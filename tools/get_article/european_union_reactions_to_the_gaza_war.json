Despite early unanimous condemnation following the October 7 attacks, the actions of the Israeli government have been increasingly criticised by EU members, with Ireland, Slovenia and Spain being most vocal about it and Germany standing close to Israel.\nBackground\nand Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez in Jerusalem, 23 November 2023]]\nAn armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023. It began when Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip. After clearing the militants from its territory, the Israeli military embarked on an extensive aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion beginning on 27 October. Clashes have also occurred in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and with Hezbollah along the Israel–Lebanon border. The fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict since 2008, it is part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War 50 years earlier.\nThe Hamas-led attack on 7 October involved a barrage of several thousand rockets directed at Israel concurrent to an estimated 3,000 militants breaching the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacking Israeli military bases and civilian communities. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals including 766 civilians and 373 security personnel were killed,}} while 253 Israelis and foreigners were taken captive to the Gaza Strip. The attack has been described as a major Israeli intelligence failure. Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, threats to the status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners. In response, Israel declared a state of war, tightened its blockade and launched one of the most severe bombing campaigns in modern history, before commencing the ground invasion on 27 October with the stated objective of destroying Hamas and controlling the Gaza Strip.\nSince the start of the Israeli operation, more than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, including over 14,000 children and 9,000 women. Several thousand more are missing and presumed trapped under rubble. Nearly all of the strip's 2.3 million population has been internally displaced. Israel's tightened blockade with cut off food, clean water, medicine, and attacks on infrastructure have led to a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, including a collapse of the healthcare system and an ongoing famine, leading to accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. By early 2024, Israeli forces had destroyed more than half of Gaza's houses, hundreds of cultural landmarks,  38-48% of tree cover and farmland and dozens of cemeteries. Israel's ground invasion started on 27 October, focusing initially on northern Gaza, including Gaza City. After the expiration of a seven-day truce which involved the release of dozens of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, Israel moved south to attack Khan Yunis on 3 December. By January 2024, Israel reoccupied most of northern Gaza. Israel's next stated objective is a major offensive in Rafah, despite objections from the international community. Israeli forces claim to have killed an estimated 9,000 Palestinian militants during the conflict while the latter killed over 250 Israeli soldiers.\nThe war has had significant international repercussions. Large protests have occurred across the world, primarily pro-Palestinian ones calling for a ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation. Israel's actions have been denounced in the Islamic world and much of the Global South. In December 2023, South Africa launched proceedings at the International Court of Justice alleging that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Israel has received significant support from its traditional Western allies, most notably the United States, which has provided Israel extensive military aid throughout the war and has vetoed multiple UN Security Council resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire.\nTimeline\nInitial reactions from member States\n* : President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said she \"unequivocally\" condemned \"the attack carried out by Hamas terrorists against Israel\", calling it \"terrorism in its most despicable form\" and saying \"Israel has the right to defend itself against such heinous attacks\".

This triggered a harsh reaction from Israeli foreign minister Eli Cohen, who subsequently accused both prime ministers of \"giving support to terrorism\" in Israel.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Serving European Union heads of state and government that have visited Israel during the war\n!State\n!Office\n!Leader\n!Date\n!References\n|-\n| European Commission\n|President\n|Ursula von der Leyen\n|13 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Romania\n|Prime Minister\n|Marcel Ciolacu\n|17 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Germany\n|Chancellor\n|Olaf Scholz\n|17 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Italy\n|Prime Minister\n|Giorgia Meloni\n|21 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Cyprus\n|President\n|Nikos Christodoulides\n|21 October 2023\n|\n|-\n|  Greece\n|Prime Minister\n|Kyriakos Mitsotakis\n|23 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Netherlands\n|Prime Minister\n|Mark Rutte\n|23 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| France\n|President\n|Emmanuel Macron\n|24 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Czech Republic\n|Prime Minister\n|Petr Fiala\n|25 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Austria\n|Chancellor\n|Karl Nehammer\n|25 October 2023\n|\n|-\n| Hungary\n|President\n|Katalin Novák\n|5 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Bulgaria\n|Prime Minister\n|Nikolai Denkov\n|6 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Latvia\n|President\n|Edgars Rinkēvičs\n|20 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Spain\n|Prime Minister\n|Pedro Sánchez\n|23 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Belgium\n|Prime Minister\n|Alexander De Croo\n|23 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Germany\n|President\n|Frank-Walter Steinmeier\n|26 November 2023\n|\n|-\n| Czech Republic\n|President\n|Petr Pavel\n|15 January 2024\n|\n|-\n| Greece\n|Prime Minister\n| Kyriakos Mitsotakis\n|30 March 2025\n|\n|}\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was criticised for supporting Israel and not calling for a ceasefire while EU’s foreign ministers condemned the attack by Hamas but also “called for the protection of civilians and restraint, the release of hostages, for allowing access to food, water and medicines to Gaza in line with international humanitarian law.” Some EU member states — Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovenia, and Denmark — called her out for what they saw as an usurpation of the European Council foreign policy prerogatives.\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has been more critical of Israel, calling the country’s siege of Gaza illegal and dismissing its evacuation order as unrealistic. As European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, he condemned the \"barbaric and terrorist attack\" by Hamas on Israel which started the Gaza war. On 10 October 2023, Borrell accused Israel of breaking international law by imposing a total blockade of the Gaza Strip. On 3 January 2024, he condemned the comments of the Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, writing, \"Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation of [international humanitarian law] & words matter.\" In March 2024, Borrell said Israel's depriving food from Palestinians was a serious violation of international humanitarian law, and described the Al-Rashid humanitarian aid incident as \"totally unacceptable carnage\".\nOn 10 April 2024, the UN's special rapporteur on Palestine Francesca Albanese said that the EU should suspend ties with Israel to prevent crimes of genocide in Gaza, supporting the initiative made by Ireland and Spain for a review of the EU-Israel agreement as she said that under the current situation, Israel has \"no incentive whatsoever to change conduct\".\nUNRWA\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is a UN agency that supports the relief and human development of Palestinian refugees, being the only UN agency dedicated to helping refugees from a specific region or conflict.\nOn 26 January 2024, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) announced it was investigating allegations, presented to it by Israel nearly two weeks before, of the involvement of a dozen of its employees in the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, with 12 UNRWA employees allegedly involved in the attacks, and spreading allegations that around ten percent of the UNRWA's 13,000 employees in the Gaza Strip have connections to Islamist militant groups. This accusation led to temporary suspension of funding to the organization by many European Union members, including Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. This funds halt was criticized by several international organizations \"considering the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip\", and led to other EU members—namely Spain, Portugal and Ireland—to increase their funding of UNRWA. Among the top ten individual European Union donors, France, Denmark, Spain, Belgium and Ireland did not halt their donations. The EU, which had suspended funding pending the outcome of the UNRWA investigations, restored and increased its funding on 1 March 2024 as so did Sweden after receiving assurances of extra checks on its spending and personnel.\nOn 29 January 2024, Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, told UN Secretary-General António Guterres that funding has not been suspended and the EU will determine funding decisions after the investigation. Borrell stated, \"We shouldn’t let allegations cloud UNRWA’s indispensable and great work.\"\nOn 1 March 2024, the EU decided not to await the outcome of the UNRWA investigation, and instead put in place a €275 million funding package, being restoration of 2024 funding of €82 million, plus €125 million of humanitarian aid for Palestinians for 2024, which UNRWA is not excluded from implementing and another €68 million through international partners like the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. At the same time, the EU reached an agreement with UNRWA on an audit to be made by EU appointed external experts.\nSpanish Foreign minister José Manuel Albares stated on 29 January 2024 that Spain \"will not change our relationship with UNRWA, although we are closely following the internal investigation and the outcome it may yield for the actions of a dozen people out of about 30,000\" because the UNRWA is an agency \"essential to alleviate the humanitarian situation\". The same day, Spanish Social Affairs minister Pablo Bustinduy called out the suspension of UNRWA funds by other western countries \"an unjustifiable collective punishment of the Palestinian people\".\nMore than a year later, in October 2025, it was revealed that Spain had threatened EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen with blocking \"other European Council decisions\" if the European Union decided to block UNRWA funding.\nFlour massacre\nOn 29 February 2024 at least 118 people were killed and 760 injured after Israeli forces opened fire on civilians seeking food from aid trucks near to the Al-Nabulsi Roundabout on the coastal Al-Rashid Street in Gaza City\nFollowing the incident, French foreign minister Stéphane Séjourné stated, \"We will demand explanations and there will need to be an independent investigation.\".\" The European External Action Service stated that many of the dead and wounded were \"hit by Israeli army fire\" and called for an independent investigation. The office of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called for an \"impartial international investigation on this tragic event\". Foreign ministers of Belgium, Germany and Italy condemned the attack, while Spanish foreign minister claimed that this \"underlines the urgency of a ceasefire\"\nWorld Central Kitchen drone strikes\nOn 1 April 2024 Israeli drones targeted a three-car convoy belonging to the World Central Kitchen (WCK) in the Gaza Strip, killing seven aid workers. The attack occurred despite the WCK having coordinated their route with the Israeli military, which both parties have acknowledged\nThe attack drew widespread international condemnation and led the World Central Kitchen to pause its operations in the Gaza Strip, along with other humanitarian and aid organizations operating there. Statements made by the Israeli ambassador in Poland on the incident led to a diplomatic spat between the two countries, as Israel's ambassador to Poland Yacov Livne, a few hours after the shelling of the WCK convoy, made several posts on social media, rejecting accusations of committing a war crime made by Deputy Speaker of the Polish Sejm Krzysztof Bosak. The ambassador wrote that the \"extreme right and left in Poland\" were accusing Israel of \"intentional murder in the attack.\" He ended his statement by saying that anti-Semites will always remain anti-Semites. The ambassador's statement sparked outrage. Polish President Andrzej Duda described it as \"not very fortunate and, in short, outrageous,\" while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he did not approve of the way the ambassador spoke about the shelling of the convoy and that he expected words of apology. The incident led to the ambassador being summoned to the Polish Foreign Ministry on 5 April 2024.\nBelgium, Ireland and Cyprus called for an immediate investigation on the incident, while Spanish Prime minister Pedro Sánchez said he was \"expecting and demanding an explanation from the Israeli government\" for the deaths of the seven aid workers. After the explanations given by the IDF and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Sánchez deemed them \"completely unacceptable and insufficient\".\nApril 2024 Iranian strikes in Israel\nOn 13 April 2024, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), a branch of the Iranian military—in coordination with the Popular Mobilization Forces of Iraq, Lebanese group Hezbollah, and the Houthis of Yemen—launched hundreds of airstrikes, codenamed Operation True Promise (), against Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, with drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The operation was in retaliation to the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus on 1 April that killed 16 people. It was Iran's first direct attack on Israel and the first direct conflict since the start of the Iran–Israel proxy conflict.\nThe attack was the biggest drone strike in history, intended to saturate anti-missile defences, and the first time since 1991 Iraqi attacks that Israel was attacked directly by the military of another state. Iran's attacks have drawn criticism from the United Nations, several world leaders, and political analysts, who warned that they risk escalating into a full-blown regional war.\nOn 13 April, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides called for an emergency meeting of the National Security Council which was held on 14 April to discuss the developments in the region. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack on Israel. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a precautionary measure enacted the \"Estia\" plan.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the Iranian attack as \"unjustifiable and highly irresponsible\", and assured that \"Germany stands by Israel\". French President Emmanuel Macron, along with other leaders, put pressure on Israel not to respond to the attack, in order to avoid escalation in the regional conflict. Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell \"strongly condemned\" Iran's attack and called it \"an unprecedented escalation and a grave threat to regional security\".\nRafah military operation\nThe Rafah offensive is an ongoing offensive in the city of Rafah, the southernmost area of the Gaza Strip, part of Israel's invasion of the strip during the Gaza war. When ceasefire talks faltered, Israel entered Rafah on 6 May 2024, taking control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing. after ordering the evacuation of Palestinians from eastern Rafah to areas in central Gaza and Khan Yunis. Later that day, Hamas accepted a ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar, but Israel did not accept the ceasefire deal and indicated that the offensive would continue before any pause. Israel conducted airstrikes on Rafah the same day, and seized the Rafah crossing.\nThis operation triggered the response of many EU leaders, mostly condemning the actions as \"alarming\" and \"concerning\". Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated, \"Reports of an Israeli military offensive on Rafah are alarming. It would have catastrophic consequences worsening the already dire humanitarian situation and the unbearable civilian toll.\" Previously on 19 February, every single member state of the European Union, with the exception of Hungary, asked the Israeli military not to take military action in Rafah.\n* : Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has warned that Israel's incursion \"would cause a further unmitigated humanitarian catastrophe and result in the death of numerous innocent civilians, again mostly children and women.\"\n* : The Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on X, said that \"Denmark shares the concern of EU and others regarding a potential Israeli military offensive in Rafah where more than half of Gaza's population is seeking refuge.\"\n* : Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné stated an Israeli assault on Rafah would be unjustified. In a phone call, Emmanuel Macron told Netanyahu that he was opposed to a military invasion of Rafah. On 16 February, Macron stated, \"I share the fears of Jordan and Egypt of a forced and massive displacement of the population\".\n* : Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stated, \"Taking action now in Rafah, the last and most overcrowded place, as announced by the Israeli defence minister, would simply not be justifiable\". On 14 February, Baerbock stated, \"If the Israeli army were to launch an offensive on Rafah... it would be a humanitarian catastrophe.\" On 17 February, Chancellor Olaf Scholz reaffirmed Germany's support for Israel's \"security\", but also warned Israeli leaders to abide by international law. On 16 March, Scholz stated, \"There is a danger that a comprehensive offensive in Rafah will result in many terrible civilian casualties, which must be strictly prohibited\".\n* : Micheál Martin stated an Israeli invasion of Rafah would entail \"grave violations of international humanitarian law\".\n* : Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stated, \"We will reiterate our opposition to military action on the ground by Israel in Rafah that could have even more catastrophic consequences for the civilians\".\n* : Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel told Israel they risked losing \"the last support they have in the world\" if they attacked Rafah.\n* : Foreign Minister, Hanke Bruins Slot, stated that Israel's planned assault on Rafah was \"unjustifiable\". Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated, \"An Israeli offensive in Rafah would cause a humanitarian disaster\".\n* : The Prime Minister Robert Golob stated, \"There is a common consensus in saying that we should do everything we can to prevent an attack on Rafah.\"\n* : The country signed a joint statement with the government of Ireland stating, \"The expanded Israeli military operation in the Rafah area poses a grave and imminent threat that the international community must urgently confront\".\nTrump plan for the Gaza Strip\nOn 4 February 2025, Trump revealed the plan during a joint press conference in the White House East Room with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The plan calls for a temporary relocation of a significant portion of the Palestinian population in Gaza to Egypt, Jordan and other countries. Countries such as Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Poland, Belgium and Germany - Israel's most staunch supporter within the European Union - voiced their opposition to any relocation or displacement of the Palestinian population. Following the announcement, Israel Defence minister Israel Katz made a controversial statement, stating that countries such as Spain, Ireland and Norway should now be \"legally obligated to allow any Gaza resident to enter their territories\" after making \"levelled accusations and false claims against Israel over its actions in Gaza\", or otherwise their hypocrisy would be exposed. José Manuel Albares, Spanish foreign minister, rejected Israel's suggestion, stating that \"the land of Palestinian Gazans is Gaza\" and that \"no third party should tell us what to do\". Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin deemed the comments made my Katz as \"provocative\" and a distraction, and that the only solution is a \"two-state solution\".\nEU sanctions against Israel\n, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs when the October 7 attacks took place, is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's actions. He was replaced in November 2024 by Kaja Kallas following the inauguration of the second Von der Leyen Commission. Kallas has been criticised for her close support to Israel.]]\nIn May 2025, Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp argued that Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip was a violation of international law and therefore of the EU–Israel Association Agreement. There were increasing calls for the full suspension of the association agreement.\nOn 15 July 2025, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas and the foreign ministers of the EU member states decided not to take any action against Israel over alleged Israeli war crimes in the Gaza war and settler violence in the West Bank. The proposed sanctions against Israel included suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement, suspending visa-free travel, or blocking imports from Israeli settlements. Israel considered the EU's decision not to impose sanctions on Israel as a diplomatic victory. Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian criticized the decision, saying, \"It’s shocking and disappointing, because everything is crystal clear. ... The whole world has been seeing what is happening in Gaza. The killing, the atrocities, the war crimes.\" Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon posted on social media: \"It is disappointing that there is no EU consensus to act on the June determination that Israel is violating Article 2 of the association agreement, concerning human rights.\" Following the EU's decision, on 1 August 2025 Slovenian prime minister Robert Golob announced that the country would impose a \"full arms embargo\" on Israel, becoming the first EU country to do so. On the same day, former European Union High Representative Josep Borrell, Kallas' predecessor, called for the European Union to stop being complicit with the \"genocide in Gaza\", and called for sanctions to be swiftly applied on Israel. Borrell has been an outspoken critic of Israel actions, defining them in multiple occasions as \"ethnic cleansing\", and the \"most dramatic situation since World War II\". He has also called out the European Union's hypocrisy, comparing the situation and actions of the international body during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, and drawing similarities to the inaction during the Srebenica genocide in Serbia.\nOn 29 July, Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs Caspar Veldkamp announced that Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir had been banned from entering the country for their calls to \"ethnic cleansing\" in the Gaza strip.\nOn 31 July, Slovenia became the first European nation to impose a full arms embargo on Israel, after its prime minister had already stated that the country would \"act independently\" if the European Union failed to take concrete actions against Israel by mid-June.\nFull-scale occupation of Gaza\nOn 4 August 2025, it was reported that prime minister Netanyahu was deciding on a full-scale occupation of the Gaza strip. Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares said that it would be a \"completely illegal move\" and recognized that Europe had done \"too little, too late\" against Israel actions, accusing Netanyahu of wanting to turn the strip into a \"massive graveyard\". On 8 August, following Israel's plan to seize Gaza city, German chancellor Friedrich Merz announced a halt in its military exports to Israel \"that could be used in Gaza\", a decision described as \"unprecedent\" due to Germany's strong support to Israel in modern times.On 10 August, the governments of Spain, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal and Slovenia, along with Norway, issued a joint statement condemning the Israeli occupation of the Gaza strip.\nOn 23 August, following the refusal of some cabinet members to secure sanctions against Israel, Dutch foreign minister and former ambassador to Israel Caspar Veldkamp resigned from his position along with other members of his party in the cabinet.

Prime minister Sánchez added that these measures were aimed at \"adding pressure on [Prime Minister] Netanyahu and his government to alleviate some of the suffering endured by the Palestinian people and also to ensure that Spanish society as a whole knows and feels that, in the face of one of the most infamous episodes of the 21st century, their country, Spain, was on the right side of history“ and lamented that the indifference and complicity of part of the international community with Netanyahu's government have prevented ”the tragedy from being stopped.\" Following the announcement of these measures, the Israeli minister of Foreign Affairs, Gideon Sa'ar, announced that Second deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz and minister of Youth Sira Rego would be prohibited from entering the country, and labeled Sánchez's government as \"corrupt\" and \"antisemitic\".

However, the poll showed that sympathy primarily for Israel dipped across the countries surveyed. On the contrary, Spain was shown to be the most pro-Palestinian country, with 27% sympathizing with that side more, compared to 19% for Israel. In the same way, Spain (59%), followed by Italy (56%), tended to see Israel's attacks on Gaza in response to the 7 October attack as unjustified, while France was evenly divided.\nYouGov repeated the polling among these seven nations in July 2024, finding a decline in public sympathy for Israel and an increase in sympathy for Palestine in all countries. The most pro-Israeli countries in July were France and Sweden, where 21% of their population identified as pro-Israel; but in Sweden a higher share said they are pro-Palestinian (25%) and in France the two sides were equal in size. Sympathy for Israel fell sharply to 19% in Germany, although the rise in the pro-Palestinian population was only modest, to 15% — the lowest percentage among the countries studied.

A plurality of Germans (44%) and Italians (36%) believed their country was taking a pro-Israeli stance, while in Belgium (30%) and Sweden (29%) their governments were seen as being neutral. Only in Belgium did a higher percentage of the population believe their country favoured Palestine (19%) than favoured Israel (16%). In all five countries, a plurality of the population said they would prefer their government take an impartial stance, this being the case especially in Germany (37%). Between 12% and 24% of the population would like their government to be more supportive of Palestine, while 4% to 9% would like to see more support for Israel.\n, Ursula von der Leyen and Friedrich Merz in the Gaza genocide, 1 September 2025]]\nIn all of these countries, between 50% and 65% of the population would approve of an arms embargo on Israel, while only 17% to 28% of the population would oppose such a measure.
