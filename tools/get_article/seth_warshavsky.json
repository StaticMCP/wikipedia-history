      "text": "# Seth Warshavsky\n\nSeth Warshavsky (1973–2024) was an American businessman and pornography entrepreneur who was the founder of the Internet Entertainment Group (IEG). During the dot-com bubble, Warshavsky's welcome of media attention made him the face of the online pornography industry to a public fascinated with what was then virtually the only segment of the dot-com industry operating at a profit. On February 10, 1998, he testified at a hearing on Internet Indecency before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.\nSeth Warshavsky died in October 2024 from unknown causes.\nBeginning in 1996, with the profits from a phone-sex operation he started while living in the Oregon building in Seattle, Washington, he had friends at AT&T who would find him sex-related numbers.\nWarshavsky converted a warehouse in Seattle into the studios of IEG's flagship website, Clublove.com. The website used computer technology that was cutting edge for its day. The business model was similar to that of a live peep show. For a monthly membership fee plus an hourly charge, customers could watch postcard-sized, low-resolution images of women strip and touch themselves in real time. For more money, they could talk to the camgirls over the phone and direct them.\nWarshavsky was featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in 1997.\nIn 1999, Warshavsky was rated number 40 on Time Magazine's list of 50 \"most important figures in technology.\"\nThe series finale of  Pam & Tommy depicted Warshavsky and IEG.\nEarly Internet pornography scandals\nWarshavsky was involved in many of the early Internet's porn-related media controversies, including:\n* In 1996, IEG was sued by Hasbro, publisher of the board game Candy Land, over the porn site candyland.com.\n* a 1997 lawsuit over the distribution of a homemade pornographic video starring Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee\n* a 1998 lawsuit over a sex video of Pamela Anderson and Bret Michaels (never aired by IEG)\n* a 1998 lawsuit by actor Kelsey Grammer over another sex video (also never aired)\n* the Our First Time hoax.\n* nude photographs of Laura Schlessinger in 1998\n* Papalvisit.com, a website with information about the 1999 visit to the U.S. by Pope John Paul II that also featured salacious stories and links to pornographic websites\n* the investment and creation, with David Marshlack, of VoyeurDorm.Com\nIEG collapse\nAt IEG's peak, Warshavsky claimed to have 100,000 subscribers and $100 million annual revenue, although subsequent events cast doubt on the veracity of this earnings claim.\nAnderson and Lee filed a $90 million copyright-infringement suit against IEG in 1998 to claim a share of the profits of the video of them.  A U.S. district court judge dismissed the case, ruling that the duo gave up their rights when they agreed to let IEG webcast the footage. Following  appeals, Anderson and Lee were awarded a $1.5 million judgment plus court costs and attorney fees in December 2002.\nReferences"
