A few examples of his appearances in literature, film, music, television and theatre are listed below.\nLiterature\nByron first appeared as a thinly disguised character in Glenarvon, by his former lover Lady Caroline Lamb, published in 1816. She described him as \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\".\nThe Spanish poet Gaspar Núñez de Arce wrote Última lamentación de Lord Byron (The last lamentation of Lord Byron), a long soliloquy on the miseries of the world, the existence of a superior, omnipotent being, politics, etc.\nMary Shelley's apocalyptic novel The Last Man acts as a roman à clef for several members of her coterie including in its cast Adrian, Earl of Windsor as a tribute to Percy Bysshe Shelley and his friend, Lord Raymond, who is a distinct portrait of Byron, noted as being \"an adventurer in the Greek wars.\"\nNovelist Benjamin Markovits produced a trilogy about the life of Byron. Imposture (2007) looked at the poet from the point of view of his friend and doctor, John Polidori. A Quiet Adjustment (2008), is an account of Byron's marriage that is more sympathetic to his wife, Annabella. Childish Loves (2011) is a reimagining of Byron's lost memoirs, dealing with questions about his childhood and sexual awakening.\nPoetry\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon, who was referred to as the female Byron, wrote (published posthumously) on Byron in her poetical illustration to The Portrait of Lord Byron, at Newstead Abbey, by Richard Westall, Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1840\nSee also  from Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839.\nLawrence Durrell wrote a poem called Byron as a lyrical soliloquy; it was first published in 1944.\nSusanna Roxman's Allegra in her 1996 collection Broken Angels (Dionysia Press, Edinburgh) is a poem about Byron's daughter by Claire Clairmont. In this text, Byron is referred to as \"Papa\".\nVampire figures\nTom Holland, in his 1995 novel The Vampyre: Being the True Pilgrimage of George Gordon, Sixth Lord Byron, describes how Lord Byron became a vampire during his first visit to Greece — a fictional transformation that explains much of his subsequent behaviour towards family and friends, and finds support in quotes from Byron poems and the diaries of John Cam Hobhouse. It is written as though Byron is retelling part of his life to his great great-great-great-granddaughter. He describes travelling in Greece, Italy, Switzerland, meeting Percy Bysshe Shelley, Shelley's death, and many other events in life around that time. Byron as vampire character returns in the 1996 sequel Supping with Panthers.\nByron is depicted as the villain/antagonist in the novel Jane Bites Back (2009)  written by Michael Thomas Ford, published by Ballantine Books. A novel based on the premise that Jane Austen and Lord Byron are vampires living in the modern day literary world.\nDan Chapman's 2010 vampire novella The Postmodern Malady of Dr. Peter Hudson begins at the time of Lord Byron's death and uses biographical information about him in the construction of its title character. It also directly quotes some of his work.\nLost manuscripts\nJohn Crowley's book ''Lord Byron's Novel: The Evening Land'' (2005) involves the rediscovery of a lost manuscript by Lord Byron, as do Frederic Prokosch's The Missolonghi Manuscript (1968), The Secret Memoir of Lord Byron  by Christopher Nicole (1979) and Robert Nye's Memoirs of Lord Byron (1989).
