The school was originally based over both of the former school sites, however the school relocated to a new campus built on the site of the former Willfield Centre in September 2013. The new school buildings were officially opened by Peter Coates, Chairman of the Stoke City Football Club, in July 2014.\nDiscovery Academy is part of the College Academies Trust, sponsored by Stoke-on-Trent College. Other schools in the trust include Excel Academy, Maple Court Academy and Stoke Studio College.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thediscoveryacademy.co.uk/ Discovery Academy official website]"
