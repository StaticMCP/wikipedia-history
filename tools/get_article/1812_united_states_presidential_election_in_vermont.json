The state legislature chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nDuring this election, Vermont cast its eight electoral votes to Democratic Republican candidate and incumbent President James Madison. For the second time in the state's history, Vermont became the only state in New England to vote for Madison, as the other four New England states cast their electoral votes for the other Democratic-Republican and Federalist supported candidate DeWitt Clinton.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Vermont\nReferences"
