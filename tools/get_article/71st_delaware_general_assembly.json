Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 1, 1861, two weeks before the beginning of the third and fourth year of the administration of Governor William Burton.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. The Senate had a Democratic majority and the House had a Republican majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Jacob Green, Kent County\nHouse of Representatives\n*John F.
