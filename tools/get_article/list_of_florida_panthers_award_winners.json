Twenty All-Star Games have been held since the Panthers entered the league in 1993, with at least one player chosen to represent the Panthers in each year except 1998 and 2011. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off. Florida has hosted one of the games. The 53rd and 67th both took place at the Amerant Bank Arena.\n* Selected by fan vote\n* All-Star Game Most Valuable Player\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Florida Panthers players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 45th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |1994\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 46th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |1996\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 47th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |1997\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 48th\n|1998\n|No Panthers selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 49th\n| 1999\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 50th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2000\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 51st\n|2001\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 53rd\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2003\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 54th\n|2004\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 55th\n|2007\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 56th\n|2008\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57th\n|2009\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 58th\n|2011\n|No Panthers selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 59th\n|2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 60th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2015\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 61st\n|rowspan=\"4\" |2016\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 62nd\n|2017\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 63rd\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 64th\n|2019\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 65th\n|2020\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 66th\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2022\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 67th\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2023\n| (Replaced Auston Matthews)\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 68th\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2024\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nThe following is a list of Florida Panthers who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Florida Panthers inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Panthers in category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2011\n|2006–2007\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2012\n|1999–2002\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2010\n|1998–1999\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2008\n|1998–1999\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2022\n|2000–2006, 2014–2019\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|2002\n|1993–1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2011\n|2005–2006\n|\n|-\n!Joe Thornton\n|Player\n|2025\n|2021–2022\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Builder\n|1995\n|1993–2001\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2023\n|2000\n|\n|}\nFoster Hewitt Memorial Award\nOne member of the Panthers organization has been honored with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award.
