Even though plans for a re-release of the album with a full version of the song \"She Did That\" and a rap remix of \"One on One Fun\" in 2014 with additional songs were announced, the idea was eventually scrapped as Love and War was never re-published. The album also received three 56th Annual Grammy Award nominations for Best Urban Contemporary album, Best R&B Performance, and Best R&B Song for \"Love and War\".\nSingles\nThe album's title track \"Love and War\" was released on December 6, 2012 as the lead single from the album.

The album almost made number one but was beaten by Ariana Grande's Yours Truly, which sold 138,000 in its first week. Love and War also debuted at number two in digital sales, selling 51,000 copies, being beaten by Yours Truly once again. However, the album sold well physically, selling 63,000 and debuted at number one in physical sales (Yours Truly only sold 30,000 physically and debuted at number seven). In its second week, the album sold 35,000 more copies. In its third week, the album sold 20,000 more copies. In its fourth week, the album sold 14,000 more copies bringing its total album sales to 183,000. The album helped Braxton set the female record for longest time between an initial chart listing and a first number one on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart during the SoundScan era (from December 1992 to 2013). The record was previously held by Angie Stone, who waited eight years and two weeks (from 1999 to 2007). The album has sold 428,000 copies in the U.S. to date.\nCritical response\n| rev2      = AllMusic\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nLove and War was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, saying \"Indeed, Love and War plays out like it's designed to contend with the likes of Ciara, Rihanna, Trey Songz, and maybe even Keyshia Cole, rather than those who came up around the same time as Braxton. Slower, more atmospheric productions like 'Stay and Fight,' 'All the Way Home,' and 'Sound of Love' suit her the best and display her considerable skill – by now, given some of the artists who have come and gone since 2000, she should have at least four albums in her past. The lighthearted numbers – like the Keri Hilson castoff-level 'Tip Toe,' the mind-numbing 'Hot Sugar,' and the Mike Will knockoff strip-club track 'She Did That' – are no match for the fully formed songs that seem rooted in Braxton's life experiences.\" Kathy Iandoli of Vibe gave the album a positive review, saying \"Love And War is at times all over the place, but that's perfectly fine. The project is beautifully crazy—exactly what we've come to know and love from Tamar Braxton. It took a dose of reality TV to bring us to Tamar's musical reality. Now everyone is tuned in.\" Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the album five out of five stars, saying \"If there's one thing that you'll take away from Tamar Braxton's triumphant Love and War, it's that this girl can sing like few can. Like all classic R&B records, it's Tamar's marvelous voice that resounds the loudest throughout—and long after it's over. It's like she's been the music industry's best kept secret for all of these years, and she's finally getting the attention she deserves. It's definitely her time.\"\nTrack listing\nUnless otherwise noted, Information is taken from Discogs.com.\n| extra1 =\n| title2 = Tip Toe\n| note2 =\n| length2 = 2:57\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 = Da Internz\n| title3 = Stay and Fight\n| note3 =\n| length3 = 4:00\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 =\n*Tamar Braxton\n}}\n| title4 = Love and War\n| note4 =\n| length4 = 4:02\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = DJ Camper\n| title5 = All the Way Home\n| note5 =\n| length5 = 4:22\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 =\n}}\n| title6 = One on One Fun\n| note6 =\n| length6 = 1:56\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 =\n| title7 = She Did That\n| note7 =\n| length7 = 1:17\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = Da Internz\n| title8 = Hot Sugar\n| note8 =\n| length8 = 3:33\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 = Kyle \"K2\" Stewart II\n| title9 = Pieces\n| note9 =\n| length9 = 3:39\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 =\n| title10 = Where It Hurts\n| note10 =\n| length10 = 3:45\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 =\n| title11 = Prettiest Girl\n| note11 =\n| length11 = 4:10\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 =\n| title12 = Sound of Love\n| note12 =\n| length12 = 4:07\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = Rico Beats\n| title13 = White Candle\n| note13 =\n| length13 = 4:16\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 =\n}}\n| title14 = Thank You Lord\n| note14 =\n| length14 = 3:20\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 =\n| total_length = 48:17\n}}\n|extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 52:26\n|title15 =  Black Tears\n| note15 =\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = D'Mile\n| length15 = 4:09\n}}\n;Notes\n* signifies a vocal producer\n* signifies a co-producer\n;Sampling credits\n*\"The One\" contains a sample from \"Juicy Fruit\", written by James Mtume, as performed by Mtume as well as a portion of the composition \"Juicy\", written by Sean Combs, James Mtume, Jean Claude Oliver, and Christopher Wallace.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK R&B Albums Chart\n|34\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|110\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|25\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|150\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n|}\nReferences"
