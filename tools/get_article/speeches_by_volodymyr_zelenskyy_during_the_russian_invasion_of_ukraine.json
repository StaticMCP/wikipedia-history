The speeches have received significant attention, with a number of commentators citing a positive effect on Ukrainian morale and on international support for Ukrainian resistance to the invasion.\nSocial media videos\nSoon after the invasion started Zelenskyy posted a video speech of him, declaring martial law.\nOn 25 February, the second day of the invasion, concerns were initially raised about his whereabouts after he missed a scheduled phone call with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Later that day, however, he posted a video of him flanked by several advisors in front of Mariinskyi Palace in central Kyiv. In the video, he gave a short speech stating that \"We are here\" and that \"We are defending our independence, our state, and we will continue to do so.\" Later that day, he posted another video of a short speech addressing the ongoing Russian assault on Kyiv, urging Kyiv residents to fight back \"any way you can.\" On 24 February, Zelensky had teleconferenced with European Union leaders.\nOn 26 February, he posted a short speech warning against disinformation that he had fled Kyiv. It has been reported that, the same day, he stated that he turned down an offer from the US to be evacuated from the city, saying that \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\" However, this story is considered by Biden administration officials to be apocryphal.\nAddresses to foreign legislatures\n, received with a standing ovation]]\n's Dáil & Seanad Éireann]]\n]]\nBeginning in March 2022, Zelenskyy made a series of virtual and in person speeches to the legislatures of other nations regarding the invasion.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date!!Parliament\n!In person\n!Online!!Notes\n|-\n| 1 March 2022|| European Parliament\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 8 March 2022|| House of Commons of the British Parliament\n|\n|\n|Thirteen days of struggle.\n|-\n| 11 March 2022|| Sejm of Poland\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 15 March 2022|| Parliament of Canada\n|\n|\n|The third Ukrainian president to give an address to the Canadian Parliament after Petro Poroshenko in 2014 and Victor Yushchenko in 2008.

He also invoked the Berlin Wall, stating that there was a new wall \"in the middle of Europe between freedom and a lack thereof. And this wall is getting taller with every bomb that falls on Ukraine.\" However, the German Parliament did not schedule time to debate the speech after its conclusion on its agenda for the day.\n|-\n| 20 March 2022|| Israeli Knesset\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 22 March 2022|| Italian parliament\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 23 March 2022|| National Diet of Japan\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|National Assembly of France\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 24 March 2022|| Swedish Riksdag\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 29 March 2022|| Danish Folketing\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 30 March 2022|| Norwegian Storting\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 31 March 2022|| House of Representatives of the Netherlands\n|\n|\n|He requested to stop trading with Russia including a boycott on Russian gas and requested for more weapons.

There were fully armed soldiers everywhere. Sandbags were visible and Ukrainian symbols were moved closer. Zelenskyy appeared, welcoming the journalists positively with handshakes. In the interview he called on the President of the United States Joe Biden to address the situation, and commented that it was yet to be seen whether talks were a waste of time. Ukraine's resistance was spoken of triumphantly and the advantage of fighting on their home ground.\nIn the backdrop of failed talks, Zelenskyy told Vice on 10 March that dialogue with Putin was the only way forward and he was positive talks would eventually work. Two days before he had said in an interview with ABC News that he would no longer seek out NATO membership, that he would consider a \"compromise\" in related to Donetsk and Luhansk, and also addressed the people of America directly.\nOn 7 April Zelenskyy, apart from commenting on the on-ground situation, told Republic TV that sanctions should work like nuclear weapons. He said that nations shouldn't pretend to support Ukraine and then at the same time maintain economic relations with the enemy. In relation to India, he answered that India finds it difficult to maintain the balance and that India's relation was with the Soviets and not Russians. Security guarantees were mentioned during the 60 minute interview.\nRussia\nOn 27 March 2022, Meduza, TV Rain and Kommersant published a video interview with Zelenskyy, along with its transcript. A few minutes before the interview was published, Roskomnadzor ordered the media to not publish it. The interviewers were Ivan Kolpakov of Meduza; Tikhon Dzyadko of TV Rain;  Mikhail Zygar; 2021 Nobel Peace Prize co-winner Dmitry Muratov of Novaya Gazeta (indirectly); and Vladimir Solovyov of Kommersant. Zelenskyy spoke in Russian.\nOn 21 April, he spoke to Mediazona.\nPublications\nIn Autumn 2022, it was announced that Zelenskyy would be publishing a book titled A Message From Ukraine, containing a collection of 16 of his wartime speeches, with proceeds going to United24. The book was published November 29, 2022 by Penguin Random House and The Guardian notes that: \"In this short and compelling collection, Zelenskiy is the first social media orator to enter the pantheon of war speakers.\"\nCharacteristics\nLanguage\nZelenskyy has used Ukrainian, Russian and English languages in his speeches and communication.\nNarratives\nMessages directed towards Ukrainians remind them of their bravery, to fight, and that he has not fled.\nIn April 2022, a nation and place branding campaign Be Brave Like Ukraine was started by the government of Ukraine and a private creative agency. Zelenskyy was at the forefront when he spoke about Ukraine and bravery on 7 April. He would go on to use this theme.\nReactions\nZelenskyy's speeches have received a generally positive response. Moira Donegan of The Guardian has stated that Zelenskyy \"has made himself into a symbol of the Ukrainian people, whose surprising courage, determination, and defiance in the face of the Russian aggression have called the west's moral bluff.\"\nJon Henley of The Guardian has stated that Zelenskyy's speeches to foreign parliaments all contained \"historical references carefully chosen to appeal to the audience\" and that his \"talent as an orator that has won him foreign acclaim.\" Anjana Susarla of Michigan State University stated that Zelenskyy's addresses have had an impact due to their authenticity, their ability to connect with social media audiences, and the urgency of the messages, saying that his videos have been \"short, between four and seven minutes, to the point, relatable and very personal.\"\nDominique Arel of the University of Ottawa has stated that Zelenskyy is \"very good at [using identification in rhetoric]. He relates the human story. He was an actor before, but he's not acting now, that's why he's so effective.\" British journalist David Patrikarakos described Zelenskyy as \"the literal man on the street,\" saying that he was sending a message that \"I'm your president, I'm not hiding, I'm not going anywhere. I am not behind the desk or wearing a suit. I am here with the risk of being killed, like everybody else.\" Timothy Naftali of New York University has stated that the speeches are \"a reminder that there is a life and death struggle going on — and it's forcing politicians to in real time to consider what are the acceptable risks.\" Olga Onuch of the University of Manchester has stated that the West was for \"the first time seeing him as an equal.\"\nZelenskyy's use of social media to deliver messages has also attracted significant attention from commentators. Patrick Wintour of The Guardian has stated that Zelenskyy \"has been constantly on the phone to western leaders, using his Twitter feed to cajole, encourage, scold and praise his allies. In the process, sanctions regarded as unthinkable a week ago have become a moral baseline.\" Karrin Vasby Anderson of Colorado State University has stated that \"Zelenskyy's approach aims to provide ordinary citizens with content they can use easily on social media to pressure their political representatives.\"\nSome commentators have argued that the reactions to Zelenskyy's speeches has tended too much towards idolisation. Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian has stated that \"there is a difference between respecting a politician and sexualising or worshipping them\" and that such reactions had the risk of trivialising the situation in Ukraine and of promoting overly simplistic narratives about the situation. Some commentators have also criticised Zelenskyy's use of comparisons to the Holocaust, particularly his use of the term \"final solution\" in his speech to the Israeli Knesset.\nSee also\n* List of speeches given by Vladimir Putin\n* Never was so much owed by so many to so few\n* We shall fight on the beaches\n* Blood, toil, tears and sweat\n* List of international presidential trips made by Volodymyr Zelenskyy\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/speeches Speeches of the President of Ukraine]\n* Without you\n* Address by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the US Congress, 21 December 2022\n* Christmas greetings of the President of Ukraine (2022)\n* New Year greetings of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy (2022)\nFurther reading\n*War Speeches I - V, lmverlag Berlin\n** War Speeches I, February–March 2022\n** War Speeches II, April 2022\n** War Speeches III, May 2022\n** War Speeches IV, June 2022\n** War Speeches V, July 2022\n;Articles and analysis\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
