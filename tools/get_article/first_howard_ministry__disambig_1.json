It was led by the country's 25th prime minister, John Howard. The first Howard ministry succeeded the second Keating ministry, which dissolved on 11 March 1996 following the federal election that took place on 2 March 1996, which saw the Coalition defeat Paul Keating's Labor Party. The ministry was replaced by the second Howard ministry on 21 October 1998 following the 1998 federal election.\nCabinet\n{| class=\"wikitable
