      "text": "# Century Tower (Tokyo)\n\nThe Century Tower is a 21-storey building located in Hongo, Bunkyo, Tokyo. The building overlooks the River Kanda, with Ochanomizu on the opposite side.\nHistory\nThe tower was commissioned by Kazuo Akao, the son of publishing tycoon Yoshio Akao, as the headquarters of the Obunsha publishing house. It cost Obunsha 1.8 billion yen to commission British architect Norman Foster to design it and the construction cost the company 23 billion yen. The structure has two main towers with a 72-metre-high atrium between them. This design nearly failed to gain authorisation from the Ministry of Health and Welfare due to Japan's stricter fire safety regulations. However, Obayashi Corporation brought Foster's pan to life by pressurising the air throughout the atrium. The building was completed in May 1991.\nDuring the Lost Decades, the original owner faced financial difficulties and sold the building. In 2007, it was purchased by its current owner, Juntendo University.\nReferences"
