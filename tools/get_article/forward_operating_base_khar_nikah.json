It combines the Pashto word \"nikah\" (marriage) with the word \"khar\" which can mean \"donkey\" and is used as an insult, suggesting a forced or undesirable marriage.\nSource: Google\nUnits\nFOB Keenan (2007-2010)\n* OP H 6 (April – October 2007)\n** B Company, 1st Battalion, The Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot) (Renamed 2nd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment) built the base.\n* OP H 7 (October 2007 - April 2008)\n** No. 10 Platoon, No. 3 Company, 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards.\n** Signals Platoon\n*** Support from Sniper Section, 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards during December.\n* OP H 8 (April 2008 - October 2008)\n** 5Scots (Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders) 2Scots Royal highland fusiliers) attached to 1st Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment) supported by - Imjin Company (2 R IRISH Territorial unit)\nFOB Khar Nikah\n* OP H12 (May - Oct 2010)\n** Gurkha Company, 1st Battalion, Mercian Regiment (Cheshire)\n* OP H 13 (October 2010 - April 2011)\n**No. 2 Company, 1st Battalion, Irish Guards\n* OP H 14 (May - Oct 2011)\n**C Company, 3rd Battalion, Mercian Regiment (formerly 'The Staffords')\n* OP H 15 (Oct 2011 - May 2012)\n**The Royal Gurkha Rifles\n* ISAF 11 (May - June 2011)\n** DK National Guard, Force Protection Platoon (-) and a DK CIMIC unit\n*ANA, ANP and ALP\n**ANA, 2nd Kandak (and specifically its 3rd Company)\n**ANP/police elements and local trained ALP\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* }}\nKhar Nikah in the media\n[https://www.gettyimages.dk/search/2/image?phrase=khar+nikah/ Getty Images from Khar Nikah]"
