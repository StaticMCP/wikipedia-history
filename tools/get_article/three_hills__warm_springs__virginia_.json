It was built in 1913, and is a -story, frame and stucco Italian Renaissance style dwelling. It consists of a central block with flanking two-story wings and rear additions. The house has a Colonial Revival style interior. The front facade features a single-story, flat-roofed portico. Also on the property are the contributing small formal boxwood garden, three frame and stucco, one-story cottages, and a stone and brick freestanding chimney.  Three Hills was built by American novelist and women's rights advocate Mary Johnston (1870-1936), who lived and operated an inn there until her death. J. Ambler Johnston, a young architect, distant relative of the writer and one of the founding partners of the Carneal and Johnston architectural firm (recently merged with Ballou Justice Upton), designed the house.\nAnother home of Johnston's listed on the National Register of Historic Places is Linden Row in Richmond.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.\nReferences\nAdditional Reading\n\"Three Hills: The Home of Mary Johnston.\" Virginia Suffrage News, November 1, 1914. https://virginiachronicle.com/?a=d&d=VSN19141101&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------"
