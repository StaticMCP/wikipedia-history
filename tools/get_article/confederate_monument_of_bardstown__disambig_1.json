Some 17 of the soldiers are still unknown.\nHistory\nMost of the soldiers were under the command of Major General Braxton Bragg who died in 1862 in conflicts around Bardstown.\nThe monument was dedicated by the J. Crepps Wickliffe Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The base is made of limestone, and the statue of the Confederate soldier was made of zinc. A relief portrait of General Robert E. Lee is located directly beneath the statue.\nThe inscription reads:\nTHIS MONUMENT\nIS ERECTED\nTO THE MEMORY OF\nTHE 67 BRAVE MEN\nBURIED HERE, WHO\nLOST THEIR LIVES IN\nTHE SERVICE OF THE\nCONFEDERATE\nGOVERNMENT.\n___________\n\"LORD GOD OF HOSTS BE\nWITH US YET,\nLEST WE FORGET,\nLEST WE FORGET.\"\nMARBLE TELLS NOT OF THEIR VALORS' WORTH,\nNAMELESS THEY REST IN THE QUIET EARTH.\nWE CARE NOT WHENCE THEY CAME,\nDEAR IN THEIR LIFELESS CLAY;\nWHETHER UNKNOWN OR KNOWN TO FAME,\nTHEIR CAUSE AND COUNTRY STILL THE SAME,\nTHEY DIED AND WORE THE GRAY.\nIt was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1997, one of sixty monuments to the American Civil War in Kentucky so honored on the same day.
