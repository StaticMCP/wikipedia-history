Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nKentucky cast four electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent Vice President Thomas Jefferson over the Federalist candidate and incumbent President John Adams. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Jefferson's running mate Aaron Burr from New York. The state was divided into two electoral districts with two electors each, whereupon each district's voters chose the electors. The only true popular vote figures still extant today are those of Franklin County.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1800 United States presidential election in Kentucky\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| Thomas Jefferson\n| align=\"right\" | 75\n| align=\"right\" | 63.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Federalist\n| John Adams (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 44\n| align=\"right\" | 37.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 119\n| align=\"right\" | 100.00%\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Kentucky\nReferences"
