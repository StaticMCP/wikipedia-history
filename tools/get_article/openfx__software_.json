He made the decision to release the source code to the public in the middle of 1999 and released a stable version a year and a half later. The product, formerly named SoftF/X, was renamed to OpenFX.\nThe OpenFX featureset includes a full renderer and raytracing engine, NURBS support, kinematics-based animation, morphing, and an extensive plugin API. Plugin capabilities include image post processor effects such as lens flare, fog and depth of field. Animation effects such as explosions, waves and dissolves add to the flexibility of the program. Version 2.0 also features support for modern graphics cards with hardware GPU acceleration.\nOpenFX supports the Win32 platform, including Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7 and 8. It can run under Unix-based platforms by using the Wine compatibility layer.\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Version\n!Release date\n!Changes\n|-\n|Beta||January 15, 2001||First Public Beta\n|-\n|1.0||February 9, 2001||Initial Release\n|-\n|1.1||July 22, 2004||Stereo hardware supportStand Alone Model Viewer (OFXVIEW.EXE)A Stereo Movie Viewer (GGPLAY.EXE)A fullscreen .flc and .avi player (DDPLAY.EXE)\n|-\n|1.5||September 22, 2005||Better Wave Simulation PluginCubic Environment SupportRemoved vertex capBug fixes\n|-\n|1.7||November 3, 2006||Fixed anti-aliasing problems\n|-\n|2.0||September 15, 2007||Hardware rendering support\n|-\n|2.1||October 4, 2010||New features in the designer module and a revised more efficient ray-tracer module\n|-\n|2.2||June 4, 2012||New Bones and Weights systems for character animation and an improved mapping coordinate painting system.
