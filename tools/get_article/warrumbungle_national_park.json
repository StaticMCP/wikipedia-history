The national park is located approximately  northwest of Sydney and contained within . The park attracts approximately  visitors per annum.\nThe national park is based on the geographical Warrumbungle Mountain Range, sometimes shortened to the Warrumbungles, and thus the park name is often heard in the plural. The park lies within the Pilliga Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance for a range of woodland bird species, many of which are threatened.\nWarrumbungle National Park was added to the Australian National Heritage List in December 2006.\nOn 4 July 2016, the park was the first within Australia to be certified as a Dark Sky Park by the International Dark Sky Association.\nAccess\nThe nearest towns to the park are Baradine, Coonabarabran, Coonamble, Gilgandra, Gulargambone, and Tooraweenah. Access via Coonabarabran to the east is by  of sealed road called the John Renshaw Parkway, built in 1966. Via Coonamble to the west, access is by a  long road with some gravel.\nThe park is contained within three local government areas: Warrumbungle Shire to the east, Gilgandra Shire to the south and Coonamble Shire to the west.\nFeatures\nBelougery Spire\nLocated within the large area of temperate savanna grasslands the park incorporates the most spectacular part of the Warrumbungle mountains, a region of past volcanic activity with unusual lava formations. Some of the most well-known rock formations include Belougery Spire, Bluff Mountain, Mount Exmouth (tallest mountain in the park), The Breadknife, Split Rock, Fans Horizon and Crater Bluff.\nThere are many scenic bushwalks and both rock climbing and abseiling are popular. Though the park preserved habitat for koalas in the past, a massive 2013 fire decimated the koala population; none are thought to have survived.\nLocated immediately adjacent to the national park is the Siding Spring Observatory. The observatory, officially opened in 1965, was constructed on the boundary of the park partly because the park provided a light-free environment. This scientific facility consists of several internationally important telescopes and has considerable socio-economic importance to the local Coonabarabran community.\nFacilities\nThere are four vehicle-based campsites and multiple walk-in campsites. All camping in the park is only permitted after obtaining a permit.  There is a visitors’ centre for bookings and arranging access to hut and gated camping.  The park also caters for large groups, eg school, club.  There are free electric barbecues available however firewood is not supplied or to be collected within park grounds.\nHistory\nA proposal to reserve the more scenic parts of the Warrumbungle Range as the Warrumbungle National Monument was first initiated by the National Parks and Primitive Areas Council in 1936. The area was first proclaimed as a reserve in 1953. In 1967 management of the park was signed over to the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service. The construction of a network of walking tracks done by hand was headed by the parks first ranger, Carl Dow. The park was added to the list of the National Heritage in December 2006, in recognition of the park's importance as an extensive and spectacular geomorphological site with bold volcanic landforms that are unrivalled anywhere else in Australia; for its unique values as a transition zone between the arid western and wetter coastal zones; and its significance as an important refugium in inland south-east Australia.\n2013 bushfire\nIn January 2013 about 80% of the national park was destroyed in a conflagration (thought to have been started by lightning) that burned much of the area surrounding the park as well as destroying dozens of homes. The visitor centre and museum were wiped out, as well as railings and viewing platforms throughout the park.  The park was closed after the fire, but has since reopened after extensive remediation works.\nIn popular culture\nThe national park was used as a filming location for the video for singer David Bowie's 1983 single \"Let's Dance\", centring on The Breadknife.\nThe Japanese anime \"Adventures of the Little Koala\" takes place within the shadow of The Breadknife.\nSee also\n* Protected areas of New South Wales\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkManagement.aspx?id=N0035 Warrumbungle National Park: Park management] at the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage.\n*[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/parkFireClosure.aspx?id=N0035 NSW Parks and Wildlife Service] Closure notice"
