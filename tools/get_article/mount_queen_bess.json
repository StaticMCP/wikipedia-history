It stands west of Chilko Lake and to the south of Tatlayoko Lake, and crowns a peak-studded ridge to the north of the Homathko Icefield.\nThe mountain is named for Queen Elizabeth I of England.  Relatively nearby is Mount Raleigh, named for Sir Walter Raleigh.  Other peaks in the vicinity of Queen Bess bear similar Elizabethan-related names: Pembroke, Silver Swan, Oriana, Armada, Grenville, Burghley, Howard, Walsingham, Cambridge, Cloister, Saint John, Galleon, and Monmouth.  Between Queen Bess and Chilko Lake is Mount Good Hope, and northwest across the Homathko is the Waddington Range, site of the highest peak in the Coast Mountains, and the highest entirely within British Columbia, Mount Waddington.\nSee also\n* Mountain peaks of Canada\n* Mountain peaks of North America\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=834 \"Mount Queen Bess, British Columbia\" on Peakbagger]\n* Mount Queen Bess (photo): [https://www.flickr.com/photos/druclimb/301091859/in/album-72157594354955282/ Flickr]"
