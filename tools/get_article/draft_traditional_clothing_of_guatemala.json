Furthermore, different from other clothes in the country (país), it's thick due to the cold weather in Quetzaltenango. Because it's a department in the west.\nSacred Symbols\nLike other traditional clothing (trajes típicos), Quetzaltenango has certain sacred symbols, that have significance and a history in the huipil (blouse), that cannot be altered, whether it's the shape or the color in the past, they were ruled by the priests of the city or the town.\nCulture Quetzalteca\nIt's important to note that it's one of the most representative of the country, and that every one of the municipalities of Quetzaltenango has one of its own, but the most representative is that of “Xelaju”. It is composed of three traditional mayan (mayas) colors, that signify: Red (Rojo): blood (Sangre) shed in wars, blood of the ancestors Yellow (Amarillo): Corn (Maíz), the color of life, ray of the sun Purple (Morado): Suffering, pain. The blouse (huipil) is decorated with flowers, stars, and various descendants of birds. The corte (skirt) is attached to the huipil by a thin sash of natural threads (Faja).\nClothes of Mourning\nOn some occasions, especially with respect for the family of the deceased, clothing is worn that is the color purple and black, which signify mourning, darkness, death, or, only a shawl of these colors and white is worn. Unfortunately, the clothes of men fell out of use, so a white shirt is used, with white pants, which are held up by a red belt, and, sometimes a satchel is worn, or, a handkerchief around the neck, or under the hat.\nQuiché\nQuiché is a department that is north-west of Guatemala City. They are known for their traditional clothing because they are the most colorful and visually appealing. Most traditional clothing is made in quiche, partly due to its big population, but also due to its design and craftsmanship.\nK’iche’ Maya\nQuiche has the most indigenous Mayan population in Guatemala, therefore many traditions are the same or fairly similar to the ancient Mayans. Before marriage, a couple must go through a one year engagement in which the couples must visit the parents' homes to get to know each other. Once the year is over, the couple goes through three wedding ceremonies, one for each part of their culture. A wedding ceremony for the certification by the state A traditional catholic wedding ceremony A c'ulnem where the couple is married by a Maya shaman (c’ulel)\nWedding Attire\nThe traditional wedding attire for both men and women has not changed much over the centuries in K’iche Mayan society. Both wedding garments are embroidered mainly with red accents as well as green, blue, yellow, and purple. Their embroidery style is up to the bride, she can decide what story to tell through the symbols in the clothes. Both the bride and the groom traditionally wear headpieces that match the colors of their embroidery. The bride’s Huipil is poncho shaped, the top is covered in embroidery and the bottom of the blouse is a plain white cotton and wool blend. The bride's corte and the groom's pants also have embroidery that is up to the bride. The groom's jacket has embroidered symbolism stitched in to match the bride.\nTraditional clothing of Quiche\nThe traditional clothing of Quiche is one of the most colorful and detailed in Guatemala, both its blouse and skirt is made with a white base, detailed with red, blue, yellow, green and other colored embroidery. It is also made with lots of flowers and Quetzals. Their belt is most famous for having cups sewn around it. Traditionally, the clothing is worn with a headpiece (tocoyal) with lots of tassels, and is typically braided into the hair.\nGuatemala City\nGuatemala City is where many tourists come to visit. It has been modernized and not many people are seen wearing traje tipicothere compared to other parts of the country. Guatemala City does not have their own style of traditional clothing, it is mostly inspired by the clothing from Quiche, Quetzaltenango, and Petén. You will often see the faja (belt) with the traditional cup embroidery from Quiche.\nTraditional clothing of Guatemala City\nIn the city many of the clothes come in a set. Unlike other regions where skirt has black undertones to be matched with many different blouses, the blouse and the skirt often have the same color scheme. Women wear a headdress to decorate their hair, a huipil decorated with embroidery, and a skirt with two or three colors. A faja is worn at the waist to cinch the skirt and keep the blouse in place."
