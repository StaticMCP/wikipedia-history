In 1998, he joined Northampton Saints Rugby Academy, and in the next ten years appeared for the club as a scrum-half and occasionally on the wing. In 2008, he moved to France and played for Aviron Bayonnais. In 2009, he moved again to Pays d'Aix RC and, in 2010, to AS Béziers Hérault, for whom he played until his retirement from professional rugby in 2013. He was in the squad that won promotion to Pro D2 in 2010.\nPost-rugby\nAfter retiring from professional sport, Howard opened a restaurant (La Charnière) in Béziers with another player, Charly Malié. The restaurant displays items and memorabilia associated with rugby union, including Andrew Mehrtens' boots. He plays amateur rugby union for Valras.\nReferences"
