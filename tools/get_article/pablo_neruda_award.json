When announcing it, the Pablo Neruda Foundation stipulated that it would be granted annually to a Chilean writer, less than 40 years old, initially endowed with $3,000. This was later increased to $6,000.\nAt first, the award was given to an author for works including poetry, creative prose, and theater. Later the award changed to its current format, as it would be granted only to poets and, according to the Foundation's website, \"in practice, was never granted to authors of other genres.\"\nIn 2006 the Neruda Foundation published an anthology with the winners, which ranged from Gonzalo Millán, the first in 1987, to , who received it in 2005.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=30|Year || width=200| Winner || Photo\n|-\n| 1987 || Gonzalo Millán\n||\n|-\n| 1988 || Raúl Zurita ||\n|-\n| 1989 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1990 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1991 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1992 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1993 || Erick Pohlhammer ||\n|-\n| 1994 || Alicia Salinas ||\n|-\n| 1995 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1996 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1997 || Isabel Gómez Muñoz ||\n|-\n| 1999 || Bernardo Chandía ||\n|-\n| 2000 || Rosabetty Muñoz ||\n|-\n| 2001 || Andrés Morales ||\n|-\n| 2002 || Armando Roa Vial ||\n|-\n| 2003 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2004 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2005 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2006 || Malú Urriola ||\n|-\n| 2007 || Javier Bello ||\n|-\n| 2008 || Rafael Rubio ||\n|-\n| 2009 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2010 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2011 || Julio Espinosa Guerra ||\n|-\n| 2012 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2013 ||  ||\n|-\n| 2014 || Andrés Anwandter ||\n|-\n| 2015 || Paula Ilabaca Núñez ||\n|-\n| 2016 || Gloria Dünkler ||\n|-\n| 2017 || Marcelo Guajardo Thomas ||\n|-\n| 2018 || Ernesto González Barnert || ||\n|-\n|2019||Gladys González ||  ||\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
