On the advice of Father Antonio, she approaches sheriff Jim Harden for help, but recognizes him as one of the murderers. She assumes the alias of Lola Belmont and teams with Joaquin Murietta, who uses the name Carlos del Rio.\nAttorney Dan Hinsdale informs Zara that he has purchased her family's rancho at a reduced fee because of back taxes owed by Zara's parents. Father Antonio warns Zara that her outlaw gang is wanted by the authorities. Upon learning this, Zara and Joaquin secretly work to regain stolen gold and land rights on the behalf of other neighboring rancheros.\nCast\n* Barbara Britton as Zara Montalvo/Lola Belmont\n* Willard Parker as Dan Hinsdale\n* Phillip Reed as Joaquin Murietta/Carlos del Rio\n* Barton MacLane as Jim Harden\n* Martin Garralaga as Father Antonio\n* Victor Kilian as Jose Montalvo\n* Thurston Hall as Governor\n* Angelo Rossitto as Nino\n* Anna Demetrio as Maria\n* Paul Marion as Manuel\n* Mikel Conrad as Captain Gray\n* Margia Dean as Carol Grayson\n* Minna Phillips as Mrs. Grayson\n* John Merton as Hank\nProduction\nBandit Queen was produced by Lippert Pictures and shot in the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park as well as in the San Fernando Valley.\nProduction took place from mid-September to early October 1950.\nMartha Vickers was initially slated to play the lead female role but was forced to withdraw because she had recently given birth and her doctor feared the effects of acting in a rugged Western on her 98-pound body.
