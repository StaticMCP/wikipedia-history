Every year since then the award has been given to  the living person considered to have made the greatest contribution to medical science or who has demonstrated public service on behalf of medicine. They are administered by the Lasker Foundation. The Lasker is sometimes referred to as \"America's Nobels\".\nThe Lasker Awards have gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize. Eighty-six Lasker laureates have received the Nobel Prize, including 32 in the last two decades.[http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2008special.htm The Lasker Foundation – 2008 Special Achievement Award] Claire Pomeroy is the current president of the Lasker Foundation.\nAward\nThe award is given in four branches of medical science:\n# Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award\n# Lasker–DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award\n# Lasker–Bloomberg Public Service Award (Renamed in 2011 from Mary Woodard Lasker Public Service Award. Renamed in 2000 from Albert Lasker Public Service Award.)\n# Lasker–Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science (1994– renamed to that name in 2008) (optional)\nThe awards carry an honorarium of $250,000 for each category.\nA collection of papers from the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation were donated to the National Library of Medicine by Mrs. Albert D. Lasker in April 1985.\nIn addition to the main awards, there are historical awards that are no longer awarded.\nRecent awards\nRecent winners include the following:\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:40px\" | Year\n! style=\"width:95px\" | Award\n! style=\"width:140px\" | Laureate(s)\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Reason\n|-\n|rowspan=6|2025\n|rowspan=2|Basic\n|Dirk Görlich\n|rowspan=2|For discoveries that exposed the structures and functions of low-complexity domains within protein sequences, revealing new principles of intracellular transport and cellular organization.\n|-\n|Steven L.
