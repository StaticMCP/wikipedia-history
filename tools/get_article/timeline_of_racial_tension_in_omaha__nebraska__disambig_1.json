These included racial violence, but also include many firsts as the black community built its institutions. Omaha has been a major industrial city on the edge of what was a rural, agricultural state. It has attracted a more diverse population than the rest of the state. Its issues were common to other major industrial cities of the early 20th century, as it was a destination for 19th and 20th century European immigrants, and internal white and black migrants from the South in the Great Migration. Many early 20th-century conflicts arose out of labor struggles, postwar social tensions and economic problems, and hiring of later immigrants and black migrants as strikebreakers in the meatpacking and stockyard industries. Massive job losses starting in the 1960s with the restructuring of the railroad, stockyards and meatpacking industries contributed to economic and social problems for workers in the city.\n19th century\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"6\"|Events reflecting racial tension in 19th century Omaha (in chronological order)\n|-\n!

Date\n! Issue\n!

There was a background of resentment against blacks among the ethnic and immigrant white working class in South Omaha because blacks were hired as strikebreakers. The reformist mayor Edward Parsons Smith tried to calm the crowd, for which they also attempted to lynch him. He was only saved by a last minute rescue. The sheriff and police could not control the mob, which numbered in the thousands. No perpetrators were brought to trial. US Army troops were stationed in South Omaha to prevent another mob from forming among white immigrants and ethnic Americans, and in North Omaha to protect the black community. This large riot shortly followed those of Red Summer, when post-war tensions led to ethnic white attacks against blacks in race riots in numerous cities across the country, increasing fears and tensions in Omaha as well.\n|-\n| 1920s\n| Racial segregation\n| Racial segregation becomes normalized as redlining and restrictive covenants keep African Americans in North Omaha.

Analyzing race relations in Omaha during the period they commented, \"1968 rivals 1919 as probably the worst year in the history of twentieth-century America from the standpoint of violence and internal tension.\" In 1969 three days of rioting swept the Near North Side, and in 1970 a policeman was killed by a suitcase bomb while answering a disturbance call at a house in North Omaha. However, as the 1966 Oscar-nominated documentary A Time for Burning and the 1970s books of Lois Mark Stalvey illustrated, the violence apparently served a purpose as lines of communication were opened between the \"West Omaha matron and the black laborer.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"6\"|Events reflecting racial tension in Omaha from 1950 to 2000 (in chronological order)\n|-\n!
