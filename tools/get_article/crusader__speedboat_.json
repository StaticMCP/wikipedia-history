A rocket-powered scale model was tested at Haslar. The full size design was by Peter du Cane and built by Vospers of Portsmouth. Technical assistance came from Saunders-Roe and Vickers-Supermarine. It cost £15,000 in 1949.\nIt was silver and scarlet in colour and 10 m long.\nThe engine was a de Havilland Ghost Mk 48 centrifugal turbojet provided as a loan by the Ministry of Supply at the request of Major Frank Halford, the engine designer. The engine was rated at 5,000&nbsp;lb thrust fed by two scoop inlets forward of the cockpit.\nThe hull was of trimaran form, a main hull with a planing step, and two smaller rear-mounted outriggers. Construction was of birch plywood frames and stringers. The hull was skinned in birch ply covered in doped fabric with metal skin reinforcement for planing surfaces. Aircraft-style riveted aluminium was used for the box-section cantilevers to the outriggers.\nExpectation was that the boat could achieve more than 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h).\nThe boat was destroyed and Cobb killed on 29 September 1952 when on a world record attempt at Loch Ness, Scotland.\nFifty years later on 5 July 2002 the wreckage of Crusader was discovered by the Loch Ness Project in  of water. The site was designated as a scheduled monument in 2005.\nSee also\n*Water speed record\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n* , reprinted from\n*  Endpapers include a sectional drawing of Crusader\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.britishpathe.com/video/jet-news-john-cobbs-crusader-jet-speed-boat British Pathe Newsreel : John Cobb's Crusader]"
