After Chinese troops counterattacked, Ungern's soldiers retreated. Ungern then launched another attack with support of a Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which came from the northeast and northwest while Ungern's troops moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers. The capital was finally captured on 4 February. Russian settlers who supported the Red Army moved from Urga together with Chinese soldiers who were retreating. During the Battle of Urga, the Chinese suffered 1,500 casualties while Ungern's forces suffered only around 60 casualties. After the capture of Urga, Ungern's troops started killing Russian Jews. Ungern personally ordered Jews to be killed. This pogrom effectively eliminated the Jewish community in Urga.\nCapture of Choir and Zamyn-Üüd\nBetween 11 and 13 March, Ungern and his soldiers captured the Chinese base at Choir. Ungern's army had 900 troops while Chinese defenders had about 1,500. After Ungern successfully captured Choir, he returned to Urga. His detachments moved southward to Zamyn-Üüd, a frontier settlement that had another Chinese base. The defending Chinese soldiers abandoned Zamyn-Üüd without a fight.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n**\n*"
