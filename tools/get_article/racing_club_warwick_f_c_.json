During this period the club won a number of honours, including the Birmingham Alliance Senior Cup when they defeated Birmingham City in the final at St. Andrews. In 1967 the club joined the West Midlands (Regional) League.  Three years later they changed to their current name (which came from the fact that their ground is by Warwick Racecourse) and soon afterwards switched to the Midland Football Combination, where they were champions in 1988 and runners-up in 1989.  After the latter honour they gained promotion to the Southern League where they remained until 2003 when they finished bottom of the Western Division and dropped into the Midland Football Alliance. They remained in the Midland Football Alliance until the end of the 2008–09 season, when they were relegated to the Midland Football Combination Premier Division, now the Midland Football League Division One.  At the start of the 2016–17 season the club began huge infrastructure renovations following the arrival of local businessman Chairman Gary Vella and the new committee members the previous year, including new changing rooms, floodlighting, stands and artificial training area. The club's record win is 15–0 recorded on 26 December 2016.  They gained their first promotion for 30 years in 2018-19 as runners-up in the Midland Football League Division One.  The club installed a 3g pitch in the winter of 2020 in order to expand their community activity and provide a broad spectrum of football to include women's and disability amongst other community groups. The West Midlands Ambulance Service will play their home fixtures at the ground.\nRacing Club Warwick made it to the final of the 2023-24 Birmingham Senior Cup before losing 9-0 against Aston Villa U21.\nYouth set-up and football academy\nAs of the 2024–25 season the club has a youth team in the Midland Floodlight Youth League, teams from U-7 to U-16 and an academy nursery section, Mini Racers, for children aged 4 to 7.
