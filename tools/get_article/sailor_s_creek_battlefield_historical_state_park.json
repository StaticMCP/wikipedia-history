It includes a portion of the landmarked Sayler's Creek Battlefield, an area of  that was the site of the April 6, 1865 Battle of Sayler's Creek, one of the last major engagements in the Eastern Theater of the war involving Confederate General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee (1807–1870). The battle occurred during his week-long retreat to the southwest in the final Appomattox campaign from the fallen Confederate capital at  Richmond and nearby Petersburg, three days before his surrender at Appomattox Court House to Union Army General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885), which effectively ended the American Civil War (1861–1865).\nBesides the historical Hillsman House, a visitors center including exhibits with artifacts and memorabilia, park ranger talks and lectures, walking trails, and interpretive plaques, the park also offers such amenities as picnic tables and barbecue grills available for use.[http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/sailors-creek.shtml Sailor's Creek State Park]\nThe Hillsman House on the site was used as a field hospital during and after the battle, and is open to visitors in the summer and by request.  The park also occasionally hosts \"living history\" events with Civil War soldier and civilian reenactors.\nThe park name appears to be a misspelling of “Sayler,” a farmer after whose land and the stream for which the Battle of Sayler's Creek was afterwards later named in 1865.  Some official records such as those of the National Historic Landmark program refer to this park as being named the Sayler's Creek Battlefield State Park.\nGallery\nFile:147th Anniversary event at Sailors Creek (cj) (8278347623) (2).jpg|A park ranger speaks to reenactors at the park, 2012\nFile:Hillsman Farm House (9316537293) (2).jpg|Displays in the Overton-Hillsman House\nFile:SC-Visitor Center Exhibits (6145857318).jpg|Exhibits at the visitor center\nFile:Sailors Creek Battlefield Gift Shop (7415213520).jpg|Items for sale in the gift shop\nFile:SC Sailors Creek Bottom Lands (5224079503).jpg|Lands along the Confederate Overlook Trail\nSee also\n* List of Virginia state parks\n* List of Virginia state forests\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/sailors-creek.shtml Sailor's Creek Battlefield State Park web page]\n*[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=10274 Overton-Hillsman House - Wayside Marker]"
