The congregation is a member of the Movement for Reform Judaism and was formed in 2017 as a result of the merger between the Edgware and District Reform Synagogue and the Hendon Reform Synagogue communities. The merged community is located on the site of the former Edgware and District Reform Synagogue.\nIn 2019 Mark Goldsmith became senior rabbi.\nHistory\nEdgware and District Reform Synagogue\nEdgware and District Reform Synagogue originated as \"Edgware and District Progressive Jewish Fellowship\" and in February 1935 became \"Edgware and District Reform Synagogue\".\nIn late 1934, a temporary committee was formed to discuss the establishment of a new Reform congregation in London and in on 12 February 1935 it was formally decided to form a synagogue to be called \"Edgware and District Reform Synagogue\".\nHendon Reform Synagogue\nHendon Reform Synagogue was founded in 1949 and its first building, in 1955, was at 1 Danescroft Avenue, Hendon.  1 Danescroft Avenue\nThe congregation of Hendon Reform Synagogue began to meet in 1949, though meetings were held in the homes of the founder members until the first synagogue, now the Kingsley Fisher Hall [named after founders Sidney Kingsley and Ben Fisher], was built several years later.  Services were held in the Methodist Meeting Hall in the Burroughs and as the congregation grew, in other local halls whilst they dreamt of having their own building. In 1950 a disused tennis club became available and was purchased for the sum of £2,600 with funds raised from donations and social events, and at last HRS had a plot on which to place a building.  Work was completed in 1955 and a consecration service for the new synagogue building was held on 6 March by the late Rabbi Dr Arthur Katz who had been Minister from the \"dream's\" beginning.\nThe congregation soon outgrew the original building and so after a further programme for fundraising, construction of the annexe which became the synagogue began in 1965. Two inspiring walls of stained glass windows were commissioned and then offered to congregants to donate in memory of their late loved ones. These magnificent windows depicting both Judaica and biblical scenes together with the marble walls surrounding the handmade ark provides the warm and serene backdrop of the synagogue. A consecration service, attended by 500 people, took place on 14 January 1968.\nUp until its merger, the congregation's senior rabbi was Steven Katz, who succeeded his father, Arthur Katz. The synagogue building was closed after its 2017 merger.\nThe merger\nIn 2016, after a series of meetings in both HRS and EDRS, members overwhelmingly voted to merge. A new entity, Edgware & Hendon Reform Synagogue, was formed on EDRS's former ground, and the inaugural service on Saturday (Shabbat) 15 July 2017 was  attended by a huge congregation and also by civic leaders of the local community. The new community is named Edgware & Hendon Reform Synagogue in English and LeDor Vador in Hebrew (the latter also being the name of its monthly magazine).\nNotable members\n* Sam Little, a professional golfer\nSee also\n}}\n* History of the Jews in England\n* List of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom\n* List of synagogues in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
