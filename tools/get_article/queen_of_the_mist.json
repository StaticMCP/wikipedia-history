Needing money, she decides to become the first woman to go over Niagara Falls, and designs her own barrel. She is helped by her manager, Frank Russell. \"Navigating both the treacherous Falls and a fickle public with a ravenous appetite for sensationalism, this unconventional heroine vies for her legacy in a world clamoring with swindling managers, assassins, revolutionaries, moralizing family, anarchists, and activists. Convinced that there is greatness in her and determined not to live as ordinary, she sets out to battle her fear and tempt her fate.\" The score incorporates turn-of-the-century themes. Anna attempts to take advantage of her fame on the lecture circuit, but that does not last. Anna dies in a nursing home at age 82, a pauper.\nMusical numbers\n;Act 1\n* Opening—Company\n* There Is Greatness In Me—Anna Edson Taylor\n* A Letter to Jane/The Tiger—Anna, Jane\n* Charity—Panhandlers, Anna\n* Glorious Devil/The Waters—Barker, Company, Anna\n* The Barrel/Cradle or Coffin—Anna\n* Types Like You—Mr. Russell, Anna\n* Do the Pan! -- Company, Anna, Mr. Russell\n* Floating Cloud/Cradle or Coffin Reprise—Rivermen, Anna\n* Laugh at the Tiger—Anna\n* On the Other Side—Mr. Russell\n* Act One Finale—Mr. Russell, Company, Anna\n;Act 2\n* The Quintessential Hero—Anna, Company\n* Million Dolla’ Momma—Mr. Russell\n* Expectations—Mr. Russell\n* Bookings (Part One) -- New Manager, Company, Anna\n* Break Down the Door—Carrie Nation, Company\n* The Green—Anna\n* Bookings (Part Two) -- Anna, New Manager\n* Postcards—Company\n* The Fall (Act Two Finale) -- Anna, Company\nReception\nBen Brantley of The New York Times said the show \"moves forward with a steady, fixed intensity that makes it feel as if it never moves forward at all\". Steven Suskin of Variety said LaChuisa \"developed a reputation for shows that are more esoteric than involving\", but that Queen \"breaks the pattern\", and also noted that the score was \"intelligent\" and \"tuneful\". Aubry D'Arminio writing for Entertainment Weekly referred to the show as \"beautifully odd\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
