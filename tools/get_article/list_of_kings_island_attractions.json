      "text": "# List of Kings Island attractions\n\nKings Island is a  amusement park located in Mason, Ohio. The park is known for releasing record-breaking and first-of-a-kind rides over the years, such as Flight of Fear, the world's first launched roller coaster using a linear induction motor, and The Beast which opened as the world's tallest, fastest, and longest wooden roller coaster in 1979. The Beast still retains the length record and continues to be highly ranked in the annual Golden Ticket Awards from Amusement Today. With the addition of Mystic Timbers in 2017, Kings Island claimed the world record for having the most wooden roller coaster track in a single amusement park, and it tied the record for most wooden roller coasters, raising the park's total to five.\nKings Island added a  water park called WaterWorks in 1989, constructed near White Water Canyon. The area featured 15 water slides, a lazy river, and a children's play area. After multiple expansions and name changes, the park was eventually renamed Soak City.\nFor safety reasons, Kings Island publishes a ride rating system that classifies the attractions one through five based on the intensity of the ride, with one representing the calmest rides to five indicating the most aggressive.\nKings Island\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Attractions located in Kings Island\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" | Type or model\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50%;\" | Description\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Thrill rating\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref(s)\n|-\n|scope=\"row\" | Adventure Express\n|Arrow Dynamics\n|Mine train roller coaster\n|Jungle adventure-themed roller coaster that features audio and visual special effects\n|Adventure Port\n|5\n|\n|-\n|scope=\"row\" | Banshee\n|Bolliger & Mabillard\n|Inverted Coaster\n|An inverted roller coaster, the longest of its kind in the world, with seven inversions located in the former location of Son of Beast\n|Action Zone\n|5\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Phantom Theater: Opening Nightmare\n|Sally Corporation\n|Interactive dark ride\n|Family dark ride where guests can interact by shooting laser guns at targets throughout the ride\n|International Street\n|1\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Cargo Loco\n|Zamperla\n|Midi Tea Cup\n|\n|Adventure Port\n|1\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Character Carousel\n|Chance Rides\n|Carousel\n|Children's carousel featuring Peanuts characters and themes\n|Planet Snoopy\n|1\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Charlie Brown’s Rushing River Log Ride\n|Arrow Dynamics, Hopkins Rides\n|Log flume\n|\n|Camp Snoopy\n|4\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Charlie Brown's Wind Up\n|Zamperla\n|Swing ride\n|Children's miniature swing ride\n|Planet Snoopy\n|1\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Congo Falls\n|Intamin\n|Shoot-the-Chutes\n|An  water flume ride with  boats and a  drop Formerly known as Amazon Falls (1988–1998)\n|Action Zone\n|5\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Delirium\n|HUSS\n|Giant Frisbee\n|Frisbee flat ride that swings riders  at an angle of 120°, lifting riders  into the air\n|Action Zone\n|5\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Diamondback\n|Bolliger & Mabillard\n|Hypercoaster\n|\n|Rivertown\n|5\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dodgem\n|Barbezi (Azzurra) & Majestic International\n|Bumper cars\n|\n|Coney Mall\n|4\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Drop Tower\n|Intamin\n|Gyro Drop\n|A  drop tower ride that opened as the tallest of its kind in the worldFormerly known as Drop Zone: Stunt Tower (1999–2007).\n|Action Zone\n|4\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Eiffel Tower\n|Intamin\n|Tower\n|\n|International Street\n|2\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Festhaus\n|\n|Live show venue\n|\n|Oktoberfest\n|\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Flight of Fear\n|Premier Rides\n|Launched roller coaster\n|Formerly known as The Outer Limits: Flight of Fear (1996–2000)\n|Area 72\n|5\n|\n|-\n|scope=\"row\" | Franklin’s Flyers\n|Larson International\n|Flying Scooters\n|\n|Camp Snoopy\n|3\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Grand Carousel\n|Philadelphia Toboggan Company\n|Carousel\n|\n|International Street\n|1\n|\n|-\n|scope=\"row\" | International Showplace\n|\n|Live show venue\n|\n|International Street\n|\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | International Street Bandstand\n|\n|Live show venue\n|Entertainment venue located between the Eiffel Tower and Royal Fountain\n|International Street\n|\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Invertigo\n|Vekoma\n|Invertigo\n|An inverted Boomerang roller coaster featuring three inversionsFormerly known as FACE/OFF (1999–2007)\n|Action Zone\n|5\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Joe Cool's Dodgem School\n|Jurgen Schmidt\n|Bumper cars\n|\n|Planet Snoopy\n|2\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Kings Island and Miami Valley Railroad\n|Crown Metal Products Company\n|Steam train\n|\n|Rivertown\n|1\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Kings Island Theater\n|\n|Live show venue\n|A 1,300-seat indoor theater first opened in 1976 and designed by Paul Shortt, the original founding faculty member at Cincinnati's College Conservatory of Music.\nFormerly known as: American Heritage Music Hall&nbsp;(1976–1992); Paramount Theater&nbsp;(1993–2007)\n|International Street\n|\n|\n|-\n|Kings Mills Antique Autos\n|Gould Manufacturing\n|Antique Cars\n|An antique car attraction reminiscent of the former Les Taxis ride.

In 1997, Kings Island expanded the water park to  by adding the wave pool (Surfside Bay; now known as Breakers Bay), and a new children's water playground. The following year, the FlowRider, and Pipeline Paradise opened as Wipeout Beach. Six years later, WaterWorks was renamed to Crocodile Dundee's Boomerang Bay Waterpark (later simplified to Boomerang Bay Waterpark). In 2012, the water park was re-branded to Cedar Fair's Soak City. All of the water slides and the lazy river were refurbished. An additional wave pool was also constructed.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 105px;\" | Name\n! style=\"width: 140px;\" | Picture\n! style=\"width: 40px;\" | Opened\n!

Riders board side-by-side rafts at the starting line where a conveyor belt launch sends them plunging down a 33-foot, 47-degree first drop.

As each raft nears the bottom of the drop and starts to climb upward, water jets drench the riders and propel them up into an enclosed tunnel illuminated with special lighting effects. The race is on as racers zip through more twists and turns, rushing into an open-air, high-banking slingshot, whipping them around 180 degrees into a gravity-defying final mega drop to see who crosses the finish line first!\n|\n|\n|-\n|Salamander Sliders\n|\n|2025\n|Located in Splash River Junction.
