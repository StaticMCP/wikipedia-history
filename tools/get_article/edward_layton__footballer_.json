Injury in the 1903/04 season meant he missed much of the season and he eventually left to join South Kirkby, where he became club captain. He later moved to Rotherham Town before being signed by Aston Villa in January 1908, moving next to Middlesbrough. In 1912 he left Middlesbrough for Australia, along with his brother William. In 1914 he returned to England, where he had been playing football for two years, with Middlesbrough still holding his registration. Cardiff City eventually acquired his registration and later he joined Stockport County.\nInternational career\nBetween 1912 and 1914 Layton travelled across Australia, playing football for various small clubs. During this time he was 'capped' by Australia in a match between New South Wales and Queensland. Even though his normal position was full back he played the game as centre forward, scoring the only goal.\nFamily\nEdward was the brother of William Layton, a footballer with Sheffield Wednesday.\nReferences"
