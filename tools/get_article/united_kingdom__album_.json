It was released exclusively in the United Kingdom in 1989 on Frontier Records and Demon Records. The album was recorded primarily for the country, where the band had a larger following than in their native United States, and consists of a mixture of studio and live tracks. United Kingdom was produced by Tom Mallon, who also produced the band's previous three LPs, The Restless Stranger, Engine and California.\nUnited Kingdom contains the song \"Kathleen\", the most obvious of many that Mark Eitzel has composed about his long-term muse, Kathleen Burns.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;American Music Club\n* Mark Eitzel – vocals, guitar\n* Tom Mallon – bass, production\n* Mike Simms – drums\n* Vudi – guitar, accordion, backing vocals\n;Additional musicians\n* Charles Gillingham – piano\n* Bruce Kaphan – pedal steel\n;Artwork and design\n* Kathleen Burns – cover photography\nReferences"
