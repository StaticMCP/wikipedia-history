Hosted by comedian Gabriel Iglesias, who is best known for his stand-up specials, the show features new material by both himself and other comedians. Each episode opens with a stand up by Iglesias before several other comedians perform, each of whom Iglesias usually introduces with an encore. The show debuted on October 6, 2011, and is executive produced by Iglesias. The program features Gabriel Iglesias as an emcee, features new material, and introduces two or three lesser known comedians looking for a big break on television. Each comedian presents a short set of jokes, which is edited to last about five minutes upon the airing of the show.\nProduction\nBefore a season would start, Gabriel and the other comedians would perform on a bigger stage than the normal comedy clubs they would usually perform whenever the season starts. As the show started becoming more and more popular, Comedy Central decided to let Gabriel and his friends perform on television. For each season the show will have a different setting for example, the first season took place in Phoenix, Arizona. Iglesias' friend Martin Moreno appears as his sidekick similar to Conan O'Brien and Andy Richter's relationship. Gabriel also got Ozomatli to serve as the house band and got to write the show's theme song. Gabriel\nwanted his show to be similar to John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show but rather than having comedians people already knew, he wanted to introduce his lesser known friends who are comedians.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n!
