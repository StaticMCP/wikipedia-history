As has long been the case for the Kerrang! Awards, the winners for the major categories were determined by fan votes from a shortlist of nominees, itself determined by a period of open fan nominee submissions.\nArchitects received the most nominations with three, namely 'Best Album', 'Best British Act', and 'Best British Live Act'. The band would ultimately walk away with only the latter award, winning it for the second consecutive year.\nThe event was also notable for the 'Hall of Fame' award being awarded for the first time since 2014, with Skunk Anansie winning the distinction. Feeder's frontman Grant Nicholas, who presented the band with their award, would two months later see his own band inducted into Kerrang! Radio's Hall of Fame.\nThe ceremony was not broadcast live but was streamed online the following evening before being uploaded to the Kerrang! YouTube channel.\nWinners and Nominees\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n!width=\"50%\"|Best Album (presented by Kelly Osbourne)\n!width=\"50%\"|Best Song (presented by Employed to Serve)\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*'Ghost – Prequelle'\n**Behemoth – I Loved You at Your Darkest\n**Bring Me the Horizon – Amo\n**Architects – Holy Hell\n**Greta Van Fleet – Anthem of the Peaceful Army\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*'Fever 333 – Burn It'\n**Bring Me the Horizon – Mantra\n**Rammstein – Deutschland\n**Frank Iero – Young and Doomed\n**Slipknot – All Out Life\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Best British Breakthrough\n!width=\"50%\"|Best International Breakthrough (presented by Matt Berry)\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Idles\n**Yonaka\n**Scarlxrd\n**Black Peaks\n**Svalbard\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*SWMRS\n**Angel Du$t\n**The Interrupters\n**Simple Creatures\n**Vein\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Best British Act\n!width=\"50%\"|Best International Act(presented by Roger Taylor)\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Bring Me the Horizon\n**Architects\n**Biffy Clyro\n**Enter Shikari\n**Iron Maiden\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Metallica\n**Foo Fighters\n**Panic! at the Disco\n**Rammstein\n**Slipknot\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Best British Live Act (presented by Caleb Shomo)\n!width=\"50%\"|Best International Live Act\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Architects\n**Don Broco\n**Employed to Serve\n**Enter Shikari\n**Frank Carter & the Rattlesnakes\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Metallica\n**Fever 333\n**Ghost\n**Mastodon\n**Parkway Drive\n|-\n!width=\"50%\"|Special Achievement awards\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n*Kerrang!
