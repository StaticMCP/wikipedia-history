These units were reorganized in 1862 into infantry and cavalry regiments. In 1864 a second call for State Troops was issued by Governor Charles Clark, and new regiments were formed. Several of the State Troops cavalry regiments were later converted to Confederate service, as noted below.\nShort term state units\n* Army of 10,000: 5 infantry regiments, 1 battalion. 60-days state service, 1861.\nInfantry\n{| width=100% |\n|-\n| width=50% |\n1862 State Troops:\n* 1st Infantry (King's)\n* 2nd Infantry (Quinn's)\n* 3rd Infantry (Owens')\n* 4th Infantry (Bromley's)\n* 5th Infantry (Robinson's)\n* 1st Battalion Infantry (Harper's)\n* 2nd Battalion Infantry (Cook's)\n* 3rd Battalion Infantry (Burgin's)\n* 4th Battalion Infantry (Fairley's/Postletwait's)\n| width=50% valign=\"top\"|\n1864 State Troops:\n* 1st Infantry (Patton's)\n* 2nd Infantry (Chandler's)\n* 3rd Infantry (Summerville's)\n* 1st Battalion Infantry (Harper's)\n|}\nCavalry\n{| width=100% |\n|-\n| width=50% |\n1862 State Troops:\n* 1st Cavalry (Blythe's)\n* 2nd Cavalry (Smith's/Lowry's), transferred to Confederate service as the 6th Cavalry.\n* 3rd Cavalry (McGuirk's), transferred to Confederate service as the 3d Cavalry.\n* 3rd Battalion Cavalry (Ashcraft's), transferred to Confederate service as Ashcraft's Battalion.\n* Davenport's Battalion\n* Dunn's Battalion\n* Forrest's Battalion\n* Ham's Battalion, transferred to Confederate service and consolidated with Ashcraft's Battalion.\n* Harris' Battalion\n* Perrin's Battalion, transferred to Confederate service as the 11th Cavalry.\n| width=50% valign=\"top\"|\n1864 State Troops:\n* 1st Cavalry (Foote's)\n* 2nd Cavalry (Hill's)\n* 3rd Cavalry (Easterling's)\n* 4th Cavalry (Fisher's)\n* 1st Battalion Cavalry (McNair's)\n* 3rd Battalion Cavalry\n* Pettus' Battalion Cavalry\n|}\nReserves\n* 1st Regiment Cavalry Reserves\n* 2nd Battalion Cavalry Reserves\n* 3rd Battalion Cavalry Reserves\n* Gamblin's Battalion Cavalry Reserves\n* Montgomery's Battalion Cavalry Reserves\n* Moorman's Battalion Cavalry Reserves\n* Peyton's Battalion Cavalry Reserves\n* Stubb's Battalion Cavalry Reserves\nSee also\n*Lists of American Civil War Regiments by State\nReferences\n*\n*"
