      "text": "# Colonial Hills Conference\n\nThe Colonial Hills Conference was a New Jersey high school sports association under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). The conference comprised sixteen public, parochial, and private high schools covering Essex County, Morris County and Somerset County in north-central North Jersey.\nAlso known as the CHC, the conference disbanded after the 2008–09 school year as part of a major realignment of Northern New Jersey athletic leagues promulgated by the NJSIAA. Most member schools moved to the Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference or the Super Essex Conference.\nThe Conference had two divisions for most sports, the Colonial Division and the Hills Division.\nColonial Division\n{|\n|School\n|Location\n|School District\n|Team Name\n|-\n|Arts High School\n|Newark\n|Newark Public Schools\n|Jaguars\n|-\n|Boonton High School\n|Boonton\n|Boonton Public Schools\n|Bombers\n|-\n|Kinnelon High School\n|Kinnelon\n|Kinnelon Public Schools\n|Colts\n|-\n|Mountain Lakes High School\n|Mountain Lakes\n|Mountain Lakes Schools\n|Lakers\n|-\n|Science Park High School\n|Newark\n|Newark Public Schools\n|Chargers\n|-\n|University High School\n|Newark\n|Newark Public Schools\n|Phoenix\n|-\n|Verona High School\n|Verona\n|Verona Public Schools\n|Hillbillies\n|-\n|Whippany Park High School\n|Hanover Township\n|Hanover Park Regional High School District\n|Wildcats\n|-\n|}\nHills Division\n{|\n|School\n|Location\n|School District\n|Team Name\n|-\n|Cedar Grove High School\n|Cedar Grove\n|Cedar Grove Schools\n|Panthers\n|-\n|Glen Ridge High School\n|Glen Ridge\n|Glen Ridge Public Schools\n|Ridgers\n|-\n|Immaculate Conception High School\n|Montclair\n|\n|Lions\n|-\n|Montclair Kimberley Academy\n|Montclair\n|\n|Cougars\n|-\n|Morristown-Beard School\n|Morris Township\n|\n|Crimson\n|-\n|Morris Catholic High School\n|Denville\n|\n|Crusaders\n|-\n|Newark Academy\n|Livingston\n|\n|Minutemen\n|-\n|Pingry School\n|Martinsville\n|\n|Big Blue\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061029044833/http://www.colonialhillsconference.com/ Colonial Hills Conference website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170525203826/http://www.njsiaa.org/ New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]"
