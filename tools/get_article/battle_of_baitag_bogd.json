The Mongolian People's Republic became involved in a border dispute with the Republic of China, as a Hui (Tungan) cavalry regiment was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongolian and Soviet positions.\nBackground\nThere had always been a Chinese police force stationed at a Xinjiang police station with Chinese sentry posts before and after 1945. As commander of the First Cavalry Division, Salar Muslim Major General Han Youwen was sent to Baitag Bogd by the Kuomintang military command to reinforce Hui Muslim General Ma Xizhen with a company of troops approximately three months before the fighting broke out. At Baitag Bogd, Han Youwen was in command of all Muslim cavalry defending against Soviet and Mongol forces. Han told American reporter A. Doak Barnett that he believed the border should be about  north of the mountains.\nBattle\nHui and Kazakh forces working for the Chinese Kuomintang battled Soviet and Mongol troops. In June 1947, the Mongols and the Soviets launched an attack against the Kazakhs, driving them back to the Chinese side. However, fighting continued for another year, with 13 clashes taking place between 5 June 1947 and July 1948.\nMongolia invaded Xinjiang with the intention of assisting Li Rihan, the pro-Soviet Special Commissioner, in gaining control of Xinjiang, over Special Commissioner Osman Batur, who was pro-ROC. The Chinese defense ministry spokesman announced that Outer Mongolian soldiers had captured Beitashan and stated that troops were resisting near Beitashan.\nElite Qinghai Hui cavalry were sent by the Chinese Kuomintang to destroy the Mongols and the Soviets in 1947.\nIn early June 1947, Beitashan was retaken by Chinese troops, who continued to fight against Soviet and Mongolian bomber planes; China's Legislative Yuan demanded stronger policies against the Soviet Union in response to the Mongol invasion. The bombs started dropping from Mongol and Soviet planes on 5 June.\nRepublic of China forces took eight Outer Mongolian troops prisoner, while 30 horses and two Republic of China soldiers died in a bombing. The Republic of China issued a protest against the border attack by the Mongols and Soviets. The Republic of China accused Soviet planes of being involved in the attack. The American ambassador to China branded the Outer Mongolian state as a tool and arm of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were aiming their intervention against the Kazakhs. Chinese Gen. Sung displayed captured Soviet-style Mongolian military headgear and a Soviet map to the American ambassador. The Soviet Tass news agency claimed that Mongolian officers were gruesomely murdered and mutilated. Douglas Mackiernan was sent to Baitag Bogd on 19 June 1947. The Mongolians possessed Soviet weapons that were seized from Soviet troops in battle. The Kazakhs were suffering from a dearth of edible supplies. The entire Baitag Bogd was threatened by Outer Mongol occupation according to Kazakh leader Osman.\nChinese Gen. Ma Xizhen and Kazakh Osman Batur fought against the Mongol troops and airplanes throughout June as fierce fighting erupted. The MPR used a battalion-size force and had Soviet air support in June 1947. The Mongolians repeatedly probed the Chinese lines.\nSee also\n*Ili Rebellion\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
