Following continued resistance and growing international pressure, Timor-Leste became independent on 20 May 2002.\nHistory\nDeclaration of independence\nEast Timor was colonised by Portugal in the mid-16th century and administered as Portuguese Timor. After the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, a decolonisation process was initiated which was to have led to the formation of an elected Constituent Assembly in 1976. Three new parties emerged at this time: the Timorese Democratic Union, which advocated continued association with Portugal; Fretilin, which supported independence; and Apodeti, which supported integration into Indonesia. In local elections held on 13 March 1975, Fretilin and UDT emerged as the largest parties, having previously formed an alliance to campaign for independence.\nOn 11 August 1975, the UDT attempted a coup, in a bid to halt the increasing popularity of Fretilin. Portuguese Governor Mário Lemos Pires fled to the offshore island of Atauro, north of the capital, Dili, from where he later attempted to broker an agreement between the two sides.\nOn 28 November 1975, Fretilin made a unilateral declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of East Timor with Francisco Xavier do Amaral as president and Nicolau dos Reis Lobato as prime minister. This act was not recognised by either Portugal or Indonesia.\nOn 30 November 1975, Fretilin caused a \"Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (RDTL)\" to be read out at an inauguration ceremony for Amaral as the newly appointed president. Article 40 of the new constitution provided for the establishment of a Council of Ministers. On 1 December 1975, Fretilin established that body.\nIndonesian invasion\nIn response, on 30 November 1975, Indonesia encouraged leaders of the UDT, Apodeti, and other smaller parties to sign the Balibo Declaration calling for integration of East Timor into Indonesia. On 7 December 1975, Indonesian forces launched a massive air and sea invasion, known as Operasi Seroja (Operation Lotus), citing the potential for a communist government, the need to develop the territory and national and regional security risks as reasons for its actions. Indonesian forces occupied the capital, Dili, within hours of launching the invasion during the Battle of Dili and occupied the second largest city, Baucau, on 10 December, with Liquisa and Maubara being occupied in late December.\nSubsequent events\nOn 17 December an Indonesian-supported Provisional Government of East Timor (Pemerintah Sementara Timor Timur; PSTT) was formed which was led by Arnaldo dos Reis Araújo of Apodeti and Lopez da Cruz of the UDT. A Regional Popular Assembly was established on 31 May 1976, which subsequently adopted a resolution calling for the formal integration of East Timor into Indonesia. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia formally annexed East Timor as the province of Timor Timur with  as its first governor.\nThe United Nations did not recognise either the Democratic Republic of East Timor, proclaimed by Fretilin, or Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor and instead continued to recognise Portugal as the legal Administering Power as demonstrated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 384. This meant that in terms of international law Portuguese Timor nominally continued to exist. An agreement in 1999 between the governments of Portugal and Indonesia led to a referendum on 30 August 1999 in which a majority of the people of East Timor voted for independence. Following a transitional period of United Nations administration, East Timor became independent as the Democratic Republic of East Timor on 20 May 2002.\nText of the Declaration of Independence\nText\nIn Portuguese:\nIn English:\nGovernment\nFollowing the declaration of independence a Council of Ministers was formed with Francisco Xavier do Amaral as president and Nicolau dos Reis Lobato as prime minister.\nPresidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Elected\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Time in office\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 1\n|\n| Francisco Xavier do Amaral\n| rowspan=\"2\"| —\n| 28 November 1975\n| 7 December 1975\n|\n| Fretilin\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 2\n|\n| Nicolau dos Reis Lobato\n| 7 December 1975\n| 31 December 1978\n|\n| Fretilin\n|}\nPrime minister\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Time in office\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" | 1\n|\n| Nicolau dos Reis Lobato\n| —\n| 28 November 1975\n| 7 December 1975\n|\n| Fretilin\n|}\nInternational relations\nDiplomatic recognition\nFollowing the declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of East Timor, the state received diplomatic recognition from six mainly socialist states, most of them former Portuguese colonies.\nThe states that recognised the Democratic Republic of East Timor were as follows:\n* Albania\n* China\n* Mozambique\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Cape Verde\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\nDiplomatic representation\nThe Democratic Republic of East Timor maintained a liaison office in New York located at Apartment 608, 310 East 44th Street.\nReferences"
