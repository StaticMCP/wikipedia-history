Covering an area of 1673 acres, the district was formed in May 2023 and assumed its name after King Salman bin Abdulaziz following the amalgamation of al-Wahah and Salah al-Din neighborhoods. The neighborhood is located adjacent to the site of King Salman Park project.\nIn 2019, the Saudi government announced the King Salman Park project, a planned 4102-acre large-scale public park that was slated to be the largest urban park in the world. King Abdulaziz District was selected for the site of the project. King Abdulaziz District was situated south of al-Wahah and Salah al-Din neighborhoods.\nIn May 2023, al-Wahah and Salah al-Din neighborhoods were renamed as King Salman Neighborhood by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to honor the legacy of King Salman bin Abdulaziz and his efforts to modernize Riyadh during his period in office as the governor of Riyadh Province between 1955 and 1960 and then from 1963 to 2011.\nLandmarks\nDiplomatic missions\n* Embassy of Ukraine\n* Embassy of Mozambique\nMosques\n* Ibn al-Uthaymin Mosque\n* Fahd al-Owaidah Mosque\n* Princess Juhaier bint Bandar Mosque\n* Al-Wahah Mosque\n* Umm Abdulaziz al-Theyab Mosque\n* Salah al-Din Mosque\nParks\n* Al-Wahah Park\nMarketplaces\n* Tamimi Markets\n* eXtra store\nInstitutes\n* Riyadh College of Technology\n* Prince Sultan University\n* International Aviation Technical College\nGovernment offices\n* Ministry of Education\nGallery\nFile:حديقة_حي_الواحة_01.JPG|Al-Wahah Park, 2012\nFile:Alowidah_Mosque.JPG|Fahd al-Owaidah Mosque, 2009\nFile:Ministry of Education, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.JPG|Ministry of Education headquarters, 2011\nReferences"
