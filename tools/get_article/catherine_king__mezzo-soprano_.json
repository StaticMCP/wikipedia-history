She is the only female member of Gothic Voices and has made over 40 recordings.\nBiography\nBorn in Newcastle and brought up in Worcestershire, Catherine King began her vocal studies as a choral scholar at Trinity College Cambridge followed by a period at the Guildhall in London, and later study with Josephine Veasey and Janice Chapman.\nCatherine King regularly performs music covering a vast period from the present day back to the 11th century, and in many languages (often with period pronunciation). Well known as a versatile early music specialist, she has played a significant role in the modern interpretation of mediaeval music, particularly through her long standing work with Gothic Voices.\nCatherine King has also recorded and premiered songs written for her by a number of composers, including at the Spitalfields Festival in London, with Sing Circle, in commissions by Andrew Keeling, at the Louth Contemporary Music Society (Ireland) and on BBC Radio and CD.
