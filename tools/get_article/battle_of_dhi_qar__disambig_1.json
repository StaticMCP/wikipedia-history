The battle occurred after the death of Al-Nu'man III by the orders of Khosru II.\nThe dating of the event is disputed. The Encyclopædia Iranica entry on the subject says:\n}}\nThe battle of Dhū-Qār is reported in many classical works of Arabic history and literature. The longest, but not necessarily most representative, version is Bishr ibn Marwān al-Asadī's Ḥarb Banī Shaybān maʻa Kisrá Ānūshirwān ().\nSee also\n* Fijar Wars\n* Al-Nu'man III\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
