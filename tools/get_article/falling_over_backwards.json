Meanwhile, Mel himself is drawn into a nascent relationship with Jackie (Julie Saint-Pierre), his landlady, which is complicated when Jackie discovers that she is pregnant by her previous boyfriend and considers having an abortion.\nCast\n* Saul Rubinek as Mel Rosenblum\n* Paul Soles as Harvey Rosenblum\n* Julie Saint-Pierre as Jackie\n* Helen Hughes as Rose Rosenblum\n* Vlasta Vrána as Drunk\n* Harry Standjofski as Club Manager\n* Aidan Devine as Young Man\nReception\nThe film was compared by critics to a Jewish version of a Michel Tremblay play.
