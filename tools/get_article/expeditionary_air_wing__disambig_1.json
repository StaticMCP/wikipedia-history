Each EAW has its own identity and is led by the Station Commander, supported by their Station management team. The deployable elements of the station structures form the core of each EAW, reinforced by  elements of the Air Combat Service Support Units (ACSSUs). Flying and Force Protection force elements are attached to meet the requirements of each operation.  EAWs enable the RAF to train as cohesive air power units which are prepared and capable of transitioning quickly from peacetime structures and deploying swiftly on operations in tailored packages.\nUK based wings\nCurrent wings\nNo. 34 EAW\n* RAF Waddington  (ISTAR)\n* Previously located at RAF Lyneham; deployed between May and December 2016 to NSA Souda Bay supporting Operation Shader.\nNo. 38 EAW\n*  38 EAW is an Air Mobility specialist EAW composed of personnel from RAF Brize Norton and RAF Northolt.\n* Deployed to Barbados on Operation Ruman 9 September 17 to  support Hurricane Irma relief efforts in the Caribbean. 38 EAW comprised\n** Elements of No. XXIV Squadron.
