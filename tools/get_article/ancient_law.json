The twelfth edition was published in 1888. A new edition, with notes by Frederick Pollock, was published in octavo in 1906.\nLectures delivered by Maine for the Inns of Court were the groundwork for Ancient Law. Its object, as stated in the preface, was \"to indicate some of the earliest ideas of mankind, as they are reflected in ancient law, and to point out the relation of those ideas to modern thought.\nSee also\n* Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges and his The Ancient City (1864)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.org/details/ancientlaw030840mbp/ Ancient Law, 10th Edition (1908) at the Internet Archive]"
