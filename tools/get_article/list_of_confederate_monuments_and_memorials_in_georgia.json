Nor does it include figures connected with the origins of the Civil War or white supremacy, but not with the Confederacy.\nGeorgia has a statute making it difficult to remove Confederate monuments because it is unlawful to damage, relocate or remove any memorials honoring any military personnel of the state or USA or the Confederate States of America.\n, there are at least 201 public spaces with Confederate monuments in Georgia.\nState capitol\nin front of the Georgia State Capitol]]\n* Statue of John Brown Gordon, Georgia State Capitol grounds (1907). \"One of the leading proponents of both the New South creed and the Lost Cause, a philosophy that greatly romanticized the South's role in the war.

That opinion was cited in several briefs in the Supreme Court's recent decision on gay marriage as an example of how government has consistently erred in defining marriage.\"\n* ]]Plaque and tree honoring William Ambrose Wright, a lieutenant in the Confederate States Army, and Georgia state comptroller for fifty years, as well as insurance commissioner.
