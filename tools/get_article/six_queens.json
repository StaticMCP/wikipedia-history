Although billed as a double A-side with \"Little Boy Lost\", the greater popularity of the former among both fans and the band, and the fact that it had a music video made for it means that the release is usually simply referred to as just 'Six Queens'.\nTypically for an indie band's first release, the single was very limited with only 500 copies pressed.\nThe song was later re-recorded by producer Iain Gore for the band's 2006 debut album, The Freedom Spark.\nTrack listing\n# \"Six Queens\"\n# \"Little Boy Lost\"\nExternal links\n*[http://www.drownedinsound.com/content/view/13191 Drowned in Sound: Review]"
