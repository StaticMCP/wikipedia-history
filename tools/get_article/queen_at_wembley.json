The recording is a performance from The Magic Tour which took place during the summer of 1986.\nIt was originally transmitted in 1986 in the UK and released commercially in various audio and video forms in 1990 and the recent DVD.\nRelease\nBroadcast\nThe recorded concert was first broadcast as Queen: Real Magic on a special episode for the British music show The Tube on 25 October 1986 on Channel 4.\nThis was transmitted in mono (as was normal before NICAM stereo became standard on UK TV in the early 1990s). However, it was simultaneously broadcast over the radio in stereo so that viewers had the option to mute their televisions, play the audio on a nearby radio and enjoy “the world’s first ever stereo simulcast” in a similar way that previous live (as opposed to, in this case, pre-recorded) classical performances had sometimes been offered.\nHome media\nThe recording was first commercially released in December 1990 as an edited VHS (missing 9 songs), then as the Live at Wembley '86 audio CD in 1992. This was followed by a DVD release as Queen: Live at Wembley Stadium (in its entirety) to coincide with the CD rerelease in 2003. The DVD has gone five times platinum in the United States, four times platinum in the United Kingdom, and achieved multi platinum status around the world. On 5 September 2011, the 25th Anniversary Edition of the concert was released as a standard 2-DVD set and a deluxe 2-DVD and 2-CD set which also included the entire Friday, 11 July 1986 concert on DVD for the first time. Eagle Rock Entertainment released a 25th anniversary edition in the US and Canada on 12 March 2013.\nDisc one\n# One Vision\n# Tie Your Mother Down\n# In the Lap of the Gods...
