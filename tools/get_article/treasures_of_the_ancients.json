It is indispensable for the Gamma World universe, and somewhat useful for other TSR products. There is a lot of high-tech in here, and a few of the higher end things in a low tech environment could make things interesting, especially if the players aren't the ones with the tech.\"\nReviews\n*Action Check #8 (Jan., 2001)\n*Papyrus (Issue 16 - April Fools 1995)\nReferences"
