Playing in New York with a top-notch quartet that includes pianist Richard Wyands, Edwards caresses some of the melodies (his long tones are impressive), he swings hard in spots, and he shows great affection for the material. ... Throughout, Teddy Edwards shows that in 2001 he was still in his musical prime.\"\nOn All About Jazz, Terrell Kent Holmes called it \"a fine example of economical playing and arrangement\" and noted \"Edwards, now approaching 80 years old, shows on Smooth Sailing that he's as formidable a sax man as ever. More power to any septuagenerian who swings.\"\nThe authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings stated that Edwards \"was in failing health\" when the album was recorded, \"but you wouldn't know it... Even at this age and even seriously ill, Teddy was able to swing a line with the best of them.\"\nDavid Franklin of Jazz Times commented: \"Smooth Sailing... shows that [Edwards'] buoyant sense of swing and tender way with a ballad remain intact. Not surprising for a man of his age, his intonation is occasionally insecure... but that aside, these eight performances are remarkable for someone of his years.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Going Home\" (Teddy Edwards) – 8:29\n# \"All Too Soon\" (Duke Ellington, Carl Sigman) – 4:50\n# \"Hank's Tune\" (Hank Mobley) – 5:22\n# \"Indian Summer\" (Victor Herbert, Al Dubin) – 6:17\n# \"Robbin's Nest\" (Illinois Jacquet, Bob Russell) – 6:43\n# \"It's the Talk of the Town\" (Jerry Livingston, Al J.
