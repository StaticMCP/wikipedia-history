Its headquarters are in the town of Araromi Opin.\nIt has an area of 480&nbsp;km and a population of 54,850 at the 2006 census.\nThe postal code of the area is 252.\nAmong other communities in Ekiti are Aare-Opin, Isolo-Opin, Isare-Opin, Osi, Ikerin-Opin, Oke-Opin, Epe-Opin, Owaatun-Opin, Etan, Obbo-Aiyegunle, Obbo-Ile, Eruku, Ajuba, Isapa, Koro and Ejiu.\nThe present Ekiti Local Government headquarter was never a known community in Opin land, but a compound from Isolo-Opin.  This became a legal tussle and caused communal unrest when the local government was created.\nA landmark judgment later declared Isolo-Opin as entitled to be the headquarter as opposed to Araromi Opin.\nOne of the credentials to this judgment is the fact that there are 12 Opins, who are children of a father, and Araromi was never among them.\nIt has become difficult to effect name changes because of political issues and legislative processes.\nNotable people\n*Ayodeji Olajide Fashikun (1965-2019), Nigerian sports journalist\n*Justice Gbadeyan, For Chief Justice of Kwara State\n*Barrister Jide Gbadeyan (SAN)\nReferences"
