The awards were broadcast live on YouTube on October 4, 2016 from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. They were hosted by actor and Vine star King Bach, the first black host of the show. In contrast with the 5th Streamy Awards which was televised on VH1 as well as being livestreamed, the Streamy Awards partnered with YouTube as their official livestreaming partner due to a desire to \"return to its digital roots\" for the 6th Streamy Awards. The official red carpet pre-show hosted by Teala Dunn was also livestreamed on YouTube.  To represent changes in the industry within the previous few years, three new award categories were introduced: Virtual Reality and 360° Video, Live, and Feature Film. The show generated a high level of social media interest and was well received by media publications, particularly for a tribute to Christina Grimmie who had died earlier that year.\nPerformers\nIn honor of Christina Grimmie, who was shot and killed outside of a concert venue earlier in the year, a medley of her songs was played throughout the show. The tribute was introduced by Shane Dawson and featured speeches by Dawson and Kurt Hugo Schneider. The show also contained musical performances by Biz Markie and Spencer Ludwig, and a musical sketch by Jon Cozart satirizing various social media platforms.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Performers at the 6th Streamy Awards\n! scope=\"col\" |Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|Jon Cozart\n|\"Jon Cozart (Paint) Sings a Song About Favorite Platforms\"\n|-\n|Spencer Ludwig\n|\"Diggy\"\n|-\n|Biz Markie\n|\"Just a Friend\"\n|-\n|Sam TsuiKurt Hugo Schneider\n|Medley of covers in memory of Christina Grimmie\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n, winner of the Audience Choice Award for Entertainer of the Year]]\n, winner of the Audience Choice Award for Show of the Year and the News and Culture category]]\n, winner of the Breakout Creator award]]\n, winners of the Comedy category]]\n, winner of the Animated category]]\n, winner of the First Person category and Best Editing]]\n, winner of the Gaming and Virtual Reality and 360 categories]]\n, winner of the Fashion category]]\n, winner of the Kids and Family category]]\n, winner of the Lifestyle category]]\n, winner of Best Cover Song]]\n, winner of Best Original Song]]\n, winner of the Brand Campaign award]]\n, winner of the Social Good Campaign award and Best Feature]]\nThe nominees were announced by GloZell Green at a ceremony in Santa Monica, California on August 24, 2016.

Madeline Roth of MTV News also praised the tribute saying \"Grimmie's Streamy Awards salute comes after both the Emmys and the Teen Choice Awards faced backlash from fans for not honoring the late singer. Finally, she's gotten the tribute she deserves.\" According to Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire, \"The show featured a number of breakout performance moments, including an emotional tribute to the late Christina Grimmie, an exuberant musical number by Spencer Ludwig and Streamys 2015 winner James Van Der Beek showing off his dance moves\". Mikey Glazer of TheWrap described Jon Cozart's musical sketch satirizing social networks as a \"comedy highlight of the night\".\nCasey Neistat, winner of the First Person award, said of the event \"The beauty of it is that reality TV – the messages, the ideas, the narratives that were communicated – were always filtered through TV producers. But now, creators that are nominated for this award ... we are telling our own stories. I think there's so much integrity in that then having them sort of be dictated by others whose interests may not align.\" Kandee Johnson, who won in the Beauty category, also praised the event, saying \"This is like the Oscars of the Internet. We really get no awards, everyone is like 'oh that little YouTube thing you do.' They look at like a joke. It's nice, someone thinks we are valuable.\" YouTuber Hazel Hayes criticized the lack of female nominees in a tweet saying \"A few people pointed out that there are no women nominated for best director at the Streamys. Same with best writer. Little bit sad to see.\"\nThe show had a 51% increase in its livestreamed viewership compared to the previous year and a high level of social media engagement.\nSee also\n*List of Streamy Award winners\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.streamys.org Streamy Awards website]"
