The result is indecisive, but both sides had some victories: Byzantine annexed most of Armenian kingdoms in Armenian highlands, which late conquered by seljuks and Armenians established Kingdom in Cilicia.\nBagratid Armenia\n* Principality of Taron\nSupported by Iberia\n| combatant2        =  Byzantine Empire\n| combatant1a       =\n* Rubenids\n| combatant2a       =  Byzantine EmpireSupported by\n| commander1        =  Gagik I Gagik II Vahram Pahlavouni Ruben I Constantine I Thoros I Leo I  Thoros II  Mleh Stephen\n| commander2        =  Basil II Constantine IX Alexios I John II Manuel I Alexios II Raynald of Chatillon Andronikos I\n| casualties1       = Unknown\n| casualties2       = 20,000 killed only at Battle of Ani\n| caption           = Armenian military commander and sparapet Vahram Pahlavouni (in the center)\n| campaignbox       =\n}}\nBackground\nThe relationship between the Byzantine Empire and ancient Armenia was a constant and varied one with an equal mix of wars, occupations, treaties of friendship, mutual military aid, and cultural exchange. Regarded as a vital defence to the Empire's eastern frontiers, emperors used various means of influence from outright takeover to gifts of titles and lands to Armenian nobles. Influence went in the other direction, too, with several important Byzantine emperors being of Armenian descent, as well as many individuals who held key military and administrative positions in Constantinople and beyond.\nByzantine emperor Constantine V (r. 741-775 CE) attacked Armenia between 746 and 752 CE, taking advantage of the civil war which preoccupied the Umayyad Caliphate. The Byzantine Empire would assert even more influence over Armenia from the 10th century CE.\nWar in Armenia (966–1045)\nConquest of Taron\nThe lines of the Bagratunis had established their rule in Taron. This power, as mentioned, became the first victim of Byzantine. It was captured by the Byzantines in 966.\nConquest of Tayk\nIn the northwestern part of Armenia, the Tayk principality emerged. Byzantium declared it independent, and its ruler David was declared a vassal. David, before his death (1000), bequeathed Tayk to Byzantium. Thus, Tayk passed to Byzantium after David's death.\nBattle of Ani\nConstantine IX Monomachos sents army about 100 000 for surrender Ani to Byzantine. 30 000 armenians of Ani led by Vahram Pahlavouni defended Ani and expuled them. Byzantine Army returned with heavy causalties, about 20 000 dead.\nFall of Ani\nIn 1045, Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos was notified that Gagik II tried to strengthen country, calls him to Constantinople, to talk about Ani's problem. Gagik arrives to the capital of Byzantine, but where turns out that Constantine conspired. Gagik II is trapped in the Byzantine court, after which a series of raids are undertaken against Ani, resulting in the decline of the Bagratid Kingdom of Ani.\nArmenians in Cilicia\nCilicia, located adjacent to the Armenian Highlands, has been known to Armenians since ancient times. As early as the 1st century BC, Tigranes II conquered and annexed the eastern plains and mountains of Cilicia to the Armenian state. It is likely that Armenians began to settle in Cilicia from that time on. By the 10th century, they were already in considerable numbers.\nTo address the national and ecclesiastical problems of the Armenians of Cilicia, Catholicos Khachig I founded a number of episcopal dioceses at the end of the 10th century.\nIn the 11th century, Due to the unfavorable situation created for Armenia, the mass emigration of the Armenian population to Lesser Armenia, Cappadocia, Assyria and Cilicia begins. It was associated with the policy of Byzantine to emigrate Armenians from Armenia and the raids of the Seljuk Turks. The raids of the nomadic Seljuk Turks had such severe consequences that significant parts of the Armenian population were forced to leave their homeland. Some of them settled in Cilicia. In the 11th century, the Byzantines also moved a number of royal and princely houses from Armenia to Cappadocia and Cilicia, along with their subject population. The Artsrunis and Bagratunis were also forced to emigrate from Armenia.\nCilician wars\nBackground\n]]Some of the Armenian princes who settled in Cappadocia, Cilicia and Northern Syria received from the empire the administration of one or another province in exchange for military service. Among them was Aplgharip Artsruni, whom the Byzantine court had appointed governor (strategos) of Cilicia. The cities of Adana, Mamistra, Tarsus and the fortresses of Lambron and Paperon were given to him. Later, Prince Aplgharip donated Lambron to Prince Oshin, who had moved from Gandzak to Cilicia, from whom the Hetumyan princely and then royal house descended.\nThe last Bagratid ruler of Ani, Gagik II, had settled in the city of Pizu, located on the border of Cilicia. The last king of Kars, Gagik Abbasyan, had established his rule in the regions of Lesser Armenia and Cappadocia bordering Cilicia.\nThe presence of a large Armenian population, the Armenian Church and Armenian royal and princely houses in Cilicia created the prerequisites for the creation of Armenian statehood.\nWar over Mountainous Cilicia\nOne of the Armenian princes, Ruben, founded the Rubenid principality in Mountainous Cilicia in 1080. Relying on the support of the Armenian population, Ruben was able to capture part of Mountainous Cilicia from the Byzantines.\nThe existence of the Rubinian principality was threatened not only by the Byzantines, but also by the Seljuk Turks. However, the First Crusade, which began to liberate Palestine and Syria from the Muslims, temporarily diverted their attention from Cilicia, allowing the Armenian authority to consolidate and strengthen.\nCapture of Vahka\nRuben was succeeded by his son Constantine, during whose reign the Rubenids' rule expanded and strengthened. In 1098 he captured the famous fortress of Vahka in Mountainous Cilicia from the Byzantines, which became the center of power.\nPart of the Crusaders were to pass through Cilicia, and Constantine controlled the Taurus passes, so they had to negotiate with him. The Armenian prince allowed the Crusaders to pass through the Taurus passes and supplied them with food. In return, the Crusaders granted him the title of baron.\nThe Crusaders captured the famous cities of Plain Cilicia, Tarsus, Adana and Mamistra, from the Seljuks, for which a stubborn struggle began between the Armenians, the Byzantines, the Seljuks and the Crusaders. The Crusaders also captured Syria and Palestine and created four Crusader states: the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Principality of Antioch, the counties of Edessa and Tripoli.\nCapture of Anazarbus and Sis\nIn 1107, encouraged by Tancred, Prince of Antioch, Thoros followed the course of the Pyramus River (today the river Ceyhan in Turkey), and seized the strongholds of Anazarbus (a place which had been considered impregnable) and Sis (ancient city). Toros extensively rebuilt the fortifications at both fortresses with tall circuit walls and massive round towers.\nByzantine conquest of Cilicia (1137)\nByzantium could not come to terms with the loss of Cilicia, so John Komnenos entered Cilicia Plain with a large army in the spring of 1137. Taking advantage of the numerical superiority, the Byzantines captured Tarsus, Adana, and Msis, and after a 37-day siege, Anabarza. Levon fortified himself with a small force in the fortress of Vahka, which fell after a heroic six-month defense. Eventually, John invited Leo to a meeting under a false promise of peace, where the prince was captured. Leo and two of his sons, Roupen and Thoros, were subsequently taken prisoner.Rubinian rule in Cilicia temporarily collapsed.\nStruggle of Thoros II\nThe captured Levon and his son Ruben died in prison. The other son of the Armenian prince, Toros, fled and, upon returning, led the liberation struggle of the Armenians of Cilicia. He was joined by his two brothers, Stepane and Mleh, who had escaped captivity.\nToros II began a struggle against the Byzantines with a small army. Within a few years, he liberated Vahka, Anabarza, Msis, and Tarson. Thus, the Armenians again managed to establish their power over most of Cilicia and restore the Rubinian rule. Further attempts by Byzantium to conquer Cilicia ended in failure.\nLiberation of Cilician Armenia\n}}\nBattle of Mamistra\n}}\nByzantine's treacherous move\nOther view is that after the battle Raynald was forced to return home, covered with humiliation; and later on, Thoros voluntarily surrendered to the brethren the fortresses in question, and the Knights in turn took oath \"to assist the Armenians on all occasions where they needed help.\"\nThe Armenians attacked the few remaining Byzantine fortresses in Cilicia.\nBattle of Tarsus (1165)\nThe 15,000-strong Byzantine troops transferred here from Cyprus approach the city in battle formation, facing the troops of the Armenian government of Cilicia led by Toros II  (about 10,000 strong). According to John Kinnamos's \"Brief History\", before the left attack, his army, by order of Andronikos, adopts a wedge-shaped formation typical of the Crusader orders. The Armenian side manages to bypass the Byzantine garrisons unnoticed and inflict a heavy defeat on the latter with unexpected flank attacks. Developing tactical successes, Toros II's troops pursue the Byzantines and completely destroy the retreating enemy garrisons.\nThere are conflicting opinions regarding the use of the \"pig's head\" formation by the Byzantines. Niketas Choniates, in his work \"History\", supplementing the idea of ​​Hovhannes Kinamos, notes that by this step the Byzantines were showing a contemptuous attitude towards the Cilician Armenian statehood. The primary source information that has reached us confirms that after the defeat, the mounted Andronicus, who had lost his troops, approached Toros unnoticed, then knocked the latter off his horse with a surprise attack. Having struck the Armenian prince from the back, Andronikos fled, leaving Thoros lying on the ground. However, thanks to his reliable armor and long shield, the Rubinian prince did not suffer any significant damage.\nDestruction of the last Byzantine strongholds\nToros II was succeeded by his brother Mleh (1169-1175). At the beginning of Mleh's rule, several eastern regions of Plain Cilicia were still in the hands of the Crusaders, and some western provinces were in the hands of Byzantium. In order to defend and further strengthen the country, it was necessary to liberate all the coastal regions from the Byzantines and the Crusaders. To implement this difficult task, Mleh, pursuing a new policy, allied himself with the Muslim emir of Aleppo. In this way, Mleh took back the most important fortresses in eastern Cilicia from the Crusaders, and then liberated Adana, Msis, and Tarsus, along with their coastal regions, from Byzantium. Armenian rule established its control over important trade routes. Mleh also tried to annex the Lambron fortress belonging to the Hetumids to his rule, but did not succeed. Prince Mleh improved the city of Sis and made it the capital of Cilician Armenia. His policies and reforms greatly contributed to the rise and strengthening of Cilician Armenia. However, the high-ranking clergy and princes, dissatisfied with Mleh's policies, organized a conspiracy and killed him.\nMleh was succeeded by Ruben, the son of his brother Stepane. Taking advantage of the hostility of Byzantium and the Sultanate of Iconium, Ruben captured the western regions of Cilicia, thanks to which the last strongholds of Byzantine rule in Cilicia were eliminated. The successes of Mleh and Ruben put an end to Byzantine ambitions over Cilicia.\nAftermath\nThe Armenian state of Cilicia created a standing army of 30,000. The authority of Thoros II greatly increased. One of his important undertakings was to move the Armenian Catholicosate to the fortress city of Rumkale, where it remained until Mamluk capture in 1292.\nThus, after more than a century of heroic and bloody struggle, the Armenians who settled in Cilicia created and strengthened the Armenian principality, preparing the ground for the latter to be proclaimed a kingdom.\nAfter losing Cilicia, Byxantine Empire and Cilician Armenia had no special relationship for long time. Relations resumed in the 14th century, along with the weakening of Cilician Armenia.\nNotes\nReferences"
