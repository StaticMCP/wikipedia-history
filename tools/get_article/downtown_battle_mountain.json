The album serves as a follow-up to the band's debut extended play, Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean, which was released in 2006. The title of the album was inspired by the unincorporated town Battle Mountain, Nevada after the band visited the city. The album was produced by Kris Crummett, who would go on to produce most of the band's future studio releases.\nThe album was supported by four singles; \"And I Told Them I Invented Times New Roman\", \"Lemon Meringue Tie\", \"The Backwards Pumpkin Song\", and \"Open Your Eyes and Look North\". It is the band's first of two studio albums to feature clean vocalist Jonny Craig. Craig left in late 2007, later re-joining in mid-2010. It is also the band's only full-length to feature guitarist Sean O'Sullivan, who left the band in late 2007. A non-direct sequel to the album, titled Downtown Battle Mountain II, was released on March 8, 2011.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Dance Gavin Dance\n*Jonny Craig – clean vocals\n*Jon Mess – unclean vocals\n*Will Swan – guitar\n*Sean O'Sullivan – guitar\n*Eric Lodge – bass guitar\n*Matt Mingus – drums, percussion\n;Additional personnel\n* Kris Crummett – production, engineering, mixing, mastering\n* Mattias Adolfsson – artwork\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! align=\"left\"| Chart (2007)\n! align=\"left\"| Peakposition\n|-\n| Billboard Top Heatseekers\n| align=\"center\"| 46\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
