Further reform came into effect in July 1855 for all parts of Lower Canada other than Montreal, Quebec City and Saint-Hyacinthe, which included provision for the creation of local councils for parishes and townships, the representation of towns and villages on county councils, and the formation of towns and villages by order in council upon the recommendation of the relevant county council. The municipal law of Lower Canada was consolidated into a single Act in 1860.\nFor more than a century localities changed little. The early 20th century saw the 2000–2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec, the large-scale amalgamation of smaller municipalities in Quebec into larger cities from 2000–2003 and the subsequent de-mergers in 2006, as well as reorganizations of Mont-Tremblant (2000), Chandler (2001), Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (2001) and Saint-Hyacinthe (2001).\nMunicipalities written in bold are on their
