He was also a war artist for the United States Army during World War I.\nBiography\nAylward was born September 5, 1875, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and developed an early interest in things nautical because his father built and owned Great Lakes ships. Much of the work from his early career reflects that influence. He studied art at the Art Institute of Chicago, at the Art Students' League in New York City. He later studied with several artists in Europe. Like some of the other future official World War I combat artists, he studied with the famous illustrator and teacher, Howard Pyle.\nAylward began his professional career by writing and illustrating 18th century marine history for magazines such as ''Harper's Monthly, The Century, and Scribner's''. His artwork also appeared in illustrated editions of Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas and Jack London's The Sea-Wolf. He combined his interest in the sea and his abilities as an illustrator to produce advertisements featuring nautical themes. In addition to his proficiency as an illustrator, Aylward was an award-winning artist and received a number of prestigious prizes such as the Salmagundi Club's Shaw Purchase Prize in 1911 and the Philadelphia Watercolor Club's Beck Prize in 1912, and the Salmagundi Prize for Illustration in 1914.\nDuring the war Aylward concentrated his efforts on recording the activities of the ports and transportation systems developed to support industrial warfare. Some of his best wartime work was done at the port of Marseilles after the armistice when he had the time to paint in some detail.\nFollowing the war, he exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1924 and the National Academy of Design in 1925.\nAylward returned to commercial illustration in the later half of the 1920s and owned a freelance studio in Hempstead, New York. He continued illustrating through the mid-1940s. He died February 26, 1956, and is buried in Bath National Cemetery, Bath, New York.\nWorld War I Paintings\nFile:US Army in World War I.jpg|World War I Doughboys and US Army trucks on the move.\nFile:Doughboy at the grave of a fallen comrade.jpg|World War I doughboy looking at the grave of a fallen comrade.\nFile:P 185, Baedeker Fibbed--Triumphal arch during the war.jpg\nMaritime Art\nFile:To the Local Population the Arrival of a Steamboat Is Always an Event.jpg|Steamboat At the Levee\nFile:The \"Chesapeake's\" Mizzen Top During the Battle.jpg|The \"Chesapeake\"\nFile:The Spirit of 1812.jpg|Spirit of 1812\nFile:This Was My Ocean, My Harbor, My World.jpg|My Ocean, My Harbor, My World\nSee also\n* United States Army Art Program\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
