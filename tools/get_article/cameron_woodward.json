He then spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons in the Premier League with Edinburgh Monarchs, his average rising to over 7. He returned to the Elite League with Eastbourne Eagles in 2006, and after rising through the team, in a spell when the team won the Elite League Knockout Cup in 2008 and the Elite Shield in 2009, was given the team captaincy in 2010, and has remained with the team since.\nIn 2008 and 2009 he also rode the Polish Ekstraliga for Stal Rzeszów, moving on to Miskolc in 2010. Since 2011 he rides for KMŻ Lublin.\nWoodward first won the Victoria State Championship in the 2005/6 season and won it again in 2007/8 and 2008/9. In 2012 he finished in 3rd place in the Australian National Championship.\nWoodward also competes in long track speedway, and took part in the World Championship in 2012, finishing in 6th place overall.\nHe also competes in grasstrack racing, and won the British Masters Championship in 2012.\nWoodward was the 2014 South Australian Champion, winning the title at Adelaide's Gillman Speedway on 7 December 2013.\nWoodward's 2014 season was ended by a broken femur sustained in a crash while riding in Poland in September. While it was anticipated that he would be fit for the start of the 2015 season, and after signing for Coventry Bees, Indianerna and Lokomotiv Daugavpils in January a check-up revealed that the break hadn't healed and a bone graft would be required, meaning that he would miss the early part of the season.\nChampionship record\n*Australian Championship: 3rd (2012)\n*Victoria State Championship: Won 2005/6, 2007/8, 2008/9\n*Australian Under-21 Championship: 2nd (2003), 3rd (2005)\nWorld Longtrack Championship\nGrand-Prix Series\n* 2012 - 6 apps (9th) 74pts\n* 2013 - 6 apps (6th) 90pts\n* 2014 - 3 apps (15th) 12pts\nBest results\n*  Rzeszow Second 2013\n*  Vechta Third 2012, 2013\nTeam Championship\n* 2013  Folkestone (5th) 25/36pts (Rode with Hunter Anderson, Rodney McDonald)\nBritish Masters Grasstrack Championship\n* 2012  Frittenden (Champion)\n* 2013  Wimborne (Champion)\nReferences"
