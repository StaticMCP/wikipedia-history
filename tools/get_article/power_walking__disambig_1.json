To qualify as power walking as opposed to jogging or running, at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times (see walking for a formal definition).\nHistory and technique\nIn 1999, the Berlin Marathon included a Power Walking division.\nPower walking is often confused with racewalking.\nPower walking techniques involve the following:\n* The walker must walk straight\n* The walker must walk doing an alternating movement of feet and arms\n* The walker must walk with one foot in permanent contact with the ground\n* The leading leg must be bent\n* Each advancing foot strike must be heel to toe at all times\n* The walker must walk not doing an exaggerated swivel to the hip\n* The arms spread completely from the elbows and these move back\nCompetitions and world records\nCompetitions are held for power walking competitions, with world records held in categories including 5&nbsp;km, 10&nbsp;km, half marathon, 30&nbsp;km, marathon, and multiday distances.\nHealth and fitness\nA 2021 study, where post coronary angioplasty patients were introduced power walking based on their ejection fraction, VO2 max calculation, heart rate monitoring and pedometer counts. Those participants in power walking groups benefited significantly on quality of life and various physiological parameters. A Vanderbilt University Medical Center study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in 2025 reported that 15 minutes of fast walking each day contributed to a range of health benefits.\nReferences\nSources\n* Reeves, Steve.
