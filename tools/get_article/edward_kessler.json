He went on to work in a family business, Kesslers International Group, for 7 years before returning to his academic studies, completing a PhD degree at the University of Cambridge in 1999.\nKessler, with Martin Forward, founded the Centre for the Study of Jewish-Christian Relations (CJCR) in 1998 and was elected Fellow of St Edmund's College in 2002. In 2006 The Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations (CMJR) and the Centre for Policy Public Education were established and the name of the organisation was changed to The Woolf Institute in 2010, and its focus was extended to the study of relationship between religion and society, with a focus on relations between Jews, Christians and Muslims.  It constructed its own building in 2017, located at Westminster College where the Institute is presently located.\nKessler launched an independent UK Commission in November 2022 on the Integration of Refugees. Lord Carlile was appointed Chair and Bishop Guli Francis-Dehqani Vice Chair for the first year and he took over in 2023. The Commission took evidence at hearings around the UK and published its report, [https://refugeeintegrationuk.com From Arrival to Integration] in March 2024.\nIn 2023 he was appointed [https://www.liberaljudaism.org/2023/07/appointment-of-chair-of-progressive-judaism-advisory-board/ Chair of the Advisory Board] overseeing the unification of Reform and Liberal Judaism.\nIn 2006, he was awarded the Sternberg Interfaith Award from philanthropist Sir Sigmund Sternberg \"in recognition of outstanding services in furthering relations between faiths\". In June 2007 The Times Higher Education newspaper described him as \"probably the most prolific interfaith figure in British academia\". In 2011 he was awarded an MBE awarded for services to interfaith relations Kessler has written or edited 13 books, including [https://www.cambridge.org/gb/universitypress/subjects/religion/judaism/introduction-jewish-christian-relations?format=PB An Introduction to Jewish-Christian Relations] (Cambridge, 2010) [https://scmpress.hymnsam.co.uk/books/9780334047155/jews-christians-and-muslims-in-encounter Jews, Christians and Muslims] (SCM, 2013) and [https://thehistorypress.co.uk/publication/jesus-pocket-giants/ Jesus] (The History Press, 2016).

In 2024, he was awarded the Seelisberg Prize for his contribution to fostering Jewish-Christian relations.\nKessler was Convenor and Vice-Chair for the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life (2013–15), a two-year initiative that examined the role of religion and belief in Britain. Its report, \"[https://www.woolf.cam.ac.uk/research/publications/reports/report-of-the-commission-on-religion-and-belief-in-british-public-life Living with Difference]\" made 37 recommendations and generated public controversy, particularly over faith schools. He was also Principal Investigator of the Woolf Diversity Study, a study of diversity in England and Wales (2017–19), which published a policy report entitled,  [https://www.woolf.cam.ac.uk/whats-on/news/how-we-get-along How We Get Along].\nMuch of his academic work has been examining scripture and exploring the significance for Jewish-Christian relations of sharing a sacred text.  He has identified a common exegetical tradition, especially in the formative centuries. More recently his writings have focussed on the encounter with Islam and contemporary relations between the three Abrahamic faiths and implications for fostering a vibrant and open society. Kessler proposes approaches for managing difference, which he argues is vital in forming a positive identity as well as sustaining communities. In his discussion on covenantal theology, he argues for the creation of ‘theological space’ in which people of faith can affirm one another without losing their particularities of faith.\nKessler also explores the tensions, positive as well as negative, between religion and civil society. At a lecture at the Brookings Institution in 2014, he argued that diplomats and policymakers need to be better trained in religion and belief, describing the contemporary religious landscape as a post-interfaith world.  In 2019, at The Council for Religious and Life Stance Communities in Oslo, he argued that because religious monopolies are in decline, Christianity can no longer be portrayed as the dominant ‘host’ religion in Europe and a previously intrinsic relationship is being weakened - belonging to a minority is the norm. In his 2024 address upon receiving the Seelisberg Prize at the University of Salzburg he called for a redoubling of efforts to pursue genuine dialogue at a time of increasing polarisation.\nAs well as teaching Cambridge University students, Kessler teaches at the Cambridge Theological Federation. In 2022, as visiting professor at the Irish School of Ecumenics, Trinity College, Dublin, he delivered a lecture on ways to sustain and  safeguard, [https://www.tcd.ie/trinitylongroomhub/whats-on/details/event.php?eventid=159529658 Jerusalem’s Holy Places]; in 2023, he delivered the [https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/891376745 Krister Stendahl] Memorial Lecture in Stockholm and discussed the importance of tackling the difficult issues in interfaith dialogue.\nBooks and edited volumes\n1989 – An English Jew: The Life and Writings of Claude Montefiore, London: Vallentine Mitchell, (2nd Edition, 2002 )\n2002 – Jews and Christians in Conversation: Crossing cultures and generations, eds., E.
