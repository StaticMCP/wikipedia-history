It was a member of the National Congress of State Games.  The games consisted of a number of competitions:\n*Summer Games (often referred to as the Empire State Games, typically held in late July)\n*Winter Games (often referred to as the Empire State Winter Games, typically held in February)\n*Games for the Physically Challenged (similar to the Paralympics)\n*Senior Games (specifically for athletes age 50 and older)\nIn 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 the Empire State Summer Games were cancelled.\nHistory\nEarly history\nOne of the original organizers of the Empire State Games was [https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/11/obituaries/herbert-mols.html Herbert Mols] of Buffalo, New York. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU__5V9RAcc0) The first Empire State Games took place at Syracuse University in 1978, the first state games to be held in the United States. The games remained in Syracuse until a delegation from Western New York led by Herb Mols, Bob Rich, Bob Bedell, Carl Roesch Sr., Dr. Marc Grosso, Gardner Debo, Mark Sternin and Ed Rutkowski brought the Games to Buffalo, New York in 1985 and 1986.\nWith the success of the first 1978 games, the Empire State Games have sparked the creation of other state games across the country. Before their cancellation, the Empire State Games were the largest state-supported amateur athletic competition in the nation.\nThe Empire State Games competition was a member of the National Congress of State Games, and was a recognized State Games Program of the United States Olympic Committee.\nCancellations\nThe 2008 Empire State Games took place from July 23 through July 27, 2008 in Binghamton. The 2009 Empire State Games were cancelled.  In 2010 the games were revived and held from July 21 through July 25, 2010 in Buffalo, New York.\nDue to a lack of state funding, the 2011 Summer games were discontinued on November 17, 2010.   The community of Lake Placid was able to save the winter games.\nAs for the Games for the Physically Challenged, they were able to be saved with the help of Nassau County Executive Edward P. Mangano and the partnership with dozens of private sector sponsors.  A second version of the Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged in Western NY continued at SUNY Brockport College with the aid of corporate sponsors and private funding from Camp Smile Inc., a local not-for-profit organization aligned with the Webster Lions Club and dedicated to providing services to children with disabilities.\nReturn of the games\nIn 2012 Empire State Sports Foundation (ESSF) was created with the specific goal of rejuvenating the Hugh L. Carey Empire State Games for amateur athletes of New York State. ESSF is a Rochester, New York-based not-for-profit public charity dedicated to the recognition and promotion of competitive excellence among New York State’s amateur athletes, as well as those attributes associated with sports: personal health, fitness, development, education, sportsmanship and teamwork.\nThe Empire State Summer Games were prepared to return in 2013, but as the ESSF were finding corporate partners, they discovered that corporate sponsors had \"been giving any extra funds to Hurricane Sandy relief, leaving little extra room for other worthy causes\". The Empire State Games are going to be re-launched in Rochester in the summer of 2014.\nUpon hearing that The Empire State Summer Games for 2013 was cancelled Nassau County announced that they will hold the 2013 Games for the Physically Challenged as they have done for the last two years. In an April 2013 press conference, Nassau County Executive Edward P. Mangano stated, \"The 2013 Games would not have been able to happen without the genius donation of $50,000 US dollars by NBTY, Inc. through their Helping Hands Charity.\" Known locally as the Nassau County Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged, the 2013 games took place May 30 through June 1.\nMeanwhile the Brockport Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged in Monroe County will be \"Celebrating 36 Years of Abilities\" in 2023 with continued private funding from Camp Smile Inc. and local corporate and community support.\nEnd of an era\nAccording to media reports April 2014, the Empire State Sports Foundation (ESSF), a Brighton, New York nonprofit organization whose aim to revive the popular Olympic-style summer sports event fueled hope among amateur athletes and media attention across the state, official announced its intention to disband. According to the official papers that were made public, filed in New York State Supreme Court, show that the foundation is insolvent, owing debts topping $158,000 to multiple creditors.\nRegions\nNew York State is divided into six regions for the Empire State Games, and each region fields its own athletic teams through tryouts before the games begin.\nRegions of the Empire State Games\n*Adirondack Region\n**Counties: Albany, Clinton, Columbia, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Montgomery, Saratoga, Schoharie, Schenectady, St. Lawrence, Rensselaer, Warren, Washington\n**Cities: Albany, Glens Falls, Plattsburgh, Schenectady, Troy\n**Uniform color: gold and blue\n*Central Region\n**Counties: Broome, Cayuga, Chemung, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego, Otsego, Schuyler, Tioga, Tompkins\n**Cities: Binghamton, Elmira, Ithaca, Oswego, Rome, Syracuse, Utica\n**Uniform color: light blue and navy blue\n*Hudson Valley Region\n**Counties: Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster,  Westchester\n**Cities:Yonkers, Mount Vernon, Middletown, Newburgh, Poughkeepsie, White Plains, New Rochelle\n**Uniform colors: kelly green and gold\n*Long Island Region\n**Counties: Nassau, Suffolk\n**Uniform colors: gray and red\n*New York City Region\n**Counties: Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island)\n**City: New York City\n**Uniform color: orange and royal blue\n*Western Region\n**Counties: Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Orleans, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Wyoming, Yates\n**Cities: Buffalo, Corning, Niagara Falls,  Rochester\n**Uniform color (1978-1994): maroon and white\n**Uniform color (1995-1996): navy blue and light blue\n**Uniform color (1996-2010): navy blue and red\nSummer Games\nThere are three divisions in the Summer Empire State Games: open, scholastic, and masters.
