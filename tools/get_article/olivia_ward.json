Ward competed on the purple team alongside her sister, Hannah Curlee, in which they became the final two together.\nEarly life and education\nShe was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She is the eldest of four siblings. Her family subsequently moved to Houston, Texas, where she attended Langham Creek High School though her junior year. She spent her senior year at, and graduated from, Baker High School in Mobile County, Alabama in 1994. Ward earned a degree in vocal performance from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa in 1998. She earned master's degrees in voice and in opera performance from the New England Conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts in 2002.\nCareer\nWard has worked as a manager at a plastic surgery office.\nThe Biggest Loser\nWard's motivation for being on The Biggest Loser was the fact that her weight, which had climbed to over 261 pounds, combined with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, meant she would likely never have children if she didn't lose a significant amount of weight. She felt her obesity was a reason she had not received many opera singing roles. Her teammate was her sister Hannah Curlee, who is three years younger than she. Ward won the Biggest Loser Season 11 on May 24, 2011 and Hannah placed second.\nOther\nAs of 2018, Ward is an Atlanta-based Senior Instructor at SoulCycle.\nAs of 2013, Ward operates a website called MyFitspiration.com.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://myfitspiration.com MyFitspiration.com]"
