It is not a fully-fledged diplomatic mission owing to the ongoing Taiwan dispute and One-China policy. However, it is the highest-level representation of the Taiwan authority in the United Kingdom. It manages cultural, economic and political cooperation between the UK and Taiwan, as well as offering consular services. Its counterpart body in Taiwan is the British Office Taipei.\nHistory\nThe Qing dynasty established an embassy to the United Kingdom, which was inherited by Republic of China. After the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, for a short time the UK continued to recognise the government of Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China, before switching recognition to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1950. Taiwan's office in London was first established in September 1963 as the Free Chinese Centre (). In 1992, it adopted its present name.\nOrganizational structure\n* Consular Division\n* Culture Division\n* Economic Division\n* Education Division\n* Financial Division\n* Overseas Compatriots Division\n* Press Division\n* Science and Technology Division\nRepresentatives\n* Eugene Chien (1993–1997)\n* Tzen Wen-hua\n* Tien Hung-mao (2002–2004)\n* Edgar Lin (2004–2007)\n* Katharine Chang (2007–2011)\n* Shen Lyu-shun (15 December 2011 to 31 March 2014)\n* Liu Chih-kung (July 2014 to 2016)\n* David Lin (July 2016 to July 2020)\n* Kelly Hsieh (since July 2020)\n*  (since January 2024)\nTransportation\nThe nearest station to the representative office is London Victoria station.\nBranch offices\n* Edinburgh\nConsular districts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
