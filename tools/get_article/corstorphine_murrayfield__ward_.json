Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it currently elects three Councillors.\nAs its name suggests, the ward's territory is based around the suburban communities of Corstorphine and Murrayfield in the west of the city, also including Balgreen, Broomhall, Carrick Knowe, Ravelston and Roseburn, Saughtonhall, with four large open areas comprising two golf courses, Edinburgh Zoo and the playing fields surrounding Murrayfield Stadium. A minor boundary change in 2017 saw the loss of the Forrester and West Coates neighbourhoods but the addition of Wester Broom and Orchard Brae South (between Roseburn Footpath and Stewart's Melville College) – there was a slight increase in the population, which in 2019 stood at 24,192.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Paul Edie(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Phil Wheeler(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Jeremy Balfour(Conservative)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Frank Ross(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Gillian Gloyer(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=1|Scott Douglas(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=2|Alan Christopher Beal(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Euan Robert Davidson(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2023 by-election\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Fiona Bennett(Liberal Democrats)\n|}\nElection results\n2023 by-election\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/corstorphinemurrayfield-ward-city-of-edinburgh#.YGRPnVPTVkw Listed Buildings in Corstorphine/Murrayfield Ward, City of Edinburgh] at British Listed Buildings"
