The war began with the Zand invasion of the Ottoman-controlled city of Basra, an important commercial center in the Persian Gulf.\nZand Iran Velayat of Ardalan\n| combatant2        =  Ottoman Empire (Pashalik of Baghdad)Southern Iraqi tribes (Al-Muntafiq)Local militias\n| commander1        = Karim Khan ZandSadeq Khan ZandKhosrow Khan\n| commander2        = Suleiman al-JaliliAbdul Hamid ITribal Sheikhs of Al-Muntafiq\n}}\nBackground\nIn the mid-18th century, the weakening of Ottoman authority in Iraq prompted Karim Khan Zand, ruler of Iran, to pursue territorial expansion into Mesopotamia. Basra was especially attractive due to its strategic and economic importance.\nThe War\nIn 1775, Zand forces launched an offensive into Ottoman Iraq, surrounding Basra and placing it under siege. The city fell to the Zands in 1776. However, tribal resistance, particularly from the Al-Muntafiq confederation, continued in the countryside. The tribes used guerrilla warfare to disrupt supply lines and undermine Zand control.\nIn 1779, after the death of Karim Khan Zand, political instability in Iran forced a withdrawal of Zand troops. Ottoman and local Iraqi forces quickly retook Basra, ending the occupation.\nAftermath\nThe war reinforced the military and political influence of Iraqi tribes in defending their territories. It was also one of the last major Iranian incursions into southern Iraq prior to the modern era. The conflict contributed to ongoing Ottoman–Persian rivalry in the region.\nSee also\n* Zand dynasty\n* Ottoman–Persian Wars\n* History of Basra\n* Al-Muntafiq\n* Iran–Iraq relations\nReferences\n* Perry, John R.
