It focusses on disinformation from the British government and questions the existence of democracy in the UK.\nThe Chapter: How the Lies were Told focusses on Operation Rockingham, which is described as a government effort to cherry pick data that would support the government's villainous characterization of Saddam Hussein, his ownership of weapons of mass destruction, and the justification for the war. The book reports that United Nations staff in Iraq constantly fed information to Operation Rockingham. The operation ignored vast quantities of data about the weaknesses of Iraqi troops, Iraqi compliance with international rules, and instead only presented information that justified the British government's pro-war stance. The cherry-picking approach was described to have been undertaken at the direction of the British government and led to the production of the infamous \"Dodgy Dossier\". Mackay credits Michael Meacher for his critique of Operation Rockingham and documents how the events damaged the reputation of Tony Blair.\nThe book also documents how the British government manipulated the press by planting poorly-substantiated stories in overseas newspapers, then encouraging UK press to report on the foreign reporting.\nThe book describes how Republican American efforts to push for the war made a military intervention a foregone conclusion.\nResearch\nNeil Mackay was supported by Scott Ritter in the production of the book.\nCritical reception\nThe book drew substantive praise from Ken Coates in his book Surging for Oil. Coats calls the book \"splendid\" several times and celebrates that Mackay has combined his years of reporting into a \"highly lethal single volume\".\nSee also\n* David Kelly (weapons expert)\nReferences"
