Slavery is largely ignored for most of the novel, save only for a brief discussion of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin in Chapter 12.\nPlot\nThe novel follows Eugene Buckingham, the only son of a South Carolina planter, as he crosses paths with Julia Tennyson, a Scottish American journalist who has written a number of pamphlets under various pseudonyms. What begins as mutual friendship eventually evolves into love, despite the anxieties of the opposing fathers. Col. Buckingham – Eugene's father and a (fictional) descendant of the Duke of Buckingham – contests the partnership on the grounds that Julia has written pamphlets degrading all planters as vicious sadists, even though he is not. Likewise Dr. Tennyson – Julia's father and a Scotsman – objects because he supports the view of all planters as violent and cruel.\nThe Tennysons eventually make their way to South Carolina from New York, and after several philosophical discussions regarding American slavery, Eugene and Julia are allowed to marry. The story ends as the newlyweds embark on a ship to England for their honeymoon.\nPublication\nThe novel was first published in 1852 in hardback form by D. Fanshaw of New York City.\nSee also\n*Anti-Tom literature\n*''Uncle Tom's Cabin''\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://utc.iath.virginia.edu/proslav/criswellhp.html text] at the University of Virginia"
