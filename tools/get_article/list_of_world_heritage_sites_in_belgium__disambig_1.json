Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. The Kingdom of Belgium accepted the convention on 24 July 1996, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list.\nBelgium has 16 sites inscribed on the list. The first sites to be added to the list were the Flemish Béguinages, the Grand-Place in Brussels and the lifts on the Canal du Centre, at the 22nd UNESCO session in 1998. The most recent inscription was the serial transnational site Funerary and memory sites of the First World War (Western Front), which is shared with France. The Sonian Forest, part of the 18-country site of the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe, is the only natural site in Belgium; the others are cultural sites, as determined by UNESCO's selection criteria. Belgium's five transnational sites also include the Belfries of Belgium and France, shared with France, the Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, shared with six other countries, the Colonies of Benevolence, shared with the Netherlands, and the Great Spa Towns of Europe, shared with six other countries. In addition, Belgium has 16 sites on its tentative list. Belgium has served on the World Heritage Committee twice.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nTransnational site|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Flemish Béguinages\n|\n| several sites\n| 1998\n| 855; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| Béguinages (French) or begijnhoven (Dutch) are collections of small buildings used by Beguines.

Most buildings were constructed after the end of the 17th century, following the Bombardment of Brussels by the French in 1695. The Town Hall from the 15th century was partially spared and represents a masterpiece of the Brabantine Gothic. Most buildings are in the Baroque style while the building housing the Brussels City Museum was restored in the 19th century in the neo-Gothic style.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#E0F0FF;\" | Belfries of Belgium and France\n|\n| several sites\n| 1999\n| 943bis; ii, iv (cultural)\n| This site comprises a total of 56 belfries, bell towers of civic buildings instead of churches, that were built between the 11th and 17th centuries in different architectural styles: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque.

After that, the building was converted into a museum.

While mining activities date back to at least the 17th century, the peak activity took place in the 19th and the second half of the 20th centuries when the mines were among the largest in Europe. Today, they are no longer operational. They preserve technical heritage of the industrial revolution related to mining and heavy industry. The mines were also a meeting point of different cultures, with workers coming from various European countries and Africa. The Bois du Cazier was the site of a major mining disaster in 1956.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#E0F0FF;\" | The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement\n|\n| Antwerp\n| 2016\n| 1321; i, ii, vi (cultural)\n| This transnational site (shared with Argentina, France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and India) encompasses 17 works of Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier.

To address the social issues, the Society of Benevolence was founded in 1818 and, under the supervision of Johannes van den Bosch, constructed seven agricultural colonies for families, orphans, beggars, and retired military personnel. This approach was innovative with the combination of education, healthcare and (forced) labour to ensure the self-sufficiency of the colonies.
