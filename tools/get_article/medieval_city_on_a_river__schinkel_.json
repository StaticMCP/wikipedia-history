After Napoleon's defeat in 1815 he was appointed the state architect of Prussia and was responsible for much of the redevelopment of Berlin city center.\nMedieval City on a River depicts an imaginary German landscape in which the sunlit gothic cathedral, framed by the rainbow, is the dominating feature, to which a procession of people dressed in medieval costume are making their way. Schinkel appears to be confirming the fundamental status of the Church as a vital institution in a resurgent Prussia after the years of oppression.\nSee also\n* 100 Great Paintings, 1980 BBC series\nReferences"
