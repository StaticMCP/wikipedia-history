Like its predecessors, it affiliated to the Austrian Trade Union Federation.  By 1998, it had 44,432 members.\nIn 2002, the union began sharing offices in Vienna with the Metal-Textile Union, and on 10 May 2006, the two unions merged, forming the Metal-Textile-Food Union. The Metal-Textile-Food Union has since merged with the Chemical Workers' Union to form PRO-GE.\nPresidents\n:1991: Leopold Simperl\n:2004: Rainer Wimmer\nReferences"
