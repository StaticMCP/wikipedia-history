It is the third film in the Deathstalker tetralogy.\nPlot summary\nThe film, which takes place in a fantasy setting, opens at a festival attended by Deathstalker and the wizard Nicias. The viewer learns that Deathstalker once saved the life of Nicias; since then, the two have traveled from village to village, obtaining money via the fortune-telling and magical abilities of Nicias. During the festival, a hooded woman arrives to see Nicias. She is actually the Princess Carissa, who possesses a magical stone. She hopes that Nicias has another stone, which, when united with her's, will at long last uncover the magical and rich city of Arandor of whom Nicias is the last of its descendants. Unfortunately, Nicias does not possess the second stone, but knows it is in a place called Southland, which is ruled by the evil sorcerer Troxartes. By coincidence, Troxartes has the second stone and wants the one in Carissa's possession so that he can harness its power and increase his rule over the land.\nThe festival is attacked by Troxartes's trusted lieutenant Makut and his cavalry, who are searching for the stone. Amid the slaughter and chaos, Nicias teleports away while the princess is saved from capture by Deathstalker. After escaping the raid, Carissa is mortally wounded by some marauding soldiers, but manages to pass her stone and knowledge of its use on to Deathstalker before succumbing to her injuries. He later travels to the hot and heavily wooded Southland where he meets the twin sister of Carissa, the petulant Princess Elizena, who was sent from the north to marry Troxartes. Meanwhile, Makut is searching for Deathstalker and manages to find him, so he hides in Elizena's tent. Unfortunately, his cover is blown when she realizes that he was threatening her with a twig instead of a knife. Deathstalker escapes into an impenetrable valley where he is given shelter by two wild women, Marinda and her mother. Marinda has sex with Deathstalker and then leads him to their horses so he can escape since Makut is surely still looking for him. The mother, outraged at Marinda's absence, leads Makut to the horses, but Deathstalker has already escaped. Learning that he is up against the formidable Deathstalker, Troxartes uses his power to awaken all the dead foes he has defeated (the titular \"Warriors from Hell\") to catch the 'legend'.\nElizena's guards are killed after Makut suspects them of aiding Deathstalker's escape. Some time later, she accidentally meets Deathstalker, who is bivouacking in the woods. In the morning she leaves but is found by Troxartes, who takes her back to his castle as his bride. Deathstalker trails them and infiltrates the castle by night, but is found by Troxartes himself, who asks for the stone. Deathstalker is then knocked unconscious, enabling Troxartes to take possession of his stone. Realizing there is actually a third stone needed to unlock its magic, Troxartes orders his mistress to torture Deathstalker for the knowledge, but he escapes and binds her to the wall of the dungeon. Meanwhile, in another part of the castle, Nicias's magic inadvertently teleports him to the castle, which now houses both stones. Troxartes jovially captures him and intends to put him in his army if his magic cannot find the third stone.\nIn the woods at night, Deathstalker reunites with Marinda and together they encounter a few of Troxartes's undead warriors near a campfire. Deathstalker recognizes Gragas amongst the group, whom he killed in a fair fight earlier. Gragas tells them that the undead are forced to do Troxartes's bidding because their souls are kept secure in jars in the castle. Deathstalker makes a deal to get the jars if they will help him against Troxartes. He also tells Marinda to alert the Northern Band to assist them in their planned invasion of Troxartes's castle. Back at the castle, Elizena learns she is being kept as a hostage until the third stone is found. She leads Deathstalker to where Nicias is being kept. They discover that the third stone has been hidden in the castle all along. The Northern Band arrives and the souls are released by Deathstalker; as a result, the undead warriors turn on Troxartes and his army. In the ensuing battle, Makut is killed by an arrow during a duel with Deathstalker; Troxartes kills Marinda, but is then killed by Deathstalker. The three stones are united at last, revealing the secret city of Arandor. Peace is restored to the land, and Deathstalker rides off into the sunset for further adventures.\nCast\n*John Allen Nelson as Deathstalker\n*Carla Herd as Carissa / Elizena\n*Terri Treas as Camisarde\n*Thom Christopher as Troxartas\n*Aarón Hernán as Nicias\n*Roger Cudney as Inaros\n*Agustín Salvat as Makut\n*Claudia Inchaurregui as Marinda\n*Mario Iván Martínez as Preacher\n*Carlos Romano as Gragas\n*Erika Carlsson as Khorsa\n*Alejandro Bracho as Dead Warrior\n*Lizetta Romo as Dead Warrior\n*Antonio Zubiaga as Soldier\n*Manuel Benítez as Soldier\nProduction\nThe movie borrows footage from The Raven for some of the exterior shots of Troxartes's castle turrets.\nReception\nInfluence\nThis movie appeared in the seventh season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 as episode #703. In the episode, Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot mock lead actor John Allen Nelson's inability to maintain a consistent accent throughout the film, as well as his character's irritating cockiness that causes them to root against him for most of the movie. They also ridicule Makut's helmet, which has enormous metal bat wings welded on each side. Thom Christopher's physical appearance and poor line delivery in the film also prove to be fodder for several jokes. At one point, Tom Servo comments that he cannot take an \"arch nemesis who's five-eight and bald\" seriously. The wizard Nicias prompts numerous jokes as well, primarily The Lord of the Rings comments that compare his appearance to Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast the Brown.  The film's lame attempt at a battle scene prompted Mike Nelson to say on two occasions, \"This movie is like playing Doom when there's no monsters or opponents\", and \"This is one of the most ambitiously bad movies we have ever done\".\nThe episode's stinger (following the end credits) is Marinda's mother angrily declaring \"Potatoes are what we eat!\"\nThe MST3K version of Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell was included as part of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XXXV DVD collection, released by Shout! Factory on March 29, 2016. The other episodes in the four-disc set include Teenage Caveman (episode #315), Being from Another Planet (episode #405), and 12 to the Moon (episode #524).\nSoundtrack\nThe movie's theme tune is a recycling of James Horner's theme for Roger Corman's Battle Beyond the Stars, which has been re-used by Corman himself for several of his films, including Space Raiders and Sorceress. The film also includes an excerpt of Brian Eno's \"Prophecy Theme\" from the soundtrack of the 1984 David Lynch version of Dune.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
