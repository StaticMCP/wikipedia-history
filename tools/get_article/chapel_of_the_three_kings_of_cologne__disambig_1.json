It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.\nThe Three Kings of Cologne refers to the Biblical Magi. The dedication is a reference to the Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne Cathedral, Germany. One of the windows shows the nativity of Jesus, which may have contributed to the naming of the Christmas Steps.\nThe chapel was built by John Foster in 1504. He was previously the local High Sheriff, mayor, and member of parliament for the city. The church serves as the chapel for Foster's Almshouses. The master of the almshouses was responsible for maintaining the chapel and appointing a priest.\nIt was refaced and roofed in 1861 by Foster and Wood, with further restoration in 1865 which included niches for the installation of carvings. The three current statues were designed by Ernest Pascoe and installed in the 1960s. On the gable above the statues is a small bellcote.\nCurrent use\nAs of 2007 the adjoining Foster's Almshouses have been remodeled into private residences, with the chapel available for the use of residents.\nSee also\n* Grade II* listed buildings in Bristol\n* List of churches in Bristol\nReferences"
