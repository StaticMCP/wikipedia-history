The area is home to several other embassies, including those of the United States, France, the Netherlands, and various other countries.\nHistory\nCounsellor of Commerce Karl Stockmann, owner of the Stockmann department store, purchased the plot where the current embassy stands in 1908. The site had previously housed Villa Rauhaniemi, which had been commissioned by Princess Zinaida Yusupova, a member of the Yusupov family, in 1844. Villa Rauhaniemi was later demolished, and Stockmann divided the property into three parts.\nThe embassy was built by businessman Severi Damsten on the former site of Villa Rauhaniemi. The embassy was designed by Jarl Eklund in 1918. Damsten lived in the building until he sold the villa to a private owner, before it eventually became property of the British government.\nArchitect Lars Sonck designed the neighboring Villa Baumgartner in 1913. The building represented the Art Nouveau style. The British Embassy purchased Villa Baumgartner in 1972, and soon afterward the villa was demolished. Its demolition caused a public scandal. The plot remained vacant until the early 1990s, when a modern embassy building, designed by architect Steven Quinlan, was constructed on the site.\nThe current Ambassador is Laura Davies.\nSee also\n* Embassy of Finland in London\n* Finland–United Kingdom relations\nReferences"
