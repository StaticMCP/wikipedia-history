It started when members of the Liberal Party, led by Eduardo Schaerer and former president Manuel Gondra revolted against the rule of Liberato Marcial Rojas, and against major Albino Jara. It ended when Albino Jara was ambushed and killed near Paraguarí, allowing Eduardo Schaerer to assume the role of the 25th President of Paraguay.\nMeredith Reid Sarkees and Frank Whelon Wayman maintain that the 1911 Paraguayan Civil War was symptomatic of a decades-long period of instability in Paraguay following the Paraguayan War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180422184434/https://www.portalguarani.com/1962_ana_montserrat_barreto_valinotti/20085_la_guerra_civil_del_centenario_1911_1912__por_ana_barreto_valinotti__ano_2013.html LA GUERRA CIVIL DEL CENTENARIO 1911-1912] (In Spanish)"
