He sat in the House for three years, before being elevated to the House of Lords upon his father's death. He is said to have been \"moderately active during his short period of membership, sitting on seven committees\".\nMonck was one of many members returned underage in the late seventeenth century, with around ten underage members in each of the Parliaments of 1690 and 1695, many aristocrats. In response to this, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1695 established 21 as the minimum age, although this was not reliably enforced. Until the Reform Act 1832, underage MPs were seldom unseated. For example, Charles James Fox became an MP aged 19 in 1768, and Robert Jocelyn, Viscount Jocelyn, became an MP aged 18 in 1806.\nBefore the general election of 2015, the youngest MP since the Reform Act 1832 was William Charles Wentworth-FitzWilliam, elected at Malton in the 1832 general election aged 20 and 11 months. His election, whilst theoretically illegal, was unchallenged; Malton was a pocket borough controlled by his family, and the matter was viewed as academic as he would be of full age by the time Parliament assembled.\nAfter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, the youngest MP elected was James Dickson, who was elected as a Liberal at a by-election for the Borough of Dungannon on 25 June 1880. He was born on 19 April 1859, and so was aged 21 years 67 days. The youngest female MP was Bernadette Devlin, elected on 17 April 1969 from Mid Ulster, aged 21 years 359 days. Until 1970, the minimum age to sit in parliament was 21. In 1970, the minimum age was lowered to 18. Both records are now jointly held by Mhairi Black, who was aged 20 years and 237 days old at the time of her election to the seat of Paisley and Renfrewshire South in the 2015 general election.\nOldest\nThe oldest serving MP whose exact dates are known was Samuel Young (1822–1918), who was MP for East Cavan from 1892 (when aged 70), until his death at the age of 96 years 63 days.\nOldest debuts\nPerhaps the oldest parliamentary debut of all time was that of Warren Lisle, believed born in 1695, who was elected on 7 September 1780 during that year's general election as MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis as locum tenens, aged reportedly 85. He stood down on 21 November to allow his kinsman, Gabriel Steward, to stand for the seat after completing his own term as mayor of the borough (when he had been the local returning officer). He died in July 1788 aged reportedly 93.\nThe oldest debut where a confirmed birth date is known was made by Sir Robert Pullar (born 18 February 1828) who was elected at an unopposed by-election for Perth on 12 February 1907 aged 78 years and 359 days. He retired at the January 1910 general election.\nThe oldest debut at a general election to the UK Parliament was possibly by Bernard Kelly (born 1808) who was elected MP for South Donegal in 1885 in the year of his 77th birthday. He died in office on 1 January 1887 aged 78.\nThe oldest woman at first entry to the Commons was Dr Ethel Bentham (born 5 January 1861) who was elected MP for Islington East at the 1929 general election aged 68 years and 145 days. She died in office, the first woman to do so, in 1931.\nJim Allister was the oldest MP first elected at the last general election, the 2024 general election, at age 71.\nDavid Hacking was the oldest hereditary peer elected to the House of Lords in a by-election, aged 83 in 2021. He had previously been in the House for 28 years before leaving in 1999.\nList of oldest sitting MPs since 1945\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Born\n!Became oldest MP\n!Left House\n!Age on leaving\n!Died\n!Political party\n!Highest office held\n|-\n|||6 May 1866||1945|||1950||83 ||24 April 1957||Liberal||\n|-\n|David Logan||22 November 1871||1950|||Feb 1964||92 |||25 February 1964||Labour||\n|-\n|Winston Churchill ||30 November 1874||Feb 1964||Sep 1964||89 ||24 January 1965||Conservative||Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n|-\n|Emanuel Shinwell||18 October 1884||Sep 1964||1970||85 ||8 May 1986||Labour||Minister of Defence\n|-\n|S.

On 30 August 2018, he surpassed the previous record set by Theodore Cooke Taylor (3 August 1850 – 19 October 1952), member for Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth from 1900 to 1918, who had lived to be 102 years and 77 days old. Atkins died aged 104 years and 200 days old. His record was surpassed on 3 January 2025 by Sir Patrick Duffy.\nOther ex-MPs who have reached their centenary are Nathaniel Micklem (1853–1954), Sir Harry Brittain (1873–1974), Sir George Ernest Schuster (1881–1982), Manny Shinwell (1884–1986), Edgar Granville (1898–1998), Jack Oldfield (1899–1999, who outlived his parliamentary service by 68 years), Hartley Shawcross (1902–2003), Bert Hazell (1907–2009), Michael Shaw (1920–2021) and Sir Patrick Duffy (born 1920, and the only centenarian former MP currently living).\nFrank James, who was elected MP for Walsall at the 1892 general election, but unseated on petition in November that year, died at 102 years and 135 days old; James's record was surpassed by Atkins on 27 October 2018.\nJill Knight (9 July 1923 – 6 April 2022) was the longest-lived female former MP, aged 98 years, 271 days.\nElizabeth Shields is the oldest living female former MP (born 27 February 1928, age ).\nStratton Mills (born 1 July 1932, age ), who was elected MP for Belfast North at the 1959 general election, is the earliest elected former MP still living. Mills was sworn in on 22 October.\nShortest-lived MPs\nOne known contender for this record for whom both birth and death dates are known, in the Parliament of England, was James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley, who while still a minor was MP for Callington in 1621–1622, and for Winchester from early in 1624 until his death from illness on military service in the Netherlands on 1 November 1624 aged 19 years and 251 days.\nBased only on evidence from his university entrance records, Peter Legh, MP for Newton from 1640, may have been aged 19 or younger when he died after a duel on 2 February 1642, but his precise birthdate is not known.\nGeoffrey Palmer, MP for Ludgershall from March 1660, died in office on 31 October 1661 aged 19 years and at least 245 days, based on his baptism registration (28 February 1642).\nAfter the setting of the youngest age of candidacy at 21, the youngest MP to die in office was George Charles Grey who was elected MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1941 and was killed in action on 30 July 1944 aged 25 years 240 days. Throughout this period he was the Baby of the House.\nThe shortest-lived female MP, Lady Cynthia Mosley, MP for Stoke 1929–1931, died in 1933 aged 34. The youngest female MP to die in office was Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen since 2015, who was murdered on 16 June 2016, 6 days before her 42nd birthday.\nPeriod of service\nLongest\nSir Francis Knollys (also the oldest ever sitting MP) was first elected as MP for Oxford in 1575 at the age of around 25 and was MP for Reading at the time of his death in 1648, a period spanning 73 years, although there were eight periods, amounting to 27 entire years (1590–1592, 1594–1596, 1599–1600, 1602–1603, 1605–1613, 1615–1619, 1627 and 1630–1639) in which the Parliament of England did not meet, and his period of service totalled little more than 23 years.\nThe longest span of service of an MP since the start of the 20th century was Winston Churchill who was first elected on 1 October 1900 and left the House of Commons on 25 September 1964, a period of 63 years 360 days. His service was not continuous, as he was not an MP for a spell in 1908 and between 1922 and 1924.\nCharles Pelham Villiers was the longest continuously serving MP. He was elected in 1835 and remained an MP continuously for over 62 years until his death on 16 January 1898, aged 96 years 13 days. Since the start of the 20th century, the longest continuous service by an MP has been 51 years 80 days by Edward Heath, who sat from 1950 to 2001.\nThe longest continuous service record for a female MP is held by Harriet Harman, first elected in October 1982. The longest total service record for a female MP is held by Dame Margaret Beckett, who served for 4 years and 7 months between 1974 and 1979 and was then re-elected in June 1983. Beckett also holds the record for the longest span of service for a woman. Both Harman and Beckett left the House of Commons on 30 May 2024.\nShortest\nThere are cases of MPs being elected posthumously; Edward Legge (1710–1747) was elected unopposed as MP for Portsmouth on 15 December 1747, four days before news arrived that he had died 87 days previously in the West Indies. In 1780 John Kirkman was elected as MP for the City of London despite dying before polls closed.\nIn more recent times, members have died after polling, but before the declaration of the results. In 1906, Thomas Higgins was declared elected for the seat of North Galway, even though he had died earlier that morning, after polling day. More recently, in 1945 Sir Edward Taswell Campbell at Bromley and Leslie Pym at Monmouth died after polling, but nine days before the declaration of the results. Both were declared elected posthumously, and both had been MPs for a number of years. Noel Skelton is another example in 1935.\nThe shortest non-posthumous service was that of Alfred Dobbs, who was declared elected MP for Smethwick on 26 July 1945 and was killed the following day in a car accident on the way to take his seat.\nThe shortest service for women MPs has been 92 days in the case of both Ruth Dalton, who was MP for Bishop Auckland from a by-election on 7 February 1929 to dissolution of Parliament on 10 May 1929 prior to that year's general election, and Margo MacDonald, who was MP for Glasgow Govan from a by-election on 8 November 1973 until the dissolution of Parliament on 8 February 1974 prior to the coming general election.\nShortest total service since 1900\nFor a comprehensive list of MPs since 1900 with less than 365 days total service see\n* List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service\nMembers who never took their seats\n* Pat Cullen 2024–\n* Dáire Hughes 2024–\n* Cathal Mallaghan 2024–\n* John Finucane 2019–\n* Órfhlaith Begley 2018–\n* Chris Hazzard 2017–\n* Elisha McCallion 2017–2019\n* Barry McElduff 2017–2018\n* Mickey Brady 2015–24\n* Francie Molloy 2013–24\n* Paul Maskey 2011–\n* Michelle Gildernew 2001–2015, 2017–24\n* Pat Doherty 2001–2017\n* Conor Murphy 2005–2015\n* Martin McGuinness 1997–2013\n* Gerry Adams 1983–1992, 1997–2011\n* Owen Carron 1981–1983\n* Bobby Sands 1981\n* Philip Clarke 1955\n* Tom Mitchell 1955\n* Alfred Dobbs 1945\n* Joseph Bell 1922\n* Harry Wrightson 1918–1919\n* 69 Sinn Féin Members elected at the 1918 general election (including 6 first elected in by-elections 1917–1918)\n* James Annand 1906\n* Thomas Higgins 1906\n* Henry Compton 1905–1906 (shortest serving MP – 46 days – whose tenure was not ended by his death)\n* Joseph Andrews 1905–1906\nNotes:\nMPs who never won an election\nOn rare occasions the election winner may be disqualified, either by an election court or by the House of Commons, and the seat awarded to the runner-up.\n:Malcolm St. Clair: Bristol South-East, 1961–1963\n:Charles Beattie: Mid-Ulster, 1955–1956\nMPs elected to two or more constituencies simultaneously\n* Charles Stewart Parnell: elected in 1880 General election for three separate seats – Cork City, Mayo and Meath.\n* Richard Hazleton: from 9 December 1910 until 23 February 1911, when he was unseated on a petition from the second seat, he was MP for North Galway and North Louth.\n* At the 1918 election, 4 Sinn Féin candidates were each elected to two seats: Arthur Griffith (Cavan East and Tyrone North West), Éamon de Valera (Clare East and Mayo East), Liam Mellows (Galway East and Meath North) and Eoin MacNeill (Londonderry City and National University of Ireland). However, none of them took their seat in the House of Commons, instead attending the First Dáil.\nMPs who have sat for three or more different constituencies\nIn modern times, it is unusual for an MP to represent more than one or two constituencies during their career, although before the 20th century it was quite common.

In the UK Parliament, William Vesey-FitzGerald, Lord Charles Beresford and Arthur Henderson were exceptional in achieving it on no fewer than four occasions each: Vesey-FitzGerald over a span of 18 years through three by-elections and one general election, Beresford over a span of 25 years after voluntarily resigning or retiring from the House at stages of his naval career, Henderson invariably at by-elections following serial general election defeats in other seats, in the shorter span of 14 years. A woman has never come back more than once.\nOf living MPs, George Galloway transferred to a different constituency and party in 2005 but did not have any period of absence from the Commons at that time. Having left Parliament in 2010 he made a comeback at a by-election in a third constituency in 2012, was defeated in 2015, then returned at a by-election for a fourth constituency in February 2024 before losing it in the general election the same year.\n:George Galloway: 2012 , 2024\n:William McCrea: 2000 , 2005\n:Michael Ancram: 1979, 1992\n:Fergus Montgomery: 1967 , October 1974\n:Tony Benn: 1963 , 1984\n:Arthur Palmer: 1952 , 1964\n:Alec Douglas-Home: 1950, 1963\n:Frank Soskice: 1950 , 1956\n:Richard Law: 1945 , 1951\n:Hyacinth Morgan: 1940, 1950\n:Frank Markham: 1935, 1951\n:Sir Herbert Williams: 1932 , 1950\n:Cahir Healy: 1931 , 1950\n:Harold Macmillan: 1931, 1945\n:Ian Fraser: 1931, 1940\n:Harcourt Johnstone: 1931, 1940\n:Cuthbert Headlam: 1931, 1940\n:Gwilym Lloyd George: 1929, 1951\n:Walter Ayles: 1929, 1945\n:Somerville Hastings: 1929, 1945\n:George Isaacs: 1929, 1939\n:William Jowitt: 1929, 1939\n:James Chuter Ede: 1929, 1935\n:Herbert Morrison: 1929, 1935\n:Robert Richards: 1929, 1935\n:Arthur Henderson Jr.: 1929, 1935\n:Benjamin Walter Gardner: 1929, 1934\n:Tom Smith: 1929, 1933\n:William Wedgwood Benn: 1928 , 1937\n:Manny Shinwell: 1928 , 1935\n:Austin Hudson: 1924, 1950\n:Walter Elliot: 1924, 1946\n:Edward Cadogan: 1924, 1940\n:Lord Erskine: 1924, 1940\n:Tom Johnston: 1924 , 1935\n:Andrew MacLaren: 1924, 1935\n:Alec Cunningham-Reid: 1924, 1932\n:Archibald Boyd-Carpenter: 1924, 1931\n:Sir Geoffrey Ellis: 1924, 1931\n:Arthur Evans, 1924, 1931\n:Park Goff, 1924, 1931\n:Vivian Henderson: 1924, 1931\n:George Hume: 1924, 1931\n:Frank Sanderson: 1924, 1931\n:Wilfred Sugden: 1924, 1931\n:Charles Lyle: 1923, 1940\n:Tom Kennedy: 1923, 1935\n:Thomas Ellis Naylor: 1923, 1935\n:Francis Dyke Acland: 1923, 1932\n:Walter Rea: 1923, 1931\n:John Edmund Mills: 1923, 1929\n:Walter Robert Smith: 1923, 1929\n:Henry Guest: 1922, 1937\n:Ramsay MacDonald: 1922, 1936\n:Charles Roden Buxton: 1922, 1929\n:Fred Jowett: 1922, 1929\n:Hastings Lees-Smith: 1922, 1924, 1935\n:John Edward Sutton: 1922 , 1923\n:Arthur Henderson, Sr.: 1919 , 1923 , 1924 , 1933\n:Edward Hemmerde: 1912 , 1922\n:Geoffrey Howard: 1911 , 1923\n:Charles Masterman: 1911 , 1923\n:Sir James Millar: 1911 , 1922, 1929\n:Sir Donald Maclean: December 1910, 1929\n:Edward Anthony Strauss: December 1910, 1927 , 1931\n:Sir Hamar Greenwood: December 1910, 1924\n:Frederick Guest: December 1910, 1923, 1931\n:Leif Jones: December 1910, 1923, 1929\n:William Mitchell-Thomson: December 1910, 1923\n:Arthur Griffith-Boscawen: December 1910, 1921\n:J.

the close of the 1628 parliament on 10 March 1629 when he served as MP for Penryn, Cornwall, until returning as MP for Richmond, Yorkshire on 9 April 1664\nNote that intervals of more than a decade between service in the Commons were more commonplace in the 17th than in later centuries due to factors such as:\n:-years when no parliaments were held, such as Charles I's rule without parliament covering 1630–39,\n:-Royalist MPs expelled during the English Civil Wars sitting again after the restoration of Charles II (1660),\n:-the Cavalier Parliament of 1661–79 which met without general elections in meantime.\n:-former Civil War and Commonwealth era Roundhead MPs returning to the Commons in the 1670s and 1680s under the Whig Party.\nSince the establishment of regular parliamentary government at the end of the 17th century and the creation of the United Kingdom Parliament in 1801, possibly the longest gap between sitting was faced by Henry Drummond (1786–1860), of nearly 35

They are also contenders for the record of couple with highest collective years of service in the Commons, totaling 66 years.\n'''Longest span of couple's service in the Commons'''\n* (Consecutive) – Noel Buxton, MP for Whitby from by-election in May 1905 to 1906, and for Norfolk North 1910 to 1918 and 1922 to 1930 when he was raised to peerage as Baron Noel-Buxton, following which his wife Lucy, Baroness Noel-Buxton served as MP for Norfolk North from 1930 to the 1931 general election, and for Norwich from 1945 to 1950, making a span of nearly 45 years.\n* (Concurrent) – Aneurin Bevan was MP for Ebbw Vale from 1929 (until his death in 1960), while his wife Jennie Lee, served from 1945 to 1970 as MP for Cannock, making a span of 41 years and 18 days. The latter had been MP for North Lanarkshire from 1929 to 1931, prior to their marriage in 1934.\nAlthough differing in that the husband's service preceded and outlasted the wife's, the Bevans' span has been surpassed by Sir Peter Bottomley who served in the Commons from 26 June 1975 to the 2024 general election, and his wife Virginia, who sat as MP for South West Surrey from by-election on 4 May 1984 to the 2005 general election – a period of .\nRepresentation of a constituency by a couple\nThe establishment of single-member seats by the 20th century as the norm for parliamentary constituencies means there have been no concurrent representations of a constituency by a couple but successive representations by one spouse after the other has died or relinquished the seat have been relatively commonplace in parliament.\nHemel Hempstead was represented the longest, for nearly 39 years, by John Davidson from a by-election in November 1920 until he was elevated to the House of Lords as Viscount Davidson in 1937, when the seat was represented by his wife Frances Davidson, Viscountess Davidson from the subsequent by-election until her retirement at the October 1959 general election.\nLouth, Lincolnshire was represented for the shortest time, a total of 4 years and 3 months, by Thomas Wintringham from June 1920 to his death in August 1921, then by his widow, Margaret, from the by-election in September 1921 to the general election in October 1924.\nCouples who served separately as MPs before marriage but not together after\n* Campbell Stephen, MP for Glasgow Camlachie 1922–1931 and 1935 to his death in 1947, who married in 1945 Dorothy Jewson, who had been MP for Norwich in 1923–1924.\n* Nigel Fisher, MP for Hitchin 1950–1955 and Surbiton 1955–1983, who married in 1956 Patricia Ford who had been MP for North Down 1953–1955.\n* Jim Sillars, MP for South Ayrshire 1970–1979 and Glasgow Govan 1988–1992, who married in 1981 Margo MacDonald who had been MP for Glasgow Govan in 1973–1974\n* Sir Alan Beith, MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed 1973–2015, who married in 2001 Diana Maddock, who had been MP for Christchurch 1993–1997.\nCouples who married serving as MPs\n* Andrew MacKay, MP for Birmingham Stechford 1977–1979, East Berkshire 1983–1997 and Bracknell 1997–2010, who married in August 1997, Julie Kirkbride, MP for Bromsgrove 1997–2010, when both had been returned in the general election in May 1997.\n* Frank Doran, MP for Aberdeen South 1987–1992, Aberdeen Central 1997–2005, and Aberdeen North 2005–2015, who married in 2010 Dame Joan Ruddock, MP for Lewisham Deptford 1987–2015.\n* Duncan Hames, MP for Chippenham 2010–2015, who married in 2011 Jo Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire 2005–2015 and 2017–2019.\n* Nick Raynsford, MP for Fulham 1983–1987, Greenwich 1992–1997 and Greenwich & Woolwich 1997–2015, who married in 2012 Alison Seabeck, MP for Plymouth Devonport 2005–2010 and Plymouth Moor View 2010–2015.\n* Nick Smith, MP for Blaenau Gwent since 2010 who married in 2012 Jenny Chapman was MP for Darlington 2010–2019.\n* Mark Lancaster, MP for North East Milton Keynes 2005–2010 and Milton Keynes North 2010–2019, who married in 2014 Caroline Dinenage, MP for Gosport since 2010.\n* Jack Lopresti, MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke 2010–2024, who married in 2017 Andrea Jenkyns, MP for Morley and Outwood 2015–2024.\n*Philip Davies, MP for Shipley 2005–2024, who married in 2020 Esther McVey, MP for Wirral West 2010–2015 and for Tatton since 2017\nCouples who divorced before one partner became an MP\n* Shirley Summerskill, MP for Halifax 1964–1983, who divorced in 1971 from her husband John Ryman, who later became MP for Blyth 1974–1983, and Blyth Valley 1983–1987.\n* Ron Davies, MP for Caerphilly 1983–2001, who divorced in 1999 from his wife Christina Rees, who later became MP for Neath 2015–2024.\nCouples who divorced when one partner had ceased to be an MP\n*John Dunwoody, MP for Falmouth and Camborne 1966–1970, and Gwyneth Dunwoody, MP for Exeter 1966–1970 and Crewe 1974–1983 and Crewe and Nantwich 1983–2008, who divorced in 1975.\n*Andrew Griffiths, MP for Burton 2010-2019, and Kate Kniveton, MP for the same seat 2019–2024, whose divorce finalised following her election.\n*Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover 2010–2019, and Natalie Elphicke, MP for same seat 2019–2024, who divorced in 2021.\nCouples who divorced while both partners served as MPs\n*Gordon Prentice, MP for Pendle 1992–2010 and Bridget Prentice, MP for Lewisham East 1992–2010, who divorced in 2000.

(They sat together for same two-member seat, Gatton.)\nBrother sets of MPs\nLargest set\nSix brother sets:\n* Francis Seymour-Conway, Viscount Beauchamp (later 2nd Marquess of Hertford) served 1766–1794; Lord George Seymour-Conway 1784–1790 and 1796–1801; Henry-Seymour-Conway (later Lord Henry Seymour) 1766–1784; Lord Robert Seymour 1771–1790 and 1794–1820; Lord William Seymour 1783–1784 and 1785–1796; and Lord Hugh Seymour 1784–1786 and 1788 to his death in 1801. All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n* Henry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey) served 1790–1804 and 1806–1810; Arthur Paget 1794–1807; Berkeley Paget 1807–1826; Sir Charles Paget 1804–1826 and 1831–1833 and 1833–1834; Sir Edward Paget, 1796–1806 and 1810–1820; and William Paget 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\nLongest span of service in the Commons by brothers\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when Sir Henry Knollys was elected MP for Reading, until the death in 1648 of his brother Sir Francis Knollys (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers Sir Robert Peel (also twice prime minister), William Yates Peel, Jonathan Peel and Edmund Peel, with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for Cashel, to the retirement of Jonathan at the 1868 general election as MP for Huntingdon. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831–1832 and 1835–1837 for Newcastle-under-Lyme. Another 59-year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and Henry Cecil Lowther, from the former's election as MP for Cockermouth in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for Westmorland (which he had represented since 1812) and Father of the House on 4 December 1867.\nThomas Hyde Villiers and his brother Charles Pelham Villiers (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in 1835. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\nRepresentation of same constituency by brothers\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis.\nTwo brothers successively represented North Derbyshire for a total span of nearly 48 years.
