The battle ended in a crushing Maratha victory, decisively asserting Maratha supremacy in northern India and humiliating the Rajput confederacy.\nBackground\nDuring the late 18th century, the Maratha Empire under Mahadji Shinde expanded into northern India. The Rajput kingdoms of Jaipur and Jodhpur attempted to resist Maratha dominance, refusing to pay tribute and rallying their forces into a confederacy. Mahadji Scindia, determined to reassert Maratha authority, marched north with his modernized army trained under the French officer Benoît de Boigne.\nThe Battle\nOn 20 June 1790, the two armies clashed near Patan.\n* The Rajput confederacy fielded more than 40,000 troops, vastly outnumbering the Marathas.\n* The Maratha army, though smaller (around 20,000), included De Boigne’s disciplined European-style infantry and powerful field artillery.\nDe Boigne arranged the Maratha line with strong infantry squares and artillery barrages that shattered the Rajput cavalry charges. The Rajput forces fought with traditional valor, but their disorganized tactics could not withstand the disciplined firepower of Scindia’s modern army.\nBy the end of the day, the Rajput army was routed, suffering thousands of casualties. Jaipur and Jodhpur’s prestige was severely damaged, and their troops fled in disorder.\nAftermath\nThe victory at Patan was a landmark in Indian military history:\n* Jaipur and Jodhpur were forced to submit to Maratha suzerainty and pay heavy tribute.\n* The defeated Rajput rulers had to acknowledge Scindia’s supremacy and agreed to pay **chauth** (a quarter of their revenues) to the Marathas as the price of their survival.\n* The Rajput states lost their independence in external affairs, effectively becoming vassals of the Marathas.\n* The battle demonstrated the superiority of European-trained infantry and artillery over traditional Rajput cavalry.\n* Rajput pride was deeply humiliated, as their ancestral martial prestige was shattered on the battlefield by a smaller but disciplined Maratha army.\nFor Mahadji Scindia, Patan confirmed his position as the paramount power in northern India. For the Rajputs, it marked a decline in political influence until the rise of the British.\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Patan is remembered as one of the greatest triumphs of the Marathas in Rajasthan. It not only secured their dominance over the Rajput states but also symbolized the transformation of Indian warfare through European military techniques.\nWhile Rajput chronicles recall it as a bitter defeat, Maratha records celebrate it as a moment of glory, where a disciplined, modern army humiliated the traditional feudal hosts of Rajasthan.\nSee also\n* Battle of Lalsot (1787)\n* Maratha Empire\n* Mahadaji Shinde\n* Benoît de Boigne\nReferences\n* Jadunath Sarkar, A New History of the Marathas, Vol. III.\n* Tony Jaques, Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A Guide to 8,500 Battles from Antiquity through the Twenty-First Century.\n* Rima Hooja, A History of Rajasthan.\nReferences"
