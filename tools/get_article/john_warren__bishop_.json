He was educated in Bury St Edmunds and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1751.\nIn 1773, he was vicar of the Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wisbech.\nBefore his promotion to bishop, Warren was Archdeacon of Worcester.  During the bishop's time at Bangor, he was involved in two major controversies. In October 1793, he became involved in a dispute with the Parys and Mona Mine companies over the demolition and rebuilding of Amlwch parish church. The bishop claimed that the mining companies had promised to rebuild the church; they denied this, but eventually agreed to make a financial contribution.\nIn 1796, the bishop was involved in another dispute, which resulted in a court case.  Warren had appointed his own nephew Registrar of the diocese of Bangor, even though the latter was under age. When the bishop attempted to sack the Deputy Registrar, Samuel Grindley, Grindley refused to leave his office, and a tussle ensued in which the bishop was threatened with a pistol and had to be dragged away by his wife.\nNotes"
