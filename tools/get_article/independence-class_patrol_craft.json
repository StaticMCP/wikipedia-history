A SGD $30 million contract was signed in June 1968 with Vosper Thornycroft by then-Permanent Secretary of the Defence and Interior Ministry, George Edwin Bogaars, for six gun-armed patrol craft for the Maritime Command (MC), which was the predecessor of the current Republic of Singapore Navy.\nThe first vessel was built by Vosper in Portchester, Portsmouth, United Kingdom while the remainder were constructed at the Vosper Thorneycroft Uniteers (VTU) Singapore yard in Tanjong Rhu. All patrol craft were commissioned by January 1972 and were decommissioned by the early 1990s.\nDesign\nThese patrol craft were based on Vosper's 110&nbsp;ft design and came in two classes.\nThe \"A class\" were fitted with a 40 mm Bofors gun forward and a 20 mm Oerlikon gun aft, both capable of engaging air and surface targets.\nThe \"B class\" were fitted with a 76.2 mm Bofors gun forward, which had a surface and shore bombardment capability, and a 20 mm Oerlikon gun at the aft.\nShips of class\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!
