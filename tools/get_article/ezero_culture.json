      "text": "# Ezero culture\n\nThe Ezero culture, 3300&mdash;2700 BC, was a Bronze Age archaeological culture occupying most of present-day Bulgaria. It takes its name from the Tell-settlement of Ezero.\nEzero follows the copper age cultures of the area (Karanovo VI culture, Gumelniţa culture, Kodzadjemen culture, and Varna culture), after a settlement hiatus in Northern Bulgaria. It bears some relationship to the earlier Cernavodă III culture  to the north. Some settlements were fortified.\nThe Ezero culture is interpreted  as part of a larger Balkan-Danubian early Bronze Age complex, a horizon reaching from Troy Id-IIc into Central Europe, encompassing the Baden of the Carpathian Basin and the Coţofeni culture of Romania. According to Hermann Parzinger, there are also typological connections to Poliochne IIa-b and Sitagroi IV.\nEconomy\nAgriculture is in evidence, along with domestic livestock. There is evidence of grape cultivation. Metallurgy was practiced.\nInterpretation\nWithin the context of the Kurgan hypothesis, it would represent a fusion of native \"Old European culture\" and intrusive \"Kurgan culture\" elements. It could also represent an Anatolian-influenced culture, either coming from Anatolia (in Renfrew's hypothesis), or heading to Asia Minor.\nGenetics\nHaplogroups\nGenetic studies have shown that the Ezero culture had a male haplogroup R1b. Among the female haplogroups were J2a1, T, U5a1, T2d2, W.\nAutosomal DNA\nGenetically the Ezero culture was of local Neolithic origin mainly, also had a contribution from WSH, but this contribution was of varying degrees in the Ezero samples.\nNotes\nSources\n* G.Il.
