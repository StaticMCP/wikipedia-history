      "text": "# List of explosives used during World War II\n\nAlmost all the common explosives listed here were mixtures of several common components:\n* Ammonium picrate\n* TNT (Trinitrotoluene)\n* PETN (Pentaerythritol tetranitrate)\n* RDX\n* Powdered aluminium.\nThis is only a partial list; there were many others. Many of these compositions are now obsolete and only encountered in legacy munitions and unexploded ordnance.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !! Composition !! Notes\n|-\n| Amatol||Ammonium nitrate and TNT || Extensively used in bombs, shells, depth charges and naval mines\n|-\n| Baronal||Barium nitrate, TNT and powdered aluminium ||\n|-\n| Baratol||Barium nitrate and TNT ||Used in British hand grenades.  Also used as the low velocity explosive lens in the implosion type nuclear weapon, Fat Man\n|-\n| Composition A||88.3% RDX and 11.7% plasticizer ||\n|-\n| Composition B||RDX, TNT and wax || Used as the high velocity explosive lens in the implosion type nuclear weapon, Fat Man\n|-\n| Composition H6||45% RDX, 30% TNT, 20% powdered aluminium and 5% wax ||Replaced Torpex for use in naval applications.\n|-\n|DBX (Depth Bomb Explosive)||21% RDX, 21% ammonium nitrate, 40% TNT, 18% powdered aluminium ||An alternative for Torpex, that used less of the strategic material RDX\n|-\n| Minol||40% TNT, 40% ammonium nitrate and 20% powdered aluminium (Minol-2) ||Developed by the British Royal Navy and used in torpedoes, depth charges and naval mines. Unsuitable for shells because of a risk of detonation if subjected to very high accelerations.\n|-\n| Octol||75% HMX (cyclotetramethylene-tetranitramine) and 25% TNT ||Still in use\n|-\n| Pentolites||50% PETN and 50% TNT ||\n|-\n| Picratol||52% ammonium picrate and 48% TNT ||Used in armour-piercing shells and bombs as insensitive to shock\n|-\n| PIPE||81% PETN and 19% oil ||\n|-\n| PTX-1||30% RDX, 50% tetryl and 20% TNT ||\n|-\n| PTX-2||41-44% RDX, 26-28% PETN and 28-33% TNT ||\n|-\n| PVA-4||90% RDX, 8% PVA and 2% dibutyl phthalate ||\n|-\n| RIPE||85% RDX and 15% oil ||\n|-\n| Tetrytols||70% Tetryl and 30% TNT ||\n|-\n| Torpex||42% RDX, 40% TNT and 18% powdered aluminium ||Developed for use in torpedoes, it was especially effective at producing destructive, underwater explosions.\n|-\n| Trialen||RDX, TNT and powdered aluminium ||Used by the Luftwaffe. There were variety of versions with different proportions of the component chemicals.\n|-\n|Explosive “D”\n|Ammonium picrate || US Army/Navy\n|-\n|Type 91 Explosive\n|Trinitroanisol (TNA) || Japanese Army/Navy\n|}\nTwo nuclear explosives, containing mixtures of uranium and plutonium, respectively, were also used at the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nSee also\n*List of Japanese World War II explosives\n*Explosive material\n*Little Boy\n*Fat Man"
