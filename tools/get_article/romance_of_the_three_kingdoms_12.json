The game was released for the PC in 2012 in Japan and Taiwan and on December 13, 2012 for the Wii U and PlayStation 3 in Japan. The game is released in Japanese and Traditional Chinese. Additional scenarios can be unlocked throughout the game.\nReception\nSangokushi 12 has had a mixed to poor review ever since it was launched in 2012. Complaints include the lack of naval warfare, lack of unit types, and the overall gameplay. Though overall cities have been replaced by detailed maps with buildings you can place, the elaborate 3D duels throughout Sangokushi 11 have been downgraded to a video.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sangokushi/ Japan Gamecity RTK12 page]\n* [http://www.gamecity.com.tw/sangokushi/12/ Taiwan Gamecity RTK12 page]"
