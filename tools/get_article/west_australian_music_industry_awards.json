WAM first received project funding from the state government in 1989, and in the early 1990s the word rock was dropped from the title to give the organisation scope to take on a broader constituency.\nIn 1994 the inaugural Kiss My WAMi Original Contemporary Music Festival was held. Other programs that have been undertaken include the Act of Youth series of all-ages shows, the WA Song Contest (now WAM Song of the Year), Women in Rock and an annual CD compilation of Western Australian musical artists (the first, \"The Western Front\", was undertaken in 1992 and included for example The Pink Fluffy Bunnies, Allegiance and Storytime.)\nThe first Western Australian Music Industry Awards occurred in 2001.\nHall of Fame Awards\nThe Hall of Fame recognises those members of the industry who have made an outstanding contribution to Western Australian contemporary music over their career. Various WAM awards of similar focus acknowledged this before the official WAM Hall of Fame awards came into being in 2004.\nThe following is an amalgamation of people who had been previously recognised through various WAM awards since 1985 and were inducted into the WAM Hall of Fame.\nGolden Rock Award\n*\n*\n*\nGolden WAMi for Contribution to the Industry\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nRock 'n' Roll of Renown\n*\n*\n*\nKiss My WAMi Award for Contribution to the Industry\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nHall of Fame\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nAwards\n2001\nThe 2001 WAMi Awards commenced with an opening party on 13 September 2001 and a closing party at the Globe Theatre on 16 September 2001.\n* Most Popular Local Original Recorded Release -
