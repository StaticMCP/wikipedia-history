It covers specialist associations, charities, professional organisations, regulators and support groups. At the end there is a list of historic nursing organisations. This list is based on the British Library UK Web Archive Nursing Collection, created in collaboration with the Royal College of Nursing History of Nursing Forum.\nThis list does not include any of the 80+ providers of nursing education courses, these can be searched via UCAS. Neither does it include NHS nursing departments or directorates.\nDental nurses, nursery nurses and veterinary nurses are not regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and are therefore not included in this list.\nA-E\n* Alliance of Senior Kerala Nurses (ASKeN) (c.2015-)\n* Anaemia Nurse Specialist Association (ANSA)\n* Association of British Paediatric Nurses (ABPN) (1938-)\n*
