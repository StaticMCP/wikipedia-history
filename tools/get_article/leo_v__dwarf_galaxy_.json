The galaxy is located at a distance of about 180&nbsp;kpc from the Sun and moves away from the Sun with the velocity of about 173&nbsp;km/s. It is classified as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) meaning that it has an approximately spherical shape with the half-light radius of about 130&nbsp;pc.\nLeo V is one of the smallest and faintest satellites of the Milky Way—its integrated luminosity is about 10,000 times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about ), and the half-light radius of 40&nbsp;pc.|name=n1|group=note}} which is much lower than the luminosity of a typical globular cluster. However, its mass is about 330 thousand solar masses, which means that Leo's V mass to light ratio is around 75. A relatively high mass to light ratio implies that Leo V is dominated by dark matter. The stellar population of Leo V consists mainly of old stars formed more than 12 billion years ago. The metallicity of these stars is also very low at , which means that they contain 100 times less heavy elements than the Sun.\nThe galaxy is located only 3 degrees away from another Milky Way satellite, Leo IV. The latter is also closer to the Sun by 20&nbsp;kpc. These two galaxies may be physically associated with each other. There is evidence that they are connected by a star bridge.\nNotes\nReferences"
