Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (II) (1847 - 1905). Biala is a branch of Peshischa Hasidism, as R. Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (II) was the great-grandson of R. Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (\"the Yid HaKadosh\") (1766 - 1813), the first Peshischa Rebbe. The dynasty was originally spread throughout many towns in Poland, often taking the names of said towns.

The Yid HaKadosh established the Peshischa school of Hasidic thought based out of Przysucha, Poland. He preached a rationalistic and talmudic-centric approach to Hasidism which stood in contrast to the kabbalistic and miracle based court of Lublin.
