Her father, Jonathan M. Clark, was a Vermonter of English descent, who, born in 1812, of Revolutionary parentage, inherited an intense American patriotism. Her mother, Mary Turch Clark, of German and French ancestry, was born and bred on the banks of the Hudson River. Both were persons of more than ordinary education and, though burdened with the cares of a family of one son and seven daughters, were life-long students. Caroline was the oldest daughter.\nShe attended the district school in a log house till seventeen years of age. To that was added one year of study in German in a private school. At the age of eight years, she was considered quite a prodigy in her studies.\nCareer\nAt the age of seventeen she began to teach. After two years of study in the Milwaukee high school under John G. McKidley, a teacher and organizer of educational work, she taught in the public schools of that city.\nIn Mequon, May 15, 1861, she married William Wallace Woodward (1828–1915).

She was identified with the same work in Nebraska as she was in Milwaukee.

In 1884, she was elected treasurer of the Nebraska W.C.T.U., and in 1887, vice-president-at-large of the State. In 1887, she was appointed organizer for the National W.C.T.U., and was twice reappointed. In the Atlanta convention, she was elected associate superintendent of the department of work among railroad employees. She was a member of each national convention of the W.C.T.U. since and including the memorable St. Louis convention of 1884. She was a friend of Frances Willard and a member of the Board of Trustees of the Woman's Temperance Temple in Chicago.\nShe was a delegate to the National Prohibition Party Convention of 1888, held in Indianapolis.
