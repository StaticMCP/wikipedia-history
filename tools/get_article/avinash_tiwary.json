Tiwary underwent major physical transformation for the role and received critical acclaim for the film. Devesh Sharma from Filmfare noted, \"Avinash shares sparkling chemistry with Tripti, and has acted like a force of nature in the film. You can only see Majnu near the end and not the actor.\" He later signed a three-film deal with Balaji Motion Pictures in 2019.\nIn 2020, Tiwary starred in two Netflix horror films. He first played Dhruv in Ghost Stories opposite Mrunal Thakur. The film received negative reviews from critics. Tiwary then played Satya, a wealthy law graduate in Bulbbul, alongside Tripti Dimri.

Based on true event, he played Chandan, a lower-caste truck driver, part of the Ashok Mahto gang.

Times of India's Archika Khurana praised Tiwary and Thakur's chemistry.\nTiwary appeared in two crime thriller series in 2023.

Both these series proved crucial for Tiwary and earned him recognition.\nIn 2024, Tiwary played Ayush, one of the three friends stuck in Goa, in Kunal Khemu's directorial debut, the comedy film Madgaon Express. Mayur Sanap from Rediff.com noted, \"Avinash Tiwary takes a little while to warm up to his role, but when he finally gets there, it works really well\".
