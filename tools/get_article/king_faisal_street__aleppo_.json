Located to the northwest of the Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square connecting the Aleppo Public Park with Al-Sabil Park. The street ends up with Shihan Square to the north of the city centre.\nHistory\nKing Faisal street was founded in 1919, to connect al-Jamiliyah district at the city centre with al-Sabil park, through the Syriac district. It was named in the honour of Faisal I the king of Syria.\nIn 1964, the Saint Matilda Melkite Greek church was opened on the street. Later in 1994, Al-Rahman mosque was built on the street, adjacent to al-Sabil park.\nThe street served as a highway until 2008 when the separating green row of trees was removed and the street was turned to a single-way avenue.\nGallery\nFile:King Faisal street Aleppo 1950.jpg|King Faisal street in 1950\nFile:Saint Matilda Church, Aleppo (2).jpg|Saint Matilda church\nFile:Rahman mosque.jpg|Al-Rahman mosque on Faisal street\nReferences"
