In 2013, there were submissions from 22 such film schools. It was opened to film schools outside of Los Angeles for the first time in 2014. BAFTA currently invites submissions from over 800 schools worldwide. In 2023, BAFTA received submissions from 103 schools spanning 30 different countries.\nOnly one award was presented at the ceremony until the addition of the Special Jury Prize in 2013. In 2017 the Student Film Award was split into three separate awards for three different categories of film: Animation, Live Action, and Documentary. In 2021, the competition was expanded with the addition of two new awards to recognise games and immersive experiences.\nThe animation award was sponsored in 2017 and 2018 by animation studio Laika.\nAward Categories\nFilm\n* BAFTA Student Film Award for Animation (since 2017)\n* BAFTA Student Film Award for Live Action (since 2017)\n* BAFTA Student Film Award for Documentary (since 2017)\n* Special Jury Prize (since 2013)\nProject\n* BAFTA Student Award for Games (since 2021)\n* BAFTA Student Award for Immersive (since 2021)\nRetired awards\n* Best Short Film (2004)\n* BAFTA Los Angeles Student Film Award (2005–2016)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bafta.org/los-angeles/events-initiatives/supporting-talent/student-film-awards BAFTA Official site] Retrieved 12 March 2019\n*[https://www.bafta.org/programmes/yugo-bafta-student-awards YUGO BAFTA Student Awards official site]"
