An orphan from a wealthy Italian family in Florence and raised in a convent since infancy, Catherine is sent by her uncle, Pope Clement VII, as a potential bride for Henri, the second son of King Francis I of France. Though considered plain and undesirable by the royal family, shrewd Catherine takes the negotiation into her own hands and convinces Francis to accept her. Catherine is smitten with Henri and assumes her feelings are reciprocated. They are married, and Catherine meets her distant cousin Diane de Poitiers, who gives her advice on how to handle Henri on their wedding night. The marriage is consummated, but afterward, Henri is upset and sends Catherine away. Looking for answers, she arrives at his chambers to find him in bed with Diane. In the present, Catherine conveys to Rahima that the lesson learned was to trust no one, and the Queen has her dragged away to the dungeon.\n|LineColor       = 284C5B\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.183\n|ShortSummary    = In the present, Catherine chooses Rahima as her new maid, and continues with her story. Young Catherine is desperate to conceive a child to secure her place in court, especially because of the unpaid dowry and her having a vision foreboding the death of her uncle, the Pope. Diane plots to be rid of Catherine and tries to get Catherine's servants to betray her. Thanks to Diane's machinations Henri avoids Catherine's bed-chamber, and in desperation, she tries to get a stable hand to impregnate her. Soon after, emboldened by the king, Henri visits Catherine's bed-chamber to perform his duty. Catherine and Henri bond over their mutual dislike of the Dauphin, Henri's cruel older brother. Recognizing that King Francis and his guest, the powerful Sultan Suleiman, both have an enemy in the Holy Roman Emperor, Catherine puts in motion an alliance between them for which Henri is credited. In the present, after deducing Rahima is being harassed by another servant girl, Nathalie, the Queen encourages Rahima to stand up for herself and gives her a small sachet of gunpowder. She hides it in Nathalie's bread dough and as Rahima scurries away, the kitchen explodes behind her.\n|LineColor       = 284C5B\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.234\n|ShortSummary    = Nathalie has lost an eye, and Catherine appears just in time to save Rahima from punishment. Catherine's widowed daughter-in-law Mary, Queen of Scots, vows to prevent Catherine's son Charles's coronation. In the past, Young Catherine swoons over Henri's wartime letters but is distressed when he returns with his Italian mistress Filippa Duci and infant daughter Diane. Diane de Poitiers intimidates Filippa to the point that she flees with her baby and offers to assist Catherine in conceiving to secure both their futures. Henri's military success in Italy wins him his father's favor, and the king expresses his admiration to Catherine for engineering the alliance. Charles de Bourbon suggests that Francois assassinate Catherine to eliminate France's distracting ties to Italy, and Catherine is ambushed in the forest, but she manages to escape. Catherine seeks help getting pregnant from Ruggeri, who cites a future price to be paid and hands her a book on potions. Francois collapses while playing tennis and dies of heart failure. The King becomes vehement in the belief that the Dauphin was poisoned. Ruggeri's book is found in Sebastio's room, and Catherine tearfully allows her atelier's arrest to save herself.

A messenger delivers the severed head of a Valois envoy from the Holy Roman Emperor. In the present, Catherine receives a written message that troubles her.

Catherine recalls that Henri named her regent while he was away fighting the Holy Roman Emperor. The Bourbons and the Guises try to manipulate Catherine to their own ends, but she outmaneuvers them and appeals to the Protestant faction for both financial and military aid. Angelica warns Diane that too much of the gold solution can drive her insane, but Diane insists on increasing the dosage. Diane pleads with Henri to forgo the battle, and though he returns to court victorious, he fears he is seen as weak and under Diane's control. Catherine suggests to Henri that he find Montmorency and bring him back to court. Protestant Pierre Marques lashes out with a warning that the self-indulgent ruling class will soon be overthrown by the commoners and an incensed Diane slashes his throat. Henry is impressed by Catherine's astute and effective regency. In the present, Rahima searches Mary's rooms at Catherine's request, looking for more correspondence between Mary and Queen Elizabeth I.

Wanting to be rid of Diane once and for all, Catherine finally locates Ruggeri and recounts her dream of Diane's and Henri's deaths. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Spain, attends the nuptials. Believing that sacrificing Henri is worth neutralizing Diane's influence, Catherine encourages him to joust. She changes her mind at the last minute, but Henri proceeds and is mortally wounded.

Holy Roman Emperor Charles V attends Henri's funeral and admits to Catherine his plans to provoke Mary’s zeal to make her bring about France's destruction. An edict criminalizing Protestantism goes into effect, resulting in the expulsion of the Bourbons and rampant executions. Catherine finds Montmorency at a clandestine Protestant service and implores him to reason with Francis II.

The Guises seek to install a recovering Montmorency as a puppet regent to appease the people, whereas Catherine goads Mary into requesting the regency for herself. Francis II, dying of consumption, emotionally rejects Mary's request but approves Catherine's regency, which Montmorency forces Antoine to sign at gunpoint. Louis is pardoned in the nick of time as Catherine's regency is proclaimed. In the present, Rahima steals a letter from Elizabeth I to Mary that Catherine has intercepted. Realizing it is a forgery, she hands it over to a trusting Mary, demanding a title and land from Catherine for her loyalty. In the false letter, Elizabeth I promises Mary to help her secure the French throne, and as Catherine intended, Mary returns to Scotland only to realize the fabrication. At the 1561 coronation of 11-year-old Charles IX, Catherine crowns her son herself.\n|LineColor       = 284C5B\n}}\n}}\nSeason 2 (2024)\n|country=U.S.A. |viewers= |episodes=\n|Viewers         =\n|ShortSummary    = Ten years later, in 1572, Charles IX is an adult but still defers to Catherine for governance.

Assuming no one survived the fire the Bourbons demand retribution from Francois for the church's destruction, convinced that he's responsible. Francois strangles his male lover for his betrayal and destroys the letters his mother had taken. To avoid conflict, Catherine strikes a deal with both the Bourbons and Guises — the Bourbons can start trade negotiations with protestant England and in return, they will drop the case against the Guises; the Guises and the other Catholic nobles will finance the construction of a new palace that Catherine plans to build in Paris in exchange for Francois's pardon. Catherine visits Diane de Poitiers and asks her to contribute to the palace and in return promises to rescind the law preventing her daughters from inheriting her estate.

To garner her favor, Angelica informs Catherine about Matisse's predicament and she makes Ruggeri suggest Aabis poison Edith to save Matisse. However, Angelica is rejected by Catherine and therefore she strikes a deal with the Bourbons. Louis de Bourbon reaches England and meets with Queen Elizabeth to hash out the trade deal. She convinces him to collude with her to usurp the Valois and supplant his house on the French throne.

The Catholic league gives Francois an ultimatum to either marry Princess Margot and assume the throne or see his brother get executed.

Before Elizabeth abruptly leaves the next day she has a brief confrontation with Catherine and leaves with her evidence of the Bourbons' treachery. The Bourbons evade capture and join Edith formally, and on Angelica's reference, Catherine catches Rahima and Alessandro planning on betraying her. Montmorency baptizes into Protestantism in exchange for Edith meeting the king.\nCatherine finds Ruggeri and he perceives that she has six betrayers around her—Montmorency, the Guises, the Bourbons, Rahima, Alessandro, and an unknown sixth person, who is implied to be one of her children.

Catherine informs Cardinal Guise that the king is dying, and after finding out the Catholic League's plans, she artfully reconciles with Anjou. Charles and Catherine meet Edith.
