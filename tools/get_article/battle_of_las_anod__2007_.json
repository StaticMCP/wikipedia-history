The ensuing battle resulted in Somaliland ousting the Puntland army from the city.\nOverview\nLas Anod had until then been controlled by Puntland, who took control of the regional capital in 2002.\nSomaliland had however been aiding local clan militias opposed to Puntland presence in the city. The clan militias were loyal to Ahmed Abdi Habsade, a former Puntland minister who later on defected to Somaliland.\nBattle\nIn October 2007, the conflict mushroomed into a regional conflict over control of the city of Las Anod, as Somaliland regular army forces mobilized from their base in the town of Adhicadeeye, west of the city, and entered the conflict. Puntland was slow to mobilize a counter-attack, as Puntland's weak economy and overstretched military obligations in Mogadishu prevented a rapid response. After assuming control of the city on 15 October, Somaliland moved Sool's regional administration into Las Anod. Between 10 and 20 people were reported to be dead.\nSee also\n* 2023 Las Anod conflict\n* Battle of Tukaraq\n* 2010 Ayn Clashes\nReferences"
