In the 1950 general elections, its candidate Óscar Osorio won the presidential elections, whilst the party won 38 of the 52 seats in the Constitutional Assembly. It was the only party to contest the 1952 and 1954 legislative elections. In the 1956 presidential elections several opposition candidates were barred from standing by the Central Elections Council, allowing its candidate, José María Lemus, to win with over 95% of the vote. In the legislative elections that year it again won all 54 seats, despite facing opposition from the National Action Party.\nThe party won the 1958 legislative elections unopposed, and again won all 54 seats in the 1960 elections despite the NAP running again.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
