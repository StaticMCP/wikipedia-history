The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.\nThe Cuban nominee is selected annually by the Cuban Film Institute, the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos (ICAIC).\nAs of 2025, Cuba was nominated only once for Strawberry and Chocolate (1993), a gay-themed comedy.\nSubmissions\nEvery year, each country is invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to submit its best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nCuba's first submission was directed by Miguel Littin, a leftist Chilean director who was nominated in this category twice, representing Mexico in 1975/76 (for Letters from Marusia) and Nicaragua in 1982/83 (for Alsino and the Condor). He also represented his native Chile in 2009.\nAll films were produced in Spanish.\nThe following is a list of the films submitted by Cuba in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Academy Awards.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
