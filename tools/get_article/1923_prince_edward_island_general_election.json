Stewart gained many seats to defeat the incumbent government of Liberal Premier John Howatt Bell.\nThis election had a number of firsts for PEI. It was the first election in which women on the Island could vote, following legislation passed in 1921.\nIt also featured the first organized third party in a PEI election, when local members of the Progressive Party ran four candidates in three Prince County districts and collected just over 2% of the vote.\nParty Standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1919\n!Elected\n!Change\n!#\n!%\n!Change\n|\n|James D.

This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assemblymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
