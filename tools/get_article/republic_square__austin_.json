Located in Downtown Austin, the park features a grassy area meant for festivals and events as well as shaded areas under live oak trees. The SFC Farmers' Market meets at the square every Saturday morning.\nHistory\nOriginally called \"Hamilton Square\", Republic Square was one of four public squares laid out in the 1839 Waller Plan of Austin by Edwin Waller. The square functioned as a normal urban park up until the mid-twentieth century when it served as a parking lot. The neighborhood surrounding the park became significant for its Mexican American residents throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. During the United States Bicentennial, the city of Austin transformed the square to its former glory, and was later revitalized again in 2017. Despite many physical changes, the historic heritage Auction Oaks survived and remain a centerpiece to the square till this day.\nTransportation hub\nRepublic Square also functions as a downtown hub for the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus system, CapMetro Bus. Austin's central bus-rapid transit system, CapMetro Rapid Lines 801 and 803 share a stop next to the square (Fourth Street/Guadalupe Street for southbound buses and Fourth Street/Lavaca Street for northbound). Republic Square station provides transit travelers the option to transfer to local lines, as well as Route 20 to Austin–Bergstrom International Airport. Republic Square was also a proposed stop for the Project Connect's Downtown Transit Tunnel, however, as of June 1, 2023, Republic Square is no longer a planned route on at least the light rail in the scaled back plans.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
