Sometimes classified in the family Emberizidae, more recent studies have shown it to belong in the tanager family.\nIt is endemic to the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador.\nThis species is closely related to the green warbler-finch, and were formerly considered conspecific, but both species differed in appearance, distribution, habitat, and song.  The nominate subspecies is from Pinta and Marchena, becki from Darwin and Wolf, mentalis from Genovesa, bifasciata from Santa Fé, cinerascens from Española, luteola from San Cristóbal, and ridgwayi from Floreana. Grey warbler-finches are found mostly in the shrubland and dry forest of smaller drier islands, and have a suitable coloration for their habitat.\nIts natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.\nReferences\n*"
