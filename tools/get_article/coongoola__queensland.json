In the , Coongoola had a population of 16 people.\nGeography\nThe Mitchell Highway enters the locality from the north (Wyandra) and exits to the south (Cunnamulla).\nThe Warrego River enters the locality from the north (Wynandra) and exits to the south-west (Cunnamulla). It is an intermittent braided river that contributes to the Murray Darling river system.\nThe land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe Western railway line opened to Cunnamulla in October 1898. It passed through Coongoola with the locality served by (from north to south):\n* Mirrabooka railway station ()\n* Offham railway station ()\n* Coongoola railway station ()\n* Kubill railway station ()\n* Nardoo railway station ()\nIn September 1922, Coongoola was visited by many scientific teams as well as the public because it was particularly well-located to view the solar eclipse as it had the longest period of totality of the eclipse and, being a quiet place, had nothing to interfere with the viewing. However, its lack of facilities was noted:\"Coongoola itself consists of a very small galvanized-iron railway station, and a small galvanized-iron hotel.  Nothing else is in view except the Longlands homestead, over 2 miles back along the rails.  Living accommodation of a homely character would be provided by Mrs. Kruck, landlady of the hotel, if reasonable notice is given.  There are several bedrooms, and other rooms which can be temporarily converted.  Altogether, arrangements can be made for 20 to 30 guests.\"A special train service was provided from Charleville to Coongoola for those wishing to view the eclipse.\nOn the day of the eclipse, the weather conditions at Coongoola were ideal for people to view and photograph the eclipse and to record scientific observations.\nCoongoola Provisional School opened on 22 June 1925. It became Coongoola State School in 1930. It closed on 2 April 1931.\nThe railway line to Cunnamulla ceased operation in 1994.\nDemographics\nIn the , Coongoola had a population of 10 people.\nIn the , Coongoola had a population of 16 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Coongoola. The nearest government primary schools are Cunnamulla State School in neighbouring Cunnamulla to south and Wyandra State School in neighbouring Wyandra to the north. The nearest government secondary school is Cunnamulla State School (to Year 12). However, some students in Coongoola may be too distant to attend these schools; the alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
