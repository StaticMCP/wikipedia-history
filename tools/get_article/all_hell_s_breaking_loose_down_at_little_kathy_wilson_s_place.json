The song \"Kathy Wilson\" was inspired by the 1953 sci-fi film Invaders From Mars, and features lines from the film voiced by Blaze Bayley.\nMany of the songs would become firm fan favourites during Wolfbane's tour in support of Iron Maiden (a band that Blaze Bayley would later join in 1994 but leave 5 years later).\nThe cover artwork was by Simon Piasecki Maxted.\nTrack listing\n# \"Steel\" - 4:57\n# \"Paint the Town Red\" - 3:06\n# \"Loco\" - 3:19\n# \"Hey Babe\" - 4:42\n# \"Totally Nude\" - 3:18\n# \"Kathy Wilson\" - 3:47\nPersonnel\n*Blaze Bayley: Vocals\n*Jason Edwards: Guitar\n*Jeff Hately: Bass\n*Steve Danger: Drums\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
