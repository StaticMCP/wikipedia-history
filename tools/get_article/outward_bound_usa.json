      "text": "# Outward Bound USA\n\nOutward Bound USA (OBUSA) is a non-profit organization providing experiential education in the United States through a network of regional schools, especially in wilderness settings. Outward Bound counts among its desired outcomes the development of self-awareness, self-confidence, leadership skills, environmental and social responsibility.\nHistory\nLike other Outward Bound International member organizations, Outward Bound USA's course offerings are derived from the work of German educator Kurt Hahn and his Outward Bound schools founded by Lawrence Holt in the United Kingdom in 1941.  The first course in the United States was run in 1961 for the Peace Corps, which it helped to shape.\nOutward Bound schools\n* Chesapeake Bay Outward Bound School\n* Colorado Outward Bound School\n* Hurricane Island Outward Bound School\n* North Carolina Outward Bound School\n* Northwest Outward Bound School\n* Outward Bound California\n* Philadelphia Outward Bound School\n* Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center\n* Voyageur Outward Bound School\n* New York City Outward Bound Schools\nOutward Bound courses\nOBUSA offers a range of courses targeted at different ages and interests.
