On 89 acres a large variety of flora and fauna of the Valdivian temperate forest ecoregion can be seen, as well as important historical and cultural landmarks of Temuco. Its main entrance is along Avenida Arturo Prat (one of the main Temuco streets) and is seven blocks away from the main square Plaza de Armas. Because of its natural landscape and several viewpoints, the monument is one of the main tourist areas of the city. Cultural events are usually held at the top of the monument.\nThe Southern Andean Volcano Observatory is located at the hill, due to its good outlook on several volcanoes including Llaima volcano.\nNatural Monument\nThe hill was originally named \"National Tourism Park Cerro Ñielol\". The Society of the Friends of the tree (founded by Luis Picasso Vallebuona) purchased the lands of the hill to reforest and protect it. Later it was reclassified as the National Park Natural Monument by Supreme Decree No. 617 of the Ministry of National Assets on December 3, 1987. Nowadays it is a protected area administrated by the Chilean state. It can be visited by car or foot all year round.\nReferences"
