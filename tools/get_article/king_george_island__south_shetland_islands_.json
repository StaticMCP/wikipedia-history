The island was named after King George III.\nGeography\nKing George Island has three major bays, Maxwell Bay, Admiralty Bay, and King George Bay. Admiralty Bay contains three fjords, and is protected as an Antarctic Specially Managed Area under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.\nThe Fildes Peninsula,  long, forms the southwest extremity of the island. It was named from association with nearby Fildes Strait by the UK-APC in 1960.\nHistory\nChilean scientists claim that Amerinds visited the area, citing stone artifacts recovered from bottom-sampling operations in Admiralty Bay; however, the artifacts—two arrowheads—were later found to have been planted.\nThe island was first claimed for Britain on 16 October 1819, formally annexed by Britain as part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies in 1908, and now as part of the separate British Antarctic Territory.  The island was claimed by Chile in 1940 as part of the Chilean Antarctic Territory.  It was also claimed by Argentina in 1943, and now as part of Argentine Antarctica, called by the Argentines Isla Veinticinco de Mayo (25 May) in honour of their National Day.  The US and Russia do not recognize any Antarctic claim, but have formally reserved their right to claim Antarctic territories for themselves.\nThe island was discovered and named by the British explorer William Smith in 1819, who named it after the then King, George III. It is approximately  long and  wide with a land area of . Over 90% of the island's surface is permanently glaciated. In 1821, 11 men of the sealing vessel Lord Melville survived the winter on the island, the first men to do so in Antarctica.\nChile (like Argentina and the United Kingdom) regards all of the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands as part of that country's territory; however, the terms of the Antarctic Treaty allow Chile to colonize the Fildes Peninsula without overtly pursuing its territorial claims.\nEcology\nThe coastal areas of the island are home to a comparatively diverse selection of animal life, including elephant, Weddell, and leopard seals, and Adelie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins. Several other seabirds, including skuas and southern giant petrel, nest on this island during the summer months.\nIn 1971, Denis C. Lindsay published Vegetation of the South Shetland Islands, and in doing so was the first professional botanist to outline the flora of King George Island. Only two vascular plants are known to grow on the island - Antarctic hair grass and Antarctic pearlwort. The flora is otherwise dominated by lichens and mosses. Ryszard Ochyra reports in his 1998 publication that there are 61 distinct species of moss found on the island, which is considered rich for the latitude. This makes King George Island  \"one of the most muscologically diverse areas in the Antarctic\".\nHuman activity\n]]\nSettlements\nHuman habitation of King George Island is limited to research stations belonging to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, South Korea, Peru, Poland, Russia, Uruguay, and the United States. Most of these stations are permanently staffed, carrying out research in areas as diverse as biology, ecology, geology, and palaeontology.\nand Russian Bellingshausen (on the right)]]\nBase Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva, the Chilean Station on the Fildes Peninsula, is operated as a permanent village with an airstrip (with large hangar and control tower along with other buildings), cafeterias for personnel of its several agencies there, a bank, a post office and comfortable ranch-style family homes with children. The Chinese Great Wall base features an indoor multipurpose room which serves as a full-size basketball court.\nIn 2004, a Russian Orthodox church, Trinity Church, was opened on the island near Russia's Bellingshausen Station. The church, one of the southernmost in the world and one of the few permanent structures in Antarctica, is permanently staffed by a priest. The first attempted murder in Antarctica occurred on the island in 2018 at Bellingshausen Station.\nPoint Thomas lighthouse at Arctowski Station is the most southerly lighthouse of the world.\nNOAA runs Lenie Base, a seasonal research station for penguin studies on Admiralty Bay. This small station, dubbed Copacabana, operates in the Antarctic summer only, but is used as a survival hut in the winter.\nTourism\nIn October 2013, American heavy metal band Metallica announced that it would perform a concert sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company at Carlini Station heliport. The concert took place on 8 December 2013.\nA small amount of specialised tourist activity also takes place during summer, including an annual marathon, known as the Antarctic marathon.\nClimate\nThe Antarctic Peninsula and its nearby islands are considered to have the mildest living conditions in Antarctica. The island's climate is strongly influenced by the surrounding ocean. Under the Köppen system, it is one of the few locations in Antarctica classified as a tundra climate rather than an ice cap climate. Variation in temperatures are small, with the coldest month, July, averaging  and  in the warmest month. With only 591.3 hours of sunshine per year, the weather is often unsettled and cloudy throughout the year, with precipitation in the form of snow, rain, and drizzle occurring often. On average, 729&nbsp;mm of precipitation falls per year.\n|date=October 2012\n}}\nSee also\n* Artigas Base\n* Bolinder Bluff\n* Cockscomb Hill\n* Comandante Ferraz Brazilian Antarctic Base\n* Composite Antarctic Gazetteer\n* Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station\n* Islands of Chile\n* List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands\n* Mersey Spit\n* Plaza Point\n* SCAR\n* Sherratt Bay\n* South Shetland Islands\n* Stwosz Icefall\n* Subantarctic\n* Territorial claims in Antarctica\n* Warszawa Dome\n* Wawel Hill (Antarctica)\n* Wesele Cove\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Alan Gurney (1998).
