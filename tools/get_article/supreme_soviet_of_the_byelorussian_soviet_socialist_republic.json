Verkhovnyy Sovet Belorusskoy SSR) was the highest organ of state power of Belarus (Byelorussia), then known as the Byelorussian SSR from 1938 to 1991. It was the only branch of government in the republic, and per the principle of unified power, all state organs are subservient to it. The Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR was preceded by the All-Byelorussian Central Executive Committee (1920-1938) and the All-Byelorussian Congress of Soviets (1919-1937). The Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR was briefly disbanded in 1941 due to the Great Patriotic War and was re-established in 1947. The Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR was briefly succeeded by the Supreme Council of Belarus from 1991 to 1996. The Supreme Council of Belarus was succeeded by the National Assembly of Belarus in 1996.\nUntil Gorbachev's democratization program, the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR was a rubber stamp like all other supreme soviets of the union republics of the Soviet Union, existing only to provide legal sanction for policies already implemented by the Communist Party of Byelorussia. The 1990 Belarusian Supreme Soviet election was the only supreme soviet election where opposition parties were able to run.\nHistory\nThe Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR was established pursuant to the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR from 1937, which changed the organization of main political organs of the republic. In theory, the Supreme Soviet's powers were unlimited per unified power. However, in practice, the Supreme Soviet's powers were curtailed by the Communist Party of Byelorussia.\nSupreme Soviet elections were held in 1938, 1947, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990. In 1990, 360 deputies were elected.\nChairmen of the Supreme Soviet\nThe Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was speaker of the legislative assembly. With the disbandment of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR in May 1990, the powers of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet were transferred to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. This changed the role and powers of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet from 1990 and onwards. The office-holders remained speakers of the assembly and additionally became the de jure heads of state.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Picture\n! width=\"150\" |Name\n! width=\"150\" |Took office\n! width=\"150\" |Left office\n! width=\"150\" |Political party\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |Chairmen of the Supreme Soviet\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |1\n|\n|Nadezhda Grekova\n(1910-2001)\n|25 July 1938\n|12 March 1947\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |2\n|\n|Vasily Kozlov\n(1903-1967)\n|12 March 1947\n|17 March 1948\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |3\n|\n|Eugene Bugaev\n(1912-1997)\n|17 March 1948\n|14 April 1949\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |4\n|\n|Joseph Belsky\n(1903-1966)\n|14 April 1949\n|28 March 1955\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |5\n|\n|Timofey Garbunov\n(1904-1969)\n|28 March 1955\n|28 March 1963\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |6\n|\n|Vasily Shavura\n(1912-2007)\n|28 March 1963\n|22 December 1965\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |7\n|\n|Maksim Tank\n(1912-1995)\n|22 December 1965\n|15 July 1971\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |8\n|\n|Ivan Shamiakin\n(1921-2004)\n|15 July 1971\n|28 March 1985\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |9\n|\n|Ivan Naumenko\n(1925-2006)\n|28 March 1985\n|15 May 1990\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |10\n|\n|Nikolai Dementey\n(1930-2018)\n|19 May 1990\n|25 August 1991\n|CPSU\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white;\" |–\n|\n|Stanislav Shushkevich\n(1934-2022)\n|25 August 1991\n|18 September 1991\n|CPSU\n|}\nChairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\nThe Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the de jure head of state of the Byelorussian SSR.
