The band is known for its offbeat sense of humour (all band members adopted the surname \"Dwarf\") and was nominated for two Juno Awards during its career. Killer Dwarfs were sometimes compared to NWOBHM acts such as Iron Maiden and Saxon.\nHistory\nBefore The Killer Dwarfs formed, the band consisted of Darrell Millar, Bryce Trewin, and Ange Fodero in a group called Sphinx. After Sphinx, Russ Graham entered the picture and they became The Killer Dwarfs. The original line-up consisted of Russ Graham (vocals) and Darrell Millar (drums), along with Bryce Trewin (guitar) and Ange Fodero (bass). Their self-titled 1983 debut album was nominated for a Juno Award and radio stations in the US, particularly in Texas, started to play the album.\nTrewin and Fodero left the band shortly afterward and were replaced by guitarist Mike Hall and bassist Ron Mayer. This line-up released the band's breakthrough 1986 album Stand Tall, followed by Big Deal in 1988 and Dirty Weapons in 1990. The band received much recognition in Canada and the United States during the 1980s, and its videos were in regular rotation at MuchMusic and on the MTV program Headbangers Ball. Gerry Finn replaced Hall in 1992, and the album Method to the Madness was released later that year.\nThe band toured for several years but then parted ways. During the mid-to-late 1990s, the band members pursued other projects. Graham formed a band called PennyBlack, and Hall and Finn both became members of the Canadian metal band Helix. Millar went on to drum for the southern rock band Laidlaw before forming his own Bon Scott era AC/DC tribute band Autobon, which went on to become Automan.ca, which provided Millar with a vehicle for recording original material. Mayer became a businessman and moved to the U.S. In 2001, however, the line-up of Graham, Millar, Hall and Mayer reunited to tour across North America. Recordings from these shows make up the live album Reunion of Scribes: Live 2001. The band again went on hiatus until 2013, when Graham, Millar, Finn, and Mayer released the album Start @ One which had been previously recorded in 1993. Also in 2013, Graham released Wireless in which he sings acoustic versions of popular Killer Dwarfs songs with guest musicians.\nOn May 26, 2014, the band was returning home after concluding a US tour at the Rocklahoma festival in Pryor, Oklahoma. While passing through a construction zone along Interstate 70 in Indiana, the band's pick-up truck, driven by drummer Johnny Fenton, struck two other vehicles and crashed into a ditch. Graham was airlifted to a hospital in Terre Haute where he received 24 stitches to close a gash on the left side of his forehead. The rest of the band walked away with cuts and bruises. In a radio interview a month later, Graham said he was healing well, but the area around the gash was still completely numb.\nOn January 5, 2018, it was announced that Killer Dwarfs had signed to Megadeth bassist David Ellefson's EMP Label Group, which would release a Killer Dwarfs' live album called NO GUFF. EMP also announced that it would reissue the band's independently released START@ONE and vocalist Graham's solo debut Wireless, plus new 2019 studio albums from Killer Dwarfs and Russ Dwarf.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{|Class = \"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n!rowspan=\"2\" | Album details\n!colspan=\"2\" | Chart\n|- Style = \"font-size: smaller;\"\n!| CAN\n!| US\n|-\n||Killer Dwarfs\n|\n* Released: 1983\n* Label: Attic Records\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n|-\n||Stand Tall\n|\n* Released: 1986\n* Label: Maze Records\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n|-\n||Big Deal\n|\n* Released: 1988\n* Label: Epic Records\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|90\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|165\n|-\n||Dirty Weapons\n|\n* Released: 1990\n* Label: Epic\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|151\n|-\n||Method to the Madness\n|\n* Released: 1992\n* Label: Epic\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n|-\n||Start @ One\n|\n* Released: 2013\n* Label: Smoothline Entertainment\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|—\n|-\n| colspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:8pt;\"| \"-\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n|}\nLive albums\n* Reunion of Scribes: Live 2001 – 2002\nSee also\n*Canadian rock\n*Music of Canada\n*:Category:Canadian rock music groups\n*List of Canadian musicians\n*List of bands from Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.metalfanatix.com/interviews/killerdwarfs.html \"Russ and Darrell Dwarf – The Killer Dwarfs\"].
