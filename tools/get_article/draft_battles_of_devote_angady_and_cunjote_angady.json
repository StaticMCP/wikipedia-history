A British East India Company detachment of approximately 150–200 sepoys, led by Lieutenant Mealey, faced thousands of Nair and Kurichiya rebels under Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja. The rebels, leveraging numerical superiority and terrain knowledge, overwhelmed the British over three days of fighting near the villages of Devote Angady and Cunjote Angady. The British suffered heavy losses, with approximately 38 killed or missing (including 1 subbadar, 2 havildars, 2 naigues, 1 waterman, and 32 sepoys) and 67 wounded, including Lieutenant Millinchamp.The engagements forced the British to retreat via the Ellacherrum Pass, marking a significant rebel victory.\nReferences"
