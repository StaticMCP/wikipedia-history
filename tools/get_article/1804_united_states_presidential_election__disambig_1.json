Incumbent Democratic-Republican president Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. It was the first presidential election conducted following the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reformed procedures for electing presidents and vice presidents.\nJefferson was renominated by his party's congressional nominating caucus without opposition, and the party nominated Governor George Clinton of New York to replace Aaron Burr as Jefferson's running mate. With former president John Adams in retirement, the Federalists turned to Pinckney, a former ambassador and Revolutionary War hero who had been Adams's running mate in the 1800 election.\nThough Jefferson had only narrowly defeated Adams in 1800, he was widely popular due to the Louisiana Purchase and a strong economy. He carried almost every state, including most states in the Federalist stronghold of New England.\nBackground\nAlthough the 1800 presidential election was a close one, Jefferson steadily gained popularity during his term. American trade boomed due to the temporary suspension of hostilities during the French Revolutionary Wars in Europe, and the Louisiana Purchase was heralded as a great achievement.\nNominations\nDemocratic-Republican Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|Democratic-Republican Party Ticket, 1804\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#228B22; width:200px;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#90EE90; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#90EE90; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| 3rdPresident of the United States(1801–1809)\n| 1stGovernor of New York(1777–1795, 1801–1804)\n|-\n|}\nThe congressional nominating caucus of the Democratic-Republican Party was held in February 1804, with 108 members of the United States Congress in attendance and Senator Stephen R. Bradley as its chair. Jefferson was renominated by acclamation while Vice President Aaron Burr was not considered for renomination. The caucus selected to give the vice-presidential nomination to Governor George Clinton whose main opponent was Senator John Breckinridge. A thirteen-member committee was selected to manage Jefferson's presidential campaign.\nVice-presidential candidates\n* John Breckinridge (Kentucky), U.S. Senator\n* George Clinton (New York), Governor\n* Gideon Granger (Connecticut), Postmaster General\n* John Langdon (New Hampshire), former U.S. Senator\n* Levi Lincoln (Massachusetts), U.S. Attorney General\n* William Maclay (Pennsylvania), former U.S. Senator\nFile:John Breckinridge as Attorney General (cropped).jpg|Senator  John Breckinridge  from Kentucky\nFile:George Clinton by Ezra Ames (3x4 cropped).jpg|Governor  George Clinton  of New York\nFile:Gideon Granger (3x4 cropped).jpg|Postmaster General  Gideon Grangerfrom Connecticut\nFile:John langdon (cropped2).jpg|Former Senator  John Langdonfrom New Hampshire\nFile:Levi Lincoln Sr. (Cropped1).jpg|Attorney General  Levi Lincolnfrom Massachusetts\nFile:William Maclay Portrait (3x4 cropped).jpg|Former Senator  William Maclayfrom Pennsylvania\nBalloting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Presidential ballot\n!Total\n!Vice-presidential ballot\n!Total\n|-\n|Thomas Jefferson\n|align=\"right\"|108\n|George Clinton\n|align=\"right\"|67\n|-\n|\n|\n|John Breckinridge\n|align=\"right\"|20\n|-\n|\n|\n|Levi Lincoln\n|align=\"right\"|9\n|-\n|\n|\n|John Langdon\n|align=\"right\"|7\n|-\n|\n|\n|Gideon Granger\n|align=\"right\"|4\n|-\n|\n|\n|William Maclay\n|align=\"right\"|1\n|}\nFederalist Party nomination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|Federalist Party Ticket, 1804\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"|\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:#FF7F50; width:200px;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#FFDAB9; width:200px;\"|for President\n| style=\"width:3em; font-size:100%; color:#000; background:#FFDAB9; width:200px;\"|for Vice President\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| 6th\nU.S. Minister to France(1796–1797)\n| 3rd\nU.S. Minister to Great Britain(1796–1803)\n|-\n|}\nThe Federalists did not hold a nominating caucus, but Federalist congressional leaders informally agreed to nominate a ticket consisting of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York. Pinckney's public service during and after the American Revolutionary War had won him national stature, and Federalists hoped that Pinckney would win some Southern votes away from Jefferson, who had dominated the Southern vote in the previous election.\nGeneral election\nFederalist leader Alexander Hamilton's death in July 1804 following the Burr–Hamilton duel destroyed whatever hope the Federalists had of defeating the popular Jefferson. Leaderless and disorganized, the Federalists failed to attract much support outside of New England. The Federalists attacked the Louisiana Purchase as unconstitutional, criticized Jefferson's gunboat navy, and alleged that Jefferson had fathered children with his slave, Sally Hemings, but the party failed to galvanize opposition to Jefferson. Jefferson's policies of expansionism and reduced government spending were widely popular. Jefferson was aided by an effective Democratic-Republican party organization, which had continued to develop since 1800, especially in the Federalist stronghold of New England.\nJefferson's victory was overwhelming, and he even won four of the five New England states. Pinckney won only two states, Connecticut and Delaware. This was the first election where the Democratic-Republicans won in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.\nAs of 2024, Jefferson was the first of eight presidential nominees to win a significant number of electoral votes in at least three elections, the others being Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Donald Trump. Of these, Jackson, Cleveland, and Roosevelt also won the popular vote in at least three elections. Jefferson, Cleveland, Roosevelt, and Trump were also their respective party's nominees for three consecutive elections. Jefferson is also the first President to receive at least 100,000 votes.\nResults\nSource (Popular Vote): A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1787-1825\nSource (electoral vote):\n(a) Only 11 of the 17 states chose electors by popular vote.\n(b) Those states that did choose electors by popular vote had widely varying restrictions on suffrage via property requirements.\nPopular vote by state\nThe popular vote totals used are the elector from each party with the highest total of votes.
