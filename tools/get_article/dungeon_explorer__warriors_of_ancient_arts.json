Specific levels have specific challenges in them, such as Level 6 of a dungeon are considered blind; without the usage of a specific item, the mini-map is blanked out with only the character icons visible.\nThe title features 3 races and 6 classes that the player can choose from the beginning. From a certain point on, the character has the option to change classes when he is not in the dungeons, each one keeping its own ranks (from \"E\" to \"S\"). There are also 6 advanced classes that require the combination of two basic classes: one with rank B and the other with rank A. These advanced classes include the skills of the previous two classes plus new own abilities and unique weapons. All of these skills are acquired as characters level up their range of weapons as well as their range of work, and two of them can be equipped and changed on the fly.\nThe jewels have multiple purposes in addition to powering up dungeons, they can be consolidated, used in alchemy or installed onto weapons are armor.

In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40 for the PSP version, and 26 out of 40 for the DS version. GamePro said of the former handheld version, \"Graphics are decent, but the sound is obnoxious. You're going to be sick to death of the sonic snails you fight over and over (since missions constantly send you back to do practically the same thing every time) with their ear-drum piercing screeches. No significant voice acting, either, which could've livened things up a bit. Co-op games are great, but Dungeon Explorer failed to excite us.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
