It was yet one more short-lived minority agent in the agitated political context of the Spanish Transition to democracy.\nGAB campaigned for independence of the Balearic Islands from Spain, but, contrary to the typical view of radical nationalist left groups, it did not ask for the hypothetical independent Balearic islands to become a part of an equally hypothetical independent Països Catalans.\nGAB was politically tied to the Communist Party of Spain (international) (PCE(i)).\nReferences"
