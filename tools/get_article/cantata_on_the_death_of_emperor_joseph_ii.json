It remains one of Beethoven's lesser-known works.\nAnother cantata written more or less in tandem with WoO 87 is the Cantata on the Accession of Emperor Leopold II, WoO 88.\nStructure\nThe cantata, written in C minor, has seven movements.\n# Coro. Largo - Larghetto (C minor)\n# Recitativo. Presto (A minor)\n# Aria. Allegro maestoso - Allegro assai (D major)\n# Aria con Coro. Andante con moto (F major)\n# Recitativo. Largo (D minor)\n# Aria. Adagio con affetto (E♭ major)\n# Coro. Largo - Larghetto (C minor)\nComposition\nThe work is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, strings and SATB chorus with solo soprano and bass (there is also a solo semichorus SSATB). The seven movements take approximately 35 minutes to perform.The ária with Chorus, the fourth section, will be used in the ópera Fidelio\nSee also\n* Beethoven and C minor\nExternal links\n*\n*The libretto by Severin Anton Averdonk, on the German Wikipedia page."
