In James Hamilton's New Spins section of Record Mirror, issue June 5, the record was referred to as a thudding hustler. In Sue Byrom's Singles section of the same issue, the speed of the music and catchy repeated chorus that could get some listeners was noted. The slick arrangement, the drums accentuating the backbeat and Shaw's phrasings were also noted.  The Cash Box reviewer in the June 12 issue called it a driving disco and r&b cut.\nAirplay\nFor the week of May 22, Cash Box recorded the record being added to the R&B playlists of WAMO in Pittsburgh, WADS in Philadelphia, and WILD in Boston. It was also added to the playlist of WDAO in Dayton.\nCharts\n\"It's Better than Walking Out\" made its debut in the Cash Box Top 100 R&B chart at 83 the week of June 12, 1976, spending a week on the chart.\nThe song peaked at no. 103 on the Billboard main chart (Bubbling Under) and at no. 74 on the R&B chart.\nFor the week ending June 26, 1976, \"Better than Walking Out\" was at no. 109 in the Billboard Bubbling Under The Hot 100 chart.
