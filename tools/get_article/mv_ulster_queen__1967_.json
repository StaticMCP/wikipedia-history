She was built by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. With her sister,  she took over the Liverpool - Belfast night service, replacing the pre-war motorships  and Ulster Prince (2). The smaller, third new ferry,  took over the Ardrossan - Belfast day service of Burns & Laird. Coast Lines were taken over by P&O in  1971 and the ferries subsequently took on the P&O Ferries colours, with pale blue funnels.\nThe service closed in 1981 and both ships were laid up in Ostend. Ulster Queen saw further service as Med Sea, Al Kahera and Ala-Eddin. In 1988, she was bought by Hellenic Mediterranean Lines, and renamed Poseidonia.\nOn 2 November  2005, she caught fire during a voyage from Suez to Jeddah. One crew member was lost. The following day, she sank on Hyndman Reef, Safaga and lies as a wreck.\nService\n*1967-1981: Liverpool-Belfast\n*1982-1985: Cyprus - Syria\n*1986: Red Sea\n*1988-2003 : Igoumenitsa - Brindisi (1988-1998)\nReferences"
