The station building made use of the LD&ECR's standard modular architecture.\nAfter leaving Shirebrook North station, the line crossed the Midland Nottingham to Worksop line (since 1998 the Robin Hood Line) and passed the LD&ECR Warsop yard near Warsop Junction. This yard is used by DB Cargo UK. To the north was a branch to Warsop Main colliery with extensive marshalling yards, now closed.\nShortly after this, in the days before the deep mines penetrating the limestone cap were sunk, the newly built line ran into countryside, crossed Warsop Vale on an embankment, and arrived at Warsop station.\nBetween Warsop and Edwinstowe the line climbed from the valley of the River Meden, heading for that of the River Maun. This was the beginning of the area known as The Dukeries, heavily promoted in the railway's literature in the hope of attracting tourist trade.\nIt passed by Warsop Windmill, where the GCR was later to provide a branch to Welbeck Colliery before reaching Clipstone, where it had been planned to build a branch to Mansfield. Instead it had built a curve into the Midland Railway line mentioned above. Sidings, however, were provided for the Duke of Portland. Further on into the Maun valley the GCR did build a junction for Mansfield Central, initially facing Lincoln, but then converted to a triangular one. Latterly this extended only to a group of collieries, all now closed.\nPassenger Services\nThere never was a Sunday service calling at Warsop.\nIn 1922 the advertised services were:\nEastbound\n*1 train to Nottingham Victoria via Mansfield Central\n*4 trains to Mansfield Central, with two extra on Saturdays\n*2 trains to Lincoln High Street (later renamed Lincoln Central, now plain Lincoln), with an extra on Friday, Lincoln's Market Day\nWestbound\n*4 trains to Chesterfield Market Place, with two extra on Saturdays\n*1 to Langwith Junction (later renamed Shirebrook North) on Fridays\n*1 to Langwith Junction (later renamed Shirebrook North) on Saturdays\nPassengers aiming for Mansfield on Saturday evenings could catch the 22:44, non-stop Eastbound to Mansfield Central or wait for the 23:38 westbound to Langwith Junction which doubled back down what is now the Robin Hood Line to the Midland station at Mansfield, arriving at Midnight.\nThe position in August 1939 was not greatly changed, though the late train to Mansfield Central had disappeared.\nBy the Summer of 1964 all regular timetabled local services had been gone for nine years, but it was still possible to catch a train to Mablethorpe or Skegness, or even to Radford via the Warsop to Shirebrook Junction curve, but it would be the following Saturday before a direct train back.\nModern times\nThe line through the station site gives access from Shirebrook to UK Coal's Thoresby Colliery and to the High Marnham Test Track.\nSince the closure of Thoresby Colliery, the traffic on the line has rapidly decreased and the line only has the High Marnham Test Track trains running every few months.\nThere is some hope of reopening the line as a branch off the Robin Hood Line and reopening Warsop,  and  stations, providing an hourly service to Mansfield and Nottingham.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16&lat=53.1996&lon=-1.1609&layers=6&b=1 The station on navigable multi-layered maps] National Library of Scotland\n*[http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#457,366,1 The station on navigable 1940s OS map] npe Maps\n*[http://www.railwaycodes.org.uk/elrs/_mileages/H/HIM1.txt The station, line and mileages] Railway Codes\n*[http://www.warsopvale.org/history2.htm Warsop Main Colliery 1] Warsop Vale\n*[http://www.warsopvale.org/new_galleries/warsop_main%201889-1989%20Pt2 Warsop Main Colliery 2] Warsop Vale\nLine and station closed\n|next1=Line and station closed\n|next2=Line and station closed\n|route=Great Central RailwayLD&ECR\n|col= }}\nLine and station closed\n|route=British RailwaysSummer Saturdays 1963-4\n|col= }}"
