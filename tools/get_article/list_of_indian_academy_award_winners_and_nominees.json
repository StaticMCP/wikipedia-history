It was nominated alongside four other films and lost to the Italian film Nights of Cabiria (1957) by one vote. In 1982, The National Film Development Corporation of India was instrumental in co-producing Richard Attenborough's biographical film Gandhi. At the 55th Academy Awards, Bhanu Athaiya became the first Indian to win an Academy Award for designing the costumes. Ravi Shankar was nominated for Best Original Score for the same film. As of 2023, three Indian films have been nominated for Best International Feature Film — Mother India, Salaam Bombay! (1988) and Lagaan (2001).\nIn 1992, legendary Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray was bestowed with an Honorary Academy Award. He became the only Indian to date to receive the honour. In 2000, M. Night Shyamalan became the first Indian-American to receive an Oscar nomination for his 1999 film The Sixth Sense. He was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay respectively. Currently, Shyamalan is the only person of Indian heritage to be nominated in those categories.\nA. R. Rahman and Resul Pookutty won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing and Best Original Score, respectively, for the 2008 British film Slumdog Millionaire. Rahman also won for Best Original Song alongside lyricist Gulzar for the song \"Jai Ho\", becoming the first and only Indian to date to have won more than one Academy Award. Rahman also holds the record for most nominations for an Indian with five total nominations to date, followed by Ismail Merchant with four nominations (three for Best Picture and once for Live Action Short).\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, three different Indian productions received Oscar nominations, with both  RRR (feature film) and The Elephant Whisperers (documentary short film) winning among their respective categories and thus the former became 'The first Indian Full-length Feature film' and the latter became 'The first Indian Documentary short film' to win the Oscars.
