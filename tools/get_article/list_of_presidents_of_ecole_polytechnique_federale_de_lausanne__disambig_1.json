This resulted in the creation of EPFL in 1969, with Cosandey as its first president. He has been succeeded in this role by four other people, in the following order: Bernard Vittoz, Jean-Claude Badoux, Patrick Aebischer, and Martin Vetterli (the current president, since 1 January 2017).\nAppointment process\nThe EPFL president is appointed by the Swiss Federal Council for renewable four-year terms. The process for appointing the presidents of the Swiss federal institutes of technology is not subject to strict rules. Martin Vetterli, the current president, was nominated by the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research, which acted on the recommendation of the Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology (ETH Board).\nEPFL presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=col colspan=\"3\" | Name\n!scope=col colspan=\"2\" | Term of office\n!scope=col width=\"60%\" | Notes\n|-\n| 6\n| Anna Fontcuberta i Morral\n(1975)\n| 90px\n|width=\"10%\"| 1 January 2025\n|width=\"10%\"|\n|align=left| Anna Fontcuberta i Morral, a Spanish and Swiss physicist and materials scientist and professor at the Institute of Materials Science & Engineering since 2008 (full professor since 2019), will succeed Martin Vetterli from 1 January 2025.
