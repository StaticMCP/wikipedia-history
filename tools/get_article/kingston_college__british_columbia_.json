The AUL's business education programs have been accredited in the past by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), but this accreditation was suspended in April 2007.  The Private Post-Secondary Education Commission of British Columbia (PPSEC) made several attempts to get Kingston to cease this practice before the PPSEC was disbanded in 2004 and replaced with Private Career Training Agency of British Columbia (PCTIA). Under PCTIA directives, any out of country institution offering degree programs in Canada should be accredited.\nThough Kingston was advised by PPSEC in 2000, 2001, and 2004, they continued to have articulation with this university after successfully appealed with PPSEC for reinstatement.\nStudents are suing the college over advertising claims.[http://www.cufa.bc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19&Itemid=44 CUFA/BC - Secret Ingredient for a Successful Economy - September 12, 2005]\nAccording to PCTIA Feb and April 2007 Board minutes, the college has submitted an appeal.\nAt the time of filing complaints Kingston had additional locations in Ontario namely Toronto (Markham) and Niagara Falls.\nNotable alumni\n*William J.
