Marked by escalating unrest and the breakdown of law enforcement authority, the conflict culminated in a British military intervention to restore order.\nThe operation was launched following widespread instability sparked by localized uprisings and an alleged breakdown in communication within RGP command. As tensions grew, the British Armed Forces, including elite units from the Royal Marines, Royal Air Force, and Royal Navy, were deployed under the leadership of Governor-General EdwardGHome.\nFierce engagements occurred, especially on the 21st of May, where both sides suffered significant casualties. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment, reinforced by aerial and naval units, pushed through RGP-held zones including the Central Operations HQ and Harbour blockades.\nBy the 22nd, coordinated operations had suppressed major resistance, and peace was restored on the 23rd. Governor-General EdwardGHome declared a return to order and announced general elections to establish renewed civilian oversight. The battle has since been referenced as a defining moment in Gibraltar's virtual governance history on ROBLOX.\nAftermath\nThe outcome reinforced the authority of the British Armed Forces in the region while prompting major reforms within the Royal Gibraltar Police. The Armed Special Constabulary was dissolved, and both sides agreed to new cooperation protocols. Civilian administration resumed with increased transparency and electoral legitimacy.\nLegacy\nKabir Smells.\nGallery\nFile:Battle of Gib RBX RG.png|RGXRGP - Battle for control of Gibraltar, 21st May 2025\nSee also\nIsmailWellesley\nNotes\n* Conflict simulated in roleplay environment.
