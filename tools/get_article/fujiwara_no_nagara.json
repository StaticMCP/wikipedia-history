For the 10th-century Japanese poet also known as Nagayoshi, see Fujiwara no Nagatō.\n, also known as Fujiwara no Nagayoshi, was a Japanese statesman, courtier and politician of the early Heian period. He was the grandfather of Emperor Yōzei.\nLife\nNagara was born as the eldest son of the sadaijin Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu, a powerful figure in the court of Emperor Saga. He was also a descendant of the early Japanese emperors and was well trusted by Emperor Ninmyō since his time as crown prince, and attended on him frequently. However, after Ninmyō took the throne, Nagara's advancement was overtaken by his younger brother Fujiwara no Yoshifusa. He served as director of the  and  in the imperial guard before finally making sangi and joining the kugyō in 844, ten years after his younger brother.\nIn 850, Nagara's nephew Emperor Montoku took the throne, and Nagara was promoted to  and then , and in 851 to . In the same year, though, Nagara was overtaken once more as his brother Fujiwara no Yoshimi, more than ten years his junior, was promoted to chūnagon. In 854, when Yoshimi was promoted to dainagon, Nagara was promoted to fill his old position of chūnagon. In 856 he was promoted to , but died shortly thereafter at the age of 55.\nLegacy\nAfter Nagara's death, his daughter Takaiko became a court lady of Emperor Seiwa. In 877, after her son Prince Sadaakira took the throne as Emperor Yōzei, Nagara was posthumously promoted to  and sadaijin, and again in 879 to daijō-daijin.\nNagara was overtaken in life by his brother Yoshifusa and Yoshimi, but he had more children, and his descendants thrived. His third son Fujiwara no Mototsune was adopted by Yoshifusa, and his line branched into various powerful clans, including the five regent houses.\nBefore the Middle Ages, there may have been a tendency to view Mototsune's biological father Nagara rather than his adoptive father Yoshifusa as his parent, making Nagara out as the ancestor of the regent family. This may have impacted the Ōkagami, leading it to depict Nagara as the head of the Hokke instead of Yoshifusa.\nPersonality\nNagara had a noble disposition, both tender-hearted and magnanimous. Despite being overtaken by his brothers, he continued to love them deeply. He was treated his subordinates with tolerance, and was loved by people of all ranks. When Emperor Ninmyō died, Fuyutsugu is said to have mourned him like a parent, even abstaining from food as he prayed for the happiness of the Emperor's spirit.\nWhen he served Emperor Montoku in his youth, the Emperor treated him as an equal, but Nagara did not abandon formal dress or display an overly familiar attitude.\nGenealogy\n*Father: Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu\n*Mother: , daughter of\n*Wife:\n**Eldest son:\n**Second son:\n*Wife: , daughter of\n**Third son: , adopted by Fujiwara no Yoshifusa\n**Fourth son:\n**Fifth son:\n**Sixth son:\n**Daughter: , court lady of Emperor Seiwa, mother of Emperor Yōzei\n*Unknown wife (possibly )\n**Daughter: , wife of , adoptive mother of Emperor Uda,\n**Daughter: , wife of Taira no Takamune,\nNotes\nReferences\n* Brinkley, Frank and Dairoku Kikuchi.
