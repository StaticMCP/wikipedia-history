It is the lead single from Ice Cube's tenth studio album ''Everythang's Corrupt''. Although he is not mentioned by name, it is directed at US President Donald Trump, containing a refrain to \"Arrest the President; you got the evidence\". The song's video is a montage of Trump clips.\nBackground\nThe song was noted for its overtly political stance following Ice Cube previously having commented on his feeling that Trump has not acted on issues that affect the black community in the United States, and strongly denying on Twitter that he would ever support Trump.\nLyrics\nAlong with lyrics about treating the White House like a \"trap house\" and that \"These motherfuckers never take the trash out\", Ice Cube refers to the accusations of Russian collusion in the 2016 election, calling Trump \"Russian intelligence\", with the song's refrain deemed a \"plea\" to Robert Mueller to arrest Trump.\nCritical reception\nAlong with being called politically charged by Rolling Stone and Pitchfork, NME called the song an \"attack\" on Trump, saying Ice Cube \"couldn't be clearer\" on its refrain.\nSee also\n*Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections\nReferences"
