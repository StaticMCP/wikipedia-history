Considered one of the pre-tournament favorites with multiple Major League Baseball All-Stars, they were upset in their opening game of the modified double-elimination pool by the Netherlands. After eliminating Panama, they faced the Dutch again for the right to advance but were stunned in 11 innings and eliminated from the competition.\n| score = 3–2\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = Puerto Rico Hiram Bithorn Stadium\n| attendance = 9,335\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2009_03_07_nedint_domint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| score = 0–9\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = Puerto Rico Hiram Bithorn Stadium\n| attendance = 9,221\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2009_03_08_panint_domint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| stadium = Puerto Rico Hiram Bithorn Stadium\n| attendance = 11,814\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2009_03_10_domint_nedint_1&mode=box\n}}\n2013\nDrawn into Pool C with Puerto Rico, Spain, and Venezuela at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico once again, the Dominicans opened the round-robin round 1 with a decisive 9–3 victory over 2009 semifinalists Venezuela. A victory over Spain and a Puerto Rico win over Venezuela ensured advancement to the second round; the Dominicans clinched the top seed by defeating the hosts. In the second round, the Dominicans rallied past upstart Italy despite an early 4–0 deficit at Marlins Park in Miami, United States. Two ninth-inning runs pushed the Dominicans past the host Americans and into the semifinals. Another victory over Puerto Rico ensured the Dominicans of the top seed and a chance to avoid two-time defending champions Japan national baseball team. Instead, they would face the surprising semifinalists the Netherlands. After an early 1–0 deficit, four 5th-inning runs pushed the Dominican Republic into the final, where a 3–0 victory over Puerto Rico gave them their first-ever World Baseball Classic title. New York Yankees second baseman Robinson Canó was named MVP of the tournament.\n| score = 3–9\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = Puerto Rico Hiram Bithorn Stadium\n| attendance = 15,055\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_07_venint_domint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| stadium = Puerto Rico Hiram Bithorn Stadium\n| attendance = 13,412\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_09_domint_espint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| stadium = Puerto Rico Hiram Bithorn Stadium\n| attendance = 19,413\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_10_domint_purint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| score = 4–5\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = United States Marlins Park\n| attendance = 14,482\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_13_itaint_purint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| stadium = United States Marlins Park\n| attendance = 34,366\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_14_domint_usaint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| score = 0–2\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = United States Marlins Park\n| attendance = 19,762\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_16_purint_domint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| score = 1–4\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = United States AT&T Park\n| attendance = 27,527\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_18_nedint_domint_1&mode=box\n}}\n| score = 0–3\n| team2 = Dominican Republic Dominican Republic\n| stadium = United States AT&T Park\n| attendance =35,703\n| boxurl = http://mlb.mlb.com/wbc/2013/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_03_19_purint_domint_1&mode=box\n}}\n2017\nThe Dominican Republic advanced out of the first round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic.

They will play from March 6-11, 2026, at LoanDepot Park in Miami, Florida, in Pool D.\nEleven-time All Star and three-time NL MVP Albert Pujols will be the manager of Team Dominican Republic for the 2026 World Baseball Classic.
