It was the only Suicidal Tendencies album to be recorded without an official drummer; the drum tracks were handled by Josh Freese, filling in for the departed R.J. Herrera. The Art of Rebellion maintains its position as the band's most commercially successful studio album to date, and the songs \"Nobody Hears\" and \"I'll Hate You Better\" have the distinction of being the only top 40 hits (radio or otherwise) in Suicidal Tendencies' career.\nAlbum information\nReleased in the wake of the success of grunge and alternative rock, The Art of Rebellion is widely considered to be Suicidal's \"experimental\" album. Mike Clark has acknowledged this. Clark also mentioned that the album was not planned that way, and was just a reflection of the band's musical growth. The songs show the band's continuing experimentation that had begun on its predecessor, Lights...Camera...Revolution!, as well as more progressive song structures, a somewhat more alternative atmosphere, and even pop-oriented sounds. This helped the band not only outride the explosion of alternative in the early 1990s, it also helped them gain a fan base within that community. Nonetheless, the album still stays true to the band's thrash and punk roots on many of the songs.\nAt almost 60 minutes long, The Art of Rebellion was Suicidal Tendencies' longest album to date, until 2013's 13. Singles to promote the album were \"Nobody Hears\", \"Asleep at the Wheel\", and \"I'll Hate You Better\"; the music videos for each single gained substantial airplay by Headbangers Ball on MTV.\nLongtime drummer R.J. Herrera left Suicidal Tendencies just prior to the album's recording sessions. Instead of replacing him, the remaining members opted to record as a four-piece and were joined by Josh Freese of The Vandals, who is credited as a session drummer on the album and does not appear in any of the photos on the insert. For the accompanying tour for The Art of Rebellion, Herrera was replaced by former Y&T and White Lion drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who would stay in Suicidal Tendencies until the band's initial breakup in 1995.\nReception\n| rev2 = ''Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\n| rev2score = 9/10\n| rev3      = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev3Score = B−\n| rev4      = Q\n| rev4Score =\n}}\nThe Art of Rebellion peaked at number 52 on the Billboard'' 200, and received generally positive reviews from critics.\nDeborah Frost of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a positive review, though noted:He's [Mike Muir] no longer the community revolutionary, compared with bad neighbors like Ice-T, and he has been crowded off the funk-fusion wagon by hotter Chili Peppers. What's more, Nirvana and Metallica have yelled The Art of Rebellion's teen alien themes like real rebels and better artists. It's hard to be convincing when your band can only offer hardcore cliches that your producer only Roger Waters-down. Even the best song, the power ballad Asleep at the Wheel, is a little too close to dinosaur rock for comfort. But rising for the first time above the thrash, Muir's experiments — particularly with uncanny, Ray Davies-like vocals — suggest that there may be life after suicide yet.\nTrack listing\nCredits\nSuicidal Tendencies\n*Mike Muir – vocals\n*Rocky George – lead guitar\n*Mike Clark – rhythm guitar\n*Robert Trujillo – bass\nAdditional musicians\n*Josh Freese – drums\n*John Webster – keyboards\n*Dennis Karmazyn – cello\nChart positions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Chart\n!Position\n|-\n|1992\n|U.S. Billboard 200\n|52\n|}\nReferences"
