It voted taxes in 1640 and was then overshadowed by the Irish Rebellion of 1641. It was legally dissolved by the King's death in 1649.\nBackground\nThe Parliament was called by the Earl of Strafford, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, because of King Charles I's need to raise funds and men to fight against the Scots in the Second Bishops' War. The main item on the agenda therefore was taxation.\n{|\n!colspan=4|Parliaments: previous, subject of the article, and next\n|-\n!Monarch !!align=left|# !!align=left|Years !!align=left|Remark\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Charles I of England\n|1\n|1634–1635\n|-\n|2\n|1640–1649\n|-\n|Charles II of England\n|1\n|1661–1666\n|}\nProceedings\n1st session\nParliament was opened on 16 March 1640 by Christopher Wandesford, whom the Lord Lieutenant Strafford had appointed his Lord Deputy. On that same day the parliament elected Sir Maurice Eustace, one of the two members for County Kildare, as speaker. Strafford arrived two days later. The parliament then unanimously voted four subsidies of £45,000 (about £ in ) to raise an Irish army of 9,000 for use by the king against the Scots in the Second Bishops' War. On 31&nbsp;March Strafford prorogued parliament until the first week of June. On 3&nbsp;April 1640 Strafford left Ireland.\n2nd session\nLord Deputy Wandesford opened the 2nd Session on 1&nbsp;June. News from England was the Short Parliament had refused subsidies to the King. The Irish MPs regretted having voted subsidies and wanted to sabotage their action by changing how the subsidies would be evaluated and collected. After two weeks of inconclusive discussions, Wandesford prorogued parliament on 17&nbsp;June.\n3rd session\nParliament reconvened on 1&nbsp;October 1640 for its 3rd Session. The Commons created a committee for grievances. The committee prepared a remonstrance (complaint) against Strafford, that was then approved by the House of Commons. This remonstrance is also called the \"November Petition\". Wandesford prorogued parliament on 12&nbsp;November, a day after Strafford's impeachment in Westminster by the Long Parliament. A delegation of 13 MPs, headed by Audley Mervyn, travelled to London to submit the remonstrance to the King, arriving on 21&nbsp;November. On 12 November Wandesford prorogued Parliament until 26&nbsp;January 1641. The Irish House of Lords had not acted on grievances during the 3rd Session, but after its prorogation some Lords decided to send Gormanston, Dillon, Kilmallock, and Muskerry to London to present separate Lords' grievances.\n4th session\nThe Irish Parliament met in its 4th Session on 26&nbsp;January 1641.\n}}\nSources\n*\n*\n*  – 1603 to 1642\n*  – 1613 to 1641\n*  – 1640 to 1641\n*\n*  – 1611 to 1625\n*  – (for timeline)\n*  – 1639 to 1641\n*\n*\n*  – 1634 to 1699\n*\n*\n*  – Parliaments & Biographies (PDF downloadable from given URL)\n*  – House of Lords\n*  – House of Commons\n*\n*  – (Preview)\n*\n*"
