Stewart released it on his 1974 album Smiler. Among the musicians featured were Ray Jackson of Lindisfarne on mandolin, and Ric Grech on violin.\nWhen released as a single in the United Kingdom in September 1974, the song became a Top 10 hit (No. 7) as part of a double A-side with his medley \"Bring It On Home to Me/You Send Me\". In the United States, this song was released as a single but its flip side, \"Mine For Me,\" was the track that charted.\nBillboard praised the story told by the lyrics, which it described as being \"about a young man leaving home to make it in the world of show business.\"\nReferences"
