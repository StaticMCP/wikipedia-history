The various category winners are awarded a statuette, officially called the Golden Horn, and a certificate. The awards, first presented in 2006 at the Gallagher Estate, are overseen by a committee governed by the NFVF.\nThe finalists, nominees, and winners are chosen by a multi-phasic process of judging panels. Only South African citizens are eligible for the awards. The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is the official live broadcast partner and sponsor.\nThe 13th South African Film and Television Awards (Quarantine Edition-ceremony) was held at the Sun City Metro Theater on 1st of April 2021 by Edem, Henry-Kendall A. And garnered over 1 million live watchers at the official SAFTAs 2021 Zoom Link\nBackground\nAt the first film indaba in August 2005, representatives of the South African film and television industry, with guidance from the National Film and Video Foundation (NFVF), set to establish an annual awards ceremony. The awards would serve as a way honour, celebrate, and promote creative excellence, and encourage the development of new talent within the industry. Since the inaugural ceremony, the awards have been under the custodianship of the NFVF and governed by a committee. The current NFVF chief-executive officer is the chairperson, while the rest of the body consists of the national broadcasters, the South African Screen Federation (SASFED), Writers' Guild of South Africa (WGSA), and other key stakeholders.\nAt the 6th South African Film and Television Awards ceremony the then NFVF CEO and SAFTA committee chairperson, Eddie Mbalo, announced there would be an investigation into establishing a South African Film and Television Academy as \"true custodians\" of the awards. The announcement followed Eddie Mbalo's resignation, \"hoping\" that the academy would be launched with a new chairperson. In the weeks before the 7th South African Film and Television Awards the current NFVF CEO, Zama Mkosi, reported that a special sub-committee had drawn up a draft constitution for the Academy. The constitution was released to the industry for feedback, she stated that \"we may achieve [an Academy] within the next two to three years.\" It is modelled on international academies, such as Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and British Academy of Film and Television Arts. The NFVF stated it could not fully fund the academy, stating they would \"walk alongside\" the industry to make the academy make \"financial sense\".\nGolden Horn statuette\nSince the inaugural awards ceremony in 2006, each winner receives a statuette named the Golden Horn and winner certificate in recognition of creative excellence. The faces on the statuette are based on artefacts from throughout Africa, some dating back to 800 CE, and reference the Lydenburg Heads. The three figure heads are sculpted to look like cattle horns and similar to the shapes found on indigenous snuff boxes. These objects were often a recognition the status of venerated member in an African community. Together the horns are a reference to flames and, ultimately, the rising sun as an \"emblem of brightness, splendour and the supreme principle of the nature\". The creative concept behind the trophy is built on the strength of the collective effort and the recognition of the individual as a part of the team.\nEligibility and entry\nAs per the awards committee guidelines, only citizens and permanent residents of South Africa are eligible for a nomination; in certain categories this rule only applies to the head producer. In the television award categories, the production company's majority stakeholders must be South African. In the case of co-productions with foreign companies, are only eligible where a \"significant proportion\" of the creative decision are made by the South African team and the production has been certified by the National Film and Video Foundation. The SAFTA committee sends out a call for entries, typically around August. For the 10th South African Film and Television Awards, participants were allowed to submit their media online, before the entry forms were submitted online and the media sent via a postal service to the NFVF head offices in Johannesburg.\nIn the television categories, shows that were publicly aired on any local stations between 1 August and 31 July are eligible. The television show must be serialised, with at least one season. The production company or producer submit two of the best episodes, along with a list of the specific categories they with to enter. In the film categories, films that were publicly exhibited in South Africa between 1 January and 31 December are eligible. The minimum runtime for feature film entries was reduced from 70 minutes to 41 minutes for the 10th South African Film and Television Awards. For any actor and actress categories a showreel of their best scenes is submitted, to give the judges a view of their range. If an entry is submitted incorrectly, it is immediately disqualified from that category.\nJudging process\nThe SAFTA committee begins each judging process, by electing a jury of three or more chairpersons. These chairpersons oversee both phases, supply score cards and guide the judges in each category. The film and television professionals with a minimum of ten years experience, or deemed \"credible\" by the jury, can volunteer to be a judge. In 2011, the SAFTA committee began incorporating previous winners and nominees into the judging process to \"encourage peer recognition\". The names of judges are not publicly available, to protect their anonymity and remove any potential coercion during the process. In the 2016, there were approximately 300 judges used throughout the process. The judging sessions take place in South Africa's three major cities, Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.\nAfter much criticism from the television industry, the SAFTA committee partnered with the Emmy Awards committee in 2015 to review and advise on improvements to the judging process. As a result, judges only cast a vote within their speciality and not every category during the first phase of judging.\nPhase one\nThe first round of judging, or filtration phase, is when all entries are considered. It typically takes place over six weeks during October and November the year before the ceremony. The filtration process reduces the number of entries to a minimum of five and maximum of seven finalists per category. If there are three or less entries in a category, the award is suspended for the year. This often applies to technical awards, where as the threshold of entries may be lower for the top award categories like Best TV Drama, Best TV Soap, Best TV Comedy, Best Feature Film, Best Actor Feature Film and Best Actress Feature Film .\nThe judges are split into \"panels\", each panel is made up of specialists in the given category. For example, the judges who are television directors will only judge for the television directing categories (regardless of genre). The panels must elect a Panel Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, who participate in both phases of judging. A score card is created by the newly appointed jury chairperson(s), based on specific criteria in a given category. These criteria typically ranges between three or four questions, with each question receiving a rating out of five. This is an example of what a score card for the television directing might look like:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Question\n! Rating\n|-\n| The technical direction of the show\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 3\n|-\n| The direction of performances\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2\n|-\n| The directorial interpretation of the script\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4\n|-\n| Total score\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 9\n|-\n|}\nOnce all the score cards have been counted, the top seven finalist in each category move onto phase two.\nPhase two\nThe final phase takes place between November and January with a new set of judges. These judges have no prior knowledge of the first phase and are, again, split into speciality panels. Each panel is encouraged to have at least one meeting, via Skype or in-person, to discuss the finalists in their category. An auditor is present during meetings to assess that discussions are \"free and fair\", and are not dominated by one point-of-view. After these discussions, the judges submit their score cards to the SAFTA committee. The three productions that receive the highest scores make the nominee list, that is typically announced in early-February. The auditors, assigned by the SAFTA committee, tally the final scores submitted and are the only ones who know the winners before the awards evening.\nCeremonies\nThe inaugural awards ceremony was held in 2006, there have been 18 editions to date.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Ceremony\n! style=\"width:;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best Feature Film\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best Actress (Feature Film)\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best Actor (Feature Film)\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best TV Drama\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best TV Comedy\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best TV Soap\n! style=\"width:;\"|Best Score (Feature)\n! style=\"width:;\"|Host(s)\n! style=\"width:;\"|Venue\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 1st SAFTA\n| 28 October 2006\n| Tsotsi\n| Quanita Adams\n| Presley Chweneyagae\n| Hard Copy\n| ''City Ses'la\n| Isidingo\n|\n|  David Kau\n|  Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 2nd SAFTA\n| 27 October 2007\n| Goodbye Bafana\n| Pauline Malefane\n| Leon Schuster\n| When We Were Black\n| Laugh Out Loud\n| Generations\n|\n| David Kau\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 3rd SAFTA\n| 7 February 2009\n|\n|\n|\n| Bay of Plenty\n| City Ses'la\n| Isidingo\n| Confessions of a Gambler\n| Trevor Noah\n| State Theatre\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|4th SAFTA\n| 20 February 2010\n| Shirley Adams\n| Denise Newman\n| Kenneth Nkosi\n| Sokhulu & Partners\n| Family Bonds\n| 7de Laan\n| Phillip Miller\n| John Vlismas\n| State Theatre\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 5th SAFTA\n| 27 February 2011\n| Life, Above All\n| Khomotso Manyaka\n| Themba Ndaba\n| Erfsondes\n| Proesstraat\n| Rhythm City\n| Restless Natives\n| Thami Ngubeni  Joey Rasdien\n| Melrose Arch\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 6th SAFTA\n| 10 March 2012\n| Black Butterflies\n|\n|  Deon Lotz\n| Intersexsions\n| Gauteng Maboneng\n| Isidingo\n| Phillip Miller\n| Bridget Masinga  Jeannie D\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 7th SAFTA\n| 17 March 2013\n| Material\n| Lindiwe Ndlovo\n| Riaad Moosa\n| 4Play: Sex Tips for Girls\n|\n| 7de Laan\n| Michael Bester\n| Connie Ferguson  Nik Rabinowitz\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 8th SAFTA\n| 5 April 2014\n|Of good report\n| Antoinette Louw\n| Mathusi Magano\n| Intersexsions\n| ZA News\n| 7de Laan\n| Bruce Retief\n| Tumi Morake  Iminam Tatiya\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 9th SAFTA\n| 22 March 2015\n| Four Corners\n| Thishiwe Ziqubu\n| Jezriel Skei\n| Swartwater\n| ZA News\n| Isibaya\n| Markus Wormstorm\n| Loyiso Gola\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n| 10th SAFTA\n| 20 March 2016\n| Dis ek, Anna\n| Fulu Mughovani\n| Mduduzi Mabaso\n| Umlilo\n| ZA News\n| Rhythm City\n| Mpho Nthangeni\n| Minnie Dlamini  Katlego Maboe\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|11th SAFTA\n| 16 March 2017\n| Sink\n| Shoki Mokgape\n| Dann-Jacques Mouton\n| Heist\n| Puppet Nation ZANews\n| The Road\n| Chris Letcher\n|Thando Thabethe  Katlego Maboe\n| Sun City\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|12th SAFTA\n| 25 March 2018\n| Inxeba\n| Crystal-Donna Roberts\n| Nakhane Touré\n| Tjovitjo\n| Puppet Nation ZANews\n| Isibaya & Uzalo\n| Rashid Lanie\n| Thando Thabethe  Phat Joe\n| Sun City\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|13th SAFTA\n| 2 March 2019\n| Sew the Winter to My Skin\n| Jill Levenberg\n| Jarrid Geduld\n| Lockdown\n| Tali's Wedding Diary\n| The River\n| Quinn Lubbe\n| Rorisang Thandekiso\n/Pearl Modiadie\n/Thomas Msengane\n/Somizi somGee Mhlongo\n| Sun City\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|14th SAFTA\n|29 April 2020\n| Fiela se Kind\n| Clementine Mosimane\n| Bongile Mantsai\n| The Republic\n|\n| Rhythm City\n| Chris Letcher\n|\n| Virtual Event\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|15th SAFTA\n| 21 May 2021\n| Toorbos\n| Tinarie Van Wyk-Loots\n| Tshamano Sebe\n| Blood & Water\n| The Riviera\n| Rhythm City\n| Andries Smit\n| Dineo Langa Mpho Popps  Graeme Richards\n| Virtual Event\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|16th SAFTA\n| 3 September 2022\n| I Am All Girls\n| Hlubi Mboya-Arnold\n| Jafta Mamabolo\n| 4 Mure\n| Tali's Baby Diary\n| Suidooster\n| Ebenhaezer Smal\n| Khutso Theledi Mpho Popps  Ryle De Morny\n| Virtual Event\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|17th SAFTA\n| 30 September 2023\n| Gaia\n| Noxolo Dlamini\n| Jarrid Geduld\n| Lavish\n| How to Ruin Christmas\n| Scandal!\n| Pierre-Henri Wicomb\n| Zozibini Tunzi  Lawrence Maleka  Carl Wastie\n| Gallagher Estate\n|- style=\"height:60px\"\n|18th SAFTA\n| 26 October 2024\n| The Fragile King\n| Antoinette Louw\n| Vusi Kunene\n| Shaka iLembe\n| Yoh!

The entry application had been submitted by the SABC, without consulting the head producer, Friedrich Stark, whose name was on the application. It was then signed by an intern, violating the SAFTA entry requirements. Vundla stated that the Generations'' entries at the 2nd South African Film and Television Awards were \"pushed through\" by the SABC and accepted by SAFTA after the judging process had already been completed. This brought into question the integrity of the ceremony, Vundla explained that he would not be \"coerced\" into entering again and that the \"awards must first get their house in order\". The Generations production team did not attend the ceremony, as Vundla explained he wanted to avoid \"creating the impression that Generations in any way supports [the SAFTAs]\". The NFVF CEO, Eddie Mbalo, publicly stated his \"disappoint\" in Vundla's decision to withdraw the nominations and believed the team was being \"denied the opportunity to be acknowledged\" by the industry.\nAward categories\nThe South African Film & Television Award is awarded in the following categories:[https://www.nfvf.co.za/call-for-entries-is-now-open-for-the-19th-annual-south-african-film-television-awards-saftas19/]\nFeature Film\n* Best Feature Film\n* Best Actor in a Feature Film\n* Best Actress in a Feature Film\n* Best Supporting Actor in a Feature Film\n* Best Supporting Actress in a Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Directing - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Scriptwriting - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Cinematography - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Original Song - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Original Music/Score - Feature Film\n* Best Animation\n* Best Short Film\n* Best Student Film\n* Best Achievement in Production Design - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Sound Design - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Costume Design - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Make-Up & Hairstyling - Feature Film\n* Best Achievement in Editing - Feature Film\nDocumentary\n* Best Documentary Feature\n* Best Documentary Short\n* Best Achievement in Directing - Documentary\n* Best Achievement in Cinematography - Documentary\n* Best Achievement in Sound Design - Documentary\n* Best Achievement in Editing - Documentary\nTelevision/Soap/Telenovela\nPrograms\n* Best TV Drama\n* Best TV Comedy\n* Best TV Soap\n* Best Telenovela\n* Best Made for TV Movie\n* Best Variety Show\n* Best Current Affairs Programme\n* Best Structured or Docu-Reality Show\n* Best Lifestyle Programme\n* Best Educational Programme\n* Best Children’s Programme\n* Best Entertainment Programme\n* Best International Format\n* Best Competition Reality Show\n* Best Structured Soapie Reality Show\n* Best Youth Programme\nLead actor\n* Best Actor in a TV Drama\n* Best Actor in a TV Comedy\n* Best Actor in a TV Soap\n* Best Actor in a Telenovela\nLead actress\n* Best Actress in a TV Drama\n* Best Actress in a TV Comedy\n* Best Actress in a TV Soap\n* Best Actress in a Telenovela\nSupporting actor\n* Best Supporting Actor in a TV Drama\n* Best Supporting Actor in a TV Comedy\n* Best Supporting Actor in a TV Soap\n* Best Supporting Actor in a Telenovela\nSupporting actress\n* Best Supporting Actress in a TV Drama\n* Best Supporting Actress in a TV Comedy\n* Best Supporting Actress in a TV Soap\n* Best Supporting Actress in a Telenovela\nDirecting\n* Best Achievement in Directing - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Directing - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Directing - TV Soap\n* Best Achievement in Directing - Telenovela\nScriptwriting\n* Best Achievement in Scriptwriting - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Scriptwriting - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Scriptwriting - TV Soap\n* Best Achievement in Scriptwriting - Telenovela\nOriginal music\n* Best Achievement in Original Music/Score - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Original Music/Score - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Original Music/Score - TV Soap\n* Best Achievement in Original Music/Score - Telenovela\n* Best Achievement in Original Song\nProduction design/art direction\n* Best Achievement in Art Direction - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Art Direction - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Art Direction - TV Soap\n* Best Achievement in Art Direction - Telenovela\nSound design\n* Best Achievement in Sound - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Sound - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Sound - TV Soap/Telenovela\nCostume design/wardrobe\n* Best Achievement in Wardrobe - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Wardrobe - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Wardrobe - TV Soap/Telenovela\nMake-up & hairstyling\n* Best Achievement in Make-Up & Hairstyling - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Make-Up & Hairstyling  - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Make-Up & Hairstyling - TV Soap/Telenovela\nEditing\n* Best Achievement in Editing - TV Drama\n* Best Achievement in Editing  - TV Comedy\n* Best Achievement in Editing - TV Soap\n* Best Achievement in Editing  - Telenovela\nVisual effects\n* Best Achievement in SFX - Film & TV\n* Best Achievement in VFX - Film & TV\nThe following special awards may be awarded at the discretion of the SAFTA Executive and Judging Committees:[https://www.nfvf.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Final-SAFTAs18-Discretionary-awards-Call.pdf]\n* Lifetime Achiever Award\n* Emerging Filmmaker\n* Youth Achiever\n* Outstanding Person with Disability Contributor Award\n* Outstanding Provincial Contributor Award\nSee also\n* List of television awards\n* Cinema of South Africa\n* Television in South Africa\n* List of South African films\n* List of South African television series\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nfvf.co.za/about-the-saftas/ Official SAFTAs site]"
