Edward Powlett Blunt. His brother was the judge Sir Arthur Salter. Herbert was educated at Wimborne Grammar School and, from 1876, Winchester College (on a scholarship). He then studied at New College, Oxford, graduating with a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1886 and then another first in Theology the following year.\nCareer, work and recognition\nSalter trained for the priesthood at Cuddesdon College and was ordained Deacon at Cuddesdon Church on  27 June 1888. He then served as Curate at Sandhurst, and was ordained Priest at Oxford in 1889. In 1891, he left that office to be vice-principal of Leeds Clergy School. He was then vicar of Mattingley (1893–99) and Shirburn, Oxfordshire (1899–1909). During his incumbency of the latter parish he began to gather material for its history, which eventually led to him editing documents for publication by the Oxford Historical Society (OHS). He devoted the rest of his life to studying the history of Oxford, the city's university and the county; he edited 34 volumes for the OHS alone, but also wrote historical works. As The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes, \"Salter came to be recognised as the leading authority on Oxford history since Anthony Wood\".\nSalter was elected a research fellow at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1918; he used the stipend to fund publication costs. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy and an honorary freeman of Oxford in 1930; in 1933 was given an honorary DLitt by the university; and in 1934 he gave the Ford Lectures at the University of Oxford. That year, he was the subject of a Festschrift.\nSalter retired from his fellowship at Magdalen in 1939.\nHe died at his home in Sturminster Newton in Dorset on 23 April 1951. His first wife Beatrice, née Ruddach, had died in 1932, and the following year he married his second wife, Miss Gladys Nina Dewar, who survived him. There were four children from the first marriage.\nSelected publications\nNote: POHS = Publications of the Oxford Historical Society.
