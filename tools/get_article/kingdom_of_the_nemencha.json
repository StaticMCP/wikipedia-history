The historicity of the kingdom was proposed by the French historian Christian Courtois in his 1955 book ''Les Vandales Et L'Afrique''. Whether this kingdom existed as a real polity, however, is far from certain, with the historian Abdallah Laroui arguing that Courtois's reasoning for its existence is \"problematic\".\nSee also\n* Mauro-Roman Kingdom\n* Exarchate of Africa\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
