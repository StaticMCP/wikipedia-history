The period saw four short-reigned emperors from Irene Palaiologina, to Anna Anachautlou,to John III Megas Komnenos and finally Michael Megas Komnenos and political instability and saw two factions emerged the Scholarioi faction a military unit and the aristocratic family Amytzantarioi the and the within the empire all the while foreign states like Genoa and the Turks began taking advantages of the internal conflicts of Trebizond. It ended with the accension of Alexios III Megas Komnenos ending the series of civil wars in the empire of Trebizond.\nBackground\nThe Empire of Trebizond was established in 1204 following the collapsed of the Byzantine Empire. It was founded by two brothers Alexios I and David Megas Komnenos, who they are the grandsons of Andronikos I Komnenos. From Alexios I to John II, the empire becomes one of the three major rump states challenging the title claim of Roman Emperor against the Despotate of Epirus and the Empire of Nicaea in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. After Michael VIII Palaiologos retook Constantinople from the Latin crusaders, he convinced the Empire of Trebizond to give up the title of Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans. In 1282 John II Megas Komnenos abandoned the title and took the title of Emperor and Autocrat of all of the east, Iberia and Perateia as part of the Treaty of 1282. When Alexios II took the throne after the death of his father (John II), he brought the empire to its golden age since Manuel I under his reign.\nWhen Alexios II died in 1330, the empire was thrown into chaos when his son Andronikos III came to the throne and began executing his younger brothers George Azachoutlou and Michael Achpougas thus blunging the empire into political instability. When he died from a plague in 1332 his son Manuel II succeeded him, however though he would depose that same year by Basil Megas Komnenos. During his reign, the factional strife continued. According to George Finlay, the great officers and principal nobles had become petty sovereigns, reducing the countryside to anarchy. Contemporary and later accounts describe increasing insubordination among the Scholarioi; Basil reportedly employed foreign mercenaries for personal protection. Some historians interpret these developments as contributing to his unpopularity. To make matters worse there was factionalism within its court and among the two factions are the Scholarioi and the Amytzantarioi an influential aristocratic family. In 1334 Basil married Irene Palaiologina the daughter of Andronikos III Palaiologos forming an alliance with the Byzantines, however the couple's relationship soured and Basil to a mistress another Irene and divorce Irene Palaiologina. Basil died in 1340; some sources and later historians have suggested poisoning as a possible cause, allegedly involving Irene Palaiologina, though this remains debated. His death precipitated a period of dynastic dispute and factional conflict within the empire..\nTimeline\nIrene Palaiologina\nBy the time Basil have died Irene Palaiologina had ascended to the throne as empress ruling in her own right and becoming the second empress of Trebizond after Theodora Grand Komnene. Irene was backed by Amytzantarioi an aristocratic family against the Scholarioi as well as John the Eunuch. The archons under the megas doux Tzanichites were outrage over the death of the former emperor and they encamped themselves in the Monastery of St. Eugenios within the walls of the city, near the imperial palace and began revolting against the empress. For two months this party sat watching the faction of Irene and her supporters, engaging in daily skirmishes to no permanent result, until July 2, 1340, when the megas doux decided for Irene. John the Eunuch directed his siege engines against the monastery, destroying it almost completely, and defeating the rebels. Tzanchites was amongst the rebels taken as prisoners and sent to Limnia where they were executed a year later in 1341. During this time the Turkmens took advantage of this and attacked Trebizond and marched up to the walls of the capital itself. A first attack was repelled on the Parcharia (\"the downs\"), but the second (July 1341) could not be stopped by the demoralized army of Irene, and the Turkmen set fire to much of Trebizond without being able to capture it. The catastrophe was exacerbated by the outbreak of an epidemic, which Michael Panaretos claims arose from the foul stench of the rotting corpses of horses and men. As a result unable to deal with many threats both internal and external, the Amytzantarioi faction abandoned her and supported her sister-in-law Anna Anachoutlou with the support of the Laz and other Kartvelian tribes they overthrew Irene Palaiologina on July 17th, 1341. The historian Miller writes about the event saying, \"The ease with which she accomplished the dethronement of Irene may be explained by the fact that, whereas the latter represented the foreign court of Byzantium, she represented the local dynasty, which in nearly a century and a half had thoroughly identified itself with the country.\" .\nAnna Anachoutlou\nAnna secured herself on the throne after overthrowing her sister-in-law but the situation under her reign was much more chaotic.The Scholarioi, as well as several unaffiliated noble families, such as the Tzanichitai, Doranitai, Kamachenoi, Kabazitai and Meizomatai, were just as opposed to Anna as they had been to Irene due to the influence of the Laz and the Amytzantarioi faction. Soon she would be challenged by Michael Grand Komnenos supported by the Eastern Roman Empire. The reason for his appearance was not actually to claim the throne, but rather that he had been selected by the regents of Andronikos III Palaiologos's young son, John V Palaiologos, as the most suitable husband for Irene Palaiologina. Arriving with three Byzantine warships and a contingent of Byzantine troops, Michael landed near Trebizond without opposition and was received by the other leaders of the Scholarioi. Though it looked likely that Michael himself would claim the throne, his arrival alongside Byzantine troops and his intention to marry Irene frustrated the Laz who had supported Anna and had driven Irene from the throne. Doubtful of whether they had the support of the people, the Laz worked to ensure Anna's continued rule through treachery. Soon after arriving, Michael was received by the local Metropolitan, Akakios, and received oaths of allegiance from various officials and nobles. His coronation as emperor was supposed to take place the following day, but that morning he was met with widespread dissent and opposition. Throughout the night, the Laz, and various nobles sympathetic to Anna's cause, had worked to incite rebellion among the people of the city. After a hard-fought battle, the Laz troops defeated Michael's Byzantine troops and captured the three Byzantine warships that had escorted him. Shortly after this victory, Anna dealt with both Michael and Irene. Irene was sent back to her family in Constantinople, whereafter she disappears from history, and Michael was sent as a prisoner to the town of Oinaion and was later transferred to somewhere in the region of Limnia in the westernmost parts of the empire. Anna Anachoutlou defeated an Aq Qoyunlu incursion during her reign; nevertheless, the political opposition within Trebizond persisted and this led to some of the Amytzantarioi faction stopped supporting her.\nAlthough she was able to get rid of Irene and Michael the threat of the Scholarioi remains intact. The unaffiliated families who fled from Trebizond aboard a Venetian ship went to Constantinople and decided to pick another candidate for the throne John III Grand Komnenos Michael's son. John III accepts it and got approval by the Byzantine Government, along the way they also received three ships for support from Genoa. On September 1342, the Scholarioi succeeding in deposing Anna and on 3 September 1342 she was strangled to death. The next day they crowned John emperor.\nJohn III Megas Komnenos\nShortly after his coronation in the Panagia Chrysokephalos Church, the Scholarioi began executing nobles who supported Anna or the Amytzantarioi faction. Despite being in his early 20s he was a weak, and dissolute ruler, who cared only for entertainment, self-indulgence, and luxury; he showed no interest over his own father who remained the prisoner of megas doux John the Eunuch according to historians William Miller and George Finlay. This made the aristocrats who elevated John apparently grew dissatisfied with him, for Niketas Scholares and others they freed his father Michael from captivity at Limnia and put him on the throne on May 1344, and had John banished to the monastery of St. Sabas.\nMichael Grand Komnenos\nWhen Michael become emperor he granted Niketas the title of megas doux and was forced to sign the document which gave Niketas and his ministers almost all power in the Empire, promising to seek their counsel in all official actions. This constitutional experiment was short-lived, because the greatest opposition came from the people of Trebizond. They were infuriated to see the Emperor stripped of his effective authority and rose up in revolt against the oligarchy of the Scholarioi. Michael swiftly took advantage of the opportunity, and arrested and imprisoned Niketas in 1345 along with his associate Gregory Meitzomates and others of their party, this move alienated the Scholarioi. However due to his elder years and that he is sick he released Niketas from prison and restored to him his former office of megas doux on December 13, 1349. In the meantime, the external powers like the Turks began taking advantage of it and invaded the Empire of Trebizond in 1346, capturing the towns of Hagios Andreas and Oinaion. In September 1347, the Black Death struck Trebizond, raging for seven months. Its effects on the city is unclear: Andrew Libadenos, who was at Trebizond at the time, makes no mention of the epidemic, while Michael Panaretos describes how the Black Death carried off \"many: children, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, mothers, and kinsmen.\" Another Turkmen invasion the following year led to a three-day battle. Despite the victory, Michael's reputation as ruler was not strengthened due to his extreme unpopularity. Then came another threat in 1348, when the Genoese seized Kerasous, the second most important city of the Empire in revenge for a massacre of Genoese by the Trapezuntines some years earlier. In May 1349, a Genoese expedition from Caffa was launched against Trebizond. The small Trapezuntine fleet under Megas doux John Kabazites was destroyed and the people of Trebizond responded to this defeat by killing any Westerner they found in the capital. Eventually, peace was reached with the Genoese, but in exchange for Kerasous they were given the fortress of Leonkastron. From now on Trebizond's commercial capacity was lessened even further, as the Genoese came to increasingly command the lucrative Black Sea trade of the port which further devastated the economy of Trebizond. As a result of these failures Niketas sees the opportunity and on December 22 1349, Niketas led a palace coup that deposed Michael and place on the throne John the son of Emperor Basil, who took the name of Alexios III of Trebizond.\nParticipants\n'Scholarioi and allies'\n* Scholarioi\n* Palaiologos (From 1341)\n* Pro-Scholarioi Grand Komnenos\n* Pro-Scholarioi Trapezuntine Army\n* Genoese Contingents\n* Venetian Contingents\n* Byzantine Contingents and Mercenaries (From 1341)\n* Scholares Family\n* Tzanichitai Family\n* Doranitai Family\n* Kamachenoi Family\n* Kabazitai Family\n* Meizomatai Family\n* Pro-Scholarioi Trapezuntine provinces\n* Other Pro-Scholarioi Trapezuntine Nobility\n* Pro-Scholarioi Trapezuntine Archonships\n* Pro-Scholarioi Trapezuntine Populace\nSupported by:\n* Byzantine Empire (From 1341)\n* Republic of Genoa (For John III)\nAmytzantarioi and allies\n* Amytzantarioi\n* Pro-Amytzantarioi Grand Komnenos\n* Palaiologos (Unti 1341)\n* Pro-Amytzantarioi Trapezuntine provinces\n* Byzantine Contingents and Mercenaries (Until 1341)\n* Laz People\n* Georgian Contingents\n* Pro-Amytzantarioi Trapezuntine Army\n* Other Pro-Amytzantarioi Trapezuntine Nobility\n* Pro-Amytzantarioi Trapezuntine Archonships\n* Zan People\n* Mingrelian People\n* Pro-Amytzantarioi Trapezuntine Populace\nSupported by:\n* Byzantine Empire (Until 1341)\n* Kingdom of Georgia (For Anna)\nAftermath\nOnce Alexios III was on the throne, he was able to become a capable ruler and dismissed Niketas in 1354 leading to revolts and rebellions by the Scholarioi and some of the nobles, but Alexios defeated the Scholarioi nobles including Constantine, Gregory and others in 1352, with only Niketas remaining in the Siege of Kenchrina in 1355 thus bringing an end to the violence and restoring stability. In that same year Michael attempted to reclaim the throne but was not successful. Although Alexios III reign did see recovery and a golden age under him the empire never recovers to its former strength, and the empire will continue to exist for over a hundred years until the Ottomans conquest in 1461\nSee Also\n* Byzantine Civil War of 1341-47\n* Byzantine Civil War of 1321-28\n* Struggle for Constantinople\nSources and research\nPrimary sources:\n* Michael Panaretos, Chronicle\nSecondary sources:\n* Anthony Bryer & David Winfield, The Byzantine Monuments and Topography of the Pontos (DOS.
