The battle ended on 20 August 2014.\nAftermath\n18 Druze fighters died in the battle, among them the brother of Wahid al-Balous.\nThe battle was known as \"al-Karama battle\" or \"battle of dignity\" and the groups that participated in it were called Men of Dignity. At the funeral, in the city's municipal stadium, Wahid al-Balous appeared and declared himself to be the leader of the group Men of Dignity, in addition to declaring that the Ba'athist Syria \"shot his men in the back\".\nIn September 2015, a car bomb exploded, killing Wahid al-Balous. The person whom the Assad regime declared responsible for the act was a militant from Al-Nusra Front, Wafi Abu Trabi.\nSee also\n* Qalb Loze massacre - Massacre committed in Qalb Loze by Al-Nusra Front against Druze\n* Druze insurgency in Southern Syria (2025–present) - Clashes after the Fall of Assad between Druze and Sunni Bedouin tribes.\nReferences"
