In February, 1862, Confederate general Earl Van Dorn ordered that all units under his command use this flag as their regimental colors.  The 4th Missouri and 15th Arkansas infantry regiments carried this flag into battle, as well as some of Van Dorn's old units in the Army of Mississippi and East Louisiana.\nThe original flag was designed by Mrs. Constance Harrison and presented to Van Dorn during his time in Virginia in 1861. The thirteen stars in the Van Dorn battle flag reflect the thirteen states admitted to the Confederacy, including Kentucky and Missouri.\nSee also\n*Flags of the Confederate States of America\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.scv674.org/csaflags.htm Confederate Flag History], website featuring Confederate Flag History, including [http://www.scv674.org/Van%20Dorn%20Flag.jpg an image] of the Van Dorn battle flag"
