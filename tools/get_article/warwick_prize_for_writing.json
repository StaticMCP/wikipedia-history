It was launched by the University of Warwick in July 2008. Past nominations included scientific research, novels, poems, e-books and plays. Works were open to be nominated by staff, students and alumni of Warwick University, and since 2014, the publishing industry.\nThe Prize Management Group\nThe Prize Management Group of the Warwick Prize for Writing was made up of senior professors and administrative staff drawn from across the faculties and included the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Warwick. The Prize Management Group was responsible for the administration of the prize, including agreeing the rules, the guidelines for the judges and the arrangements for the award of the prize.
