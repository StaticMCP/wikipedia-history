      "text": "# United States presidential elections in Alabama\n\n| voted_winning = 27\n| voted_losing = 24\n}}\nFollowing is a table of United States presidential elections in Alabama, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1819, Alabama has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864, during the American Civil War, when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy.\nA socially conservative Deep South state, Alabama was dominated by the Democratic Party for most of its history, voting almost exclusively Democratic from the founding of the party in the 1820s until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Since the 1980s, the state has become heavily Republican, like most of the south.\nNotably, Alabama has also almost always voted for the same presidential candidate as neighboring Mississippi. In more than two hundred years of presidential elections, they have supported the same candidate in all but one; the election of 1840, when Mississippi voted for William Henry Harrison and Alabama for Martin Van Buren (in 1868, only Alabama participated, as Mississippi had not yet been readmitted to the Union).\nWinners of the state are in bold. The shading refers to the state winner, and not the national winner.\nElections from 1864 to present\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become president, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The popular vote was primarily directed to filling the office of vice president. Alabama had its electors chosen not by the people, but by the State House and Senate. George W. Philips, Henry Minor and John Scott were selected by the legislature and all three men voted for James Monroe.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1820 United States presidential election in Alabama\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican\n|George W.
