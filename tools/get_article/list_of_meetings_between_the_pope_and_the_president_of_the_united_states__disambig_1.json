The goal was that the United States acquire these lands then sell them to Filipino farmers to give them a stake in the new government and address resentment against the mostly Spanish priests who held much of the arable land. The Pope promised to study the issue and expressed support for the American pacification program, which was agreed to and implemented by 1904.\nand Jill Biden on April 12, 1980.]]\nWhile Joe Biden was serving as a U.S. Senator, he met with Pope John Paul II on April 12, 1980 at the Vatican.

Roosevelt had no intention of meeting the missionaries, but he declined to submit to Pius X's conditions and the interview did not take place. Theodore Roosevelt called the entire papal episode, \"An elegant row.\"\nIn July 2023, Bill Clinton visited Pope Francis at Casa di Santa Marta in Vatican City.
