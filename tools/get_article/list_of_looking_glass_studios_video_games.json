The company's first game was Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss in 1992, which received widespread critical acclaim and sold nearly 500,000 units. Looking Glass proceeded to develop titles in multiple genres, including role-playing, sports, flight simulation, and stealth video games. These titles were primarily published by Origin Systems, Electronic Arts and Eidos Interactive, with three titles self-published by Looking Glass Studios.\nLooking Glass' products were praised for innovations in video game technology and design. Several of their successes, such as Flight Unlimited and Thief: The Dark Project, sold over half a million copies each. Poor sales of their final two self-published games—Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri (1996) and British Open Championship Golf (1997)—left the company in financial turmoil, however. This, combined with multiple failed business deals, including a temporary merger with Intermetrics from 1997 to 1999, led the company to close on May 24, 2000, and cancel several projects in development. Its final project, ''Jane's Attack Squadron, was completed by Mad Doc Software and released by Xicat Interactive in 2002. In total, Looking Glass Studios released 12&nbsp;original games in its 10&nbsp;years of activity, alongside several ports and other spin-offs.\nGames\n(FM Towns version)\n| multiplereleasedates=yes\n| release=1992&nbsp;– DOS1993&nbsp;– FM Towns1997&nbsp;– PlayStation2002&nbsp;– Windows Mobile\n| notes=\n*First-person computer role-playing game, set in the fantasy world of the Ultima series\n*Developed by Blue Sky Productions and published by Origin Systems\n*Ported in Japan to FM Towns by Origin\n*Ported to Windows Mobile by ZIO Interactive|PAL|December 1992}}\n| multiplereleasedates=yes\n| release=1992&nbsp;– Sega Genesis\n| notes=*Genesis version of John Madden Football '93\n*Developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Electronic Arts\n}}\n| multiplereleasedates=yes\n| release=1993&nbsp;– DOS\n| notes=*Sequel to Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss that continues the first-person computer role-playing game style, in the fantasy world of the Ultima series.\n*Developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Origin Systems\n}}\n| multiplereleasedates=yes\n| release=1994&nbsp;– DOS1994&nbsp;– Macintosh\n| notes=*First-person science fiction game inspired by Ultima Underworld''\n*Originally released on floppy discs; re-released months later on CD-ROM with voice acting\n*Developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Origin Systems\n}}\n| multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1995&nbsp;– DOS1995&nbsp;– Windows1997&nbsp;– Macintosh\n|notes=*Aerobatic flight simulator that uses real-time computational fluid dynamics\n*The first game self-published by Looking Glass Technologies\n*A commercial success, with 780,000 units in sales\n}}\n| multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1996&nbsp;– DOS\n|notes=*Tactical shooter with squad mechanics and outdoor environments\n*Looking Glass Technologies' second self-published game\n*A commercial failure, with 100,000 units in sales\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=no\n|release=1997&nbsp;– Windows\n|notes=*Golf game based on The Open Championship\n*Third and final self-published game by Looking Glass Technologies\n*A commercial failure\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1997&nbsp;– Windows\n|notes=*Sequel to Flight Unlimited, focused on general aviation\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1998&nbsp;– Windows\n|notes=*A first-person stealth game\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive\n*A commercial success, with over 500,000 units in sales\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1999&nbsp;– Nintendo 64\n|notes=*Nintendo 64 version of Command & Conquer\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Nintendo\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1999&nbsp;– Windows\n|notes=*Sequel to System Shock\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games and published by Electronic Arts\n*Sega Dreamcast port was planned but cancelled\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1999&nbsp;– Windows\n|notes=*A general aviation flight simulator and the third Flight Unlimited game\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Electronic Arts\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=1999&nbsp;– Nintendo 64\n|notes=*A port of Destruction Derby to the Nintendo 64\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by THQ\n}}\n|release=1999&nbsp;– Windows\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|notes=*Expanded re-release of Thief: The Dark Project that features three additional missions\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive|PAL|March 31, 2000}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|release=2000&nbsp;– Windows\n|notes=*Stealth game sequel to Thief: The Dark Project\n*Developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos Interactive\n}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|notes=*Combat flight simulator video game\n*Initially developed by Looking Glass Studios to be published by Electronic Arts, later finished by Mad Doc Software and released by Xicat Interactive\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20000301062711/http://www.lglass.com/ Official website] (Archived)"
