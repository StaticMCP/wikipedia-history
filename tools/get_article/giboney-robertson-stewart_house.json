It is a two-story wood-frame structure with a cross-gable roof, erected in 1895 for W. A. and Ann Giboney.  It is one of the city's finest Queen Anne Victorians, and the only one two stories in height.  It has the irregular massing typical of the style, and a wraparound one-story porch supported by Tuscan columns.  Originally erected with a turret, that feature was removed sometime before the 1940s.  The house has been owned by members of the locally prominent Robertson family, who were judges and lawyers, and by Doctor T. J. Stewart, one of the area's first medical practitioners.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Cross County, Arkansas\nReferences"
