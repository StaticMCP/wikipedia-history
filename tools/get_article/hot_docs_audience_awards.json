There are currently two awards presented for feature films: the Hot Docs Audience Award, presented since 2001 to the most popular film overall regardless of nationality, and the Rogers Audience Award, presented since 2017 to the most popular Canadian film.\nAudience awards are also presented for mid-length and short films.\nThe Rogers Audience Award comes with a CA$50,000 prize from the Rogers Group of Funds, and is considered the most important award at the festival. Although the festival releases a preview list of the Top 20 contenders in audience award voting while the festival is underway, the Canadian films in the list are hidden, and identified only as a film that is eligible for the Rogers Award rather than by title, so as not to give away the Rogers Award contenders in advance of the final announcement. The festival concludes with a repeat screening of the Rogers Audience Award winner, following which the preview list is updated to reveal all of the hidden Canadian film titles.\nIf a Canadian film wins the overall award, then the Canadian award is not given to a different film in lieu, but instead the same film wins both awards. This practice was diverged from for the first time at the 2023 festival, where Philippe Falardeau's documentary television series Lac-Mégantic: This Is Not an Accident was the overall winner of the Audience Award; although a Canadian project, it comprised episodes of a television series rather than a feature film, and thus was not deemed eligible for the Rogers Award, which instead went to the film Someone Lives Here.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, in both 2020 and 2021 the festival opted to split the Canadian award and its associated prize money among all of the five highest-ranked Canadian films of the year instead of singling out only the top-ranked Canadian film. In 2022, the festival split the Canadian award among three films instead of five, and returned to naming a single winner in 2023.\nHot Docs Audience Award\n{|class = \"wikitable sortable\" width=100%\n|-\n!
