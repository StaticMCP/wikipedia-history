However, Giełgud made several mistakes and delayed the attack. As Russian reinforcements managed to arrive in Vilnius, they lined up at the front and took up convenient defensive positions, the forces were equal: 24,000 rebels against 24,000 Russians.\nThe place of battle\nThe Russians took up quite strong positions, but they were narrow and it was impossible to deploy enough troops, the escape routes were also blocked, which means that the slightest failure would lead to disaster.\nBattle\nGiełgud's inept command led to inconsistencies along the entire front, instead of a joint attack, the Poles engaged in battles in parts, the infantry attacked before the artillery deployed and suffered heavy losses.\nThe roundabout measures also failed, Rolland stumbled upon the Russian guard and returned having lost part of the troops.\nRussian gradually turned to attacks, but the actions of the cavalry were not so successful, the cavalry battle ended with the victory of the Poles, and the Russian cavalry in a scattered form led them to the positions of the artillery, the battle could have been lost, but the infantry hit the main troops of Rolland in time, the Poles turned into a stampede.\nThe pursuit could not be organized due to the orders of the high command, although with it the entire corps of 20,000 could be exterminated. The main reason for the defeat of the Poles lay in the inability to conduct joint actions, while the Russians acted very harmoniously.\nGiełgud reached the Prussian border and wanted to cross it, but was killed by his own soldier: Lieutenant Skulski, who suspected Giełgud of treason.\nAftermath\nPolish-Lithuanian forces lost up to 2,000, (incl. 1,200 KIA, WIA, POWs or MIA and 800 deserted) and Russian army lost only 364 men. Most of the Lithuanian rebels dispersed after the battle, which was a heavy defeat that put an end to the uprising in Lithuania.\nReferences\nBibliography\nRussian-language sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPolish-language sources\n*"
