Most non-Yugoslav sources referred to the post as \"Prime Minister.\"\nHistory\nThe 1953 Yugoslav constitutional law proclaimed the country to be a socialist state and abolished the institutions of prime minister and Government that had existed since the country's establishment in 1918. A new office of president of the Republic was created for Yugoslav communist leader Josip Broz Tito which would be both the country's head of state and would simultaneously preside over the new Federal Executive Council (FEC). The then FEC was fundamentally different from governments to date. It was made up of 30 to 45 members elected from the Federal Assembly with only five of these members becoming state secretaries for one of five secretariats (rather than ministries) and two or more members becoming Vice President of the Federal Executive Council. Government ministries to date were dissolved and their work continued by various Federal Administrations headed by appointed directors.\nThe 1963 Yugoslav constitution separated some of the executive roles of the president of the Republic and moved them to the new office of president of the FEC who would preside over that body. The president of the FEC would be elected by the Federal Assembly upon their nomination by the president of the Republic.\nList\n|League of Communists of Yugoslavia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Union of Reform Forces|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Socialist Party of Serbia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | Head of Government\n!
