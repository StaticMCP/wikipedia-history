Based in Ambleside, Cumbria, England, BET aims to run around five expeditions per year, to destinations all over the world.   The group is aimed at young people (aged 16–25) from all backgrounds who share an interest in the outdoors and who want to \"learn new skills, make new friends, gain new self-confidence and discover new places on expeditions, in the UK, Europe and worldwide\". Run predominantly by volunteers, BEG engages professional leaders on a voluntary basis.\nHistory\nThe Summit of Jbel Toubkal in Morocco.|right|300px\nFounded by businessman Michael Scott in 1947, Brathay Exploration has since taken almost 10,000 participants on almost 700 expeditions all over the world. In 1997 the Royal Geographical Society awarded BET a Special Medal \"for services to exploration and youth adventurous activities\". Brathay Exploration was a founder member of the Young Explorers' Trust and has published a number of scientific and other reports, which are available from the Royal Geographical Society Expedition Advisory Centre.\nStructure\nBrathay Exploration Trust Ltd. is a Registered Charity (Reg.No. 1061156) run by a Board of elected Trustees. All of the Trustees and Members are volunteers, with the exception of the Trust's only employee, its part-time Administrator. The Administrator is responsible for running BET's Office and Headquarters at Shackleton Lodge, both of which are situated beside the River Brathay near Ambleside in Cumbria. Although all of the Expedition Leaders are also volunteers, many having risen through the ranks of members to eventually plan and implement their own trip and are now advised and guided by BET's Expedition Development Officer, a new role created in 2014 to help build and develop an exciting, diverse and high-quality itinerary of expeditions.\nSpiti River in India.|right|300px]]\nAnnual events\nThere are a number of regular events throughout the year:\nAnnual Reunion\nThere is an annual reunion (usually over the first weekend in the October half-term), where members and leaders of expeditions reunite and relive the fun of their expedition. In recent years, this has taken the form of formal presentations, followed by more informal discussions over drinks, followed by a ceilidh. The Annual Raft Race is also now a regular event.\nAnnual Dinner\nThere is also an annual dinner (usually held in January), where members can meet up and discuss past and future trips, as well as catching up on each other's news in yet another excuse for people to socialise!\nLeaders' Weekend\nThe main Leaders' weekend (usually held in March) is where leaders meet to discuss one another's trips, plan future events, feedback together and receive relevant information and training. It is also where most of the expeditions undergo their external vetting.\nMembers' Weekends\nMembers' weekends occur regularly throughout the year.  Accommodation at BET's Headquarters is free for all members, and it is a chance for members to catch up and spend a weekend in the hills.\nPrevious Expeditions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\"\n|+Past Expeditions\n|-\n| Year\n| Destination 1\n| Destination 2\n| Destination 3\n| Destination 4\n| Destination 5\n| Destination 6\n| Destination 7\n| Destination 8\n| Destination 9\n| Destination 10\n| Destination 11\n|-\n| 2010\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 2009\n| Norway\n| Spain\n| D of E\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 2008\n| India¹\n| Morocco\n| Corsica\n| Foula\n| D of E\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|2007\n| Bulgaria¹\n| India\n| Morocco\n| Mull\n| Norway\n| Romania¹\n| Scotland\n| D of E\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 2006\n| Tanzania\n| India\n| Guatemala\n| Malta/Gozo\n| Alps\n| Foula\n| John Muir Trail\n| Norway\n| D of E\n| Lake District¹\n| -\n|-\n| 2005\n| Alps (Tour Du Mont Blanc)\n| China\n| Via Feratta\n| Tanzania\n| Guernsey*\n| Morocco\n| South Africa\n| Mull\n| D of E\n| Lake District¹\n| -\n|-\n| 2004\n| Corsica\n| India\n| Alaska\n| Bolivia\n| Belize\n| Alps\n| Foula\n| D of E\n| Lake District\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 2003\n| Norway\n| Lake District\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 2002\n| Belize¹\n| Corsica\n| Ghana¹\n| India²\n| Lake District\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 2001\n| Oman\n| Ghana\n| India\n| South Africa\n| Malaysia\n| Canada\n| Romania\n| Corsica\n| Greece\n| Mull\n| Lake District\n|-\n| 2000\n| India\n| Svalbard\n| Mongolia\n| Belize\n| Alaska\n| Morocco\n| Norway\n| Alps\n| Scotland\n| Mull\n| Foula\n|}\n¹ Expedition cancelled\n² Due to problems in Kashmir, this expedition was altered to go to Morocco\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.brathayexploration.org.uk/ Brathay Exploration Trust]\n*"
