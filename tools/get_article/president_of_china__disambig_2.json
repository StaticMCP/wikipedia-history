On its own, it is a ceremonial office and has no real power in China's political system, though since 1993, the post has been concurrently held by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, who is China's de facto top leader. While the office has many of the characteristics of a head of state, the Constitution of China does not define it as such. The Chinese president was the third to fifth highest-ranking position when it was re-established in 1982.\nThe presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain functions performed by a head of state in most other countries. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. While the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), making the incumbent China's paramount leader and supreme commander of the armed forces.\nMao Zedong, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, rejected that the president of China functioned as China's head of state, arguing instead that the major differences between the Soviet system and the Chinese was that the presidency acted as a representative of the state collective leadership. Liu Shaoqi in his report on the 1954 Constitution of China, stated that the powers of the Chinese head of state was jointly exercised by the permanent organ, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the president. The president has no independent powers other than those bestowed by China's permanent organ.\nThe first state representative of China dates back to the Republican era when the post was held by Sun Yat-sen upon the establishment of the Republic on 1 January 1912. The presidency in its current form was the chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers and a stipulation that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. The term limits were abolished in 2018. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.\nHistory\nEstablishment in 1954\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution. Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental. The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defense Council.\" The National Defense Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference () and acts as its chairman.\" The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils. The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\nHistory up to 1974\nCCP chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman. After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman Dong Biwu as \"acting state chairman\".\nAbolition in 1975\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of state chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the CCP chairman supreme commander of the PLA in concurrence as chairman of the party CMC, while the duties of state representative were transferred to the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of state chairman, but did place a greater emphasis on the ceremonial roles performed by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as state representative.\nRestoration in 1982\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose. Research showed that having the NPCSC chairman as the national representative created problems, as the position was equivalent to the speaker of parliament in other countries. Deng Xiaoping agreed to restore the presidency, but without powers in specific government affairs, saying \"It is still necessary to have a President. It is better to have a President to represent the country, but the powers of the President can be defined in a more abstract way. He should not be in charge of specific work or interfere in specific government affairs\".\nThe office was reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982. In the 1982 Constitution, the party developed policy while the state executed it, and the president was conceived of as a ceremonial and replacement figure with a role similar to that of equivalent of figurehead presidents in parliamentary republics. Actual state power was vested in the general secretary of the Communist Party, the premier, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As part of the effort to prevent another leader from rising above the party as Mao had done, all four posts were intended to be held by separate people. The president therefore performed ceremonial duties such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. The constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on the chairman of the Central Military Commission Deng Xiaoping. He was effectively the paramount leader, as he had controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983–1988) and Yang Shangkun (1988–1993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state. Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then–Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.\nOn March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of general secretary of the party and CMC chairman, which do not have term limits.\nSelection\nEligibility\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n* be a Chinese citizen;\n* have the right to vote and stand for election;\n* be at least 45 years old.\nElection\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ. However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders. Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote. The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years. Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!No.\n!Year!!Electoral college!!Total Seats!!President-elect!!Voters!!For!!Against!!Abstain!!Result\n|-\n|1\n|1954||1st National People's Congress||1226||Mao Zedong||1210||1210||0||0||Elected\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2\n|1959||2nd National People's Congress||1235|| rowspan=\"2\" |Liu Shaoqi|| || || || ||Elected\n|-\n|1964||3rd National People's Congress||3040|| || || || ||Elected\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |N/A\n|1975||4th National People's Congress||2864|| colspan=\"6\" |Presidency vacant\n|-\n|1978||5th National People's Congress||3497|| colspan=\"6\" |Presidency abolished\n|-\n|3\n|1983||6th National People's Congress||2978||Li Xiannian|| || || || ||Elected\n|-\n|4\n|1988||7th National People's Congress||2970||Yang Shangkun||2970||2812||124||34||Elected\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |5\n|1993||8th National People's Congress||2977|| rowspan=\"2\" |Jiang Zemin||2918||2858||35||25||Elected\n|-\n|1998||9th National People's Congress||2983||2947||2882||36||29||Elected\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |6\n|2003||10th National People's Congress||2985|| rowspan=\"2\" |Hu Jintao||2944||2937||4||3||Elected\n|-\n|2008||11th National People's Congress||2987||2964||2956||3||5||Elected\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |7\n|2013||12th National People's Congress||2987|| rowspan=\"3\" |Xi Jinping||2956||2952||1||3||Elected\n|-\n|2018||13th National People's Congress||2980||2970||2970||0||0||Elected\n|-\n|2023||14th National People's Congress||2977||2952||2952||0||0||Elected\n|}\nPowers and duties\nThe president functions as the state representative of China both internally and externally. According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state organ that represents the PRC in state activities, but one person serves the presidency.\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councillors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honours. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC), which the office is subject to.\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic. Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of the state. It is, therefore, conceived to mainly function as a symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.\nIn theory, the president has discretion in selecting the premier, though in practice, the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the premier's nomination, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination. Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.\nThe director of the Office of the President of China is currently Han Shiming.\nPolitical ranking\nThe presidency has been the second-highest-ranking official in China's political system after the CCP general secretary since 1989. The political ranking of the presidency has changed throughout the decades, influenced by the officeholder of the time. 2nd President Liu Shaoqi was also the first-ranked vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party, behind CCP Chairman Mao Zedong. President Li Xiannian was also the 5th ranked member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the CCP general secretary and Chinese premier. President Yang Shangkun was not a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after CCP general secretary Zhao Ziyang/Jiang Zemin and CMC chairman Deng Xiaoping. Since Jiang Zemin's accession to the office in 1993, the president was also the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking first in party and state.\nPost title\nThe title of the office (), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".\nLine of succession\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China. If the office of president falls vacant, then the vice president succeeds to the office. If both offices fall vacant, then the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice president.\nCurrent line of succession\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
