The Sasanian emperor Yazdegerd III made it to Estakhr, which is approximately 8&nbsp;km northeast of Persepolis, the new capital of the Sasanian Empire and tried to plan an organized resistance against the Arabs.\nAfter some time he went to Gor, but Estakhr failed to put up a strong resistance, and was soon sacked by the Arabs, who killed over 40,000 inhabitants. The Arabs then quickly seized Gor, Kazerun and Siraf, while Yazdegerd III fled to Kerman and the Muslim conquest of Fars came to an end; however, the series of revolts still haunted the town until it was pacified for once by AD 693 and the status as provincial capital was moved to Shiraz.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
