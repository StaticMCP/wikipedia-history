      "text": "# Revolution (ultimate)\n\nThe Medellín Revolution (also known as Colombia Revolution) is a women's ultimate team based in Medellín, Colombia which competes professionally in the Premier Ultimate League (PUL) and as a club team in national and international competitions. The team has represented Colombia on the international stage numerous times. As a team, they are known for a unique free-spirited attitude and a fast-paced, relentless style of play; they are considered one of the top club teams in the world. Plays by several of their players have been selected for the ESPN SportsCenter Top 10 highlights show.\nThe Revolution club was co-founded by coach Mauricio Moore and Andrea Trujillo in 2004 in response to the lack of playing opportunities for women to play ultimate in Colombia. The Revolution have won 11 consecutive club women's championships in Colombia, beginning in 2009.\nThe Revolution joined the PUL for the league's inaugural 2019 season as the only competing team not based in the United States. The team went undefeated and won the 2019 PUL championship.\nAs a PUL team\nThe Revolution is one of the original eight teams in the Premier Ultimate League. They participated in a 2018 series of showcase games among several teams who would go on to become founding members of the PUL.\nThe team would have played its second season in 2020, but the PUL cancelled the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecord\nConsidered a clear front-runner for the 2019 regular season, the Revolution lived up to pre-season expectations and defeated the Atlanta Soul 30–20 in the first ever pro women's ultimate game in Colombia and again 24–17 in Atlanta, the Raleigh Radiance 16–13, the Columbus Pride 18–16, and the Indianapolis Red 16–6.  This record gave them a first-place finish in the league prior to playoffs. Again a heavy favorite in the playoffs, the Revolution defeated the Atlanta Soul 27–26 in a double overtime semifinal game before besting the Raleigh Radiance 20–14 in the championship game.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Reg.
