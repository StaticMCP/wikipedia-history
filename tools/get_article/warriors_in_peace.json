The song was written by Francis Lee and composed and produced by A. R. Rahman. It served as the theme song for the 2003 film Warriors of Heaven and Earth and was released as a single by Sony on September 10, 2003.\nRelease and promotion\nOn August 25, 2003, media outlets reported that Tsai had been invited to perform the theme song for Warriors of Heaven and Earth. On September 10, 2003, she held the \"Jolin Tsai VS Warriors of Heaven and Earth\" music video premiere at the Beijing International Club. She described it as her first experience recording for a major motion picture and expressed her intent to balance the film's atmosphere with her own musical style. Film director He Ping praised Tsai's gentle voice, which he felt was a fitting match for the film's tone. He invited Indian composer A. R. Rahman to produce the track, with production costs reportedly reaching RMB 1 million.\nOn September 11, 2003, Tsai attended the \"Warriors in Peace\" launch ceremony at the Portman Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai. During the event, she addressed concerns about whether her voice would suit the style of the film, explaining that film music does not always require a strong or forceful tone, a softer voice could also effectively convey the intended emotion and harmony.\nComposition and recording\nTsai traveled to India to record the song, where she waited at her hotel until A. R. Rahman personally called her to begin recording. The track marks a departure from Tsai's earlier pop-oriented work, featuring a rich, exotic atmosphere characterized by grandeur and melancholy. Tsai described her recording experience, saying, \"When the music starts playing, you immediately feel how passionate your emotions are.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Warriors in Peace\" was produced with a budget exceeding NT$1 million. Filmed on 35mm, it featured extensive post-production CGI effects designed to evoke a vast and desolate mood, complementing the song's tone. The video centers around the theme of \"love and peace\" and incorporates ethnic motifs and visual symbolism. Tsai appears in flowing white veils, performing choreography inspired by Indian dance in a desert setting. She personally selected all of the accessories featured in the video.\nLive performances\nTsai performed \"Warriors in Peace\" at the global premiere of Warriors of Heaven and Earth on September 23, 2003, at Duanmen in Beijing. She also performed the song at the film's Taiwan premiere on October 1, 2003.\nTrack listing\n# \"The Golden Era\" – 3:58\n# \"Warriors in Peace\" – 4:35\n# \"Dacoit Duel\" – 3:28\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release dates and formats for \"Warriors in Peace\"\n!Region\n!Date\n!Format(s)\n!Distributor\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Taiwan\n|September 10, 2003\n|Radio airplay\n|Sony\n|}\nReferences"
