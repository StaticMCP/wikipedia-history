He rated it 5.5, considering it \"a pretty skippable show from a promotion who's made it a mission to not put skippable shows on.\" He said that the show was \"filled with a lot of house show-esque efforts and a general lack of excitement\". He criticized the match between AJ Styles and Brian Myers, stating it \"useless\" but appreciated the six-man tag team match in the main event, calling it \"tremendous and\" \"pretty much worth the price of admission along with the Tag Title match\".\nHe rated the night two 8.0 calling it \"a show worthy of\" PWG's catalogue. According to him, \"There weren't any MOTYC's here, but everyone worked hard and provided PWG with a terrific variety of wrestling that no other promotions can give.\" He praised the match between ACH and Kenny Omega, considering it a \"must-see for this show\".\nHe rated the night three 8.5. He praised the overall event as \"an immensely entertaining tournament with a barrage of premium indy wrestling, comedy, and storytelling\". He criticized the length of night three as a very long event where \"the fans had to sit through 170 minutes of in-ring wrestling in a burning-up building\". There were \"fantastic matches all down the card\" but specific criticism was directed at the match between AJ Styles and Roderick Strong.\nAftermath\nRoderick Strong's assault on Kyle O'Reilly led to a match between the two for the PWG World Championship at Untitled II, where O'Reilly retained. However, Strong attacked O'Reilly and the referee Rick Knox after the match. The 2014 Battle of Los Angeles winner Ricochet received his title shot for the World Championship against Kyle O'Reilly at Black Cole Sun, but failed to win. Strong suddenly showed up after the match and attacked O'Reilly and forced him to give him an immediate World Championship title shot. O'Reilly accepted it as a Guerrilla Warfare match, which Strong won.\nResults\nTournament brackets\n| RD1-team3 =Zack Sabre Jr.\n| RD1-team4 =Adam Cole\n| RD1-score3=Pin\n| RD1-score4=18:03\n| RD1-team5 =Biff Busick\n| RD1-team6 =Roderick Strong\n| RD1-score5=Pin\n| RD1-score6=12:26\n| RD1-team7 =A.J.
