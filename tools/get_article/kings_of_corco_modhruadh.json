These districts were ruled by the Ó Conchubhair Corcomroe and Ó Lochlainn families, respectively.\nIn the 16th-century these areas became the English administrative baronies of Corcomroe and Burren.\nList of kings (incomplete)\nFor further references, see Annals of Inisfallen\n* Torpaid, died 769.\n* Flaithbertach mac Dub Ruip, died 873.\n* Cet mac Flaithbertach, 907–919\n* Aniudán mac Mael Gorm, died 936.\n* Conchobar mac Mael Sechnaill, fl. 993, died 1003.\n* Cathal mac Conchobur, died 1015\n* Lochlainn, died 1015.\n* Conchobar mac Mael Sechnaill, died 1027.\n* Congalach Ua Lochlainn, died 1045.\n* Anad Ua Lochlainn, killed 1060.\n* Conchobar Ua Chonchobuir, died 1104\nExternal links\n* http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100004/index.html"
