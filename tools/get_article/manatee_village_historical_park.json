The historical park contains 14 preserved and replica structures representative of the founding period, including the 1903 Wiggins General Store, the Fogarty Boatworks, the 1912 Stephens House, a smokehouse, a sugar cane mill, a barn, the 1887 Methodist church, the 1908 schoolhouse, the 1860 courthouse, a Cow Hunter's bunkhouse, and a steam engine. Museum visitors can also tour the nearby 1850 Manatee burying grounds. Admission is free.\nHistory\nIn 1974, a group of women formed the Heritage of Manatee’s Environment Committee after hearing of plans to tear down two historic buildings, the 1887 Methodist church and 1860 courthouse. The Committee worked with county officials to reestablish the Manatee County Historical Commission. The Commission had both historic buildings moved to the current museum location in December 1975 and restoration efforts began. Manatee Village Historical Park was officially opened on July 4, 1976. The museum has since grown to include 14 structures.\nStructures\nThe Manatee Village Historical Park contains 14 preserved and replica structures representing the cultural heritage of Manatee County's founding period of 1840-1918:\n# Old Cabbage Head: Named for its bulbous smoke stack, this 1913 train engine arrived in Manatee County in 1948 and was used to welcome visitors to Bradenton. The train engine was moved to the park in 2002.\n# Wiggins Store: A general store built in 1903 by entrepreneur King Wiggins. The store was one of the first brick buildings in the area. The building was condemned in 1983, but later restored and reopened in 1990. The store contains the museum's exhibits, gift shop, and staff offices.\n# Fogarty Boat Works: A boat yard built by John Fogarty and his brothers, William and Bartholomew, in 1866.
