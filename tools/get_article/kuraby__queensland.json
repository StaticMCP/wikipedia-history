Kuraby is serviced by a fast electric train service to Brisbane city and the Gold Coast, whilst a bus service takes commuters to the large shopping centres of Upper Mount Gravatt and Springwood.\nThe 1970s saw a Big W store with an adjoining Woolworths supermarket open in this suburb, which is now a part of the Underwood Marketplace.\nThe climate is sub-tropical with relatively dry winters and hot humid summers.\nIn practice one could throw a stick of wood into a creek one side of the suburb and eventually it would finish up in the Brisbane River whilst if one throws a stick in the opposite direction it would finish up in the Logan River. Both rivers eventually flow into Moreton Bay.\nBecause Kuraby is situated between these two rivers it tends to have a somewhat drier landscape than other parts of Brisbane. Rain tends to come up the Logan to the mountains [hills] behind Brisbane then back down the Brisbane River.\nThe topography ranges from high hills with very poor soil to low, very fertile soil areas.\nA number of parks are situated within the area these cater for all types of activities from sporting to leisure.\nThe local council has reserved large tracts of native bush in the area surrounding many of these parks. This in turn has ensured that many of the wildlife species of the area survives.\nHistory\nThe name \"Kuraby\" was officially gazetted on 16 August 1975 and derives from the local railway station name first used by the Railway Department in 1889, having previously been Spring Creek railway station. The name \"Kuraby\" refers to a creek near the railway station. Originally the name came from an aboriginal word meaning \"a place of many springs\".\nThe area of Kuraby was once known as Eight Miles Plains. Charles Baker was granted a Publican's Licence on 12 December 1865. The modern Glen Hotel now stands there.  This was where Cobb & Co changed horses and the passengers were refreshed before continuing their journey to Beenleigh and further south.\nThe settlement of Kuraby began in 1860, when the Hollosons and Bakers cleared land and commenced farming. However, it was the opening of the Kuraby rail station on the South Coast railway line in 1885 that the name Kuraby came to be used (in preference to Eight Mile Plains or Spring Creek, the name then used to distinguish the area from Eight Mile Plains). The Spring Creek Township was advertised for sale in 1887 with 151 lots available.\nThe Duke and Duchess of York opened the new Parliament House, Canberra, in 1927. Four years later they toured Australia, and in the middle of their hectic schedule, one night's rest was arranged. The Royal Train was brought to the passing loop at Kuraby station and kept securely there with its pilot train. The timetable was re-arranged to enable them to have an un-interrupted evening. This event put the name of Kuraby on the map.\nKuraby State School was opened in 1928 and is situated within bushland surrounds.\nSt John's Anglican Church at 1410 Beenleigh Road () was dedicated on 19 June 1960 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. It closed circa 1989. It was purchased in the early 1990s by the Islamic community and converted it into Kuraby Mosque.\nKuraby Special School opened in 1978.\nOn 21 September 2001, ten days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Kuraby Mosque was the subject of an arson attack, the first mosque in the world to be attacked as a consequence of the terrorist attacks. The mosque was rebuilt.\nAs at 2019, there is little evidence of agriculture as housing estates occupy the former farm land.\nDemographics\nIn the , Kuraby had  a population of 7,777 people, 51.4% female and 48.6% male.

The nearest government secondary schools are Runcorn State High School in neighbouring Runcorn to the west and Rochedale State High School in Rochedale to the north-east.\nCulture\nKuraby has a diverse population mix of old and young. Some of the older residents can trace their families back to the early settlement of the area. A number of the local streets now bear their name.\nMany nationalities from different parts of the world now call Kuraby home. The Muslim community has a mosque in Kuraby () while there is a Buddhist temple situated in a nearby suburb. Many other religions have their place of worship either in the suburb or in the surrounding suburbs. According to the 2021 census, Kuraby has the largest Muslim community of any suburb in Queensland, numbering 2,813 individuals and making up 31.2% of the suburb's population.\nYoung families are attracted to Kuraby as it has many facilities to cater for them.  Several doctors and a chemist have set up business in Kuraby to cater for the health needs of the population. Kuraby has its own community centre (the infrastructure is owned by the local council) and is run by a volunteer committee of local people who are responsible for seeing that the building is maintained and improvements are implemented.\nTransport\nKuraby railway station provides access to regular Queensland Rail City network services to Brisbane and Beenleigh.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://queenslandplaces.com.au/kuraby University of Queensland: Queensland Places: Kuraby]"
