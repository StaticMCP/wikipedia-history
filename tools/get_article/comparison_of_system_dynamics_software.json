Package name\n! Licensing\n! Implementation language\n! Last update (year)\n! More info\n|-\n| AMESim\n| , commercial\n| C\n| 2017\n| Distributed by Siemens. Modelica-models supported.\n|-\n|-\n| Analytica\n| , commercial, free limited version\n| C++\n| 2018\n| Supports system dynamics, Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty, array abstraction for handling multidimensional data, linear and non-linear optimization. Uses influence diagrams to define, navigate, and document models.\n|-\n| AnyLogic\n| , commercial, free Personal Learning Edition (PLE) for education, formal or not\n| Java\n| 2020\n| Supports system dynamics, agent based and discrete event modeling, allows making hybrid models.\n|-\n| ASCEND\n| , GNU General Public License (GPL)\n| C\n| 2012\n| For solving small to very large mathematical models, systems of non-linear equations, linear and nonlinear optimisation problems, dynamic systems expressed as differential-algebraic equations.\n|-\n| Berkeley Madonna\n| , commercial\n| C++, Java\n| 2018\n| Developed on Berkeley campus under sponsorship of NSF and NIH, used by academic and commercial institutions to build mathematical models for research and teaching.

DYNAMO software for microcomputers may be available via eBay or other resale sites.\n|-\n|GoldSim\n|, commercial\n|C++\n|2022\n|Differs from traditional system dynamics approaches in that 1) it puts much greater emphasis on probabilistic simulation techniques to support representation of uncertain and/or stochastic systems; and 2) it provides a wide variety of specialized model objects (beyond stocks, flows and converters) in order to make models less abstract (and hence more transparent) and help represent processes and events that cannot easily be represented using a traditional system dynamics approach. These differences are due to the fact that GoldSim is primarily used for engineering and scientific applications where quantitative probabilistic predictions of future performance are required.\n|-\n| iThink\n| , commercial\n| C++, JavaScript\n| 2018\n| System dynamics and discrete event modeling with some agent-based capabilities.
