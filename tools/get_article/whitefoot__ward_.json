Its area is  south-east of Charing Cross, and north of Downham, south of Catford, west of Grove Park, and east of Bellingham. The ward was named after Whitefoot Lane, which formed much of its northern boundary.\nPart of the South Eastern Main Line between Hither Green and Grove Park stations marked the whole eastern edge of the ward. The western boundary followed some of the Catford Loop Line, between Bellingham and Beckenham Hill stations, and small parts of two A-roads, South End Lane (A2218) and Bromley Road (A21).\nThe Whitefoot area is covered by two postcode districts,  in the south and  in the north; most of their common boundary follows Whitefoot Lane. Hither Green Cemetery is on the east side of the ward, and Forster Memorial Park in the west.\nOne of the ward's councillors from 2010 to 2019 was Labour's Janet Daby, who resigned to concentrate on her role as the MP for Lewisham East, which includes Whitefoot in its boundaries. She won the parliamentary seat at a 2018 by-election. In 2006, the Liberal Democrats won all three ward seats. Daby gained one in 2010, before the other two seats were gained by Labour in 2014. In 2021, all three seats were held by Labour.\nFrom 2022, Whitefoot was replaced by the new Catford South, Hither Green and Downham wards.\n2002–2022 Lewisham council elections\nThere was a revision in ward boundaries in Lewisham in 2002.\n2019 by-election\nThe by-election took place on 2 May 2019, following the resignation of Janet Daby.
