His name means \"the chief whose strength is attained through patience\".\nEarly life\nKeliʻiahonui was born May 13, 1869, at Kaʻalaʻa at the mouth of the Pauoa Valley, in Honolulu, on the old homestead of his aunt Queen Kapiʻolani. He was baptized by Bishop Thomas Nettleship Staley of the St. Andrew's Cathedral. His genealogy centered mainly on his ancestry as an heir of his great-grandfather Kaumualiʻi, the last ruling King of Kauaʻi. He shared his name with his great-uncle Kealiʻiahonui who was sometimes called the last prince of Kauaʻi. His mother Princess Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike was sister of Queen Kapiʻolani. His father was High Chief David Kahalepouli Piʻikoi, first cousin of King Kalākaua. Keliʻiahonui was initially educated at St. Alban's College (now ʻIolani School) and Punahou School.\nIn 1885, he and his brothers David Kawānanakoa and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole were sent abroad along with to attend Saint Matthew's School, a private Episcopal military school in San Mateo, California.\nPrince of Hawaii\nIn 1874 the Kalākaua Dynasty ascended to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, ending the Kamehameha Dynasty. On February 10, 1883, Keliʻiahonui was granted by letters patent the title of Prince and style of His Royal Highness by King Kalākaua along with his mother, brothers and aunt. Keliʻiahonui was not mentioned in the first-person accounts of the coronation ceremony for Kalākaua and Kapiʻolani coronation ceremony on February 14 of the same year despite his mother, aunts and brothers playing important parts in the ceremony.\nThe three brothers were known as the Piʻikoi Brothers or the \"Three Princes\". Being the middle son, he was in a difficult position. A year younger than his brother David, he was physically smaller than either of his brothers. He also fought illness more frequently. His brothers were adopted sons of the king and queen. He was adopted in the Hawaiian tradition of hānai to his aunt Princess Poʻomaikelani, while his brothers were adopted by King Kalākaua and Queen Kapiʻolani.\nWhile attending school in San Mateo, Edward and his brothers would travel south to the Pacific seashore at Santa Cruz. The brothers demonstrated the Hawaiian sport of board surfing to the locals, becoming the first California surfers in the summer of 1885. The historic first was reported on July 20, 1885, in the Santa Cruz Daily, \"The young Hawaiian Princes were in the water enjoying it hugely and giving interesting exhibitions of surf board swimming as practiced in their native land.\"\nKeliʻiahonui's health had always been weaker than his brothers. In 1887, Keliʻiahonui was sent home ill with typhoid fever from school in California. He died of typhoid fever at ʻIolani Palace shortly after arriving home on September 21, 1887, aged eighteen. He was buried in the Kalakaua Crypt, Royal Mausoleum called Mauna ʻAla in Nuʻuanu Valley, Oʻahu. Prince Edward Street in Waikiki is named after him.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSee also"
