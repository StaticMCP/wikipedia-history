The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC (Swat), Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan migrations.]]\nThe Cemetery H culture was a Bronze Age culture in the Punjab region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, from about 1900&nbsp;BCE until about 1300&nbsp;BCE. It is regarded as a regional form of the late phase of the Harappan (Indus Valley) civilisation (alongside the Jhukar culture of Sindh and Rangpur culture of Gujarat), but also as a phase of the Indo-Aryan migrations.\nOrigins\nThe Cemetery H culture was located in and around the Punjab region in present-day Pakistan and India. It was named after a cemetery found in \"area H\" at Harappa. Remains of the culture have been dated from about 1900&nbsp;BCE until about 1300&nbsp;BCE.\nAccording to Mohammad Rafique Mughal, the Cemetery&nbsp;H culture developed out of the northern part of the Indus Valley civilization around 1700&nbsp;BCE, being part of the Punjab Phase, one of three cultural phases that developed in the Localization Era or \"Late Harappan phase\" of the Indus Valley Tradition. According to Kenoyer, the Cemetery H culture \"may only reflect a change in the focus of settlement organization from that which was the pattern of the earlier Harappan phase and not cultural discontinuity, urban decay, invading aliens, or site abandonment, all of which have been suggested in the past.\" According to Kennedy and Mallory & Adams, the Cemetery H culture also \"shows clear biological affinities\" with the earlier population of Harappa.\nSome traits of the Cemetery H culture have been associated with the Swat culture, which has been regarded as evidence of the Indo-Aryan movement toward the Indian subcontinent. According to Parpola, the Cemetery&nbsp;H culture represents a first wave of Indo-Aryan migration from as early as 1900&nbsp;BCE, which was followed by a migration to the Punjab –1400 BCE. According to Kochhar, the Swat IV co-founded the Harappan Cemetery H phase in Punjab (2000–1800 BCE), while the Rigvedic Indo-Aryans of Swat&nbsp;V later absorbed the Cemetery&nbsp;H people and gave rise to the Painted Grey Ware culture (to 1400 BCE).\nTogether with the Gandhara grave culture and the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture, the Cemetery H culture is considered by some scholars as a factor in the formation of the Vedic civilization.\nFeatures\nThe distinguishing features of this culture include:\n* The use of cremation of human remains. The bones were stored in painted pottery burial urns. This is completely different from the Indus civilization where bodies were buried in wooden coffins. The urn burials and the \"grave skeletons\" were nearly contemporaneous.\n* Reddish pottery, painted in black with antelopes, peacocks etc., sun or star motifs, with different surface treatments to the earlier period.\n* Expansion of settlements into the east.\n* Rice became a main crop.\n* Apparent breakdown of the widespread trade of the Indus civilization, with materials such as marine shells no longer used.\n* Continued use of mud brick for building.\nSome of the designs painted on the Cemetery H funerary urns have been interpreted through the lens of Vedic mythology:\nFor instance, peacocks with hollow bodies and a small human form inside, which has been interpreted as the souls of the dead, and a hound that can be seen as the hound of Yama, the god of death. This may indicate the introduction of new religious beliefs during this period, but the archaeological evidence does not support the hypothesis that the Cemetery&nbsp;H people were the destroyers of the Harappan cities.\nArchaeology\nCremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery&nbsp;H culture, a practice previously described in the Vedas. The Rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice, in RV 10.15.14, where the forefathers \"both cremated (agnidagdhá-) and uncremated (ánagnidagdha-)\" are invoked.\nSee also\n* Chronological dating\n** Phases in archaeology\n** Pottery in the Indian subcontinent\n* Periodisation of the Indus Valley civilisation\n** Ahar-Banas culture (3000–1500 BCE)\n** Late Harappan Phase of IVC (1900–1500 BCE)\n*** Cemetery H culture in Punjab\n*** Jhukar-Jhangar culture in Punjab\n*** Rangpur culture in Gujarat\n* Vedic period\n** Kuru kingdom (1200 – )\n** OCP (2000–1500 BCE)\n** Copper Hoard culture (2800–1500 BCE), may or may not be independent of vedic culture\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.harappa.com http://www.harappa.com harappa.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060908052731/http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_01.html https://web.archive.org/web/20060908052731/http://pubweb.cc.u-tokai.ac.jp/indus/english/3_1_01.html journal]"
