      "text": "# Ultra-Warrior\n\nUltra-Warrior is a 1981 board game published by Task Force Games.\nGameplay\nUltra-Warrior is a game set in the far future involving single combatants wearing environmental control suits equipped with energy barriers, and using powerful weapons that can alter the landscape during the combat.\nReception\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed Ultra-Warrior in The Space Gamer No. 44. Barton commented that \"Overall, Ultra-Warrior isn't a bad little game. Unless the idea of knights-errant jousting across the cosmos turns you off, you might find it a worthy selection for a quick play session with a moderate-level simulation.\"\nTony Watson reviewed Ultra-Warrior in Ares Magazine #13 and commented that \"the game plays fairly well, the rules are concise, and the physical qualify is up to Task Force's usual good standards. Rather than being a bad game, Ultra-Warrior is something of a bland game, whose features wear thin after only a few playings.\"\nReferences"
