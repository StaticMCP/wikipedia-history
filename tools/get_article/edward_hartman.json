According to The News & Observer, five mitigating factors were presented at Hartman's trial, including alcoholism (he claimed to be severely intoxicated at the time of the murder) and childhood abuse. The jury felt that these factors were outweighed by Hartman's theft of Smith's car and money. In seeking clemency, Hartman's lawyers (along with outside groups) argued that the prosecution had used Hartman's sexuality (he was bisexual) in a discriminatory manner, an argument rejected by the courts and by Governor Mike Easley of North Carolina.\nSee also\n* Capital punishment in North Carolina\n* Capital punishment in the United States\n* List of people executed in North Carolina\n* List of people executed in the United States in 2003\nGeneral references\n* [http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/hartman877.htm \"State executes convicted killer; Governor denies clemency after U.S. Supreme Court declines to hear case of man who killed housemate,\"] by Matthew Eisley.
