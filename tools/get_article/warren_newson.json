He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1991-98. Newson played for the Chicago White Sox (1991–1995), Seattle Mariners (1995) and Texas Rangers (1996–1998). He also played for the Kia Tigers of the KBO League in 2002.\nWhile playing for the White Sox, Newson was given the nickname \"The Deacon\" by the team's longtime television play-by-play announcer, Ken Harrelson. Newson possessed exceptional strike zone judgment, prompting Bill James to herald him as a freely-available player who could help many teams win.\nExternal links\n*[http://eng.koreabaseball.com/Teams/Playerinfohitter/summary.aspx?pcode=72654 Career statistics and player information] from Korea Baseball Organization"
