Half of Delaware's executive officers were up for election, including the Governorship. Additionally, federal elections for the state's Class 2 seat in the United States Senate seat and Delaware's at-large congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Primary elections were held on September 10, 2024.\nDemocrats, who historically dominate the state politically, won all statewide elections and did well in down ballot races. A large number of candidates ran unopposed, including around half running for Delaware House of Representatives, all but two running for the Delaware Senate, and Governor John Carney in the Wilmington mayoral race. The election had a turnout rate of 65.74% of registered voters casting ballots across 533 precincts.\nBackground\nThe Delaware Democratic Party dominates the politics of Delaware. The party holds a supermajority in both chambers of the State Legislature and holds all statewide seats. The most recent time Republicans won statewide elections in Delaware was in 2014, when the elections for Delaware Auditor of Accounts and Delaware State Treasurer were won by Tom Wagner and Ken Simpler respectively. In 2018, Wagner did not seek reelection while Simpler was defeated by a Democratic challenger.\nFederal elections\nPresident\nIncumbent President Joe Biden was the only Democrat to qualify for the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primary in Delaware. After Nikki Haley suspended her primary campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee. However, Haley dropped out too late to remove her name from the primary ballot, so the Delaware Legislature voted to cancel the Presidential primaries as a cost saving measure.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris won Delaware with 56.6 percent of the popular vote, winning all three of the state's electoral votes. Despite her win in Delaware, Harris lost the presidential election to Trump.\nSenate\nIn May 2023, incumbent Democratic Senator Tom Carper revealed that he would not be seeking reelection. Carper endorsed Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware's at-large congressional district to succeed him. Rochester won the election with 56.6 percent of the vote. She became Delaware's first female and first black senator.\n|votes      = 283,298\n|percentage = 56.6\n}}\n|votes      = 197,753\n|percentage = 39.5\n}}\n|votes      = 19,555\n|percentage = 3.9\n}}\nHouse of Representatives\nLisa Blunt Rochester, the incumbent Representative for Delaware's at-large congressional district decided not to seek re-election opting to run for United States Senate. State Senator Sarah McBride decided to run to replace her, becoming the first openly transgender person to run for Congress. McBride won the election with 57.9 percent of the vote. With her victory, she became the first openly transgender person elected to the United States Congress. After the election, McBride resigned from her State Senate seat.\nState elections\nGovernor\nIncumbent Governor John Carney was unable to seek a third term due to term limits.

Gay won the race, receiving around 55 percent of the vote. Following her victory, Gay resigned from her State Senate seat.\nInsurance Commissioner\nIncumbent Democratic Trinidad Navarro won a third term as Insurance Commissioner of Delaware against Republican challenger Ralph Taylor.

However, on October 3, 2023, Purzycki revealed that he would not be seeking a third term citing his age and a desire to spend time with his family. Incumbent Governor of Delaware John Carney, who was unable to seek reelection due to term limits, decided to enter the race. Due to the Delaware Democratic Party's dominance over both the state and Wilmington, the Republican State Committee of Delaware did not run a candidate. Since no other candidates ran in the general election, Carney won the election unopposed.}}\nReferences"
