Simbalist (5 September 1943 &ndash; 12 March 2005) was a role-playing game designer.\nCareer\nEdward E. Simbalist and Wilf K. Backhaus designed a role-playing game called Chevalier, which they brought to Gen Con IX in 1976 with hopes to sell it to TSR; after witnessing Gary Gygax berate a staff member, Simbalist decided not to approach Gygax about the game. At the convention, they met Scott Bizar of Fantasy Games Unlimited, who was interested in the game and helped to get it published over the next year as Chivalry & Sorcery, the first role-playing game from Fantasy Games Unlimited. In the late 1970s, Bizar contacted Simbalist and Phil McGregor to produce a science-fiction role-playing game, which was published in 1980 as Space Opera. Simbalist supervised both of his role-playing game lines until FGU reached a point where it was no longer able to release new products.\nHe was Canadian and lived in Edmonton. He also was a teacher at [http://edithrogers.epsb.ca Edith Rodgers junior high school].\nBibliography\n* Chevalier (1976), self-publisher\n* Chivalry & Sorcery (1977), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Bireme & Galley (Chivalry & Sorcery) (1978), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Chivalry & Sorcery Sourcebook (1978), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Destrier (Chivalry & Sorcery) (1978), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Swords & Sorcerers (Chivalry & Sorcery) (1978), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Arden (Chivalry & Sorcery) (1979), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Saurians (Chivalry & Sorcery) (1979), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Space Opera (1980), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Chivalry & Sorcery Sourcebook 2 (1981), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Ground & Air Equipment (Space Opera) (1981), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* ''Seldon's Compendium of Starcraft 1 (Space Opera) (1981), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Star Sector, Atlas 1 (Space Opera) (1981), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Star Sector, Atlas 2 (Space Opera) (1982), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Chivalry & Sorcery 2nd edition (1983), Fantasy Games Unlimited\n* Chivalry & Sorcery Sourcebook 1 & 2, 2nd Ed.
