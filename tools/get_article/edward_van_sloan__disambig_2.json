Vansloun, in: California Death Index, 1940–1997.- Edward Vansloun, in: Social Security Death Index. was an American character actor best remembered for his roles in the Universal Studios horror films such as Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), and The Mummy (1932).\nEarly years\nEdward Paul Van Sloun was of Dutch and German descent and was born in New Trier, Minnesota, on November 1, 1882 the son of Martinus Van Sloun and Theresa ( Breher) Van Sloun. He was living in San Francisco by 1900 with his aunt Mary (née Breher) Baumann and her daughter Alma. His mother settled in San Francisco, where young Edward resided with his siblings (the artist Frank J., Mary D., Leonora M., Alma K., Josephine) and mother as he launched his acting career in theaters.\nCareer\nIn 1915, Van Sloan was the leading man with the Forsberg Players, based at the Fulton Opera House in  Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\nVan Sloan's roles in Universal's films date from the 1930s, including Dracula (1931), Frankenstein (1931), and The Mummy (1932). In the first of these, he played Professor Van Helsing, the famous vampire-hunter, a role he had first taken in the successful touring production of Dracula by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston. He played essentially the same role, this time as Dr. Muller, an occultist, in The Mummy. He again played Van Helsing in the 1936 film ''Dracula's Daughter. In Frankenstein'', he played the character of Dr. Waldman, and he also stepped in front of a curtain before the film's opening credits to warn audience members that they now had a chance to escape the theatre if they were too squeamish to endure the film.\nOn Broadway, Van Sloan's credits included The Vigil (1948), Remote Control (1929), Dracula (1927), Lost (1927), Juarez and Maximilian (1926), Schweiger (1926), Morals (1925), Polly Preferred (1923), and The Unknown Purple (1919).\nPersonal life\nIn 1910, Van Sloan acted in Pinero, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he married the leading lady Myra Jackson, with whom he had one child, Paul (born February 21, 1911, in Pennsylvania). During the 1920s, Van Sloan appeared in several plays at the 48th Street Theater on Broadway, including the 1924 stage adaptation of Dracula before accepting an offer in late 1930 (at age 48) for a part in the acclaimed Tod Browning-directed screen production of Dracula. He died in 1964 at age 81. He was cremated at Olivet Gardens of Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California. However, his family buried his urn at Boehm Cemetery in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania.\nFilmography\n* Slander (1916) – Joseph Tremaine (film debut)\n* Dracula (1931) – Professor Van Helsing\n* Frankenstein (1931) – Dr. Waldman\n* Under Eighteen (1931) – Assistant to François (uncredited)\n* Manhattan Parade (1931) – The Lawyer (uncredited)\n* Behind the Mask (1932) – Dr. August Steiner\n* Play Girl (1932) – Moffatt, the Boss\n* Man Wanted (1932) – Mr. Walters\n* Forgotten Commandments (1932) – Doctor (uncredited)\n* Thunder Below (1932) – Doctor (uncredited)\n* The Last Mile (1932) – Rabbi\n* The Death Kiss (1932) – Tom Avery\n* The Mummy (1932) – Dr. Muller\n* The Billion Dollar Scandal (1933) – Attorney Carp\n* Infernal Machine (1933) – Professor Gustabve Hoffman\n* The World Gone Mad (1933) – (uncredited)\n* The Working Man (1933) – Mr. Briggs\n* Trick for Trick (1933) – John Russell\n* The Silk Express (1933) – Mill Owner in Association (uncredited)\n* ''It's Great to Be Alive (1933) – Dr. Wilton\n* Baby Face (1933) – Jameson – Bank Director (uncredited)\n* Deluge (1933) – Professor Carlysle\n* Murder on the Campus (1933) – Prof. C.
