All 50 states and The District of Columbia were part of the 1980 United States presidential election. Washington, D.C. voters chose 3 electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nWashington, D.C. was won by incumbent President Jimmy Carter (D) by a 61-point landslide.\nCarter's 74.9% of the vote represents the lowest vote won by a Democrat in the District of Columbia, while also being the sole presidential election when the Democratic candidate (albeit very narrowly) did not earn at least 75% of the district's vote. Anderson's 9.3% is also the highest a non-major party candidate ever got in D.C.\nResults\n, George Bush and Howard Baker attend a campaign rally at the United States Capitol in Washington DC on September 15, 1980.]]\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in the District of Columbia\nReferences"
