It was created in 1973 by Michael Bergeron and William B. Kelley, becoming defunct in 1976. The first issue in May 1973 marked Chicago's \"first successful attempt at producing a serious gay newspaper\", following another paper that only lasted two issues. Richard W. Pfeiffer wrote a monthly column for the newspaper.\nIn 1974, Lavender Woman reported that the Crusader had a large free circulation. The paper operated a gay switchboard, 929-HELP, from Bergeron's basement.\nIn June 1976, Philadelphia Gay News reported that the Crusader would fold after issue 27, except for an annual wrap-up edition.\nReferences\n}}\nBook sources\n*"
