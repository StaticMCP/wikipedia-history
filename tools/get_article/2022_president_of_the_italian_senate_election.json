It resulted in Ignazio La Russa being elected president.\nProcedure\nThe election takes place by secret ballot, as required by the assembly's standing orders. Pursuant to the current rules of procedure, an absolute majority of the whole membership is needed to win on the first ballot. On the second and third ballot, a simple majority of votes cast (including blank votes) suffices. If the first three ballots fail to deliver a winner, a runoff is held between the two candidates who got the most votes on the third ballot.\nHistory\nThe election took place on 13 October 2022, over three weeks after the 2022 Italian general election. It took place by secret ballot, as required by the assembly's standing orders. Liliana Segre, being the oldest Senator present, served as the acting presiding officer.\nIgnazio La Russa was the official candidate for the Presidency of the Senate of the centre-right coalition (composed of Brothers of Italy, Lega Salvini Premier, Forza Italia and Us Moderates), which at the time held 115 Senate seats (a majority of 11).\nParties which did not belong to the centre-right coalition instructed their members to cast a blank ballot.\nAll but two of the 18 Forza Italia senators refused to support La Russa, and decided not to cast a ballot. However, La Russa nonetheless managed to be elected president on the first ballot with 116 votes, due to support from some members of opposition parties.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Ignazio La Russa\n|Brothers of Italy\n|bgcolor=#CEF6D8|116\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Roberto Calderoli\n|Lega\n|2\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Liliana Segre\n|Independent\n|2\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|66\n|-\n|colspan=3|Abstentions\n|1\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|19\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|104\n|}\nThe following senators did not cast a vote:\n*Alberto Barachini (FI)\n*Anna Maria Bernini (FI)\n*Stefania Craxi (FI)\n*Ilaria Cucchi (PD)\n*Dario Damiani (FI)\n*Claudio Fazzone (FI)\n*Maurizio Gasparri (FI)\n*Claudio Lotito (FI)\n*Gianfranco Micciché (FI)\n*Giorgio Napolitano (Ind.)\n*Mario Occhiuto (FI)\n*Adriano Paroli (FI)\n*Renzo Piano (Ind.)\n*Licia Ronzulli (FI)\n*Roberto Rosso (FI)\n*Francesco Silvestri (FI)\n*Francesco Paolo Sisto (FI)\n*Pierantonio Zanettin (FI)\n*Paolo Zangrillo (FI)\nSee also\n* 2022 President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies election\nNotes\nReferences"
