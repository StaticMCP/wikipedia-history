A Hong Kong-Chinese co-production, the film stars Louis Koo, Daniel Wu and Gao Yuanyuan. The film opened the 35th Hong Kong International Film Festival on 20 March 2011. It was then released theatrically in Hong Kong on 31 March 2011.\nPlot\nChi-yan (Gao Yuanyuan) is an analyst who has recently broken up with her boyfriend and is holding onto many of his belongings, including his pet frog. She meets her ex on a bus and attempts to arrange for him to collect his belongings, but his new girlfriend, upset at her boyfriend seeing another woman, forces Chi-yan off the bus. Now walking, she drops papers in the road and an alcoholic passerby (Daniel Wu) helps her pick them up. She arrives at work and presents a report on an imminent financial crash. After work, she meets the passerby again at a liquor store, and offers him her ex's wine samples. Over the following nights, Chi-yan gives the passerby all of her ex's belongings; he sells them and encourages Chi-yan to spend the proceeds on herself. He takes the frog as a pet. They agree to meet again the next week, when he will show her his work as an architect; Chi-yan implores him not to drink until then.\nThat week, Chi-yan flirts with Cheung Shen Ran (Louis Koo), an investment firm CEO who works in a neighboring building, by pantomiming through her office window. They agree to a date; Chi-yan goes, only to be stood up. By going, she misses her opportunity to meet the architect again. She berates Shen in his office; later, she sees that Shen has lost his job.\nThree years later, Chi-yan arrives at work to find that Shen is her new boss. She is furious and threatens to quit; he responds by taking her out to buy a Maserati sportscar and a high-rise apartment. He professes his love to Chi-yan and the two nearly sleep together before Chi-yan has second thoughts, questioning Shen's loyalty. Shen begins half-heartedly dating other women. Chi-yan notices that the architect to whom she gave the frog now works in the neighboring building. The two go on a date, where Chi-yan learns his name is Fang Qihong, that he has started his own architecture firm, and that he is no longer alcoholic. He professes his love, and states that he would never cheat on her.\nRecognizing the romantic rivalry, Shen takes Chi-yan out for a luxurious meal, feigning a professional obligation; when he ogles other women at the restaurant, Chi-yan runs away and meets Qihong. The two fly to Suzhou, where Qihong shows Chi-yan a skyscraper he has designed for her. Chi-yan leaves him to stay with her mother and grandmother in Suzhou. When Qihong returns to work and Chi-yan does not, Shen attacks Qihong, and the frog is killed in the scuffle. Qihong returns to Suzhou and invites Chi-yan to a dinner with his family. During the dinner, Shen climbs a neighboring skyscraper and calls Chi-yan to propose to her. In response, Qihong proposes as well. Chi-yan embraces Qihong.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Time Out Hong Kong gave the film a four out of six rating praising the dialogue and \"expert comic timing\". The Hollywood Reporter opined that \"To dazzles with non-stop filmmaking tricks, so many will be happy to forget the disingenuity of the creative premise\". Variety referred to the film as \"tightly plotted and frequently funny, with suave lead perfs and glossy production design and lensing\" while noting that \"this mainstream, mostly Mandarin-language pic is squarely aimed at mainland audiences and will do midrange biz in the region, but won't travel much elsewhere.\"\nTheme songs\n*\"愛很簡單\" (Love is Simple) by David Tao\n(Used by Sean when expressing his love and proposing to Chi-yan)\n*\"我願意\" (''I'm Willing) by Faye Wong\n(Used by Kevin when expressing his love and proposing to Chi-yan)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mediaasia.com/dontgobreakingmyheart Official website]\n*\n*\n* [http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=11517 Don't Go Breaking My Heart]'' at Hong Kong Cinemagic"
