Through its own forms - social organization, the use of territory and natural resources (with a subsistence relationship) - its socio-cultural-religious reproduction using knowledge transmitted orally and in daily practice.\nOfficially, according to the Federal Government, to be recognized as traditional, it is necessary to carry out daily production practices based on sustainable development.  It is estimated that in Brazil around 4.5 million people are part of these communities, occupying 25% of the national territory.\nThe term \"traditional peoples\" is defined as a larger legal category which includes, but is neither exclusive nor replacing of, Brazil's indigenous peoples.\nGovernment recognition\nIn 2007, the Federal Government of Brazil formally recognized the existence of so-called traditional populations (Presidential Decree 6040 of February 7),  expanding the recognition partially made in the 1988 Constitution (only indigenous and quilombola) to cover the following communities: caboclo; caiçara; extractive; jangadeiro; fisherman; riverside; tapper; in addition to indigenous and quilombola. The law also established the \"National Policy for the Sustainable Development of Traditional Peoples and Communities\" (PNPCT), subordinated to the Ministry of the Environment.\nIn 2016, Decree 8750 was issued by President Dilma Rousseff, establishing the National Council of Traditional Peoples and Communities (CNPCT). It was initially established as an arm of the Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger. In 2018, under the presidencies of Michel Temer and later Jair Bolsonaro, the council was shifted to the Ministry of Woman, Family and Human Rights as per Decree 9.465.\nIn 2023, under President Lula da Silva, the council was expanded and shifted to the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. In addition, Lula established a National Secretariat for Traditional Peoples and Communities and Sustainable Rural Development under the same ministry. Other offices, particularly those concerning the quilombola communities, are housed under the Ministry of Racial Equality and other independent government agencies, such as INCRA and the Palmares Cultural Foundation.\nList of traditional communities\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|People/Communities\n|Habitat\n|Activity\n|References\n|-\n|Andirobeiras\n|\n|use of the Andirobeira tree\n|\n|-\n|Apanhadores de Flores Sempre Viva\n|Diamantina , Minas Gerais\n|flower picking\n|\n|-\n|Benzedeiros\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Caatingueiros\n|caatinga\n|animal husbandry\n|\n|-\n|Caboclos\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Caiçaras\n|Rio de Janeiro , São Paulo and Paraná\n|fishing\n|\n|-\n|Caipira\n|Paraná\n|\n|\n|-\n|Castanheiras\n|amazon\n|\n|\n|-\n|Catadores de Mangaba\n|sergipe\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chapadeiros\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Cipozeiros\n|Santa Catarina , Paraná and São Paulo\n|Imbe plant harvest\n|\n|-\n|Extrativistas\n|Marajó , Pará\n|açaí , fishing, shrimp\n|\n|-\n|Extrativistas marinho\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Faxinalenses\n|Paraná\n|animal husbandry\n|\n|-\n|Fundo de Pasto\n|Bahia , Pernambuco and Piauí\n|raising goats and sheep\n|\n|-\n|Geraizeiros\n|Minas Gerais\n|agriculture, livestock and collection\n|\n|-\n|Ilhéus\n|Paraná\n|fish catcher\n|\n|-\n|Indigenous peoples\n|in all regions\n|fishing, gathering and small farming\n|\n|-\n|Isqueiros\n|Pantanal , Mato Grosso\n|fishing bait collector\n|\n|-\n|Jangadeiros\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Marisqueiros\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Morroquianos\n|Caceres, Mato Grosso\n|smallholders\n|\n|-\n|Pantaneiros\n|Pantanal, Mato Grosso\n|livestock\n|\n|-\n|Pescadores Artesanais\n|\n|fishing\n|\n|-\n|Piaçaveiros\n|amazon\n|piassava fiber processing\n|\n|-\n|Pomeranos\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Terreiros\n|in all regions\n|\n|\n|-\n|Quebradeiras de Coco Babaçu\n|Maranhão , Pará , Piauí und Tocantins\n|babassu fruit harvest\n|\n|-\n|Quilombolas\n|in all regions\n|\n|\n|-\n|Retireiros\n|Northeast of Mato Grosso\n|livestock and agriculture\n|\n|-\n|Ribeirinhos\n|amazon\n|fishing, gathering and farming\n|\n|-\n|Romani people\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Seringueiros\n|amazon\n|rubber cones\n|\n|-\n|Vazanteiros\n|Minas Gerais\n|Agriculture\n|\n|-\n|Veredeiros\n|North of Minas Gerais, Bahia and Midwest\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
