His mother, born to a German speaking Polish–Galician Jewish family in Jarosław, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (present-day, Poland), was a leading mezzo-soprano at the Hamburg State Opera. His father, born in Breslau (present-day, Wrocław), was a banker in Hamburg. Andrews had a younger sister Rene Andrews (née Renate Berta Aufrichtig; 1923–1992). The family fled Nazi Germany in January 1935 and settled in London with Andrews becoming a naturalised British citizen in 1947.\nEducation\nAndrews was educated at  a  in Eerde, Netherlands. At the age of 17 he contracted Poliomyelitis, which caused permanent muscle weakness in both legs. Returning to London, Andrews attended night school at the Courtauld Institute twice a week, earning his diploma in the early 1950s.
