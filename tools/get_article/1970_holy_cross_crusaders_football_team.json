Bill Whitton returned for a second year as head coach. The team compiled a record of 0–10–1.\nReeling financially from the cancellation of all 1969 home games, Holy Cross opted to schedule an 11-game season for the first time in its history, adding a visit to West Point. The no-win, 10-loss season was the worst result in Holy Cross history to that point.\nAll home games were played at Fitton Field on the Holy Cross campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 19 | |   | Temple\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 13-23\n| 12,500 |\n| October 3 | |   | Dartmouth\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 14-50\n| 13,222 |\n| October 10 | |   | Colgate\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 13-21\n| 10,111 |\n| October 17 | | @ | Boston University\n| Nickerson Field | Boston, MA | L 23-33\n| 6,247 |\n| October 24 | 1:30 p.m. | @ | Villanova\n| Villanova Stadium | Villanova, PA  | L 14-34\n| 13,174 |\n| October 31 | 1:50 p.m. | @ | Buffalo\n| Rotary Field | Buffalo, NY | L 0-16\n| 8,219–8,290 |\n| November 7 | |   | UMass^\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | L 13-29\n| 12,881 |\n| November 14 | | @ | Rutgers\n| Rutgers Stadium | Piscataway, NJ | L 7-37\n| 10,500 |\n| November 21 | |   | Connecticut\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | T 20-20\n| 6,818–7,000 |\n| November 28 | | @ | Boston College (rivalry)\n| Alumni Stadium | Chestnut Hill, MA | L 0-54\n| 23,500 |\n}}\nStatistical leaders\nStatistical leaders for the 1970 Crusaders included:\n* Rushing: Joe Wilson, 492 yards and 6 touchdowns on 102 attempts\n* Passing: Jerry Lamb, 855 yards, 78 completions and 3 touchdowns on 204 attempts\n* Receiving: Jack VonOhlen, 358 yards and 3 touchdowns on 30 receptions\n* Scoring: Joe Wilson, 44 points from 7 touchdowns and 1 two-point conversion\n* Total offense: Colin Clapton, 599 yards (604 passing, minus-5 rushing)\n* All-purpose yards: Joe Wilson, 590 yards (492 rushing, 98 receiving)\n* Interceptions: Mike Jordan, 4 interceptions for no yards\nReferences"
