A deluxe edition of the album with five additional tracks was released on February 14, 2020. Straus began a tour in support of the album on September 20, 2019.\nBackground\nThe album was written chronologically, with Straus stating that she named the album Cheap Queen after the drag term for a queen that is \"resourceful, making something out of not very much\". While Straus started her career with songs like \"1950\" and \"Pussy Is God\", The Guardian remarked that she swaps out those \"queer pop anthems for understated ballads\". Straus explained that the album's sound came about as she was \"dealing with the most vulnerable year of my life\" after the popularity of \"1950\", as she was under \"complete stress and anxiety, and not knowing what to do with myself or with my body, and then also being in love\".\nStraus released a deluxe edition of Cheap Queen on February 14, 2020, which included five new songs.\nCritical reception\n| MC = 81/100\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = DIY\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Exclaim!\n| rev3score = 8/10\n| rev4 = The Guardian\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = The Irish Times\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = NME\n| rev6score =\n| rev7 = Pitchfork\n| rev7score = 7.4/10\n| rev8 = Q\n| rev8score =\n| rev9 = Rolling Stone\n| rev9Score =\n| rev10 = Uncut\n| rev10score = 8/10\n}}\nCheap Queen received universal acclaim from music critics. On review aggregate site Metacritic the album received a rating of 81 out of 100 from 13 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". The album's sound has been compared to the works of Prince, Morrissey, Richard Hawley, Lily Allen, Madonna, Lorde, James Blake, Robyn, Imogen Heap, Fiona Apple, Billie Eilish, Maggie Rogers, Clairo, and Janis Joplin. Matt Collar of Allmusic praised how Straus examines themes of gender and sexuality \"with a low-key sensuality that combines masculine hip-hop confidence with a soulful, feminist point-of-view\". Max Gayler of The Line of Best Fit praised the album's \"eclectic instrumentation and bold production\" and the \"one-two punch\" of the album's closing two tracks, saying \"King Princess hasn't reinvented pop, but she is bridging its most exciting chasms.\" Aimee Cliff of The Guardian complimented the \"funk-driven\" \"Hit the Back\", as well as King Princess's voice, which Cliff described as \"often intimately close in the mix, brushing up against your ear, unglamorous and unadorned.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Year-end lists\n!scope=\"col\"| Publication\n!scope=\"col\"| Accolade\n!scope=\"col\"| Rank\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|AllMusic\n| Best Pop Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Consequence of Sound\n| Top 50 Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|GQ Magazine\n| The Best Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|The Guardian\n| The 50 Best Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|The Line of Best Fit\n| The 50 Best Albums of 2019 Ranked\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|PopCrush\n| 25 Best Pop Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Time\n| The 10 Best Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|Uproxx\n| The Best Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n| The 35 Best Pop Albums of 2019\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |USA Today\n| Best Albums of 2019\n|\n|}\nTrack listing\n| extra1 =\n| length1 = 3:43\n| title2 = Useless Phrases\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 1:16\n| title3 = Cheap Queen\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 =\n| length3 = 2:41\n| title4 = Ain't Together\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 =\n| length4 = 3:22\n| title5 = Do You Wanna See Me Crying?\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 =\n| length5 = 1:46\n| title6 = Homegirl\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 3:01\n| title7 = Prophet\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 =\n| length7 = 4:09\n| title8 = Isabel's Moment\n| note8 = featuring Tobias Jesso Jr.\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 =\n| length8 = 2:13\n| title9 = Trust Nobody\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 =\n| length9 = 3:15\n| title10 = Watching My Phone\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 =\n| length10 = 3:00\n| title11 = You Destroyed My Heart\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 =\n| length11 = 3:40\n| title12 = Hit the Back\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 =\n| length12 = 3:23\n| title13 = If You Think It's Love\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 =\n| length13 = 3:23\n| total_length = 38:57\n}}\n| extra14 =\n| length14 = 3:07\n| title15 = All Dressed in White\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 =\n| length15 = 2:00\n| title16 = Forget About It\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 =\n| note16 = featuring Banoffee\n| length16 = 2:59\n| title17 = Best Friend\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 =\n| length17 = 3:25\n| title18 = Ohio\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 =\n| length18 = 4:53\n}}\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n*King Princess – lead and background vocals (all tracks), songwriting (all tracks), production (all tracks), bass (tracks 1–4, 7–12, 14, 16), programming (tracks 1–10, 13, 14, 16–18), synthesizer (tracks 2, 4, 5, 7, 13, 14, 16), keyboards (tracks 3, 10–12), guitar (tracks 4–7, 10, 11, 14, 18), drums (tracks 9, 11–14)\n*Mike Malchicoff – production (tracks 1–7, 9–12, 14–17), assistant producer (tracks 8, 13, 18)\n*Nick Long – songwriting (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 17), guitar (tracks 1, 4, 7, 9, 11, 16)\n*Homer Steinweiss – drums (track 1)\n*Leon Michels – keyboards (track 1)\n*Jonah Finegold – guitar (tracks 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18)\n*Michael Freeman – assistant engineer (tracks 3, 4, 9, 13)\n*Amandla Stenberg – songwriting (track 3)\n*Billie Holiday – songwriting (track 3)\n*Carl Sigman – songwriting (track 3)\n*Bob Russell – songwriting (track 3)\n*Mark Ronson – assistant producer (tracks 4, 9, 16), production (track 17)\n*Justin Tranter – songwriting (track 4)\n*Edgar J.
