It was then purchased by one of its crew, who converted it for use as a houseboat.\nIn 1989 Martin Woodward, then coxswain of the Bembridge lifeboat, purchased Queen Victoria and, after several years of fundraising, the boat was finally restored in 1998, at the Classic Boat Museum, in East Cowes.\nThe boat is now under the stewardship of the Isle of Wight Historic Lifeboat Trust,  a registered charity, and is seaworthy.\n1999 it was taken to the BBC Television Centre in London to appear on the BBC television programme Blue Peter, to mark the RNLI's 175th anniversary.\nReferences"
