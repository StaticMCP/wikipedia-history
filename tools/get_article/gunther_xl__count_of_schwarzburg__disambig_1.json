His paternal grandparents were Guenther XXI. (XXXVIII.) von Schwarzburg-Blankenburg\n(1450&ndash;1484) and Katharina von Querfurt (1452&ndash;1521). Over time, Günther united all but one of the Schwarzburg possessions in one hand. He introduced Protestantism in his country and fought on the Protestant side against the emperor in the Schmalkaldic War.  Günther benefitted considerably from the political downfall of the Ernestine branch of the House of Wettin.\nIn feudal matters, he came into conflict with Elector Johann Frederick I, Elector of Saxony.  The Elector invaded Schwarzburg and torched the city of Sondershausen.  Günther had to flee, and was only able to return after the battle of Mühlberg in 1547.\nTo demonstrate his accumulated wealth and power, he largely demolished the existing castle in Sondershausen in 1533 and built a new Renaissance château on the site.  This château forms the old North, East and South wings of the current Sondershausen Palace.\nAfter his death, the County of Schwarzburg was divided among his four sons.  Thus, he became the ancestor of the two lines of the House of Schwarzburg that survived until the 20th century: Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.\nMarriage and issue\nOn 29 November 1528, Günther XL married Elisabeth (d. 14 May 1572), the daughter of Count Philip of Isenburg-Büdingen-Ronneburg.  They had the following children:\n* Günther XLI, Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt (1529&ndash;1583), nicknamed \"the Bellicose\", Count of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt\n* Magdalena (1530&ndash;1565), married in 1552, to Count John Albert VI of Mansfeld-Arnstein\n* Amalie (1531&ndash;1542)\n* John Günther I, Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (1532&ndash;1586), Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen\n* William I, Count of Schwarzburg-Frankenhausen (1534&ndash;1597), Count of Schwarzburg-Frankenhausen\n* Philip (1536-1536)\n* Albert VII, Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1537&ndash;1605), Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt\n* Otto Henry?
