Along with the Orpheum, Vancouver Playhouse, and the [https://vancouvercivictheatres.com/venues/annex/ Annex], it is one of four facilities operated by the Vancouver Civic Theatres on behalf of the city of Vancouver (the Playhouse adjoins the QE Theatre in the same complex). It was named after the former Canadian monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.\nFormerly the home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, which is now based at the Orpheum, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre is now the home of the Vancouver Opera and Ballet BC. It also hosts various other musical events year-round. The theatre has a 70′ wide x 40′ deep (21.34m x 12.19m) stage / performing area. The building holds two venues: the 2,765-seat main auditorium and the 668-seat Playhouse Theatre.\nThe theatre was the first project by the Montreal-based architectural partnership of Lebensold, Desbarats, Affleck, Dimakopoulos, Michaud, and Sise.  It opened in July 1959.\nSee also\n* Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.vancouveropera.ca/ Vancouver Opera's website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141023193629/http://aercoustics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2011.10.01-QET-Award-CCE-magazine.pdf QET Renovations]\n*[http://www.balletbc.com/ Ballet BC website]\n*[http://www.proscenium.ca/work/queen-elizabeth-theatre-2/ Long range plan and renovations 1993-2011]"
