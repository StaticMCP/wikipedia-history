It was the third general election to be held in less than two years. Parliament was dissolved on 9 October.  Scotland was allocated 74 seats in total, with 71 territorial seats (32 burgh constituencies and 38 county constituencies) which voted using the first past the post voting method, and one university constituency, which elected an additional 3 members using the Single Transferable Vote (STV) method. As voters in university constituencies voted under a different system, and in addition to their territorial vote, the results are compiled separately. All 74 seats were contested.\nIn Scotland the election saw both the Labour Party and the Unionists gain votes at the expense of the Liberals. Labour were slightly (0.4%) ahead of the Unionists in terms of votes cast, however the Unionists managed to secure 12 more Scottish seats than Labour, winning 38 seats in total. The Scottish Liberals saw an 11.8% swing against them and lost more than half their seats to finish third. The only other party represented in parliament from Scotland was the Scottish Prohibition Party, who retained their only seat in Dundee.\nWhen combined with results from across the UK, the Conservatives (with whom the Unionists aligned at Westminster) led by Stanley Baldwin obtained a large parliamentary majority of 209. Labour lost 40 seats. The Liberal Party, led by Asquith, lost 118 of their 158 seats which helped to polarise British politics between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party.\nResults\nSeats summary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\"  colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Last Election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#5555FF\"|\n| Unionist\n| align=center|38\n| align=center| 16\n| align=center| 22\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#DC241f\"|\n| Labour\n| align=center| 26\n| align=center| 34\n| align=center| 8\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFD700\"|\n| Liberal\n| align=center| 9\n| align=center| 23\n| align=center| 14\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#800080\" |\n| Scottish Prohibition Party\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center|\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=text-align:right| Total\n| align=center| 74\n| align=center| 74\n| align=center|\n|-\n|}\nBurgh & County constituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:100px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#5555FF\"|\n| Unionist\n| align=center| 36\n| align=center| 22\n| align=center| 688,299\n| align=center| 40.7\n| align=center| 9.1\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#DC241f\"|\n| Labour\n| align=center| 26\n| align=center| 8\n| align=center| 697,146\n| align=center| 41.1\n| align=center| 5.2\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFD700\"|\n| Liberal\n| align=center| 8\n| align=center| 14\n| align=center| 286,540\n| align=center| 16.6\n| align=center| 11.8\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FF0000\"|\n| Communist\n| align=center| 0\n| align=center| -\n| align=center| 15,930\n| align=center| 0.7\n| align=center| 1.7\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#D3D3D3\"|\n| Other\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | -\n| align=\"center\" | 29,193\n| align=\"center\" | 0.9\n| align=\"center\" | 0.8\n|-\n| colspan=2 | Total\n| align=center| 71\n| align=center|\n| align=center| 1,717,108\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\nUniversity constituency\nThe Combined Scottish Universities elected an additional 3 members to the house using the STV voting method.
