Bejoy added that the due to Salmaan's popularity across languages, he wanted the film's music to have a wide appeal.

Bejoy began recording the film's background score by June 2023 and completed it within mid-August. He eventually took specific importance on recording music for the promotional materials—the themes featured in the motion poster (\"People of Kotha\") and teaser were released separately. The theme \"People of Kotha\" had two more renditions apart from the original versions: an \"edgy\" and \"contemporary\" version. Salmaan also provided him suggestions on designing the themes and background score, so that it could suit the film well.\nBefore signing King of Kotha, Rahman worked on nearly six to seven films, where he would compose one or two songs a day. This had affected him professionally slowing his progress on composition, where he described it to be a composer's block. When Abhilash signed Rahman for the film, a friend of the composer asked him on he would provide pre-composed music for the film, which had offended him.

Unlike the criticism faced by the recent action thriller Jailer for the overuse of the Alappara theme, Jakes creates distinct tracks for different moments and employing the main King of Kotha theme only as needed. Throughout the film, his tracks shine consistently, offering a cohesive experience in line with its tone.\" Sajin Shrijith of The New Indian Express summarized: \"Jakes Bejoy's fittingly rousing score acts as a neat cushion without being intrusive.\" Janani K. of India Today wrote \"Jakes Bejoy's score elevates every single mass sequence.\" Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India described the \"thumping background score by Jakes Bejoy is like icing on the cake\".\nRegarding the song \"Kotha Raja\", the critic reviewed it as \"The song's pulsating beats and catchy melody evidently strike a chord with the masses\". While the song was appreciated by netizens, it was criticized for its poor placement. Some were also critical on Rahman's three of the compositions being excluded from the film.\nTrack listing\nBackground score\nThe film's original score, which consisted of 53 tracks running for one hour, was released by Sony Music India on 15 September 2023.\nNotes\nReferences"
