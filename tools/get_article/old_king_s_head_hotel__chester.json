It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.\nHistory\nThe building was constructed in about 1208.  It was the town house for Peter the Clerk, the administrator of Chester Castle.  It initially contained a section of the Chester Rows, but these were enclosed during the alterations made between the 15th and early 17th&nbsp;centuries.  The latest of these alterations were made for Randle Holme&nbsp;I. Inside the building on the middle floor you can still see evidence of the original Chester rows as the support pillars are still in place. The building was restored in 1935, and again during the 1960s.\nArchitecture\nIt is basically a timber-framed building, part of which has been refaced with yellow sandstone, and with brick that has been painted or rendered. The roofs are slated.   The building is in three storeys, of which the upper storey facing Lower Bridge Street is jettied.  Both faces have three bays.  The three bays on Lower Bridge Street are gabled, as is the middle bay on Castle Street.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Cheshire West and Chester\nReferences"
