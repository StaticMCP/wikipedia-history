Geologically considered a continental crustal fragment, it lies alongside the Sunda shelf, and is the largest in a cluster of islands between Java and New Guinea. European colonialism has shaped Timorese history since 1515, a period when it was divided between the Dutch in the west of the island (now Indonesian West Timor) and the Portuguese in the east (now the independent state of East Timor).\nEarly history\nThe island of Timor was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped Australasia more generally. It is believed that survivors from three waves of migration still live in the country. The first is described by anthropologists as Vedda people who arrived from the north and west at least 42,000 years ago. In 2011, evidence was uncovered, at the Jerimalai cave site, showing that these early settlers had high-level maritime skills at this time, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna. These excavations also discovered one of the world's earliest recorded fish hooks, between 16,000 and 23,000 years old.\nAround 3000 BC, a second migration brought Melanesians. The earlier Vedda peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior. Finally, proto-Malays from 2500 BC arrived from south China and north Indochina. Timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of Timor arriving on land in the south. Some stories recount Timorese ancestors journeying from the Malay Peninsula or the Minangkabau Highlands of Sumatra.\nThe Timorese in their region\nThe later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, sandalwood, deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.\nIndianized Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms (3rd century – 16th century)\ncultural influence zone of Greater India for transmission of elements of Indian elements such as the honorific titles, naming of people, naming of places, mottos of organizations and educational institutes as well as adoption of Hinduism, Buddhism, Indian architecture, martial arts, Indian music and dance, traditional Indian clothing, and Indian cuisine, a process which has also been aided by the ongoing historic expansion of Indian diaspora.]]\nEarlier Buddhist era (3rd century BCE – 7th century)\nIndianized Javanese Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya empire (7th – 12th century)\nOral traditions of people of the Wehali principality of East Timor mention their migration from Sina Mutin Malaka or \"Chinese White Malacca\" (part of the Indianized Hindu-Buddhist Srivijaya Empire) in ancient times.\nRelations with Indianized Javanese Hindu empire of Majapahit (12th – 16th century)\nThe Majapahit Empire's Nagarakretagama chronicles called Timor a tributary, but as Portuguese chronologist Tomé Pires wrote in the sixteenth century, all islands east of Java were called \"Timor\". Indonesian nationalist used the Majapahit chronicles to claim East Timor as part of Indonesia.\nChiefdoms or polities\nEarly European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century. One of the most significant is the Wehali or Wehale Kingdom in central Timor, to which the Tetum, Bunak, and Kemak ethnic groups were aligned.\nThe account of Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan expedition, who visited Timor in 1522, confirms the importance of the Wewiku-Wehali Kingdom. In the seventeenth century the ruler of Wehali was described as \"an emperor, whom all the kings on the island adhere to with tribute, as being their sovereign\". He entertained friendly contacts with the Muslim kingdom of Makassar, but his power was checked by devastating invasions by the Portuguese in 1642 and 1665. Wehali was now brought inside the Portuguese sphere of power but appears to have had limited contact with its colonial suzerain.\nTrade with China\nTimor is mentioned in the 13th-century Chinese Zhu Fan Zhi, where it is called Ti-wu and is noted for its sandalwood. It is called Ti-men in the History of Song of 1345. Writing toward 1350, Wang Dayuan refers to a Ku-li Ti-men, which is a corruption of Giri Timor, meaning island of Timor. Giri from \"mountain\" in Sanskrit, thus \"mountainous island of Timor\".\nTrade with the Philippines\nFilipinos, known as Luções among Portuguese sailors, were recorded to have visited and settled in East Timor before Spanish colonization of the Philippines. The Magellan expedition recorded that when they anchored on the island, they witnessed Luções merchants who traded Philippine gold for East Timorese sandalwood.\nEuropean colonization and Christianization (16th century onward)\nBeginning in the early 16th century, European colonialists—the Dutch in the island's west, and Portuguese in the east—would divide the island, isolating the East Timorese from the histories of the surrounding archipelago.\nSee also\n* History of East Timor\n* History of Indonesia\nReferences"
