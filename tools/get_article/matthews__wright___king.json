The band, Raymond Matthews (born October 13, 1956), Woody Wright (born October 10, 1957) and Tony King (born June 27, 1957), was put together by Columbia Records producer Larry Strickland after Shenandoah left the label, as an attempt to keep a viable country band on that label. Wright had previously been in another band called Memphis.\nThough they enjoyed video success on CMT and TNN as well as touring with Reba McEntire for two seasons, their highest charting radio single, \"The Power of Love,\" peaked at No. 41 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 1992. It was the title track of their debut album, issued that same year on Columbia Records. The trio dissolved shortly after the release of their second album, Dream Seekers.\nSince disbanding, Tony King joined Brooks & Dunn's backing band and was also briefly engaged to Wynonna Judd, Woody Wright found success as a gospel songwriter, producer and solo artist, while Raymond Matthews returned to his native Alabama and a successful contracting business.\nIn 2013, Raymond Matthews and his daughter, Ashley Matthews Mobley, released an album entitled Come Home.  The album is a compilation of gospel songs written by Raymond. Production and recording took place at Dugger Mountain Music Hall near Heflin, Alabama.\nDiscography\nPower of Love\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     = The Doghouse & Nightingale\n| genre      = Country\n| length     = 30:41\n| label      = Columbia Records\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = Dream Seekers\n| next_year  = 1993\n}}\n}}\n| length2           = 3:15\n| title3            = You Found a Way\n| writer3           =\n| length3           = 2:31\n| title4            = Someone's Child\n| writer4           =\n| length4           = 3:07\n| title5            = Standing in the River (Dying of Thirst)\n| writer5           =\n| length5           = 3:17\n| title6            = Mother's Eyes\n| writer6           =\n| length6           = 3:27\n| title7            = When the River Runs High\n| writer7           =\n| length7           = 2:27\n| title8            = Leavin' Reasons\n| writer8           =\n| length8           = 3:18\n| title9            = House Huntin'\n| writer9           =\n| length9           = 3:01\n| title10           = Everytime She Says Yes\n| writer10          =\n| length10          = 3:28\n}}\nMusicians\n*Raymond Matthews – Vocals\n*Woody Wright – Vocals\n*Tony King – Vocals\n*Eddie Bayers – Drums\n*Willie Weeks – Bass\n*Tom Robb – Bass\n*Steve Gibson – Guitar\n*Bill Watson – Bass\n*Mark Casstevens – Guitar\nProduction\n*Marshall Morgan – Engineer\n*Toby Seay – Assistant Engineer\n*John Kunz – Assistant Engineer\n*Denny Purcell – Mastering\n*Carlos Grier – Editing\n*Bill Johnson – Art Direction\n*Rollow Welch – Design\n*Randee Saint Nicholas – Photography\nDream Seekers\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     = Scruggs Sound (Berry Hill, Tennessee)\n| genre      = Country\n| length     = 35:35\n| label      = Columbia Records\n| producer   = Randy Scruggs\n| prev_title = Power of Love\n| prev_year  = 1992\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n}}\n| length1           = 3:47\n| title2            = Every Step of the Way\n| writer2           =\n| length2           = 3:32\n| title3            = I Got a Love\n| writer3           = Jackson Leap\n| length3           = 3:29\n| title4            = She's Letting Go\n| writer4           =\n| length4           = 3:26\n| title5            = Don't Forget About Me\n| writer5           =\n| length5           = 3:11\n| title6            = Plain Jane\n| writer6           =\n| length6           = 3:22\n| title7            = The Truth Is Killin' Me\n| writer7           = Raymond Matthews\n| length7           = 3:31\n| title8            = Uncle Sam's Right Hand Man\n| writer8           = Raymond Matthews\n| length8           = 3:43\n| title9            = Dream Seeker\n| writer9           = Raymond Matthews\n| length9           = 3:17\n| title10           = Big Money\n| writer10          =\n| length10          = 4:17\n}}\nMusicians\n*Eddie Bayers – Drums\n*Willie Weeks – Bass\n*Michael Rhodes – Bass\n*Brent Mason – Electric Guitars\n*Randy Scruggs – Electric Guitars\n*Don Potter - Acoustic Guitar\n*Paul Franklin - Steel Guitar\n*Matt Rollings - Piano, Synth\n*Steve Nathan - Organ, Synth\n*Ron Reynolds - Percussion\nProduction\n*Ron Reynolds – Engineer\n*Glenn Meadows – Digital Editing, Mastering\n*Bill Johnson – Art Direction\n*Rollow Welch – Design\n*Jodi Lynn Miller – Design Assistant\n*Peter Nash – Photography\nTrack information and credits verified from Discogs, AllMusic, and the album's liner notes.\nCharts\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chartpositions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| US Country\n! width=\"45\"| CAN Country\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Power of Love\"\n| 41\n| 45\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| Power of Love\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Mother's Eyes\"\n| 55\n| 76\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"House Huntin'\"\n| 68\n| —\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Got a Love\"\n| 45\n| 75\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Dream Seekers\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"One of These Days\"\n| 74\n| 63\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"—\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\nMusic videos\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
