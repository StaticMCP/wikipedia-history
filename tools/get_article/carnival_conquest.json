She is the first of her namesake class, whose design is derived from the  of cruise ships. Sixty percent of her staterooms have ocean views, and sixty percent of those (37% of all cabins) have balconies. The ship's interior decor is of a French Impressionist style designed to complement the port city of New Orleans.  Carnival Conquest was renovated in 2009.\nThe godmother of Carnival Conquest is Lindy Boggs, former US Congresswoman for Louisiana.\nThe vessel has been homeported at Miami, Florida.  On 7 July 2013, the ship was diverted to Mobile, Alabama, after a tugboat sank at New Orleans, causing a closure to the Mississippi River. Carnival then changed the next seven-day cruise roundtrip New Orleans into a six-day cruise from Mobile to New Orleans. Passengers disembarking were provided charter buses to New Orleans.\non 6 January 2006]]\nSee also\n*Cruise Confidential\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
