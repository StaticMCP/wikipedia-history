Nowadays it has the support of 947 town councils out of the 948 total in Catalonia (99%). Recently they have also received international recognition when in late 2019 the council of Torrelodones expressed its support to their cause. In addition, 39 out of 39 county councils give support to the association and also all the four Catalan provincial councils.\nThere are seven major parties in Catalonia that support the right of self-determination. In 2012, these were the proportions of mayors of each party who have signed for the association:\n* CUP: 4/4 (100%)\n* ERC: 128/139 (92.1%)\n* Convergència and Unió: 402/519 (75.3%)\n* ICV-EUiA: 13/23 (56.5%)\n* PSC 76/196: (38.8%)\n* PP: 0/8 (0%). (It does not support either self-determination or independence)\n* Without party (independent candidates) 46/53 (86.8%)\n* Other parties 4/4 (100%)\n* Administrated by public committee 0/1 (0%)\n* Partit Junts per la Independencia (12/27%)\n* Partit Més Junts que Els Anteriors (MJQEN) (3/9%)\nImage:Municipis independencia 1-10-15.png| Supporting municipalities}}\nImage:Territori x Independència 1-10-15.gif| Territory per supporting municipalities}}\nImage:Consells Comarcals adherits a l'AMI.5.png| Supporting comarcal councils'''}}\nImage:Diputacions adherides a l'AMI.png| Supporting provincial councils}}\nImage:Mapa-població-AMI 04062012.png|Percentage of supporting population by comarca\nObjectives\nAs stated in the foundation articles of the association, these are the goals and purposes of the organization:\n*1. Becoming a broad discussion space to share ideas, initiatives (institutional and citizen-level), experiences, information, management tools and everything that can be useful to bring the people of Catalonia to independence in order to achieve full functioning municipal powers.\n*2. Promote and defend Catalan national rights.\n*3. Develop the citizen need for Catalonia to exercise her right to self-determination.\n*4. Create a promotion network abroad, mainly within the framework of the European Union.\n*5. Promote town council self-finance.\n*6. Establish synergies in other areas, such as business and finance.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Province !! Adherits !! Population !! % Pop. !! Mun.
