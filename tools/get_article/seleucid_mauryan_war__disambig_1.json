The alliance freed Seleucus to turn his attention toward his rivals in the west, while Chandragupta secured control over the areas that he had sought, the Maurya Empire emerging as the dominant power of the Indian subcontinent.\nBackground\n(Minted 290–280 BC), the first indigenous satrap to be appointed by the Seleucid Empire]]\nIn the wake of Alexander's Indian campaign, Chandragupta Maurya led a successful revolt from north-western India against the Nanda Dynasty, rulers at the time of the Gangetic Plain, establishing himself as Emperor of Magadha around 321 BC. He fought the empire for eleven years with successful guerrilla campaigns, and captured the Nanda capital of Pataliputra. This led to the fall of the empire and the eventual creation of the Maurya Empire with Chandragupta Maurya as its emperor.\nThe Persian provinces in what is now modern Afghanistan, together with the wealthy kingdom of Gandhara and the states of the Indus Valley, had all submitted to Alexander the Great and become part of his empire. When Alexander died, the Wars of the Diadochi (\"Successors\") split his empire apart; as his generals fought for control of Alexander's empire. In the eastern territories one of these generals, Seleucus I Nicator, was taking control and was starting to establish what became known as the Seleucid Empire. According to the Roman historian Appian, History of Rome, Seleucus was\n}}\nThe Roman historian Justin described how Sandrocottus (Greek version of Chandragupta's name) assassinated Greek governors and established an oppressive regime \"after taking the throne\":\n}}\nConfrontation\nDetails of the conflict are lacking, and the only sources mentioning the confrontation between Seleucus and Chandragupta are a few references by Strabo, Appian, Plutarch, and Justin. According to Appian,\nIt is unknown if there was in fact a pitched battle. Jansani warns that \"there are very little details about the battle or skirmish they fought, and that none of the ancient authors depicted either Seleucus or Chandragupta as the clear victor of this battle. This lack of information about the encounter and the ensuing treaty means that it is impossible to reconstruct them.\" Military historian John D. Grainger has argued that Seleucus, upon crossing the Indus, \"would find himself in a trap, with a large river at his back and a hostile continent before him,\" and consequently could not have advanced much farther than the Indus. According to Grainger, the details of the conflict are unclear, but the outcome clearly must have been \"a decisive Indian victory,\" with Chandragupta driving back Seleucus' forces as far as the Hindu Kush and consequently gaining large territories in modern-day Afghanistan. Wheatley and Heckel suggest that the degree of friendly Maurya-Seleucid relations established after the war implies that the hostilities were probably \"neither prolonged nor grievous\".\nDynastic marriage-alliance\nThe confrontation was followed by a dynastic marriage-alliance, briefly mentioned by, or alluded to, by Greco-Roman authors Strabo (64 or 63 BCE – c. 24 CE) XV 2,9, Plutarch (1st c. CE), Justin (2nd c. CE), and Appian (2nd c. CE) 'Syr. 55. According to Jansari, Strabos and Plutarch may have drawn information from the same source, possibly Megasthenes. No Indian sources record the events, and Jansari warns that \"the dependence on a small group of sources from only one literary tradition necessitates a cautious approach to these texts and the events they describe.\"\nThree terms are recorded by these ancient sources. Seleucus Nicator seems to have ceded territories to Chandragupta, and received war elephants from Chandragupta Maurya, which subsequently influenced the Wars of the Diadochi in the west. Seleucus and Chandragupta also agreed to a marriage alliance, probably the marriage of Seleucus' daughter to Chandragupta.\nOverview of the alliance\nStrabo mentions the exchange of elephants and territory as part of the dynastic marriage-alliance. In his Geographica, composed about 300 years after Chandragupta's death, he describes a number of tribes living along the Indus, and then states that \"The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians\":\nJansari notes that \"them\" refers to \"territories previously held by Alexander, but it is not specified which these were.\"\nV.A. Smith (1914):\n}}\nKosmin summarizes those sources as follows, cautiously interpreting which territories may have been transferred:\n}}\nJansari notes that, in the 20th century, diverging views on Chandragupta have developed between western academics and Indian scholars. While westerners tend to take a reserved view on Chandragupta's accomplishments, Indian authors have portrayed Chandragupta as a very successful king who established the first Indian nation.\nTransferred territories\nGedrosia (Baluchistan)\nMalan mountain range (Purali/Hingol river)\nV.A.

Smith actually takes the Malan mountain range, which lies east of the Makran coast, as the western limit.]]\nWith regard to Gedrosia, more recent authors mention either \"Gedrosia,\" which gives the impression that Baluchistan as far as Iran was hand over, or '[the eastern] part of Gedrosia'. According to Thapar (1963), referring to Smith (1914), History of India,\nthat the territory ceded consisted of Gedrosia, Arachosia, Aria [modern-day Herat], and the Paropamisadae.\"}}\nIn History of Early India, also from 1963, Thapar writes that \"Some Seleucid territories that today would cover eastern Afghanistan, Baluchistan and Makran were ceded to the Maurya.\"\nAccording to Kosmin, Seleucus \"certainly\" transferred \"the eastern parts of Gedrosia.\" Thomas Trautmann includes the Makran Coast, referring to Smith (1924), and taking the Ashokan Edict of Kandahar as a validation for a maximum interpretation of Strabo. Smith actually takes the Malin range, east of the Makran coast, as the western limit, The validation by the Ashokan edicts is questioned by Coningham & Young and \"a growing number of researchers,\" as the Ashokan edicts may rather point to the maximum extent of contact, and not of institutionalized control.\nLower Indus Valley\nConingham & Young also question the extent of control over the lower Indus Valley, following Thapar, noting that this may hve been an area of peripheral control. Raymond Allchin  also notes the absence of major cities in the lower Indus valley.\nParopamisadae (Gandhara and Kabul) and Arachosia (Kandahar)\nAccording to Tarn, \"the Paropamisadae itself was never Chandragupta's.\" Tarn, writing in 1922 before the discovery of the edicts of Ashoka in Kandahar and Laghman Province in the 1930s-60s, limits the exchanged territory to the Indus Valley. According to Tarn, the limit followed the Kunar river, east of Kabul and ending in Jalalabad, further south along the watershed, and ending  at the Hingol river.: \"The Paropamisadae was not among the provinces ceded by Seleucus to Chandragupta [...] there is a passage from Eratosthenes, usually neglected, which seems plain enough. It says that, before Alexander, the Paropamisadae, Arachosia, and Gedrosia all stretched to the Indus; the reference is to the Achaemenid satrapies, and it implies that in Persian times the Paropamisadae and Gandhara were one satrapy. Alexander (it continues) took away from Iran the parts of these three satrapies which lay along the Indus and made of them separate [caroikia] (which must here mean governments or provinces); it was these which Seleucus ceded, being districts predominantly Indian in blood [...] Of the satrapy which Eratosthenes calls Paropamisadae Chandragupta got Gandhara, the land between the Kunar river and the Indus; this is certain, because Eratosthenes says that he did not get the whole, while the thorough evangelisation of Gandhara by Asoka shows that it belonged to the Mauryas. The boundary in Arachosia cannot be precisely defined; but, speaking very roughly, what Chandragupta got lay east of a line starting from the Kunar river and following the watershed to somewhere near Quetta and then going to the sea by Kalat and the Purali river; that will serve as an indication. The Paropamisadae itself was never Chandragupta’s.See [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Arid-region-location-and-drainage-pattern_fig1_335692129 this map] for Porali River, close to the Hingol River.}}\nKosmin writes that Seleucud \"certainly\" ceded Gandhara and Parapamisadae (this includes Gandhara), but \"possibly\" also Arachosia. Trautmann includes most of Afghanistan, including Herat, and Pakistan, noting that this extent has been doubted. He refers to Smith, stating that Smith \"convincingly supported the veracity of the territorial cession,\" and arguing that the Ashokan inscription in Gandhara \"confirmed the accuracy of the ancient testimony.\"\nConingham & Young question the extent of control over eastern Afghanistan, noting that \"a growing number of researchers would now agree that the Ashokan edicts may have represented 'an area of maximum contact rather than streamlined bureaucratic control'.\"\nAria (Herat)\nThe acquisition of Aria (modern Herat) is disputed. Smith included a large part of Aria, referring to Strabo and Pliny. Strabo XV, 1, 10:\n}}\nPliny the Elder (23/24–79 CE):\nSmith reads Strabo XV 1,10 as implying that \"Strabo informs us that the cession included a large part of Ariane.\" He further argues that Pliny, in his treatment of the borders of India, when referring to various authors who \"include in India the four satrapies of Gedrosia, Arachosia, Aria, and the Paropanisadae,\" this\n}}\nAccording to Tarn, explicitly criticising Smith for his interpretation of the extent of Aria, the idea that Seleucus handed over more than what is now eastern Afghanistan is an exaggeration originating in a statement by Pliny the Elder in his Geographia VI, 69, referring not specifically to the lands received by Chandragupta, but rather to the various opinions of geographers regarding the definition of the word \"India.\"\nAccording to Kosmin, Seleucid \"possibly\"  gave away \"Aria as far as Herat.\" According to Raychaudhuri & Mukherjee, Aria \"has been wrongly included in the list of ceded satrapies by some scholars [...] on the basis of wrong assessments of the passage of Strabo [...] and a statement by Pliny.\" According to John D. Grainger, \"Seleucus \"must [...] have held Aria\", and furthermore, his \"son Antiochos was active there fifteen years later.\" According to Sherwin-White and Kuhrt (1993), \"The region of Aria is definitely known to have been Seleucid under Seleucus I and Antiochus I as it definitely was after Antiochus III's great campaign in the east against the Parthians and Bactrians. [...] There is no evidence whatever that it did not remain Seleucid, like Drangiana, with which it is linked by easy routes.\"\nMilitary consequences\n}}\nThe arrangement proved to be mutually beneficial. The border between the Seleucid and Mauryan Empires remained stable in subsequent generations, and friendly diplomatic relations are reflected by the ambassador Megasthenes, and by the envoys sent westward by Chandragupta's grandson Ashoka. Chandragupta's gift of war elephants \"may have alleviated the burden of fodder and the return march\" and allowed him to appropriately reduce the size and cost of his large army, since the major threats to his power had now all been removed.\nWith the war elephants acquired from the Mauryas, Seleucus was able to defeat his rival, Antigonus, along with his allies at the Battle of Ipsus. Adding Antigonus's territories to his own, Seleucus would found the Seleucid Empire, which would endure as a great power in the Mediterranean and the Middle East until 64 BC.\nMauryan control of territory in what is now Afghanistan helped guard against invasion of India from the northwest. Chandragupta Maurya went on to expand his rule in India southward into the Deccan.\nWhile Seleucus surrendered territory west of the Indus and in Afghanistan, he was accepted by satraps of the eastern provinces in present-day Iran. His Iranian wife, Apama, may have helped him implement his rule in Bactria and Sogdiana.\nSee also\n* Kalinga War\n* Nanda-Mauryan War\n* Shunga–Greek War\n* First Battle of Jhelum\n* Greek campaigns in India\n* List of wars involving India\n* Military history of India\nNotes\n: \"Certain areas in the north-west were acquired through the treaty with Seleucus. There is no absolute certainty as to which these areas were and it has been suggested [Smith (1914), Early History of India, p.159] that the territory ceded consisted of Gedrosia, Arachosia, Aria [modern-day Herat], and the Paropamisadae.\"\nThe acquisition of Aria (modern Herat) is disputed. According to Raychaudhuri & Mukherjee (1996), p.594, it \"has been wrongly included in the list of ceded satrapies by some scholars [...] on the basis of wrong assessments of the passage of Strabo [...] and a statement by Pliny.\" According to John D Grainger (2014, p. 109), \"Seleucus \"must [...] have held Aria\", and furthermore, his \"son Antiochos was active there fifteen years later\".\n: \"...the general rising of the northern peoples headed by Chandragupta, the founder of the Maurya dynasty of Pataliputra, followed in rapid succession. The Lower Indus Valley now became free from foreign rule, and the local chiefs were no doubt left to their own devices. Nominally the territory may have been a dependency of the Mauryan kingdom, but, separated from the main body of that kingdom by a wide expanse of desert, and at a vast distance from the capital on the Ganges, its tie of allegiance must have been of the slightest. This independence, or semi-independence, lasted under no doubt varying degrees of definiteness […] till […] Demetrius, in the second century B.C., invaded Patalene in force and completely subjected it to Bactria.\"}}\ndescribes the area, stating that the Malan range is an offshoot of the Makran Coastal Range, which was explored by Sir Aurel Stein, who found out that \"the Buzelak, or \"Goat's Pass\", leading from the Malan plain across the Malan range into the plain of Ormara proved to be very steep,\" concluding that it was unlikely that Alexander had passed over the Malan range.\n*  also gives a description of the struggles of Alexander's army at hteir retreat from India: \"They turned west, reaching the mouth of the Tomerus (Hingol) River [...] Alexander, true to his tactical principles, prepared to advance along the coast [...] An unexpected obstacle arose to the continuance of the line of march. On the other side of the river loomed the utterly impossible barrier of the Malan (modern name) mountain range, its seaward end dropping abruptly and precipitately into the ater, and barring passage.\"}}\n: \"Extravagant ideas have been put forard as to what Seleucus did cede [...] The worst has been that of V. A. Smith, who gave Chandragupta the satrapies of Gedrosia, Arachosia, Paropamisadae, and Aria on the strength of Pliny VI, 69, a historical absurdity of unknown origin.\"}}\n: \"Seleucus ceded a vast territory, comprising most of what is now Afghanistan, plus southern Pakistan; the region of present-day Kabul (Paropamisadae), Kandahar (Arachosia) and Herat (Aria) ; and the Makran coast of Pakistan in the province of Baluchistan (Gedrosia ).\"Trautman refers to , \"The extent of the cession of Ariana by Seleukos Nikator to Chandragupta Maurya,\" in Which Smith actually writes: \"The satrapy of Gedrosia (or Gadrosia) extended far to the west, and probably only the eastern part of it was annexed by Chandragupta.
