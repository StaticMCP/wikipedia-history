Virtualization is an abstraction layer that decouples hardware from operating systems. The VMware Infrastructure suite allows enterprises to optimize and manage their IT infrastructure through virtualization as an integrated offering. The core product families are vSphere, vSAN and NSX for on-premises virtualization. VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is an infrastructure platform for hybrid cloud management. The VMware Infrastructure suite is designed to span a large range of deployment types to provide maximum flexibility and scalability.\nComponents\nThe suite included:\n* VMware ESX Server version 3\n* VMware ESXi version 3.x\n* VMware vCenter version 2 (formally VMware VirtualCenter)\n* Virtual SMP (which allows a guest operating system to \"see\" up to four CPUs in the virtual machine).\nUsers can supplement this software bundle by purchasing optional products, such as VMotion, as well as distributed services such as high availability (HA), distributed resource scheduler (DRS), or consolidated backup.\nVMware Inc. released VMware Infrastructure 3 in June 2006. The suite came in three \"editions\": Starter, Standard and Enterprise.\nLimitations\nKnown limitations in VMware Infrastructure 3 may constrain the design of data centers:\nlimitations in VMware Infrastructure version 3.5 included the following:\n* Guest system maximum RAM: 64 mb\n* Number of guest CPUs: 4\n* Number of hosts in an HA cluster: 32\n* Number of hosts in a DRS cluster: 32\n* Size of RAM per server: 256 GB\n* Number of hosts managed by Virtual Center Server: 200\n* Number of virtual machines managed by Virtual Center Server: 2000\nNo limitations were, for example, volume size of 64 TB with no more than 6 SCSI controllers per virtual machine; maximum number of remote consoles to a virtual machine is 10.\nIt is also not possible to connect Fibre Channel tape drives, which hinders the ability to do backups using these drives.\nRenaming\nVMware renamed their product VMware vSphere for release 4, and marketed it for cloud computing.\nSee also\n* Comparison of platform virtualization software\n* Virtual appliance\n* VMware VMFS, the VMware SAN file system\n* x86 virtualization\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/vi_pages/vi_pubs_35.html VMware Infrastructure 3 documentation]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWf_WiaFedc VMware Infrastructure 3 demo] - YouTube"
