Playing at fullback, he was one of five Warbrick brothers who participated in the tour, which was captained and organised by his half-brother Joe.\nBilly Warbrick played at least 59 matches during the Natives' tour, including at least 36 in the British Isles. He was one of the star players on tour, and was described by tour manager Thomas Eyton as \"a dashing player, grand tackler, first-class kick, very quick at follow up\".\nFollowing the tour Warbrick moved to Australia where he played for Queensland, and then New South Wales. He also coached Australia in their first ever Test match—against the British Isles in 1899.\nHe contracted tuberculosis and returned to New Zealand shortly before he died in 1901.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
