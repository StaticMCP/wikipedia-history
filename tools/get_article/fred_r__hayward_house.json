Hayward House is a historic house at 1547 Centre Street in Newton, Massachusetts.  This large -story stucco-clad house was designed by Winchester architect Robert Coit, and built in 1912.  Mostly rectangular in its massing with a hip roof, there are two forward-facing gables framing the main entry, the right one projecting slightly.  The roof of the left side gable sweeps down to shelter a sunroom.  Fred R. Hayward was later the president of the New England Confectionery Company, which had been created by his father in a sequence of mergers.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences"
