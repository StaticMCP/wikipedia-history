The municipal area is 71.2% wooded. Schwarzenborn belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Wittlich-Land.\nHistory\nSchwarzenborn belonged from the Late Middle Ages to the County of Manderscheid and until the line died out in 1762, the village was ruled by the Manderscheid-Kail branch of the noble family, who owned a castle in nearby Oberkail. Thereafter, the lordship passed to the Manderscheid-Blankenheim line, which held it until the lands on the Rhine’s left bank became French. In 1814, Schwarzenborn passed to Prussia, which administered the village through the Mayoralty (Bürgermeisterei) of Oberkail. The Oberkail church also served the Schwarzenborners as their parish church, but Himmerod Abbey, too, about 3&nbsp;km to the southeast, characterized the area. Since 1947, Schwarzenborn has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.\nPolitics\nMunicipal council\nThe council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\nCulture and sightseeing\nSchwarzenborn has at its disposal an inn and a little chapel with a slender tower.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.swr.de/hierzuland-rp/archiv/2006/08/20/index.html Brief portrait of Schwarzenborn with film] at SWR Fernsehen\n*[http://www.manderscheid.de/ Schwarzenborn in the collective municipality’s Web pages]\n*[http://www.schwarzenborn-eifel.de/ Municipality’s official webpage]"
