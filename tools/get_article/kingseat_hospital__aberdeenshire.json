Some of the old hospital buildings now form the central area of the village of Kingseat.\nHistory\nThe hospital, which was designed by Alexander Marshall Mackenzie using a village-type layout, opened as the Aberdeen District Asylum in May 1904. Six additional villas were added later. The hospital was used as a naval hospital for wounded sailors who had been serving on arctic convoys or the atlantic convoys during the Second World War and then joined the National Health Service as Kingseat Hospital in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in April 1994. Many of the buildings have been demolished and the site has been redeveloped by Avant Homes for residential use.\nNew Zealand Kingseat\nThe New Zealand Kingseat Hospital was named after the Scottish one, after Theodore Gray (Director-General of the Mental Health Division of the Health Department) returned from an overseas trip and felt it appropriate to have a sister hospital with the same name in New Zealand.\nReferences"
