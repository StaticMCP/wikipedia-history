Stewart captained the team in 1950. He was the last pre-war player to play for Preston.\nFollowing the 1950 season, Stewart indicated he would retire, and possibly move into coaching. In March 1951, he had applied for a clearance to Abbotsford to take up the role of captain-coach. However, by July that year, Stewart was back at Preston.\nCoaching career\nAfter moving into coaching in 1960, Stewart coached Preston teams to four premierships in as many years. This included coaching premierships in three separate grades between 1961 and 1963. In 1964 he resigned as head coach after Preston were relegated to the VFA second division.\nStewart coached Reservoir in the Northern Metropolitan Football League for the 1965 season and following that year became club president for the next four seasons (1966–1969). He would reprise the presidential role again for four more seasons over the next decade, in 1972, and from 1978–1980. He was granted life membership of the Reservoir Football Club for his efforts.\nDeath\nStewart died in July 1997 and was buried in Preston Cemetery.\nReferences"
