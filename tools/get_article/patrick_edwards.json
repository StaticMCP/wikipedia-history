He played college football for the Houston Cougars.\nEarly life\nEdwards was born in Temple, Texas, to Patrick Dixon and Patricia Edwards. He was raised in Hearne, Texas, where he attended Hearne High School. There, he played baseball, basketball, and football and competed in track and field. In basketball, Edwards was named an All-Region and All-District player, and, in baseball, he was named an All-District player. He played football as a wide receiver, and earned first-team All-State, All-District, and All-Brazos Valley honors.\nHe was recruited by Baylor, Henderson State, and Houston. He chose the latter, as he had long ambitions to attend the school.\nCollege career\nEdwards did not secure a scholarship, but impressed the Cougars' coaches enough in try-outs to earn a walk-on position. He sat out the 2007 season as a redshirt.\nHe entered the season as a starter at a wide receiver position. During the first eight games of the season, Edwards recorded 46 receptions for 634 receiving yards and four touchdowns. He compiled 100-plus yard games against Oklahoma State, East Carolina, and Southern Methodist. Against UAB, he tallied a season-long 70-yard reception.\nFor their eighth game of the season, Houston traveled to meet Marshall. The Thundering Herd scored first with a field goal, and never relinquished the lead. In the third quarter, Houston quarterback Blake Joseph threw a long pass into the Marshall end zone. His intended receiver, Edwards, in pursuit of the pass, ran out of the back of the end zone. Just beyond the boundary, he collided with a cart. Running at full speed, Edwards' right leg impacted the object and he flipped over due to the momentum. He suffered a compound fracture of the leg. The cart was one of several that were parked just outside the field's boundary and held equipment for the Marshall band.\nHouston athletic director Dave Maggard declined to comment substantively about the situation, but confirmed he would discuss the matter with Marshall officials. Edwards himself considered the burden of responsibility to be with the Conference USA officiating crew, rather than Marshall. Shortly after the incident, he said from the hospital, \"They are supposed to check and see if everything is off the field.\"\nOn March 30, 2009, Edwards announced that he would return to play the 2009 season and that he intended to pursue legal action against Marshall for his injury.\nHe still had an extremely productive college stay, racking up 4507 yards and 43 touchdowns on 291 receptions.\nIn Houston's 73-34 win against the Rice Owls on October 27, 2011, Edwards had 7 receptions for 318 yards and 5 touchdowns. Edwards was named the Conference USA Offensive Player of the Year for the 2011 season.\nCollege statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|! colspan=\"7\" style=\";\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! colspan=\"5\" | Receiving\n|-\n!GP\n!
