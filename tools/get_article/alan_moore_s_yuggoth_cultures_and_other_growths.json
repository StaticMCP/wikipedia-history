P. Lovecraft. It was published by Avatar Press in 2003.\nBackground\nAfter Dave Mitchell of Oneiros Books asked Alan Moore to contribute to The Starry Wisdom, a collection of new writings inspired by H. P. Lovecraft, Moore came up with the idea to do an entire book, to be called Yuggoth Cultures, based on Lovecraft's Fungi From Yuggoth cycle of poems. Unfortunately, Moore lost the only copies of most of the pieces he had written for the book in a London taxi cab. Moore submitted a short story entitled \"The Courtyard\" as his entry for The Starry Wisdom, but suspended work on Yuggoth Cultures.  \"So the project went 'on hold,'...I kind of shoved it in the back of a drawer and forgot about it,\" he told Avatar editor-in-chief William Christensen in an interview included in Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths No. 3. The two other surviving pieces from Yuggoth Cultures, the poems \"Recognition\" and \"Zaman's Hill,\" were included in the 1995 book Dust: A Creation Books Reader.\nAvatar's 2003 anthology miniseries Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths presented Antony Johnston's  comics adaptation of \"Recognition\" and \"Zaman's Hill\" as well as two of Alan Moore's songs, \"Litvinoff's Book\" and \"Me and Dorothy Parker\", the never-before-seen \"Nightjar,\" and reprints of many of Alan Moore's short comics.\nPublication\nThe series was published as a 3-part black and white monthly comic:\nIssue #1 (September 2003)\n* \"Zaman's Hill\" (adapted by Antony Johnston from Moore's poem, art by Juan Jose Ryp)\n* \"Nightjar\" (art by Bryan Talbot, planned as the first instalment of a serial to appear in Warrior)\n* Nightjar first draft script by Alan Moore\n* A letter from Alan Moore to Bryan Talbot outlining the creation of Nightjar\n* Nightjar commentary by Bryan Talbot\nIssue No. 2 (October 2003)\n* \"Litvinoff's Book\" (adapted by Antony Johnston from Moore's song, art by Mike Wolfer)\n* \"Cold Snap\" (art by Bryan Talbot, previously published in the 1985 Flying Pig benefit comic Food for Thought)\n* \"Itchy Peterson: Just Born Lucky I Guess\" (pencils by Val Semeiks, inks by Kevin Conrad, previously published in Chaos!

The basis was the story as seen in Yuggoth Cultures #1 with some additional notes from Bryan Talbot, but the bulk of the story was created by Johnston.\nYuggoth Creatures\nJohnston would later produce more work in the Cthulhu Mythos, for Avatar, under the title Yuggoth Creatures. All three issues are included in the collected ''Alan Moore's Yuggoth Cultures and Other Growths''.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.avatarpress.com/yuggothcultures/ Avatar Press' page on the series]\n* [http://www.bryan-talbot.com/oldsite/articles/nightjar.html The seminal Alan Moore comic that never was], about Nightjar, from Bryan Talbot's official fanpage\nReviews\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040326/http://www.comicreaders.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=379 Review of issue #1]"
