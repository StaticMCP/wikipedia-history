It elects three Councillors. As its name suggests, its territory (which has not altered since its creation in 2007) consists of the northern part of the burgh of Bearsden, with part of the boundary to the south following the path of the Antonine Wall; it also borders the Drumchapel housing estate in Glasgow – the marked differences in average life expectancy and other factors between residents living in close proximity in the two areas has been remarked upon in various studies. In 2020, the ward had a population of 14,943.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=6|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Ian McKay(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Amanda Stewart(Conservative)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|Duncan Cumming(Liberal Democrats / Ind.)\n|-\n!2011\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ashay Ghai(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Sheila Mechan(Conservative / Ind.)\n|rowspan=2|Rosie O'Neil(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Calum Smith(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Alan Reid(Liberal Democrats)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2022 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2017 election\n2017 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2012 election\n2012 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2007 election\n2007 East Dunbartonshire Council election\nReferences"
