Moreover there were no ministries or state committees for tourism in the Soviet Union, because tourists to and from non-communist countries were highly restricted and few in numbers.\nThe ministry oversees various arts, cultural and historic sites in the republic, they include but are not limited to  cinemas, circus, libraries, monuments, museums, musical institutions, parks, the National Cultural Center, the Philharmonic Hall and theaters. The ministry also oversees and regulates the republic's artists, teachers and promoters of culture of Kyrgyzstan.\nStructure\nThe ministry is subdivided into three departments:\nDepartment of Cinematography\nThis department is in charge of the regulation of the film industry in the Kyrgyz Republic as well as the promotion of the republic through films, some of which were showcased internationally. The department has also partnered the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development in establishing the Cinema Development Fund so as to enable local filmmakers to have better resources to produce films.\nDepartment of Information and Mass Communications\nThis department is in charge of the regulation of information made via mass media in the republic. An example of the department's scope of work include promoting and initiating the moving of local newspapers into electronic format.\nDepartment of Tourism\nThis department is responsible for organising events related to tourism in Kyrgyzstan. These include the World Nomad Games which was held thrice in the republic, Apricot Festival and Karagat Festival.
