Ben's wife and the children's mother, Rachel, disappeared years before while hunting and is believed by all to be dead.  Unexpectedly, troops from the Monroe Militia commanded by Captain Tom Neville arrive while Charlie is out hunting, intending to take Ben Matheson prisoner, because General Monroe believes that Ben may know something about restoring the power.  Before Ben is arrested, he secretly gives Aaron a mysterious pendant with directions to meet someone and instructions to keep it safe.  However, a militia soldier fatally shoots Ben, who was protecting Danny.  The soldiers take Danny prisoner and leave.  Ben requests that Charlie go to Chicago and find Ben's brother Miles, whom Charlie has never heard of, to help rescue Danny.  Aaron and Maggie accompany Charlie.  Along the way they meet Nate, who helps them out of trouble. Upon reaching Chicago they find that The Grand has been converted to a tavern owned by Miles -- and Miles immediately identifies Nate as a soldier in the Monroe Militia.  After the militia unsuccessfully tries to arrest Miles, who slaughters the troops trying to capture him with Charlie's help, the group sets off to find Danny. Meanwhile, Danny escapes and meets a woman named Grace, but the militia come to her house and recapture Danny.  Grace is then shown using another pendant to power a computer and communicate with an unknown party.\n----\nFlashbacks: Ben rushes home to warn his family that \"It's happening.\" He urgently downloads something onto a USB pendant and tries to warn his brother Miles.  Miles, who is in the Marines in South Carolina, is on his way back to base with his friend (and fellow Marine) \"Bass\" when he is contacted by Ben, but the blackout happens and interrupts the call. Miles and his friend return to base, and it is revealed that his friend \"Bass\" is Sebastian Monroe, later General and President of the Monroe Republic.\n| LineColor = 005E8D\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ProdCode = 2J7102\n| ShortSummary = Charlie, Miles, Aaron, and Maggie continue to travel together looking for a way to find Danny.

Monroe tortures a member of a rebel group that are trying to bring back the United States. Nora escapes with Miles and Charlie and they find out that she had deliberately allowed herself to be captured to steal a sniper rifle that the militia had.  They return to take the rifle and rescue the slaves she was held with, forcing Charlie to make her first kill.  Nora tells Miles, much to his displeasure, that she has joined the resistance, who are trying to restore the United States. Meanwhile, a man stealthily shows up at Grace's house wearing a necklace just like hers, and Grace sends a frantic online message as she saw him that \"Randall\" was there.

They capture the militia's commander, Jeremy, to use as leverage, but Jeremy tells the rebels that his troops are under orders not to deal for him because of Miles' presence, and then, realizing that the others didn't know Miles' history, tells them that Miles was the founder and former commanding general of the Monroe Militia.  Miles gives himself up to Jeremy in exchange for the militia allowing Charlie, Nora and the others to get away, but Charlie and Nora later ambush the Militia on a bridge to rescue Miles. Meanwhile, Aaron and Maggie go in search of the address that Ben gave Aaron, which turns out to be Grace's, but find her house empty.

The diner is destroyed by rocket fire from the helicopter, but the group survived in the reinforced walk-in refrigerator. After a short discussion, the group decides to warn and aid the rebels in their fight against Monroe's forces. Rachel and Miles are in need of anti-air weaponry, so they seek out another scientist, John Sanborn (Leland Orser), who is in possession of both weapons and another pendant.  While alone, Miles tells Rachel that he saw her dead body and would never have abandoned her had he known she was alive.  Sanborn informs Rachel that Randall captured Grace and then incapacitates them before revealing that he also is working for Randall.  Miles, however, frees himself, incapacitates John, and takes the weapons and the pendant along with Rachel. Charlie and the others go to the rebel headquarters to warn the rebels, but the mood is grim as Commander Ramsey, the rebel leader, believes they can no longer win, but Nora says that Miles will help. Neville and his son Jason (formerly known as Nate) overlook a massacred rebel camp, while Jason voices his disapproval of Monroe's methods, because the rebels don't stand a chance. They eventually find the rebel headquarters and spot Charlie among many people there.

Miles aims his rocket launcher but is knocked out by the concussion from a missile.  Danny then takes the rocket launcher and fires at the helicopter containing the amplifier, the source of power for both Militia helicopters. As the helicopters fall, Danny is killed by stray bullets to his chest. Later, Rachel cuts into Danny's body and pulls out a device with a flashing LED.

He tells the rebels that Jim could help train them into real soldiers. Meanwhile, Rachel, Charlie and Aaron go to the rebels' Eco base, an old hospital. Things between Rachel and Charlie are strained, since Charlie is cold to her mother. Randall reveals that he can activate the pendants remotely to track them, and he and Monroe seal an uneasy alliance. After Rachel sees the pendants activate on their own, she realizes that Randall is tracking them, and she destroys the pendants so they cannot be tracked or used.  Someone sees Miles and Nora and sells the information to a militia kill squad. Miles and Nora find Jim living under an assumed name as a happily-married town librarian. He's not happy to see Miles again and he refuses to go back. With Eco base under attack by Randall and militia troops, Rachel reveals that Randall was her boss at the United States Department of Defense (DOD), while Randall tells her through a megaphone that he needs her for her scientific knowledge. The militia kill squad arrives in Jim's town, but Miles, Jim and Nora manage to kill them. Randall captures Rachel and reveals to her that his intention is to restore power, but only in the hands of a chosen few, to prevent a return to the wars of the past. Charlie rescues Rachel. The militia's captain tries to kill Jim's wife. He saves her, but she's shocked by his background and repudiates him. Jim tells Miles he has destroyed his life again, but agrees to go with him.

Neville faces danger and hard choices as Randall doubts his competence, Monroe doubts his loyalty, he and Julia have to pretend that Jason was killed, and his convoy is ambushed by the rebels led by Miles, resulting in his capture and torture.  Charlie stops Rachel from murdering Neville in revenge for Danny's death.  Left alone, Rachel and Miles then discuss Charlie and renew their romantic attraction.  After mistakenly revealing his destination to Jason, who pretended to free him, Neville kills two rebels and escapes.  He then makes his way to Philadelphia and flees with Julia before Monroe learns of his blunder.  Using Neville's information, the rebels find that Randall has built a nuclear weapon, which Randall takes back to Philadelphia by car using the pendants.

During a battle, Alec tells Charlie to ask Miles what he did to Rachel.  Monroe uses a helicopter to drop leaflets over Atlanta demanding unconditional surrender.  Miles is captured by Georgia police and turns out to have had a personal relationship with Georgia Federation president Kelly Foster, who ultimately frees him to find Alec. Miles kills Alec just as Monroe orders Alec to detonate the nuke. Meanwhile, Rachel and Aaron locate her former co-worker Dr. Jane Warren (Kate Burton), who reveals that the nanites kept Danny and keep her partner Beth alive through their cancer-eating abilities.  Jane believes that if Rachel shuts down the nanites and restore the power, Beth will die.  However, at Beth's urging, she provides Rachel with her technical journal, which has information that will permit Rachel to turn off the nanites if she reaches the Tower.  After the nuclear weapon has been disarmed, Charlie asks Miles about Rachel, and Miles answers only that he hurts anyone close to him.  President Foster declares war on the Monroe Republic and offers Miles command of an army made up of 200 soldiers from the Georgia Federation, to help the rebels open a second front within the Monroe Republic.\n----\nFlashbacks:  Seven years after the blackout, Miles gives Alec a \"lucky\" knife from Miles' father and grandfather, which he tells Alec to pass along to his own son, when he has one.

Although Miles sneaks away from camp at night, he is later followed by Charlie, Nora, Jim Hudson and some Georgian soldiers.  In the battle that ensues, Emma tells Bass that she gave birth to his son while he and Miles were away in boot camp, but she is then killed by a Georgian officer trying to shoot Monroe.  Miles shoots and kills the Georgian officer for killing Emma.  Jeremy leads a wounded Monroe back to the helicopters.  Meanwhile. Aaron and Rachel cross the Mississippi River into the Plains Nation on their way to The Tower.  The pair stop in La Grange, Missouri\n, where Rachel tries to decipher the diagrams in Jane's journal.  She declines help from Aaron, who has two technical doctorates from MIT, and asks him instead to shop for supplies.  While doing so, Aaron sees his wife, Priscilla whom he abandoned in the months right after the black-out, but she acts cold and distant.  Priscilla tells Aaron that she has moved on, but Aaron believes her actions indicated that she was in trouble.  He ultimately finds that she was being held by a bounty hunter and rescues her (with her help).  She tells him that she has remarried and her family is in Texas; the Monroe Republic put a bounty on her after she killed an official while defending her eleven-year-old daughter.  They say goodbye.

In secret, they take control of a scientist named Dr. Ethan Camp (Timothy Busfield), via his wife and daughter, Bonnie, from the Monroe Republic, intending to hand him over to the Georgia Federation to weaponize anthrax. Charlie, Nora and Jason work against them and attempt to free Dr. Camp, only to be ambushed by a stationed group of Monroe's Militiamen. During the gunfight, Miles decided to help them escape with Dr. Camp's family, with Charlie thanking him. After they escape, Neville is furious at Miles for his action, but Miles says that they're better him, much to Neville's unhappiness. Meanwhile, Rachel and Aaron, in their desperate attempt to find food, steal some from a local Plains Nation settlement while on their journey to The Tower, resulting in three men from the settlement being killed trying to retrieve it. Rachel's leg is broken during their escape, and it is revealed that Aaron pioneered a software application while he was a student at MIT, therefore he must be the one to go to The Tower. It was also revealed that this software and Aaron's profile was in a journal owned by Dr. Jane Warren, and was most likely used by Randall Flynn when beginning his project at The Tower. The extent or the purpose of this software use is currently unknown. Grace Beaumont cracks into the elevator using a computer within The Tower, and a man set to guard her is killed while going to level 12. The show ends with Grace coming face-to-face with the killer.\n| LineColor = 005E8D\n}}\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ProdCode = 2J7117\n| ShortSummary = The Rebel and Georgia Federation Alliance is attacked by the Monroe Republic, reducing their numbers from 300 men to 30. This prompts President Foster (Leslie Hope) to tell Miles that either he comes up with a plan, or she will surrender to Monroe in order to save her people. During the attack on the Rebel/Georgia Alliance, Jason is critically injured, but is carried to safety by his father, Major Neville. Monroe kills Jeremy Baker (Mark Pellegrino) believing him to behind an assassination attempt made against him. It is later revealed that Baker had nothing to do with this assassination attempt, strengthening Baker's statement that he made before he was killed, pointing out that the only reason all of Monroe's friends betray him (including Major Neville and Miles) is because his delusions, paranoia, and barbaric nature drive them away. Rachel has Aaron reprogram the flashing LED, which she explains to be first-generation nanotechnology, that she had removed from Danny after his death, and inserted it into her leg to repair the bone and tissues. When Rachel's leg is healed, a group from the settlement saw how her leg was healed and force them to heal one of the group's son, who has been injured and has infection in his wounds. They agree to help the boy, but when they arrive at the electronics store where Rachel's leg was healed, Rachel knocks the boy's father out. Rachel then says that she has to go the Tower first because she has to restore the world's electricity so that the opposing nations could overthrow Monroe and end his ongoing war. She also reveals that she wants revenge on Monroe for killing her son, and ruining her life. At the end of the episode, Jason and Charlie are witnessed by Tom, kissing in a hospital room within the Georgia Federation Presidential House. Nora is captured by the Monroe forces and delivered to Monroe, where it is revealed that they knew each other previously.\n----\nFlashbacks: More is shown into the history between Miles and Rachel, the latter first arriving at the Monroe Republic to give her family time to escape Miles.

As a result, over the next 21 days, she is tortured repeatedly until she finally reveals the locations of Miles, Neville and Charlie. John Sanborn, who attacked Miles and Rachel, rescues Nora from the Militia Prison, after injecting her with a substance which causes hallucinations and paranoia. He also steals a pendant and amplifier for the rebels to use. He tells Miles he did so because he didn't want to carry out his orders of killing her and doesn't want to be responsible for people's death. Subsequently, Nora reveals to Miles that she told Monroe everything. Miles, Nora, Jason, Neville, Charlie, Sanborn, and Hudson board a helicopter bound for The Tower, stopping on the way to siphon fuel from vehicles abandoned in an airstrip. During this stop, the pilot of the helicopter and another rebel, Ramsay, were murdered with an X on their throats from a knife, leading to speculation that the murders were carried out by members of the Plains Nation. Charlie, however, points out that it cannot be a local of the area who did it because there is no food or water nearby. It is also confirmed by Ramsay that it was one of the group who did it, and eyes immediately turn to Jason, as he was seen by Charlie speaking to a member of the Monroe Militia back in Atlanta. Jason attempts to flee with Miles in pursuit. Sanborn quickly notices the knife used to murder the two rebels bore the stamp of Annapolis and follows. He tells Miles that it was Hudson who committed the murders, and then he is shot by Hudson himself. Hudson then reveals that Monroe has his wife, and that he was told by the Militia men that he had to kill Miles, Neville, Ramsay, and Sanborn.  Hudson and Miles fight, with Hudson gaining the upper hand, but ultimately is shot dead by Jason. Monroe decides that Flynn is no longer of any use, and tells his forces to kill him. Flynn then discloses information about The Tower, including that it holds weapons which make his helicopters seem like toys. This makes Monroe lead an operation to retrieve this weaponry, but their path is blocked by an invading force within The Tower, which have locked Flynn out of the system, preventing him from gaining access to the building. Rachel and Aaron get closer to The Tower. Realizing that The Tower is now surrounded by Militia, Rachel makes the decision that she will fulfill her personal mission of killing Monroe at nightfall, leaving the rest of the Militia to fight for leadership, subsequently leaving Aaron with the chance of approaching the door to The Tower with the override codes.

Now one year since the Patriots, Rachel continues to work on the Pendant and is able to get it working again, and shows it to Aaron and Priscilla. Grace appears to the group and tells them that she has found a way to kill the nanotech, by infecting it with a virus she has been working on. She tells them to travel to Bradbury, Idaho, and that she may be able to bring the power back. Grace later dies in the morning. Meanwhile, Monroe and Miles continue their fight against the Patriots and are joined by Charlie. But while checking an old store, they come across Rachel and her group who ask for their help.\n| LineColor = A51C1F\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Miles and Monroe initially refuse to help Rachel, but Charlie decides to help, causing Miles to join. The group of six struggles to Bradbury, where Priscilla sees the sign that the nanotech showed her. They enter Bradbury, and send Aaron and Priscilla to upload the virus into a computer while the rest fend off the townspeople. Miles recognizes Tom Neville at the front, apparently possessed by the nanotech, as are all the people. Neville tells them he initially wanted to kill them in revenge for Jason, but the nanotech showed him that true power is forgiveness, and is flanked by Truman and President Davis. Neville then tells them that the town is all about forgiveness, and they have an option. Join the town, or die. As he says this, an unseen person puts a gun to Aaron's head as he is about to activate the virus.\n| LineColor = A51C1F\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Charlie talks about seeing a group of ants kill a rabbit when she was a girl, and says she now knows how the rabbit felt. When the group does not wish to surrender, Neville tries to persuade them by showing them Connor - the person who has a gun to Aaron's head, is among them. Connor states that he forgives his father for loving Miles more than him. When Neville tries to say that Connor has the life Monroe couldn't give him, Monroe shoots him in the head, killing him. President Davis orders the possessed townspeople to attack, since the nanotech cannot attack them directly due to their proximity to the pendant. Aaron, Priscilla, Charlie and Rachel escape to an isolated area and attempt to activate the virus, while Miles and Monroe fight the townspeople. Charlie kills President Davis, and Miles is stabbed non-fatally, but saved by Monroe. As Aaron is about to activate the virus, he and Priscilla are shot dead by Truman, and the computer is destroyed. Monroe kills Truman and the survivors flee. Rachel, who realizes the terrible, selfish things she did in the past, plans to turn herself over to the nanotech. After telling Charlie and Miles about the terrible things she did, Rachel tells Miles to look after their daughter, kisses him, and goes to join the townspeople, led by Connor, thus destroying the pendant. Rachel is then shown possessed by the nanotech.\n| LineColor = A51C1F\n}}\n| ShortSummary = Rachel is in the midst of a Nanite-induced hallucination, where the Nano use Ben to tell her that, rather than nearly destroy humanity, she saved it by creating them. They see the downfall of the pre-Blackout world as inevitable, and they are doing humanity a favor by being in control. Rachel admits that her joining was a trick, as she recites the virus code. This disables the Nanites, but also kills everyone in Bradbury, including Connor and Rachel. Charlie, Bass, and Miles later bury their friends and go their separate ways. Miles and Charlie return to Sylvania Estates, while Monroe disappears somewhere in South America. The story then fast-forwards to years later with the power never returning. Miles, who is still sad, struggles with guilt over Rachel's death, but eventually settles down with a woman and has a son with her.
