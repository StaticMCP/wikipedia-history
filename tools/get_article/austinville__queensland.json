In the , Austinville had a population of 403 people.\nGeography\nAustinville is situated in the Gold Coast Hinterland between Mudgeeraba and Springbrook.\nAustinville is located in a valley through which flows Mudgeeraba Creek and the rugged Nimmel Range looms in the distance. Significant rainforest exists in the area.  Areas in the south are protected within Springbrook National Park. Apart from protected areas, the land use is a mixture of residential and grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nAustinville settlement was established as a banana plantation in 1934, making it one of the Gold Coast's oldest suburbs. It was started as an attempt to resettle unemployed people on the land following the Great Depression, and therefore lift the economy. It was named after Under-Secretary for Labour and Industry at the time, William Henry Austin, who encouraged the building of many of these plantations throughout the state.\nLand was cleared and divided into blocks and approximately 50 small homes were built. Mudgeeraba Creek flowed behind the homes along the valley floor, and the rugged Nimmel Range bordered on the settlement's western side. The settlement was very short lived. By 1939, within just 5 years, most families had left the area. Rainforest has crept back into much of the once banana farming valley, and the area remains dwarfed by the surrounding conservation area.\nAustinville State School opened on 25 June 1934. It closed on 9 June 1939.\nDemographics\nIn the , Austinville had a population of 361 people.\nIn the , Austinville had a population of 356 people.\nIn the , Austinville had a population of 403 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Austinville.
