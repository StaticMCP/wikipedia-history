It was the leading force behind the Bolivian National Revolution from 1952 to 1964. It influenced much of the country's history since 1941.\nOrigins\nThe Revolutionary Nationalist Movement was begun in 1941 by future presidents Víctor Paz Estenssoro and Hernán Siles Zuazo. It soon attracted some of the brightest members of the Bolivian intelligentsia. Among the party's most prominent supporters were Humberto Guzmán Fricke, Juan Lechín, Carlos Montenegro, Walter Guevara Arze, Javier del Granado, Augusto Céspedes, Lydia Gueiler, Guillermo Bedregal, and Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, a number of whom later became presidents of Bolivia.\nAt the time of its establishment it was a leftist/reformist party, along the lines of similar Latin American parties such as the Brazilian Labour Party, the Socialist Party of Chile, the National Liberation Party in Costa Rica, Dominican Revolutionary Party, the Guatemalan Revolutionary Action Party, the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance in Peru, Democratic Action in Venezuela. The MNR first came to power in 1943, as supporters of the reformist military regime of Gualberto Villarroel.\nBolivian National Revolution\nThe Revolutionary Nationalist Movement led the leftist Bolivian National Revolution of 1952 and ruled the country until 1964 when it was overthrown by the military coup of René Barrientos. During the presidencies of Paz Estenssoro (1952–56 and 1960–64) and Hernán Siles Zuazo (1956–60) were the top leaders of the Revolutionary period, establishing the universal vote, nationalizing the tin mines, and instituting an extensive agrarian reform. During this time many of the old elitist parties which had previously dominated Bolivian politics either disappeared or faded into irrelevance. This left the MNR in the center of the Bolivian political spectrum.\nSiles and Paz split in the 1960s over Paz's ambitions and personal control of the party. Filled with many strong personalities, the party had in fact begun to fragment along political and personal lines since the late 1950s, with Wálter Guevara being the first to leave and the popular Juan Lechín being expelled in 1964. Siles went on to form the Revolutionary Nationalist Leftwing Movement (MNRI) and Lechín the Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left (PRIN).\nFurther splits and return to democracy\nFalling from power only deepened the intra-party squabbles. With the main body of the MNR firmly behind Paz Estenssoro, the old leader made what can be seen as a major mistake in 1971, when he supported the coup d'état of Hugo Banzer Suárez. He apparently believed that Banzer would only rule for a year or two before calling elections that the MNR would almost certainly win.  If so, he badly miscalculated; Banzer exiled Paz in 1975. The main body supported Paz in exile, while a faction continued to back Banzer.\nPaz' support of the Banzer dictatorship was a move that was to cost his party dearly at the polls in subsequent years. While Paz seemed to be moving steadily to the right, Siles Zuazo broke off to found the left-leaning Left-wing Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNRI) in 1971. Indeed, Siles was the post-MNR politician who was best able to capitalize on the remaining legitimacy and respect that MNR had as a result of the 1952 Revolution. Paz Estenssoro led the MNR-proper in the Bolivian general elections of 1978, 1979, and 1980 elections, finishing third, second, and second, respectively.\nLed by Sánchez de Lozada, the MNR won the 1993 elections and Sanchez was confirmed as president by parliament. He continued the policies of the NEP. The party placed second in 1997 elections, with the presidential candidate Juan Carlos Durán (at the time, the Bolivian constitution prohibited direct re-election of a sitting president) losing to the former dictator Banzer.\n21st century\nAt the legislative elections 2002 MNR in alliance with Free Bolivia Movement, won 26.9% of the popular vote and 36 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 11 out of 27 in the Senate. Following these elections, because no presidential candidate had received a majority, the Congress chose the President, and they again elected Sánchez de Lozada. After the 2002 elections, the party ruled in a coalition with the Revolutionary Left Movement. In 2003 Sanchez was forced to resign, and his successor, independent candidate Carlos Mesa took over in hopes of promoting national unity in the face of nationwide protests. Mesa soon resigned and presidential elections were scheduled for December 2005. In these elections MNR received only 6.5% of the popular vote and won 7 out of 130 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 1 out of 27 seats in the Senate. Its candidate in the presidential elections was Michiaki Nagatani, whose poor performance demonstrated a steep decline in the fortunes of the party as the Bolivian political scene began to be dominated by Evo Morales.\nFor the 2009 elections, the MNR was a component of the Plan Progress for Bolivia – National Convergence.  The party's future is uncertain as it is no longer represented in the parliament and its last government has been tarnished by serious accusations of corruption, economic mismanagement and armed suppression of protesters.\nThe Revolutionary Nationalist Movement currently is led by Luis Eduardo Siles.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|1947\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Víctor Paz Estenssoro\n|5,194\n|5.56%\n|Lost\n|-\n|1951\n|54,129\n|42.9%\n|Annulled\n|-\n|1956\n|Hernán Siles Zuazo\n|787,792\n|84.4%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1960\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Víctor Paz Estenssoro\n|735,619\n|76.1%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1964\n|1,114,717\n|97.9%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1966\n|Víctor Andrade\n|88,099\n|8.7%\n|Lost\n|-\n|1978\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Víctor Paz Estenssoro\n|213,622\n|11.0%\n|Lost\n|-\n|1979\n|527,184\n|35.9%\n|Lost\n|-\n|1980\n|263,706\n|20.2%\n|Lost\n|-\n|1985\n|456,704\n|30.4%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1989\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada\n|363,113\n|25.6%\n|Lost\n|-\n|1993\n|585,837\n|35.6%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1997\n|Juan Carlos Durán\n|396,235\n|18.2%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2002\n|Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada\n|624,126\n|22.5%\n|Elected\n|-\n|2005\n|Michiaki Nagatani Morishita\n|185,859\n|6.5%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2009\n|Endorsing Manfred Reyes Villa\n|1,212,795\n|26.5%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2014\n|Endorsing Samuel Doria Medina\n|1,253,288\n|24.2%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2019\n|Virginio Lema\n|42,334\n|0.7%\n|Lost\n|}\nChamber of Deputies and Senate elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Votes\n!%\n!Chamber seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Senate seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n|-\n|1942\n|\n|\n|}}\n| 5\n| 7th\n|}}\n|\n|\n|-\n|1944\n|\n|\n|}}\n| 51\n| 1st\n|}}\n|\n|\n|-\n|1947\n|\n|\n|}}\n| 52\n| 4th\n|}}\n| 1\n| 4th\n|-\n|1949\n|\n|\n|}}\n| 5\n| 3rd\n|}}\n|\n| 5th\n|-\n|1956\n|787,792\n|84.4%\n|}}\n| 52\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 17\n| 1st\n|-\n|1960\n|735,619\n|76.1%\n|}}\n| 10\n| 1st\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|-\n|1962\n|886,572\n|84.7%\n|}}\n| 13\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 16\n| 1st\n|-\n|1964\n|1,114,717\n|97.9%\n|}}\n| 7\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 5\n| 1st\n|-\n|1966\n|88,099\n|8.7%\n|}}\n| 57\n| 3rd\n|}}\n| 22\n| 3rd\n|-\n|1979\n|527,184\n|35.9%\n|}}\n| 48\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 16\n| 1st\n|-\n|1980\n|263,706\n|20.2%\n|}}\n| 14\n| 2nd\n|}}\n| 6\n| 2nd\n|-\n|1985\n|456,704\n|30.4%\n|}}\n| 9\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 6\n| 1st\n|-\n|1989\n|363,113\n|25.6%\n|}}\n| 3\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 7\n| 1st\n|-\n|1993\n|585,837\n|35.6%\n|}}\n| 12\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 8\n| 1st\n|-\n|1997\n|396,235\n|18.2%\n|}}\n| 26\n| 2nd\n|}}\n| 12\n| 2nd\n|-\n|2002\n|624,126\n|22.5%\n|}}\n| 10\n| 1st\n|}}\n| 6\n| 1st\n|-\n|2005\n|185,859\n|6.47%\n|}}\n| 29\n| 4th\n|}}\n| 10\n| 4th\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
