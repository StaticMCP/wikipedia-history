Its plot centers on Chief Inspector Angelika Schnell who is portrayed by actress Ursula Strauss. Its original German title can be seen as both a play on words - fast investigated - and more commonly as a short description of the series - (Ms.) Schnell investigates. As of 2024, eight seasons of the show have been aired.\nSee also\n*List of Austrian television series\nExternal links\n*"
