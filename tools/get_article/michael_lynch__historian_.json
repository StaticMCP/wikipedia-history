In 2010, five years after his retirement, he was described by one reviewer as 'one of the most influential historians in Scotland of the last thirty years', whose work has been characterised by an 'ability to bring ecclesiastical, cultural and urban perspectives to traditional Scottish political and governmental histories', as well as the ability 'to clarify a difficult theory within a deceptively simple phrase'.\nLynch was born in Aberdeen. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School before taking degrees at the University of Aberdeen and the University of London. His first academic post was a lectureship in the history department at University College, Bangor (now Bangor University), from 1971 to 1979. From there he took up a lectureship in the Scottish history department at the University of Edinburgh, where, in 1993, he was appointed Sir William Fraser Professor of Scottish History and Palaeography, holding this Chair—the oldest and most distinguished Scottish history professorship in the world—until his retirement in 2005. As Professor he served as chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland (1996–2002), president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1996–1999), and a trustee of the National Museum of Scotland (2002–2005).\nUpon his retirement, Lynch was named an honorary research professor at Edinburgh, and latterly an honorary professorial fellow at the same university.\nLynch is not to be confused with Michael J. Lynch (born 1938), a British historian at the University of Leicester who specializes in Nazi Germany, Mao's China and Stalinist Russia.\nSelected publications\nLynch's monographs to date include:\n* Edinburgh and the Reformation (1981), winner of the Scottish Arts Council Literary Award\n* Scotland: A New History (1991), winner of the Scottish Arts Council Literary Award\n* The University of Edinburgh: an illustrated history (2003) (together with R.
