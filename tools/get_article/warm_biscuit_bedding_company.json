Bodwell's tips and anecdotes have been quoted in articles in The New York Times, Entrepreneur and CNET News, among other publications. She has been a QVC guest host for Country Living Quilts.\nOrigin of the name\nAs explained by the owner, a memory from her Texas childhood was the origin of the company name. At bedtime, children were told to climb into their warm \"biscuits\", or beds by their Grandmother.\nGrowth\nFrom its inception as a home-based business, Warm Biscuit Bedding expanded to an office in downtown New York City with a workshop and warehouse in Oklahoma and then a larger remote facility in Colorado. Marketing initially through a mail-order catalog, the company later opened an online store. The product line featured retro fabric designs and grew to include a selection of custom, monogram and personalized items.\nProduct\nCustomers can customize their bedrooms and add vintage bedding and fabrics among other furniture options.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.warmbiscuit.com Warm Biscuit Bedding Company]\n* [http://warmbiscuit.com/fabricsall1.html Warm Biscuit Bedding Company \"Vintage and Retro Fabrics\"]"
