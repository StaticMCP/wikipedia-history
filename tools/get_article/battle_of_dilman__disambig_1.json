It was fought at Dilman, Qajar Iran between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire.\nDespite having the larger forces, the Ottomans suffered 468 dead, 1,228 wounded, and 370 missing in the first day. Many injured Ottoman soldiers were abandoned on the field of battle. More than half of the Ottoman troops were Kurdish, almost all of whom deserted. By the end of the battle, the Ottomans had 3,500 of its soldiers killed.\nThe result was a Russian victory under Tovmas Nazarbekian. Armenian and Assyrian volunteers had an important role in the victory.\nOne month later, Halil Kut abandoned Persia with his army reduced to half of its original size. Halil blamed his defeat on the Christians and ordered the execution of all Armenians and Assyrians among his own soldiers. German military advisors reported the murder of several hundred unarmed Armenian and Assyrian soldiers and officers. The Armenian and Assyrian civilians of northwestern Persia were also massacred by Ottoman troops.\nSee also\n* Sarkis Jebejian\nReferences"
