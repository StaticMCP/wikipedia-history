The monument is located on Star Island, New Hampshire, where Tucke was a minister, judge, educator, physician, and in his probate record, \"owner\" of a 12-year-old black girl by the name of Diana, valued at 20 pounds.\nThe Tucke Monument is the tallest gravestone in the state of New Hampshire, far surpassing the  gravestone of Frank Jones located in Portsmouth.\nHistory\nPhilanthropist Edward Tuck, the namesake of Dartmouth's business school, financed the monument's construction in 1914, in cooperation with the New Hampshire Historical Society.  On July 29, 1914, the Historical Society organized a dedication for the monument, and published a 68-page book, memorializing the event:\nIt was a beautiful day, and a fresh breeze blew all the clouds inland.  The steamer Nassau from Boston, specially chartered for the occasion, left Jones's wharf at ten o'clock, making the trip in an hour.  Arriving at Star Island the company proceeded to the monument, which stands a short distance southeast of the quaint little stone church where candle-light services are still held as in days of yore.  Everyone was impressed by the dignity and beauty of the obelisk, which stands forty-six and one-half feet high, and can be seen from ten miles out at sea.  The shaft tapers in the same proportions as the monument at Bunker Hill.\nAn inscription at the base of the Tucke Monument reads:\nSee also\n* Monument for Captain John Smith\nReferences"
