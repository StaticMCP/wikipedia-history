A few states allowed free Black men to vote, and New Jersey also included unmarried and widowed women who owned property. Generally, states limited this right to property-owning or tax-paying White males (about 6% of the population).\n*Georgia removes property requirement for voting.\n1790s\n1790\n*The Naturalization Act of 1790 allows free White persons born outside of the United States to become citizens. However, since each state set its own requirements for voting, this Act (and its successor Naturalization Act of 1795) did not automatically grant these naturalized citizens the right to vote.\n1791\n*Vermont is admitted as a new state, giving the vote to all men regardless of color or property ownership.\n1792\n*New Hampshire removes property ownership as requirement to vote.\n*Kentucky is admitted as a new state, giving the vote to free men regardless of color or property ownership, although the vote would shortly be taken away from free Black people.\n*Delaware removes property ownership as requirement to vote, but continues to require that voters pay taxes.\n1798\n*Georgia removes tax requirement for voting.\n1800s\n1800\n*Only three states, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Vermont, had universal white male suffrage.\n1807\n* Voting rights are taken away from free black men and all women in New Jersey.\n1819\n*Economic crisis stemming from the Panic of 1819 led to greater calls from propertyless men for the abolition of restrictions to voting; by 1830, the number of states with universal white male suffrage had risen to ten, although six still had property qualifications and eight had taxpaying qualifications. Territories on the frontier, eager to attract new settlers, also helped expand suffrage.\n1821\n* In 1821, the state of New York held a constitutional convention which removed property requirements for white male voters, but required that \"persons of colour\" own $250 worth of property, \"over and above all debts,\" in order to vote. White male voters were instead required to pay a tax, but this rule was abolished in an amendment of 1826. Requirements for persons of color were not affected by this amendment. Due to the state's policy of gradual emancipation, slavery persisted until 1827, but until then the proportion of African Americans who were free (and thus potential voters) steadily increased. Native Americans still controlled large territories in Upstate New York, and though typically excluded from citizenship altogether, the property requirement applied to any voter who was not white.\n1828\n*The 1828 presidential election was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of universal white male suffrage.\n*Maryland passes a law to allow Jews to vote. Maryland was the last state to remove religious restrictions for voting.\n1830s\n1837\n* Voting rights are taken away from free black men in Pennsylvania.\n1838\n*Kentucky women are allowed to vote in school elections.\n1840s\nof Rhode Island]]1840\n* Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of adult white male population in the 1840 presidential election.\n1841\n*The Dorr Rebellion takes place in Rhode Island because men who did not own land could not vote.\n1843\n*Rhode Island drafts a new constitution extending voting rights to any free men regardless of whether they own property, provided they pay a $1 poll tax. Naturalized citizens are still not eligible to vote unless they own property.\n1848\n*Mexicans living in US territories are declared citizens in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, but are often discouraged from voting.\n1850s\n1856\n* The last state to abolish property qualification was North Carolina.\n1860s\n, ]]1860\n*Tax-paying qualifications remained in five states in 1860 – Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina. They survived in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island until the 20th century. In addition, many poor whites were later disenfranchised.\n1866\n*Wisconsin gives black men the right to vote after Ezekiel Gillespie fights for his right to vote.\n1867\n* Congress passes the District of Columbia Suffrage Act over Andrew Johnson's veto, granting voting rights all free men living in the District, regardless of racial background.\n1868\n* Citizenship is guaranteed to all male persons born or naturalized in the United States by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, setting the stage for future expansions to voting rights.\n*November 3: The right of black men to vote in Iowa is approved through a voter referendum.\n1869\n*Women in Wyoming get equal suffrage rights.\n1870s\n1870\n* The Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents states from denying the right to vote on grounds of \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude\".\n**Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era began soon after. Former Confederate states passed Jim Crow laws and amendments to effectively disfranchise black and poor white voters through poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and other restrictions, applied in a discriminatory manner. During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld state efforts to discriminate against racial minorities; only later in the 20th century were these laws ruled unconstitutional. Black males in the Northern states could vote, but the majority of black males lived in the South.\n*Women in Utah get the right to vote.\n1875\n*Minor v.
