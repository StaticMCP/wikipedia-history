Before that, Queensland used the stamps of New South Wales from 1851. All of Queensland's postage stamps portrayed Queen Victoria with the exception of two stamps depicting allegorical figures of Australia (1903, 1907). Between 1 January 1880 and 1 July 1892, revenue stamps of 1866–1892 were authorised for postal use. In 1913 the stamps of Queensland were superseded by those of Australia.\nA significant collection of Queensland stamps is held at the Queensland Museum.\nSee also\n*Postage stamps and postal history of Australia\n*Revenue stamps of Queensland\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Campbell, Hugh M.
