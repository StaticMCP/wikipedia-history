After Sun split from the Old Guangxi Clique over allocation of troops, he attempted to strip Cen Chunxuan (aka Tsen Chun-Hsuan or Sam Sun-Suen), one of Lu's most important allies in Guangdong, of some of his troops, in order to assign them to the more apparently loyal Chen Jiongming, a local Guangdong warlord who had sponsored Sun. Sun Yat-sen then directed Chen Jiongming to attack Lu Rongting and the other Guangxi warlords. In October 1920, Chen captured Guangzhou and drove the Guangxi warlords out of Guangdong.\nSecond Yue-Gui War\nIn 1921, Chen hoped to unite the region surrounding Guangdong behind Sun's regime at Guangzhou and pushed into Guangxi itself. Lu sent two armies--one led by his wife's younger brother Tan Haoming, the other under Shen Hongyingagainst Chen's forces. These drove Chen back and occupied the areas of Qinzhou and Lianzhou. However, Lu's ally Chen Binghun collapsed, losing Wuzhou and allowing Chen Jiongming to drive up the rivers into Guangxi as allies moved in from the north. Lu Rongting was forced to step down in July 1921. By August, Chen had occupied Nanning and the rest of Guangxi.\nAftermath\nAlthough Chen Jiongming and the Guangdong forces occupied Guangxi until April 1922, their occupation was largely nominal. Armed bands of Guangxi loyalists continued to gather under local commanders, calling themselves the Self-Government Army. Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming soon split over plans for the Northern Expedition. By May 1922, Sun Yat-sen's Cantonese forces had evacuated Guangxi, leaving it to Chen. Nevertheless, Sun would return later to reform his National government.\nSee also\n*New Guangxi Clique\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
