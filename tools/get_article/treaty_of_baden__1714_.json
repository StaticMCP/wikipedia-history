Together with the Treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt, it was one in a series of agreements ending the 1701 to 1713 War of the Spanish Succession.\nBackground\nThe treaty was the first international agreement signed in the Swiss Confederacy. On the margins of the conference, the signatories also secretly agreed to a Catholic union to intervene in favour of the Catholic cantons that had been defeated at the Second War of Villmergen two years earlier by the Peace of Aarau ending Catholic hegemony in the Confederacy.\nTerms\n* France retained Alsace and Landau but returned the east bank of the Rhine River (the Breisgau) to Austria.\n* The prince-electors of Bavaria and Cologne were reinstated in their territories and their positions.\n* Emperor Charles VI kept the title of King of Spain and the Spanish heritage, which was actually of no value since in Spain, all power remained with King Philip V of Spain.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
