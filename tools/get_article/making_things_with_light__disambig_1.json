Records. It was the band's first album to include bass player Aaron Rubin, replacing former bassist Byron Stomatos. The album's title refers to its cover art, which shows the four band members depicted using a Lite-Brite toy.\nThe album was compiled from several recording sessions the band had conducted over a two-year period, including a demo tape they had recorded in October 1989 and a studio session in June 1990. The CD version of the album includes numerous bonus tracks from three live performances, as well as a cover of the Shonen Knife song \"Flying Jelly Attack\" that had originally been released on the compilation Every Band Has a Shonen Knife Who Loves Them.\nTrack listing\nPerformers\n*Dr. Frank - vocals, guitar\n*Jon Von Zelowitz - vocals, guitar\n*Aaron Rubin - bass\n*Alex Laipeneiks - drums\nAlbum information\n*Record label: Lookout!
