In February, Mitch Barnett and James Fisher-Harris were announced as co-captains.\nFor the first time, the Warriors played at Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas, as part of the Rugby League Las Vegas annual event organised by the NRL.\nThe Warriors qualified for the final series for the tenth time in their history and first time since 2023. In the elimination final on 13 September, the Penrith Panthers defeated the Warriors 24–8 at Go Media Stadium, Auckland, thereby ending the Warriors' season.\nThe Warriors' reserve-grade team won the New South Wales Cup for the first time, defeating the St George Illawarra Dragons 30–12 in the NSW Cup Grand Final on 28 September. On 5 October, the reserve-grade team won the 2025 NRL State Championship defeating the Burleigh Bears 50–20.\nSquad\n|list1b=\n|list1c=\n|list1d=\n|list1e=\n|list1f=\n|list1g=\n|list1h=\n|list1i=\n|list1j=\n|list2a=\n|list2b=\n|list2c=\n|list2d=\n|list2e=\n|list2f=\n|list2g=\n|list2h=\n|list2i=\n|list2j=\n|list3a=\n|list3b=\n|list3c=\n|list3d=\n|list3e=\n|list3f=\n|list3g=\n|list3h=\n|column2_title=Supplementary list\n|list4a=\n|list4b=\n|list4c=\n|list4d=\n|list4e=\n|list4f=\n|list4g=\n|column3_title=Coaching staff\n|coach=Andrew Webster\n|assistant=Richard Agar (Backs)\n|assistant2=Stacey Jones (Halves & Special Plays)\n|assistant3=Slade Griffin (Forwards)\n|assistant4=Balin Cupples (High Performance)\n|assistant5=Kai Kara-France (Wrestling)\n|assistant6=Daryl Halligan (Goalkicking)\n|assistant7=David Tangata-Toa (NSW Cup coach)\n}}\nSquad changes and contract extensions\nThese movements happened across the previous season, off-season and preseason.
