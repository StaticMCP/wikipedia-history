The figure may be the border or interior of the polygon, or one or more closed polygonal paths that include all of the border and also have some legs crossing the interior. The name is derived from the polygon's similarity to the diffraction spikes of astronomical stars, but specific uses may exploit the connection or not. Stars often represent the unity of states within a country when they are used as a part of the flag.\nEmblematic use\n*In heraldry, a mullet is a star with straight arms and typically five points. A star with wavy rather than straight rays is called an estoile.

It has traditionally been used in British heraldry as a mark of cadency for the third son.\n*In Christian art, St. Bruno bears a star on his breast; Saint Dominic, Saint Humbert and Saint Peter of Alcantara have a star on their head or forehead.\n*The star with six (or less commonly five, sometimes seven) points is associated with law enforcement in the United States, and forms the basis of the sheriff's badge.\nThree-pointed stars\nThe three-pointed star is used much less often than other types of stars. but it appears in one of the versions of the flag of the International Brigades in the Spanish civil war.

A compass rose in the form of a four pointed-star also appears in the flag of NATO and the flag of the country of Aruba. The seal of the (now cancelled) United States Civil Service Commission included a four-pointed star between the years 1963-1979. Four-pointed stars also appears in the symbols of the Subaru car company and Philips corporation.\nFive-pointed stars\nThe five-pointed star, if drawn with points of equal length and angles of 36° at each point, is sometimes termed a golden five pointed star. If the colinear edges are joined, a pentagram is produced, which is the simplest of the unicursal star polygons, and a symbol of mystical and magical significance.\nThe golden five-pointed star is a very common ideogram in the western world, and has particularly strong associations with military power and war. Many communist countries (such as China and Vietnam) and symbols also incorporate five-pointed stars.\nImage:VIIcorpsbadge.png|Union Army, VII Corps, 3rd Division Badge\nImage:XIIcorpsbadge.png|Union Army, XII Corps, 3rd Division Badge\nThe five-pointed star appears in the flags of 35 countries, and also appears commonly in the heraldry of the United States, and stands in contrast to the vexillologically rarer seven-pointed star.\nThe five-pointed star occurs in conjunction with a crescent in the flags of several countries to symbolize Islam, appearing for example as part of the symbol of the Ottoman Empire.\nIn philately, the five-pointed star signifies stamps that have not been postmarked.\nThe five-pointed star is used as the symbol of the People Nation alliance of gangs from Chicago.

This symbol is most commonly associated with Judaism.
