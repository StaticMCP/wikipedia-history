After a misunderstanding paints Kaz as the self-declared \"best pilot in the known galaxy\", he must compete in a dangerous race to prove himself. Poe's associate Jarek Yaeger lends Kaz a ship in need of repairs, The Fireball, which irks mechanic Tam Ryvora.

The Quarren pirate Kragan Gorr and his gang attack the Colossus during a \"triple dark\" storm.

At the same time, Agent Tierny manipulates Tam's resentment towards Kaz to motivate her into joining the First Order and reveals that Yeager knew who Kaz really is all this time. This is further supported when Tam lashes out at a captured Yeager for hiding Kaz's true identity this entire time. Kaz runs into Torra, who agrees to lead him to the cells.

The show was created by Dave Filoni, who previously directed the 2008 film Star Wars: The Clone Wars, developed the subsequent television series, created, developed and executive produced Star Wars Rebels, and in 2017 became the head of Lucasfilm Animation. Filoni said the show was influenced by anime and by his grandfather's experiences in World War II. By August 1, 2018, Polygon Pictures was selected as the animation production company.\nOn August 12, 2018, Filoni stated that he would not work as directly on Resistance in a day-to-day capacity as he had on previous projects due to his work on The Clone Wars revival. However, he provided direction and notes to the story team, a role he compared to George Lucas' input on The Clone Wars.\nCasting\nAlong with the official series announcement, it was announced that Oscar Isaac and Gwendoline Christie would reprise their roles as Poe Dameron and Captain Phasma, respectively. They are joined by Christopher Sean, Bobby Moynihan, Suzie McGrath, Scott Lawrence, Myrna Velasco, Josh Brener, Donald Faison and Jim Rash. General Leia Organa, Kylo Ren and  have appeared in the series.\nRelease\nMarketing\nA trailer was released on August 17, 2018, showcasing the new animation style and characters. It received a negative reaction from fans, including criticism for its apparent targeting of younger viewers and both praise and criticism for the anime-style CGI. Blair Marnell of Nerdist compared the initial reaction to the early stigma The Clone Wars and Rebels suffered for similarly targeting younger demographics during release, only for both to become more positively received with subsequent seasons.\nBroadcast\nThe series debuted in the United States on the Disney Channel on October 7, 2018, with Disney XD airing the series later in the United States and worldwide, with the exception of Southeast Asia, where all live-action shows are sold by Disney's Southeast Asian channel. The series was renewed for a second season, which aired in October 2019. Its first episode, which picks up directly after the end of the first season, was screened at Star Wars Celebration in Chicago.\nSeason two premiered on Sunday, October 6, (10 p.m. EDT/PDT) on Disney Channel and DisneyNOW, with subsequent airings on Disney XD. Season two was the final season of the show and consisted of 19 episodes.\nHome media\nAs announced on July 23, 2019, Lucasfilm released the first season on DVD on August 20. It includes all 21 episodes of season one, as well as an exclusive sneak-peek at the making of the show with cast and crew, 4 audio commentaries with Sean, Lawrence, Brener and Velasco, the 12 shorts and Resistance Rewind.\nThe first season of Star Wars Resistance became available for streaming on November 12, 2019, the launch date for Disney+. The second season became available on February 25, 2020.\nReception\nCritical response\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 has an approval rating of 92% based reviews from 13 critics, with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site's critics consensus states, \"Star Wars: Resistance streamlined story sets the stage for exciting adventures—and seems poised to explore a canvas stocked with immediately relatable characters and plenty of potential.\"\nWilliam Hughes of The A.V. Club praised the first episode saying \"At the end of its first hour, Resistance feels pleasantly primed with potential.\" He gave it a grade B.\nBrian Lowry of CNN gave it a mixed review, he notes that previous Star Wars shows offered plenty for older fans but that this show was more clearly made for a younger audience, and \"Star Wars Resistance paints with a much brighter, more colorful palette, but at least initially settles for more pallid characters and situations—the kind that don't immediately suggest this is the animated show you're looking for.\" Syfy Wire notes that \"Resistances cel-shading animation style stands out amongst the franchise's traditional CG-animated fare.\" Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media called the series \"lighthearted\" and downplaying cartoon violence. She also argued that the series has a lot of humor, has characters demonstrate traits of determination and courage, saying that the series had vivid animation and \"high-flying action\" which dominates the series plot.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2019\n| Primetime Emmy Awards\n| Outstanding Children's Program\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Star Wars Resistance\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Saturn Awards\n| Best Animated Series\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|\n| Primetime Emmy Awards\n| Outstanding Children's Program\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nReferences\nFootnotes\nCitations\n-->\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.disneyplus.com/series/star-wars-resistance/FQwsUthRSbnp Star Wars Resistance] at Disney+\n*\n*"
