Mahiru says she is trying to get over her fear and that talking with Sōta is easier than most men, though he is also easier to hit.

One of the chefs, Jun Satō, tells Sōta of how Kyōko protected Yachiyo from bullies when she was in grade school, and in return, Yachiyo has been following Kyōko and makes parfaits for her at work. The general manager of Wagnaria, Otoo, appears at the restaurant; he rarely visits as he is always trying to find his missing wife. Yachiyo comes down with a cold and Kyōko tries to fill in for her in the meantime with not much luck.

Although Popura and Inami accept Aoi as a new member of Wagnaria, Sōta is aware her life story is a lie. Aoi constantly exhibits clumsiness and a lack of common sense, and as a result Sōta and Jun take an immediate disliking to her. Yachiyo befriends Aoi, whom she takes to be a mother-figure, while Otoo is labelled as her father-figure. Aoi tells Yachiyo that Jun has feelings for her, which later culminates in a disastrous confession by Jun and a denial by Yachiyo.

While he initially refuses, the other employees get him to change his mind and he goes along with it, dressing as a girl and calling himself Kotori.

Tasaka and Saitou plan to cure her depression by convincing her that beating up Shindou shocked his brain into reverting to his old personality, and Kamakura becomes so happy she cries.
