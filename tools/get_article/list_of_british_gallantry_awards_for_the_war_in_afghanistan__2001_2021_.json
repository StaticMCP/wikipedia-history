Apart from appointments to purely military orders, only gallantry awards have been included and only those that allow post-nominal letters (this excludes appointments to the Order of the British Empire for distinguished service and fourth-level awards such as Mentions-in-Despatches and Queen's Commendations).\nThe list includes the rank and decorations the recipient held at the time, together with their regiment, corps or service, and the date of publication of the award in the London Gazette. The first honours list was published in October 2002, covering the period from October 2001 to March 2002, and subsequent lists have each covered six-month periods of operations, ending in March or September. The latest list was published in July 2015 and covered the period ending 31 December 2014.\nVictoria Cross\nThe Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award for gallantry in the presence of the enemy, and is also the highest honour in the British Honours System. A miniature of the award is worn on the undress uniform to indicate the unique nature of the award.\n*Corporal Bryan James Budd, The Parachute Regiment, December 2006 (killed in action)\nDuring July and August, A Company of 3 Para were deployed into Sangin, where their position was constantly under attack. On 27 July, during a patrol, a member of Corporal Budd's section was shot and seriously injured in open ground. Budd led an assault against a building, causing the enemy to retreat, allowing the evacuation and treatment of the wounded soldier. On 20 August, on another patrol, Budd's section again came under heavy fire, with two soldiers being wounded. He assaulted the enemy single-handedly, continuing even when himself wounded. This inspired the remainder of the platoon to renew their attack, and force the withdrawal of the enemy. Budd subsequently died of his wounds. His \"single-handed action... and his determination, though wounded, to push on against a superior enemy force stands out as a premeditated act of inspirational leadership and the greatest valour\".\n*Lance Corporal James Thomas Duane Ashworth, Grenadier Guards, June 2012 (killed in action)\nOn 13 June 2012, in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province, Lance Corporal Ashworth led his fire-team into the heart of an insurgent-dominated village. The initial attack resulted in the deaths of two insurgents and the recovery of two sniper rifles; however, the follow-up attack by Afghan local police stalled when a policeman was shot and killed. Ashworth moved to the front of his fire-team and pursued the attack, breaking into an enemy compound under machine-gun fire and driving the insurgents into an out-building. He then relentlessly crawled forward under fierce enemy fire to neutralise an enemy sniper with his final grenade. Placing himself in full view of the enemy to accurately throw his grenade, Ashworth was hit by enemy fire and killed before he could neutralise the sniper; however, his actions galvanised his platoon, which completed the clearance of the compound. His \"total disregard for his own safety...was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack. This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.\"\n*Lance Corporal Joshua Mark Leakey, Parachute Regiment, August 2013\nThe actions for which Leakey was awarded the Victoria Cross occurred on 22 August 2013 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. A routine joint patrol composed of British paratroopers, US Marines and Afghan soldiers had targeted a village to search for illegal weapons. Having been flown into the area in Chinook helicopters, the patrol was attacked by machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades soon after dismounting. Leakey's helicopter had landed on a hill near the village and he, with three other paratroopers and an Afghan soldier, were to provide fire support for the main segment of the patrol. From their vantage point, his section could see the attack and heard over their radio that someone had been injured. Leakey ran up the hill to assess the seriousness of the attack and came to the conclusion that urgent action was needed. Though he was only a lance corporal, he took control of the situation and led his section down to the group under attack.\nHaving reached the group under attack, he gave first aid to the wounded US Marine Corps captain and began to evacuate him from the battlefield. While under fire, he returned to the machine guns that his section had left at the top of the hill. He moved one to a better position to fire at the attacking Taliban even though he was under constant, accurate fire (bullets were ricocheting off the weapon he was carrying). His actions inspired other soldiers to join in the fight back.\nWhile he was manning the machine gun, he was also shouting updates of the situation into his radio. Having realised that more than one machine gun would be needed to effectively fight back the insurgents, he allowed his gun to be taken over by another soldier. He then ran once more through heavy fire to retrieve a second machine gun, position it in a suitable site, and then manned it to fire at the Taliban.\nThe skirmish lasted approximately 45 minutes during which 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. It was only when air support arrived that fighting ceased. When it did, he handed the second machine gun over to another soldier. He then returned to the injured American officer and oversaw his medical evacuation.\nThe Ministry of Defence summarised the reasons for awarding Leakey the Victoria Cross as follows:\nGeorge Cross\nThe George Cross (GC) is the highest civilian award for bravery, and ranks equal to the Victoria Cross. It may be awarded to members of the armed forces for acts of heroism not in the presence of the enemy. A miniature of this award is also worn in undress.\n*Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher, Royal Marines Reserve, July 2008\n*Colour Sergeant Kevin Haberfield, Royal Marines, August 2005\n*Staff Sergeant Kim Spencer Hughes, The Royal Logistic Corps, March 2010\n*Staff Sergeant Olaf Sean George Schmid, The Royal Logistic Corps, March 2010 (killed in action)\n*Corporal Mark William Wright, The Parachute Regiment, December 2006 (killed in action)\nOrder of the Bath\nSenior officers may be appointed to the Order of the Bath for distinguished service.

It may be awarded to any rank, but the majority of awards are to officers of at least the rank of lieutenant colonel (or equivalent) commanding recognised formations. Although an Order, and with only one Class - Companion - bars may be awarded for further periods of service meriting an appointment to the Order.\nBar to DSO:\n*Lieutenant Colonel James Alexander Delacour De Labilliere DSO MBE, The Rifles, March 2012;
