All seats on 14 county councils and eight unitary authorities in England were up for election. They were the first local elections to follow the 2024 general election. Most of these seats were last contested at the 2021 local elections.\nThere were also six mayoral elections, including the inaugural election for the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, and the inaugural election for the mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire. The 2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election was also held on 1 May. In addition, elections for the Council of the Isles of Scilly were held. The City of London Corporation held elections on 19 and 20 March.\nThe BBC described the elections as a \"sweeping victory\" for Reform UK: the party won 677 seats, increasing their total councillor number to 804, just less than the 895 councillors in post for the Green Party. Reform thus held overall control in 10 local authorities, the Greens had overall control of 1. The governing Labour Party and opposition Conservative Party lost councillors ending with 6,177 and 4,403 councillors and overall control of 107 (-1) and 33 (-16) councils respectively. This was the first time that Labour finished fourth in a local election; it was the first set of elections under the premiership of Keir Starmer. There were gains for the Liberal Democrats who took overall control of three new councils (up to 37) and won more seats (370 new councillors to end with 3,197)) than the Conservatives for the second local election in a row.\nSome elections originally scheduled for 2025 have been delayed by up to a year while reorganisation takes place. The government announced that elections to nine councils would not take place in 2025 to allow restructuring, with elections to reformed or newly created replacement authorities taking place in 2026.\nBackground\nSignificance of these elections\nThese elections were the first local elections to follow the general election held on 4 July 2024 which resulted in a landslide victory for the Labour Party. The combined vote share for Labour and the Conservatives reached a record low, with smaller parties doing well. Labour returned to being the largest party in Scotland and remained so in Wales. The election was noted as the most disproportionate in modern British history (i.e. Labour won 63% of seats with 34% of the vote), mainly as a result of the first-past-the-post voting system.\nKeir Starmer won a landslide victory at the general election and became prime minister, but with the smallest share of the electoral vote of any majority government since record-keeping of the popular vote began in 1830. By the end of 2024, opinion polling for the Labour Party and Starmer's personal approval ratings had dropped significantly following several controversies including those regarding the abolition of Winter Fuel Payments and alleged trading of gifts for political influence, as well as a series of far-right anti-immigration riots fueled by the perception that his government mishandled its response to the 2024 Southport stabbings, protests by farmers over a proposed new inheritance tax on their farms, and continued government support for Israel in the Gaza war. These controversies culminated in an online petition in November 2024 calling for an early general election reaching over 2 million signatures within 2 days.\nOn 2 November 2024, Kemi Badenoch won the 2024 Conservative leadership election to succeed Rishi Sunak as leader of the opposition. In a December 2024 interview, Badenoch said the public \"kicked out\" the Conservative Party because it was not trusted and did not deliver; she dismissed concerns that her approach of not having specific policy positions would leave a vacuum that could be filled by Reform UK; and she acknowledged the 2025 local elections would be difficult for her party. Nigel Farage's party Reform UK placed third in the share of the vote in the 2024 election and had MPs elected to the Commons for the first time. Farage and his party Reform UK did well in opinion polls at the expense of both Labour and the Conservatives.\nFollowing the publication of the English Devolution White Paper on 16 December 2024, which set out the Labour government's plans for local government reorganisation, some of the elections scheduled for May 2025 will be delayed by up to a year while reorganisation takes place. County councils and unitary authorities had until 10 January 2025 to request to join the Government's Devolution Priority Programme and ask the Government to cancel or postpone their regularly scheduled elections. At least 13 of the 21 county councils asked the government to delay their elections. On 5 February 2025, the government announced that elections to nine councils (seven county councils and two unitary authorities) would not take place in 2025 to allow restructuring to take place, with elections to reformed or newly created replacement authorities taking place in 2026.\nThese were the third set of local elections held under the Elections Act 2022, a controversial voter identification law that requires voters to show photo ID when attending a polling station. This act also meant that the elections for directly-elected mayors would use the first-past-the-post voting system rather than the previously used supplementary vote system.\nCampaign\n{| class=\"floatright plainrowheaders wikitable\"\n|+ Aggregate seats contested by party\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" | Seats\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Reform UK\n| |width=100%|per=1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Conservative\n| |width=100%|per=1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Labour\n| |width=100%|per=1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Liberal Democrats\n| |width=100%|per=1}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Green\n| |width=100%|per=1}}\n|}\nLiberal Democrats\nEd Davey launched the Liberal Democrats' campaign on 17 March in Great Missenden. On 20 March the party's spring conference began in Harrogate.\nDavey said he wanted to replace the Conservatives as the \"party of Middle England\".\nConservative\nKemi Badenoch launched the Conservative Party's campaign on 20 March at an event in Buckinghamshire. She warned activists of an \"extremely difficult\" challenge, and promised to bring \"lower taxes and better services.\"\nBadenoch suggested that Conservative Party councillors could form coalitions with Reform UK councillors, but Farage turned this suggestion down.\nReform UK\nNigel Farage launched the Reform UK campaign at an event on 28 March at Arena Birmingham. Reform contested nearly all the council seats and the six mayoral elections.\nLabour\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer launched the Labour Party campaign on 3 April at an event in Derbyshire.\nGreen\nCarla Denyer launched the Green Party campaign on 8 April in Warwickshire.\nResults\nOverall\nThe table below shows the results of these elections, along with the overall number of councillors in Great Britain for each party following the elections.\n{| id=\"results\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Party\n! colspan=\"3\" | Councillors\n! colspan=\"4\" | Councils\n|-\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"| Won\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|After\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|+/−\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|Won\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|After\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|+/−\n|-\n|\n|677\n|804\n| 677\n|10\n|10\n| 10\n|-\n|\n|370\n|3,197\n| 163\n|3\n|40\n| 3\n|-\n|\n|319\n|4,403\n| 674\n|0\n|33\n| 16\n|-\n|\n|98\n|6,124\n| 187\n|0\n|107\n| 1\n|-\n|\n|79\n|895\n| 44\n|0\n|1\n|\n|-\n|\n| colspan=1\n| 418\n|\n| colspan=1\n| 1\n|\n|-\n|\n| colspan=1\n| 201\n|\n| colspan=1\n| 3\n|\n|-\n|\n| 94\n|2,546\n| 23\n|0\n|11\n|\n|-\n|\n| colspan=3\n|10\n|162\n| 4\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#f2f2f2 \" | Total\n! style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | 1,635\n! style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | 18,596\n! style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | —\n! style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | 23\n! style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | 368\n! style=\"background:#f2f2f2;\" | —\n|}\nCounty councils\nThere are 21 county councils in England. All of them hold whole-council elections on a four-year cycle that includes 2025. However, 7 county councils (Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Surrey, East Sussex, West Sussex and Hampshire) had their elections postponed due to local government reorganisation. A total of 16 county councils applied for their elections to be postponed, though 9 (Derbyshire, Devon, Gloucestershire, Kent, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire) had this request rejected and their elections went ahead as planned, as these places were not part of the Devolution Priority Programme.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | Result\n|-\n|Cambridgeshire\n| 61\n|  (Lib Dem–Lab–Ind coalition)\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Derbyshire\n| 64\n|\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Devon\n| 60\n|\n|  (Lib Dem–Green coalition)\n|Details\n|-\n|Gloucestershire\n| 55\n|\n|  (Lib Dem minority)\n|Details\n|-\n|Hertfordshire\n| 78\n|\n|  (Lib Dem minority)\n|Details\n|-\n|Kent\n| 81\n|\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Lancashire\n| 84\n|\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Leicestershire\n| 55\n|\n|  (Reform UK minority)\n|Details\n|-\n|Lincolnshire\n| 70\n|\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Nottinghamshire\n| 66\n|\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Oxfordshire\n| 69\n|  (Lib Dem–Lab–Grn coalition)\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Staffordshire\n| 62\n|\n|\n|Details\n|-\n|Warwickshire\n| 57\n|\n|  (Reform UK minority)\n|Details\n|-\n|Worcestershire\n| 57\n|\n|  (Reform UK minority)\n|Details\n|}\nMetropolitan boroughs\nMost metropolitan boroughs are elected by thirds across three years, with a fourth fallow year, which fell in 2025.

The Green Party won 895 seats and control of 1 council. The governing Labour Party and opposition Conservative Party won 6,177 seats and 4,403 seats and overall control of 107 (-1) and 33 (-16) councils respectively. There were gains for the Liberal Democrats, who gained overall (majority) control in Cambridgeshire, Shropshire and Oxfordshire and won 3,197 seats and 40 councils overall. At 30%, Reform's projected national vote share was higher than UKIP's 23% at the 2013 local elections, representing the first set of local elections since PNS began to be calculated where neither the Conservative nor Labour parties received the highest vote share.\nThe result of the 2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election, took place on the same day. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell argued that recent government cuts had made voters feel that the party had turned its back on them. Richard Burgon, Labour MP for Leeds East, called the result \"entirely avoidable\". Starmer acknowledged that the result was disappointing but defended his government's decisions. Farage described the result as a \"very big moment\" for his party. He also attributed Labour's defeat to a loss of confidence in Starmer's governance, especially voter frustration on immigration.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ Projected proportion of aggregate votes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\" | Party\n! colspan=\"3\" | BBC\n! colspan=\"2\" | Sky News\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |  from\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |  from\n|-\n! 2024\n! 2021\n! 2024\n|-\n|\n|30%\n| 28pp\n| N/A\n|32%\n| N/A\n|-\n|\n|20%\n| 14pp\n| 9pp\n|19%\n| 16pp\n|-\n|\n|17%\n|\n|\n|16%\n|\n|-\n|\n|15%\n| 10pp\n| 21pp\n|18%\n| 8pp\n|-\n|\n|11%\n| 2pp\n|N/A\n|7%\n|N/A\n|-\n|\n|7%\n| 2pp\n|N/A\n|8%\n|N/A\n|}\nOpinion polls\nVoting intention\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height:14px;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Date(s)conducted\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Pollster\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Client\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Samplesize\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Area\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Con\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Lab\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |LD\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Grn\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Ref\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Others\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"2025-04-24\" | 17 – 24 Apr 2025\n| More In Common\n|Channel 4\n|977\n|GB\n|25%\n|18%\n|17%\n|8%\n|style=\"background:#ccf8ff; color: black;\"|26%\n|6%\n|}\nSeat projections\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; line-height:14px;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Date(s)conducted\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Pollster\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Client\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Samplesize\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Area\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Con\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Lab\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |LD\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Grn\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Ref\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:50px;\"|Others\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"background:;\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |Results\n|319\n|98\n|370\n|79\n|style=\"background:#ccf8ff; color: black;\"|677\n|94\n|-\n|data-sort-value=\"2025-03-10\" | 1 – 10 Mar 2025\n| Electoral Calculus\n| The Daily Telegraph\n|5,421\n|GB\n| style=\"background:#CCEBFF;\" |548\n|252\n|270\n|27\n|474\n|77\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |6 May 2021\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |2021 local elections\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |–\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |–\n| style=\"background:#CCEBFF;\" |974\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |307\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |230\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |38\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |0\n| style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" |101\n|}\nLord Haywood, a Conservative peer and political pollster, predicted that the Conservative Party could lose between 475 and 525 councillors in the local elections. He also suggested that the results would not be particularly positive for the Labour Party, forecasting little change in its overall number of councillors. Haywood projected that Reform UK could gain between 400 and 450 seats. He further indicated that Labour could be at risk of losing control of Doncaster Council to Reform UK and might lose nearly all of its seats on either Oxfordshire or Cambridgeshire councils.\nOn the day of the election, prior to the close of polls, the New Statesman published a forecast from Britain Elects showing an expected result of the Conservatives on 483 seats, Labour on 334, the Liberal Democrats on 314, Reform on 311, Green on 56, and the remaining 109 for other parties.\nSee also\n* 2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election (1 May)\n* 2025 Manx local elections (24 April)\nNotes\nReferences"
