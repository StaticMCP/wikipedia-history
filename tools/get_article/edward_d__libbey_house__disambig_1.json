Libbey House is a historic house museum at 2008 Scottwood Avenue in Toledo, Ohio.  Built in 1895, it was the home of Edward Libbey (1854-1925), a businessman who revolutionized the glass making industry in the United States. Libbey and his wife, Florence Scott Libbey would later establish the Toledo Museum of Art in 1901.\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1983. The property was purchased in 2008 by The Libbey House Foundation with the intent to restore the house to its original condition\nDescription and history\nThe Edward D. Libbey House is located in the Old West End District, at the corner of Scottwood Avenue and Woodruff Avenue. It is a Shingle style home designed by architect David L. Stine and built in 1895.  It is  stories in height, with a foundation of fieldstone and brick, and a shingled exterior.  It has asymmetrical massing typical of the style, with gables of varying size, projecting and recessed sections, and a porch supported by clusters of Tuscan columns.\nEdward Libbey, a native of Massachusetts, was trained in the manufacture of glass at the New England Glass Company, and came to Toledo in 1888, where he established a new glass works with former employees of that firm.  Working with inventor Michael Joseph Owens, Libbey proceeded to revolutionize the manufacture of glass, creating automated equipment for producing all manner of glass products, including light bulbs, bottles, glass tubing, and window glass.  He eventually founded several different firms in support of these and other innovations.\nLibbey owned the house until is death in 1925; it is the only significant surviving architectural artifact associated with his life.  It remained a private residence until 1965, when it was purchased by the Toledo Society for the Handicapped. It is now owned and operated by a dedicated non-profit charity.\nGallery\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, exterior views, 2018 - DPLA - 4381d816a3fd94d490f7e166fc876e21 (page 7).jpg|Exterior of Libbey House, 2018\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, exterior views, 2018 - DPLA - 4381d816a3fd94d490f7e166fc876e21 (page 6).jpg|Exterior of Libbey House, 2018\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, exterior views, 2018 - DPLA - 4381d816a3fd94d490f7e166fc876e21 (page 3).jpg|Historical marker outside of Libbey House, 2018\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, exterior views, 2018 - DPLA - 4381d816a3fd94d490f7e166fc876e21 (page 2).jpg|Historical marker outside of Libbey House, 2018\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, architectural drawing, 1895 - DPLA - c3e4c18dc3ac8ad290b7cf2f01a5c9d2.jpg|Blueprint of Libbey House detailing first floorplan, 1895\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, architectural drawing, 1895 - DPLA - eb55ac347226705be4ccf2ddb6ce8f24.jpg|Blueprint of Libbey House detailing second floorplan, 1895\nFile:Edward Drummond Libbey Residence, architectural drawing, 1895 - DPLA - 50b2628c3cad60ada3a6954495f11576.jpg|Blueprint of Libbey House detailing north exterior elevation, 1895\nFile:Edward D.
