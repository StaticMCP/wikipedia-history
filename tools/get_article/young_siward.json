      "text": "# Young Siward\n\nYoung Siward is a character in William Shakespeare’s play Macbeth (1606). He is the son of Siward, general of the English forces in the battle against Macbeth. Macbeth kills him in the final battle, shortly before his swordfight with Lord Macduff.\nHe is based on the real-life historical figure of Osbeorn Bulax.\nRole in the Play\nHe first appears in scene 5.2, as the English forces join with the Scottish. Lennox refers to him as one of many “unrough youths” who “protest their first of manhood.” If he is an “unrough” youth, then he is too young to grow a beard and is probably around fifteen or sixteen. Also, to protest his \"first of manhood” means that he is eager to prove himself as a man.\nHe next appears in scenes 5.4 and 5.6 as the troops enter Birnam Wood and Malcolm orders him and his father to lead the first battalion against Macbeth.\nHis final appearance occurs in scene 5.7 when he comes across Macbeth and attacks, calling him “an abhorred tyrant.” Macbeth slays him and exits the stage.\nIn the final scene of the play, Ross informs Siward of his son’s death, saying “like a man he died.” Siward expresses his gratitude that his son died honorably, and says he is sure that his son has become a soldier of God.\nSignificance\nIn his article about the death of Young Siward, Karl F. Zender writes:\n}}\nIn this sense, the battle between Macbeth and Young Siward serves two purposes. Young Siward is offering himself as champion of Christian good against the forces of darkness, and for Macbeth, his triumph over the boy is proof of his (mistaken) belief that no human can kill him. Young Siward's Christian beliefs are echoed when his father hears of his death and is assured that his son has become \"God’s soldier\" because of his battle against evil. Although he falls in battle, Young Siward is praised for his bravery, and in falling at the hand of Macbeth he has finally achieved manhood (this is indicated when Ross informs Siward that his son \"only liv'd but till he was a man\").\nReferences"
