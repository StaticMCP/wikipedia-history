In area it is between  and  making it the 61st-largest island in the world and Canada's 15th-largest island. Its population, as of the 2021 census, was 1,349, all of whom live in the island's only community, Gjoa Haven. which includes the rest of King William Island, has a population of 0.}}\nWhile searching for the Northwest Passage, a number of polar explorers visited, or spent their winters on, King William Island.\nGeography\nThe island is separated from the Boothia Peninsula by the James Ross Strait to the northeast, and the Rae Strait to the east. To the west is the Victoria Strait and beyond it Victoria Island. Within the Simpson Strait, to the south of the island, is Todd Island, and beyond it, further to the south, is the Adelaide Peninsula. Queen Maud Gulf lies to the southwest.\nSome places on the coast are: (counter clockwise from the northern tip) Cape Felix, Victory Point and Gore Point at the mouth of Collinson Inlet, Point Le Vesconte, Erebus Bay, Cape Crozier, (south side) Terror Bay, Irving Islands, Washington Bay, Cape Herschel, Gladman Point, entrance to Simpson Strait, Todd Islets, (east side) Gjoa Haven, Matheson Peninsula, Latrobe Bay, Cape Norton at mouth of Peel Inlet, Matty Island, Tennent Islands, Clarence Islands, Cape Felix.\nWildlife\nThe island is known for its large populations of barren-ground caribou, which summer there before migrating in the autumn by walking south over the sea ice.\nRole in Arctic exploration\nSir James Clark Ross\nThe island was long occupied by Inuit, who had a culture adapted to the extreme environment. In 1830, the British explorer James Clark Ross named it \"King William Land\" for King William IV the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; Ross thought at the time that it was a peninsula. Some sources credit his uncle, John Ross with naming the land. In 1834, George Back, another Arctic explorer, viewed its south shore from Chantrey Inlet and eventually recognised it as an island.\nSir John Franklin\nsouth of Cape Felix]]\nSir John Franklin, another British explorer, made an Arctic expedition looking for the Northwest Passage about a decade after Ross; his two ships became stranded in 1846 when frozen in the sea ice northwest of the island. After abandoning the two ships, most of the crew died from exposure and starvation as they attempted to walk south near the western coastline. Two of Franklin's men were buried at Hall Point on the island's south coast. The ships were believed lost forever, as many subsequent expeditions were unable to find them. As early as 1854, expeditions sent out to research the fate of Franklin's expedition discovered remains but were unable to find the two ships.\nOn September 9, 2014, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that the Victoria Strait Expedition had located one of Franklin's two ships beneath shallow waters south of King William Island. It is preserved in very good condition; the side-scan sonar could detect the deck planking. By the beginning of October, the wreck had been identified as HMS Erebus. The other expedition vessel, HMS Terror, was found in 2016 in Terror Bay, off the south-west coast of King William Island.\nRoald Amundsen\nLandsat satellite image of King William Island. North is to the upper left]]\nIn 1903, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, looking for the Northwest Passage, sailed through the James Ross Strait and stopped at a natural harbour on the island's south coast. Unable to proceed due to sea ice, he spent the winters of 1903–1904 and 1904–1905 there. During his stays, he learned Arctic living skills from the local Netsilik. He used his ship Gjøa as a base for explorations in the summer of 1904, during which he travelled by dogsled on the Boothia Peninsula and to the North Magnetic Pole. After 22 months on the island, Amundsen left in August 1905. The harbour where he lived has the island's only settlement, Gjoa Haven. Amundsen used skills learned from the Inuit when he made his later expedition to the South Pole.\nGeorge Porter\nGeorge Porter was born on a whaling ship near Herschel Island in 1895 to Mary Kappak and W.P.S. Porter. George was schooled in Alaska. In 1913 he was a sailor on the Elvira and travelled with the explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson. After briefly working as a reindeer herder in Siberia, he enlisted with the US military near the end of the First World War. In 1919, George was discharged from the Army in Iowa. In 1921 George sailed to Australia. Later George guided Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) commander Henry Larsen on many trips. George Porter eventually made Gjoa Haven on King William Island his home, where he worked as the manager of the Hudson's Bay Company trading post for a career of 25 years.\nClimate\nLike many places in the high Arctic the island has a tundra climate (Köppen: ET), its winter is long and cold and the summers are cool, melting part of the ice; with low precipitation, it is a \"cold desert\".\nelevation: , 1961-1990 normals\n| Jan mean C  =-34.2\n| Feb mean C  =-34.9\n| Mar mean C  =-31.4\n| Apr mean C  =-22.0\n| May mean C  =-9.8\n| Jun mean C  =1.0\n| Jul mean C  =7.2\n| Aug mean C  =5.2\n| Sep mean C  =-0.9\n| Oct mean C  =-11.2\n| Nov mean C  =-23.6\n| Dec mean C  =-29.8\n| Jan high C  =-30.8\n| Feb high C  =-31.5\n| Mar high C  =-27.3\n| Apr high C  =-17.2\n| May high C  =-5.9\n| Jun high C  =3.8\n| Jul high C  =11.3\n| Aug high C  =8.5\n| Sep high C  =1.3\n| Oct high C  =-7.8\n| Nov high C  =-19.7\n| Dec high C  =-26.3\n| Jan record high C =-5.0\n| Feb record high C =-4.4\n| Mar record high C =-1.7\n| Apr record high C =2.2\n| May record high C =3.9\n| Jun record high C =21.1\n| Jul record high C =24.4\n| Aug record high C =23.9\n| Sep record high C =13.9\n| Oct record high C =6.7\n| Nov record high C =-0.6\n| Dec record high C =-4.0\n| Jan low C  =-38.3\n| Feb low C  =-38.7\n| Mar low C  =-35.7\n| Apr low C  =-27.1\n| May low C  =-13.8\n| Jun low C  =-2.0\n| Jul low C  =3.1\n| Aug low C  =1.9\n| Sep low C  =-3.2\n| Oct low C  =-14.6\n| Nov low C  =-27.5\n| Dec low C  =-34.0\n| Jan record low C  =-50.0\n| Feb record low C  =-53.0\n| Mar record low C  =-48.3\n| Apr record low C  =-43.3\n| May record low C  =-31.1\n| Jun record low C  =-18.9\n| Jul record low C  =-1.7\n| Aug record low C  =-6.1\n| Sep record low C  =-17.5\n| Oct record low C  =-33.4\n| Nov record low C  =-46.7\n| Dec record low C  =-47.2\n| precipitation colour  = green\n| Jan precipitation mm  =1.7\n| Feb precipitation mm  =2.3\n| Mar precipitation mm  =2.5\n| Apr precipitation mm  =5.5\n| May precipitation mm  =9.4\n| Jun precipitation mm  =10.0\n| Jul precipitation mm  =23.5\n| Aug precipitation mm  =25.9\n| Sep precipitation mm  =18.9\n| Oct precipitation mm  =13.2\n| Nov precipitation mm  =5.0\n| Dec precipitation mm  =2.3\n| year precipitation mm = 120.4\n|snow colour = green\n| Jan snow cm  =1.7\n| Feb snow cm  =2.3\n| Mar snow cm  =2.5\n| Apr snow cm  =5.5\n| May snow cm  =8.4\n| Jun snow cm  =3.0\n| Jul snow cm  =0.2\n| Aug snow cm  =1.3\n| Sep snow cm  =6.5\n| Oct snow cm  =12.4\n| Nov snow cm  =5.0\n| Dec snow cm  =2.3\n| year snow cm = 51.2\n|rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm  =0.0\n| Feb rain mm  =0.0\n| Mar rain mm  =0.0\n| Apr rain mm  =0.0\n| May rain mm  =1.0\n| Jun rain mm  =7.1\n| Jul rain mm  =23.4\n| Aug rain mm  =24.6\n| Sep rain mm  =12.4\n| Oct rain mm  =0.8\n| Nov rain mm  =0.0\n| Dec rain mm  =0.0\n| year rain mm = 69.2\n| unit rain days = 0.2 mm\n| Jan rain days  =0\n| Feb rain days  =0\n| Mar rain days  =0\n| Apr rain days  =trace\n| May rain days  =trace\n| Jun rain days  =3\n| Jul rain days  =8\n| Aug rain days  =9\n| Sep rain days  =5\n| Oct rain days  =trace\n| Nov rain days  =0\n| Dec rain days  =0\n| year rain days = 26\n| unit snow days = 0.2 cm\n| Jan snow days  =2\n| Feb snow days  =2\n| Mar snow days  =2\n| Apr snow days  =3\n| May snow days  =5\n| Jun snow days  =2\n| Jul snow days  =trace\n| Aug snow days  =1\n| Sep snow days  =5\n| Oct snow days  =8\n| Nov snow days  =4\n| Dec snow days  =2\n| year snow days = 38\n| unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n| Jan precipitation days  =2\n| Feb precipitation days  =2\n| Mar precipitation days  =2\n| Apr precipitation days  =3\n| May precipitation days  =6\n| Jun precipitation days  =5\n| Jul precipitation days  =8\n| Aug precipitation days  =10\n| Sep precipitation days  =10\n| Oct precipitation days  =8\n| Nov precipitation days  =4\n| Dec precipitation days  =2\n| year precipitation days = 63\n| source = Environment and Climate Change Canada Canadian Climate Normals 1961-1990\n}}\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nNotes\nReferences\n* The Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, .\nFurther reading\n* Fraser, J.
