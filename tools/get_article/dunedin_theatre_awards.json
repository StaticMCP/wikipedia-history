The awards were established in 2010 by director and actor Patrick Davies, and the winners are selected by a panel of theatre reviewers. The winners are selected by the Dunedin Reviewers Collective.\n2010 awards\nThe first awards were presented by Mayor Dave Cull in December 2010 at an event held at the Fortune Theatre. The panel of reviewers who selected the winners consisted of Anna Chinn, Jimmy Currin, Barbara Frame, Terry MacTavish, Sharon Matthews, and Jen Aitken. The awards were criticised when 6 out of 7 awards were won by the Fortune Theatre, and no awards were given to visiting production Miss Saigon. Founder of the awards Patrick Davies said that the awards explicitly excluded children's theatre, musical theatre or \"anything to do with education\" from consideration, but that categories for those types of production might be included the following year. The OSTAs (Otago Southland Theatre Awards) were launched in 2013 to reward achievements in musical theatre.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Award\n!Winner\n!Notes\n|-\n|Technical design\n|Peter King for Wuthering Heights\n|at the Fortune Theatre.
