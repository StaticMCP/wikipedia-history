Introduced in 1977. This award is bestowed upon Bangladeshi citizens or organizations in recognition of substantial contributions to one of many fields, including the War of Liberation, the Language Movement, education, literature, journalism, public service, science and technology, medical science, social science, song, games and sports, fine arts, rural development, and other areas.\nEach awardee receives a gold medal, a certificate of honour, and 500,000 Bangladeshi takas (US$4109). A cabinet committee on national awards prepares the list of each year's nominees and forwards the list to the head of the government for final approval. The award is traditionally presented on the eve of Independence Day in Bangladesh at a much publicized ceremony attended by several cabinet and parliament members and distinguished society guests.\nIn 2006, the award generated some controversy as the initial list was not accepted by the Prime Minister, some government ministers had expressed concern over the nomination of three fellow ministers. Furthermore, the award to the Rapid Action Battalion was criticized by many because of RAB's alleged involvement in extrajudicial killings.\nAwards by decade\n* List of Independence Day Award recipients (1977–1979)\n* List of Independence Day Award recipients (1980–1989)\n* List of Independence Day Award recipients (1990–1999)\n* List of Independence Day Award recipients (2000–2009)\n* List of Independence Day Award recipients (2010–2019)\n* List of Independence Day Award recipients (2020–2029)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132451/http://www.cabinet.gov.bd/view_award.php?year_select=1980&Submit=GO&lang=en List of awardees], Cabinet Division, Bangladesh Government\n*"
