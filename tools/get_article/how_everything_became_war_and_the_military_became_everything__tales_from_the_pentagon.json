But Ms. Brooks has a larger ambition: She wants to explore exactly what happens to a society when the customary distinctions between war and peace melt away.\" Writing in Foreign Affairs, Lawrence Freedman said the book details how the U.S. military became part of a blurred boundary between war and peace, and drawn \"into pursuits for which it is not well suited, such as postconflict reconstruction\". A National Review book review said that it confirmed real-world \"consequences\" of trends noted in a 1992 Air Force officer thesis, printed in the United States Army War College quarterly journal, Parameters that was set in a fictionalized 2012, in which \"after years of being handed the tough jobs the rest of the government seemed incapable of handling, the U.S. military, with the acquiescence of the American people and their government, simply took over\" in a military coup d'état of the United States government.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
