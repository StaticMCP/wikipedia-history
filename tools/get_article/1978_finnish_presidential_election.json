They were the first elections since 1968, as Parliament had extended Urho Kekkonen's term by four years. The public elected presidential electors to an electoral college on 15 and 16 January. The electors, in turn assembled in Helsinki on 15 February to formally elect the President. Urho Kekkonen, president since 1956, was re-elected on the first ballot by the electors. The turnout for the popular vote was 64%.\nKekkonen had agreed to become the Social Democratic presidential candidate in April 1975, and after that all the major Finnish political parties chose him as their candidate. Kekkonen's opponents, such as the Christian League's presidential candidate Raino Westerholm, claimed that Kekkonen's long presidency weakened Finnish democracy. Over one-third of Finnish voters abstained from voting, partly as a protest against Kekkonen's expected landslide victory.\nThe 77-year-old Kekkonen's health was already declining, although this was not easily noticeable in his public appearances.\nResults\nPopular vote\n|party2=Centre Party|votes2=475372|seats2=64\n|party3=Finnish People's Democratic League|votes3=445098|seats3=56\n|party4=National Coalition Party|votes4=360310|seats4=45\n|party5=Swedish People's Party|votes5=88054|seats5=12\n|party6=Liberals|votes6=71232|seats6=8\n|party7=Åland Coalition|votes7=5331|seats7=1\n|party8=Socialist Workers Party|votes8=2187|seats8=0\n|party9=|votes9=893|seats9=0\n|atotal10=2017631|aseats10=260\n|alliance11=Finnish Christian League|votes11=215244|seats11=24\n|alliance12=Finnish Rural Party|votes12=114488|seats12=10\n|alliance13=Constitutional People's Party|votes13=82478|seats13=6\n|alliance14=Finnish People's Unity Party|votes14=18543|seats14=0\n|invalid=21955\n|electorate=3844279\n|total_sc=0\n|source=Nohlen & Stöver\n}}\nElectoral college\n|party4=Constitutional People's Party|votes4=6\n|source=Nohlen & Stöver\n}}\nReferences"
