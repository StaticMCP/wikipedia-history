The president is the nominal head of the executive, the first citizen of the country, and the supreme commander of the Pakistan Armed Forces. President is ceremonial head of state of Pakistan. He is bound to act on advice or Prime Minister and cabinet. Asif Ali Zardari is the 14th and current president, having assumed the presidency on 10 March 2024.\nThe office of president was created upon the proclamation of Islamic Republic on 23 March 1956. The then serving governor-general, Major General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 ''coup d'etat'', the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.\nThe constitution prohibits the president from directly running the government. Instead, the executive power is exercised on his behalf by the prime minister who keeps him informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy, as well as all legislative proposals. The Constitution however, vests the President with the powers of granting pardons, reprieves, and the control over military; however, all appointments at higher commands of the military must be made by the President on a \"required and necessary\" basis, upon consultation and approval from the prime minister.\nThe president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College for a five-year term. The Constitution requires the president to be a \"Muslim of not less than forty five (45) years of age\". The president resides in an estate in Islamabad known as Aiwan-e-Sadar (President's House). In his absence, the chairman of Senate exercises the responsibilities of the post, until the actual president resumes office, or the next office holder is elected.\nThere have been a total of 14 presidents. The first president was Iskander Ali Mirza who entered office on 23 March 1956. The current President is Asif Ali Zardari, who took charge on 10 March 2024, following his controversial victory in the 2024 election.\nPowers and authority\nRole of the President\nThe Official Residence and the Workplace of the President is Aiwan-e-Sadr— the presidential palace located in northeastern Islamabad. The presidency forms the vital institutional organ of state and is part of the bicameral Parliament.\nPowers to exercise the authority are limited to the ceremonial figurehead, and required to address the Parliament to give a direction for national policies before being informed of its key decisions.\nIn addition, the president is also a civil commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces, with Chairman of the joint chiefs being its chief military adviser to maintain the civilian control of the Pakistani military. After a thorough confirmation comes from the Prime minister, the President confirms the judicial appointments in the national court system. In addition, the Constitution allows the president to grant pardons, reprieves, and clemency in cases recommended to him by the executive and the judiciary. The president himself has absolute constitutional immunity from criminal and civil proceedings, and no proceedings can be initiated or continued against him during the term of his office.\nin Chapter 1: The President of Part III: The Federation of Pakistan in the Constitution of Pakistan}}\nLegislative powers\n* According to Article 50 of the Constitution the Parliament of Pakistan consists of the president and two Houses known as the National Assembly and the Senate.\n* The president shall assent to a bill within ten days after it has been presented to him for assent. if the president fails to do so he shall be deemed to have assented to the bill at the expiration of the period.

Furthermore, the presidential powers have significantly declined with Pakistan's government reversed to a parliamentary democratic republic.\nPowers before the 18th Amendment\nBefore the 18th Amendment to the constitution in 2010, the President was quite powerful.\nHe had the constitutional authority to choose and appoint the Prime Minister in his discretion who got majority votes from the National Assembly.\nDue to Article 58-2(b), he had the authority to dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion when the Government of Federation cannot be carried according to the provisions of the Constitution. President Zia Ul Haq, Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Farooq Leghari used this constitutional provision to dissolve the elected Prime Minister's Government. The President is the ceremonial head of state, while the Prime Minister is head of the executive, although this provision made the President more powerful than the Prime Minister, making the PM subordinate to him. If there is any misunderstanding or disagreement between the President and the Prime Minister, the President may use these powers to dismiss the Prime Minister and dissolve National Assembly. Pakistan's Parliamentary system was changed to a Semi-presidential government as a consequence.\n* He had the authority to appoint the Governors of Provinces in his discretion.\n* He had the authority to appoint the Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Air Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee in his discretion.\n* He was the chairman of the National Security Council, so he had the authority to take decisions related to national security and defense.\n* He was also the Chairman of the National Command Authority. He had the authority to take decisions related to nuclear weapons and missile technologies of the country.\n* He had the authority to appoint the Chief Election Commissioner in his discretion; he was not bound to consult with Prime Minister and Leader of Opposition.\n* He had the authority to appoint a Caretaker Prime Minister and Caretaker cabinet in his discretion after a dissolution of National Assembly and consultation was not required for these appointments.\n* He had the authority to appoint Judges of Supreme Court and High Court with consultation from the Chief Justice of Pakistan. He was not bound to appoint judges from recommendations of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan.\n* He had the authority to refer to any matter of public importance to the public in form of referendum in his discretion.\n* He had the authority to take decisions related to the foreign policy of the country. President Zia ul Haq and President Musharraf exercised these powers because they were the chiefs of Army Staff and because of the 8th and 17th Amendments to the constitution and President Asif Ali Zardari also exercised these powers because he was chairman of Peoples Party as well as president during 2008 to 2013.\nEligibility and selection process\nThe Constitution of Pakistan sets the principle qualifications that the candidate must meet to be eligible to the office of the president. A president has to be:\n* A citizen of Pakistan\n* A Muslim\n* At least 45 years of age\n* Qualified to be elected as member of the National Assembly\nWhenever the Aiwan-e-Sadr becomes vacant, the selection of president is done by the electoral college, which consists of both houses of Parliament (the Senate and National Assembly) and the four provincial assemblies. The chief election commissioner has to conduct elections to the office of the president in a special session. Voting takes place in secrecy.\nEach elector casts a different number of votes. The general principle is that the total number of votes cast by members of Parliament equals the total number of votes cast by provincial legislators. Each of the provincial legislatures has an equal number of votes to each other, based on the number of members of the smallest legislature, which is the Balochistan Assembly (65 seats).\nThe constitution further states that election to the office of president will not be held earlier than sixty days and not later than thirty days before the expiration of the term of the president in office.\nElection and oath\nThe president is elected indirectly for a term of five years. The incumbent president is eligible for re-election to that office, but cannot hold that office for more than two consecutive terms. The president is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the chief justice—, an oath or affirmation that the president shall protect, preserve and defend the Constitution as follows:\nLine of succession and removal\nThe Constitution discusses the possibility of an acting president. Certain office-holders, however, are permitted to stand as presidential candidates in case of vacancy as the constitution does not include a position of vice president:\n* The chairman of the Senate of Pakistan\n* The speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan.\nThe president may be removed before the expiry of the term through impeachment. The president can be removed for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.\nThe impeachment process may start in either of the two houses of the Parliament. The house initiates the process by leveling the charges against the president. The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by either the chairman or the speaker of the National Assembly through a two-thirds majority. The notice is sent up to the president, and 14 days later it is taken up for consideration.\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by the two-thirds majority. The speaker of the National Assembly then summons the joint session not earlier than seven days. The president has the right to defend oneself.\nIf the resolution is passed by the two-thirds majority at the joint session declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross misconduct, then the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.\nNo president has been impeached. However, the proceedings have been used in 2008 in an attempt to impeach former president Pervez Musharraf who tendered the resignation after the proceedings above were used.\nList of presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n|+Key for presidents list\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20px\" |\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:250px\" | Party name\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color: #6495ED\" |\n| Republican Party\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:\" |\n| Muslim League (C)\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:\"|\n| Armed Forces\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:gray\" |\n| Independent\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:\" |\n| Pakistan Muslim League (Q)\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:\" |\n| Pakistan People's Party\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:\" |\n| Pakistan Muslim League (N)\n|-\n| align=center style=\"background-color:\" |\n| Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Name\n! colspan=\"3\"| Term of office\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Political party\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Elected\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n!

With the promulgation of the first constitution, Pakistan became an Islamic republic in 1956, and the governor-general was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent governor-general, Iskander Mirza, became Pakistan's first president by 1956 Pakistani presidential election. He reportedly suspended the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 on 7 October 1958, and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army General Ayub Khan as the first Chief Martial Law Administrator. Two weeks later, Ayub Khan subsequently carried out the 1958 Pakistani coup d'etat and assumed the presidency.\nbecame the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956]]\nThe Constitution of Pakistan of 1962 introduced by President Ayub Khan, turned the country into a presidential republic without direct elections. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held the 1965 Pakistani presidential election. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, Fatima Jinnah, for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Ayub Khan.\nControversy regarding the U-2 incident (1960), privatization (1963), and war with India (1965), fueled a fierce left-wing opposition movement led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the PPP and Bengali nationalist Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from paralysis and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General Yahya Khan, who imposed martial law and announced that national elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, general elections were held in 1970 which saw the PPP gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current-day Pakistan) and the Awami League gaining a majority in East Pakistan (current-day Bangladesh).\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited Nurul Amin of the Pakistan Muslim League to become the prime minister, and also appointed him as the first vice president. The growing instigated violence against Pakistanis in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use force in order to maintain order there, which further escalated Bengali resistance (1970). Preemptive strikes against India led to another war in 1971, which freed East Pakistan and created Bangladesh.\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of Pakistan after the fall of East Pakistan, President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. President Bhutto created the current Constitution of Pakistan in 1973, transforming Pakistan into a parliamentary democracy, and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial figurehead.\nPast Interventions\nThe general elections held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the right-wing alliance, the Pakistan National Alliance. The events leading to it resulted in military intervention by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq and Chairman Joint Chiefs Admiral Mohammad Shariff. Suspending the Constitution in 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's presidency oversaw the modern growth of far-right ideas in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the Constitution, President Zia-ul-Haq held a referendum (1984) and called for general elections in 1985. President Zia-ul-Haq appointed Mohammad Junejo as prime minister and assumed more powers through the constitutional amendment. After dismissing Prime Minister Junejo, President Zia-ul-Haq announced that new general elections would be held, but President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988.\nThe general elections held in 1988 witnessed the victory of PPP in 1988 and appointed Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan to the presidency. The conflict between Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan repeatedly intervened in government matters and leveled charges against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; thus dismissing Prime Minister Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990. After holding general elections in 1990, Nawaz Sharif brought up an ideologically conservative government and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by Supreme Court and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shamim Allam, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tendered resignations in 1993.\nFollowing the new elections held in 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto established a strong government after appointing loyalist Farooq Leghari to the presidency. However, the corruption charges and the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 resulted in President Farooq Leghari dismissing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In 1997, President Farooq Leghari could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the public in 1997. President Leghari unsuccessfully supported Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah— both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the Judiciary, the Executive, and the Parliament. After appointing Rafiq Tarar, the Parliament successfully passed constitutional amendment to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial self coup in 1999, General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar in 2001 while assuming more powers to the presidency. In January 2004, the Electoral College elected Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the Judiciary, and declared a state of emergency in 2007, after dismissing the senior justices of the Supreme Court. Although Musharraf was elected in 2007, the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious. A populist constitutional movement eventually resulted in Musharraf's departure. On 22 August 2008, the electoral commission called for presidential nominations to be delivered by 26 August 2008 and for elections to be held on 6 September 2008.\nFigurehead overview\nvisits Maritime Ministry, flanked by Ali Zaidi and Rizwan Ahmed]]\nAfter the presidential election held in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari lobbied for constitutional amendment to restore the Constitution as it was in 1973. In 2010, the Parliament unanimously and with a large majority, passed the eighteenth amendment of the constitution. It revoked the presidential powers and changed Pakistan from a semi-presidential system of government to a parliamentary republic, with great hopes of governmental stability in the future.\nSee also\n*Principal Secretary to the President of Pakistan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Prime Minister of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court\n* Sindh Police\n* Punjab Police\n* Islamabad Police\n* Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army\n* Constitution of Pakistan\n* Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman)\n* Foreign Minister of Pakistan\n* Finance Minister of Pakistan\n* Interior Minister of Pakistan\n* Minister of Defence (Pakistan)\n* Vice President of Pakistan\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.president.gov.pk President of Pakistan: official website]"
