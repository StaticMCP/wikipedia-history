This theory considers civilizations as living entities with life cycles and posits that at certain stages, civilizations tend toward fusion and combination. From this viewpoint, civilizations can not only be in conflict, but also engage in metaphorical unions (marriage), leading to the creation of new civilizations.\nThe theory was reportedly first proposed by Peyman Fattahi (Elia M) in the 1990s (1370s in the Iranian calendar).\nLife Cycle of Civilizations\nThe Fusion of Civilizations theory is based on the similarity between human life and civilizations. Just as humans experience birth, growth, maturity, marriage, aging, and death, civilizations also follow a similar cycle. In this view, the maturity stage of civilizations coincides with the need for deep interaction and fusion with other civilizations.\nA human is born, grows, reaches maturity, marries. After marriage, various destinies await them. Often, after marriage, they witness the birth of their children. As the children grow, they become more worn out and experience middle age, old age, and then death. What happens to most humans has also happened and will happen to most civilizations. And this era is the time of the fusion of civilizations. The marriage of cultures and religions. The coupling of civilizations. Marriage may occur after dialogue or even conflict, but many marriages have occurred without prior dialogue or conflict.\nThis perspective aligns with several cyclical theories of history:\n* Oswald Spengler, in his book The Decline of the West (1918), likens civilizations to living organisms that undergo stages of birth, growth, maturity, and death.\n* Arnold J. Toynbee, in A Study of History (1934–1961), also refers to the cycle of rise and fall of civilizations, believing that civilizations grow in response to challenges and decline if unable to respond.\n* Brooks Adams, in his book The Law of Civilization and Decay (1895), points to the cyclical pattern of civilizations, suggesting that they progress through concentration and then decay.\nInteraction of Civilizations: Clash or Fusion\nContrary to theories like the \"Clash of Civilizations\" proposed by Samuel P. Huntington, which argue that future conflicts will primarily be based on cultural and civilizational differences, the Fusion of Civilizations theory posits that the interaction of civilizations can manifest more as a marriage and new fusion than as violence. In this scenario, conflict is merely a prelude to fusion, with the ultimate goal being the amalgamation of civilizations and the creation of a new one.\nSimilarly, Eric Mark Kramer, in his Cultural Fusion Theory, introduced years after the Fusion of Civilizations theory was reportedly first articulated, emphasizes the interaction and combination of cultures, asserting that cultures change through interaction and create new elements.\nGender of Civilizations: Masculine and Feminine\nIn this theory, civilizations, like humans, possess symbolic gender characteristics: some civilizations are described as active, dynamic, and decision-making (masculine), while others are receptive, facilitative, and passive (feminine). This symbolic gender is not fixed and can change based on historical conditions and civilizational interactions.\nSome civilizations in this marriage will be masculine, and some feminine. Just as in the current situation, civilizations may be masculine, feminine, or resemble neutrality. Masculines will have an active, decision-making, and progressive role  and feminines will have a more passive, decision-making, and receptive role. It is even possible that some feminine civilizations, after a new connection, change their state and take on a reverse role. The Fusion of Civilizations says that humans are solitary beings and seek connection from childhood to the end of their lives. This tendency also governs human societies.\nComparisons have been drawn to other theories involving cultural or gender dichotomies:\n* Sandra Bem, in her Gender Schema Theory (1981), believes that gender roles are transmitted through culture and influence individuals' behavior and attitudes.\n* Geert Hofstede, in his cultural dimensions theory, divides cultures into \"masculine\" and \"feminine.\" Masculine cultures emphasize competition, success, and achievement, while feminine cultures emphasize care, quality of life, and cooperation.\nCombination of Civilizations and Emergence of New Civilizations\nAfter fusion, civilizations can create new ones, akin to the birth of a new child, inheriting some features from parent civilizations but possessing an independent identity. These civilizational offspring can be healthy, malformed, legitimate, or illegitimate. A prominent example cited is the combination of Western and Eastern civilizations in the contemporary era.\nFusion of Religions and Spiritual Convergence\nOne consequence discussed in the theory is the gradual integration of religions and the formation of convergent theology or spiritual paths. Examples sometimes cited include Jewish Christians, Buddhist Christians, or shared teachings between Islamic mysticism and Buddhism.\nStories, legends, and most human efforts are oriented toward marriage, and this is the orientation of human societies. The definition of a human in this view is not that humans are evil or benevolent beings. It is that humans are relational beings seeking connection. Humans cannot continue life without connection—with something else; God, ideas, dreams, and most commonly, with a spouse. Civilizations have also followed and will follow this path, and now that they have reached maturity (those that hadn't before), it's time for their fusion. Many religions have blended today, and this blending process began yesterday. Jewish Christians, Hindu Christians... and the same has happened and is increasing regarding civilizations. The marriage of Western and Eastern civilizations and the formation of a new civilization born from it, which is neither this nor that, is an example of this reality. This means the dissolution and disappearance of previous civilizations and the emergence of new ones.\n* Riane Eisler, in her book The Chalice and the Blade (1987), refers to two cultural models: \"dominator\" and \"partnership.\" She believes societies can shift from the dominator model (characterized by hierarchy and control) to the partnership model, emphasizing cooperation, equality, and peace. This aspect of societal transformation towards partnership is sometimes compared to the Fusion theory's implications for religious and cultural convergence.\nThe new civilization inherits features from the father and mother civilizations but is often different from both. A child can be legitimate or illegitimate, healthy or malformed; its birth can be timely or untimely, and other similar states. This reality also applies to the fusion of civilizations. Some new civilizations are even 'anti-civilizations' and exist in contrast to their parent civilizations. Some civilizations that have previously fused will separate because some fusions are compatible or incompatible... A man or woman may experience more than one marriage, and this multiplicity of marriages may occur for a civilization, as it has before...\nFuture of Civilizations: Peace or Conflict\nIn this theory, the tendency of civilizations toward fusion and interaction is seen as ultimately counteracting war and violence. Although conflicts may occur before fusion, the ultimate path is suggested to lead toward a form of \"great peace.\" This process, metaphorically likened to chemical reactions, could lead to a complete transformation of existing civilizational foundations. Some civilizations may absorb or repel others. This behavior, described as differing from historical exclusivity, is portrayed as moving toward global convergence.\nThe end of dialogues is not conflict or dialogue; it's marriage, the fusion of civilizations. And this fusion has occurred and occurs in various dimensions. The nature of this fusion will determine the fate of the world. The behavior of civilizations is like that of humans and families. One swallows the other, but the swallowed one is not destroyed; instead, it changes the first from within. When two feed off each other, both change. The fusion of civilizations is the partnership of civilizations. A close and intermingled partnership. In this intermingling, the participants become indistinguishable from each other. This fusion is such that the fused entities will undergo mutations, but it's unclear whether this mutation will be the same for both, and perhaps the mutation occurs in opposite directions... In the fusion of civilizations, the concept and process of democracy and what depends on it and the new civilization will be transformed... When one is absorbed by another, it can mean that this one repels a third or fourth combination, or the combination of the first and second. So, some civilizations or new combinations will repel other civilizations. This behavior (repulsive and attractive) differs from previous behaviors, and its orientation is not war but peace. The world's orientation is toward great peace, but after a significant event, this movement will become very powerful.\nReferences"
