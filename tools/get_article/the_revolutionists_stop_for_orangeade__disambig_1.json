      "text": "# The Revolutionists Stop for Orangeade__disambig_1\n\n\"The Revolutionists Stop for Orangeade\" is a poem from the second\nedition (1931) of Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry,\nHarmonium.\nAlthough the poem's title is not atypical in being gaudy, it may be an\nexception to the rule that the titles of Stevens's poems are not\nguides to their content. The revolutionists are imploring\ntheir leader to let them stop singing in the sun, or at least to\nresume singing in the shade. And while the captain starts the singing\nin a voice rougher than a grinding shale, orangeade all around would\nnot be amiss.\nThe poem reflects Stevens's affection for the Caribbean, and it is as\nlight as a feather compared to other poems added to the 1931 edition\nof Harmonium, like \"Sea Surface full of Clouds\".\nDirect address and imperative mood (\"Ask us not....\", \"Sing a\nsong....\", \"Wear the breeches...\", \"Hang a feather....\") keeps the\npace brisk in the poem's four stanzas, enhanced in the fourth by the\nunusual rhyming.\nReferences\n* Bates, Milton J. Wallace Stevens: A Mythology of Self. 1985: University of California Press."
