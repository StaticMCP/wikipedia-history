On the right wing, Colonel Horn was completely surprised, and after some resistance he had to retreat. Ultimately, the Prussians were able to stop the attacks, but they gave up Dahlenkirchen because they could not defend it.\nAftermath\nThe unsuccessful siege of Riga went on.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal sources\n*\nIn popular culture\nhttp://www.kurpfalz-feldherren.de/artikel/gefecht-bei-dahlenkirchen-napoleonisch-black-powder-spiel-vom-26032016-teil-1\nExternal links\n*"
