He played college football for the UCF Knights and played professionally for the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.\nEarly life\nWard grew up in Fort Walton Beach, Florida and attended Choctawhatchee High School.\nCollege career\nWard redshirted his true freshman year at UCF and spent his redshirt freshman season as a backup long snapper. As a redshirt senior, he was a finalist for the Patrick Mannelly Award. Ward used the extra year of eligibility granted to college athletes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and returned to UCF for a sixth season and was a finalist for the Mannelly Award for a second straight year. Ward played in 47 games over the course of his college career. After the conclusion of his college career Ward played in the 2023 Senior Bowl and the 2023 Hula Bowl.\nProfessional career\n}}\nWard was signed by the Los Angeles Rams as an undrafted free agent on April 29, 2023, shortly after the conclusion of the 2023 NFL draft. On August 29, 2023, the Rams announced that he had made the initial 53-man roster. Ward played in 13 games during the 2023 season and participated in all 17 games in 2024.\nDuring the 2025 season, the Rams placekicking operation was beset by numerous blocked or missed kicks, which proved crucial in a pair of early season losses. After handling snaps in the team's first eight games, Ward was inactive for the Rams' Week 10 game against the San Francisco 49ers and was replaced as long snapper by veteran Jake McQuaide. One day later, on November 10, 2025, Ward was released by the Rams.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.therams.com/team/players-roster/alex-ward/ Los Angeles Rams bio]\n*[https://ucfknights.com/sports/football/roster/alex-ward/13298 UCF Knights bio]"
