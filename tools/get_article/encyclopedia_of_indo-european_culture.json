      "text": "# Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture (EIEC) is an encyclopedia of Indo-European studies and the Proto-Indo-Europeans. The encyclopedia was edited by J. P. Mallory and Douglas Q. Adams and published in 1997 by Fitzroy Dearborn. Archaeological articles are written by Mallory, linguistic articles are written by Adams, and include a distinguished ''Who's Who'' of 1990s Indo-Europeanists who made contributions as sub-editors. Though it is not a polemic, the work in part extends support to Colin Renfrew's Anatolian hypothesis of Indo-European origins.\nReviews\n*\n*\n*\n*\nBibliography\n*"
