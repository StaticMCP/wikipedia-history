The statues depict 11 Union generals and one Confederate general, Albert Pike, who is depicted as a Mason and not as a general. Two Union admirals are honored, although Admiral Samuel Francis DuPont's statue was removed to Wilmington, Delaware, and he is now honored with a fountain. Other statues depict nuns, peace, emancipation, and the Grand Army of the Republic.\nIn accordance with Executive Order 11593 by President Richard Nixon, the National Park Service surveyed and registered the 18 Civil War statues in Washington, D.C. to aid in their preservation.[https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/anps/anps_7b.htm America's National Park System: The Critical Documents – Edited by Lary M. Dilsaver] They are listed as a group on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe African American Civil War Memorial  was completed in 1997 and is not included in the group of historic statues.\nStatues\n]]\n]]\n#Samuel Francis DuPont Memorial Fountain\n#Nuns of the Battlefield\n#Stephenson Grand Army of the Republic Memorial\n#Peace Monument\n#Ulysses S.
