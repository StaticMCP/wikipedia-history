It can also be used for teleplays, stage plays, radio plays, multimedia, graphic novels and other similar script formats.\nFade In is developed by Kent Tessman, a film director and screenwriter.  The software was first released in 2011; the latest version 4.2.0 was released in 2025.\nThe desktop version of Fade In Professional Screenwriting Software is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  Fade In Mobile is available for iOS (including both iPhone and iPad) and Android devices.\nFeatures\nFade In implements the standard functionality expected of a specialized screenwriting program, including formatting scenes, action, characters and dialogue in industry standard screenplay format.\nFade In provides key features needed by professional screenwriters.  These features include revision management and page/scene locking which are required in a professional environment for managing rewrites through pre-production and production.\nFade In's developers have implemented a number of features that the other professional screenwriting programs lack, including full Unicode support, revision page colors, changing character names, full-screen editing, batch watermarking, and support for formats such as Final Draft, Open Screenplay Format, Fountain, and Scrivener.  Some of Fade In's advantages in terms of text rendering and platform compatibility may be due to its more modern software architecture.\nCritical reception\nFade In Professional Screenwriting Software has been reviewed favorably.\nPCWorld gave the software a score of 5 out of 5, noting both its ease-of-use and professional feature set.  MacWorld gave the software a score of 4.5 out of 5, mentioning that it has \"all the major features—and then some—found in industry standard Final Draft, but at a quarter of the price\".  The software has also been reviewed favorably by Linux Journal.\nThe independent review site Top Ten Reviews ranked Fade In among the top screenwriting software along with Final Draft, Movie Magic Screenwriter, and Celtx.\nSee also\n* List of screenwriting software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
