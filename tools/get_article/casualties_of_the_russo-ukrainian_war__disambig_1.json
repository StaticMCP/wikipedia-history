Despite varied reports on Ukrainian military casualties due to underreporting, official figures eventually tallied, indicating significant military and civilian casualties on both sides. The war also saw a substantial number of missing and captured individuals, with efforts to exchange prisoners between conflicting parties. Foreign fighters and civilian casualties added to the war's complexity, with international involvement and impacts extending beyond the immediate conflict zones.\nThe subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine further escalated casualties and destruction. Conflicting reports from Russian and Ukrainian sources indicated high military and civilian casualties, with significant discrepancies in reported numbers. Foreign involvement continued, with both foreign fighters and civilian deaths reported. Efforts to identify and repatriate the deceased, alongside the treatment of prisoners of war, highlighted the human cost of the ongoing conflict.\nRussian annexation of Crimea (2014)\nDuring the Russian annexation of Crimea from 23 February through 19 March 2014, six people were killed. The dead included three protesters, two Ukrainian soldiers and one Russian Cossack paramilitary. On 10 August 2016, Russia accused the Special Forces of Ukraine of conducting a raid near the Crimean town of Armiansk which killed two Russian servicemen. The government of Ukraine dismissed the report as a provocation. Ten people were forcibly disappeared between 2014 and 2016 and were still missing as of 2017.\nWar in Donbas (2014–2022)\nThe overall number of estimated deaths in the war in Donbas from 6 April 2014 to 31 December 2021 was 14,200–14,400. This included about 6,500 pro-Russian separatist fighters, 4,400 Ukrainian fighters, and 3,404 civilians. This number includes non-combat military deaths, as well as deaths from mines and unexploded ordnance. The vast majority of the deaths took place in the first year of the war, when major combat took place before the Minsk agreements.\nTotal deaths\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Breakdown\n! scope=\"col\" | Fatalities\n! scope=\"col\" | Time period\n! scope=\"col\" | Source\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Total\n|14,200–14,400 killed\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 31 Dec. 2021\n|United Nations\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Civilians\n|3,404 killed (306 foreign)\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 31 Dec. 2021\n|United Nations\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"|Ukrainian forces(AFU, NGU, SBGSand volunteer forces)\n|4,400 killed\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 31 Dec. 2021\n|United Nations\n|-\n|4,535 killed\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 23 Feb. 2022\n|Museum of Military History\n|-\n|5,262 killed\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 23 Feb. 2022\n|UALosses project\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Pro-Russian forces(DPR and LPR forces)\n|6,500 killed\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 31 Dec. 2021\n|United Nations\n|-\n|17 killed\n|1 Jan. – 25 Feb. 2022\n|DPR & LPR[https://lug-info.com/en/news/lpr-service-member-killed-in-ukrainian-attack-on-donetskiy-2 LPR service member killed in Ukrainian attack on Donetskiy][https://lug-info.com/en/news/three-lpr-militiamen-four-civilians-killed-in-ukrainian-army-strikes-over-week-jccc Three LPR militiamen, four civilians killed in Ukrainian army strikes over week – JCCC]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Russian Armed Forces\n|400–500 killed\n|6 Apr. 2014 – 10 Mar. 2015\n|US State Department\n|}\nInitially, the known number of Ukrainian military casualties varied widely due to the Ukrainian Army drastically understating its casualties, as reported by medics, activists and soldiers on the ground, as well as at least one lawmaker. Several medical officials reported they were overstretched due to the drastic number of casualties. Eventually, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry stated that the numbers recorded by the National Museum of Military History were the official ones, although still incomplete, with 4,535 deaths cataloged by 23 February 2022.\nAccording to the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 1,175 of the Ukrainian servicemen died due to non-combat causes by 5 March 2021. Subsequently, the military did not publish new figures on their non-combat losses, stating they could be considered a state secret.\nDeaths by regions\nThe following table does not include the 298 deaths from the shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 or the deaths of Ukrainian servicemen, which are listed separately.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Region\n!scope=\"col\"| Fatalities\n!scope=\"col\"| Time period\n!scope=\"col\"| Source\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Donetsk region\n|2,420 civilians and DPR fighters killed\n|6 April 2014 – 15 February 2015\n|OCHA\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Luhansk region\n|1,185 civilians and LPR fighters killed In addition, 526 of the civilians and militants died in Luhansk city alone by 11 September, of which 300 were confirmed as civilians by 31 August.}}\n|1 May 2014 – 15 February 2015\n|OCHA\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Donetsk region\n|4,374 civilians killed\n|6 April 2014 – 18 February 2022\n|DPR\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Luhansk region\n|2,269 civilians killed\n|6 April 2014 – 23 February 2022\n|LPR\n|}\nin Kyiv has been transformed into a war memorial with the photos of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who were killed during the war in Donbas]]\nMissing and captured\nBy 15 May 2016, the Donetsk region's prosecutors reported 1,592 civilians had gone missing in government-controlled areas, of whom 208 had been located. At the same time, a report by the United Nations stated 1,331–1,460 people were missing, including at least 378 soldiers and 216 civilians. 345 unidentified bodies, of mostly soldiers, were also confirmed to be held at morgues in the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast or buried. In all, as of late October, 774 people were missing according to the government, including 271 soldiers. By the end of December 2017, the number of confirmed missing on the Ukrainian side was 402, including 123 soldiers. The separatists also reported 433 missing on their side by mid-December 2016, and 321 missing by mid-February 2022.\nAs of mid-March 2015, according to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), 1,553 separatists had been released from captivity during prisoner exchanges between the two sides. Subsequently, Ukraine released another 316 people by late February 2016, according to the DPR and other media reports, while by September, 1,598 security forces members and 1,484 civilians had been released by the rebels. 1,110 separatist fighters and supporters, including 743 civilians, were reportedly still being held by Ukrainian forces as of late March 2016, according to the DPR. They updated the figure of separatist prisoners to 816, including 287–646 civilians, in December. At the end of May 2015, the Ukrainian commander of Donetsk airport, Oleg Kuzminykh, who was captured during the battle for the complex, was released.\nIn December 2017, a large prisoner exchange took place where the rebels released 73 out of 176 prisoners they were holding, while Ukraine released 306 out of 380 of their prisoners. Out of those that were released by Ukraine, 29 brought to the exchange point refused to go back to separatist-held territory, while 40 who were already previously released did not show up for the exchange. Meanwhile, out of those released by the rebels, 32 were soldiers. This brought the overall number of prisoners released by the rebels to 3,215. Among those still held by the separatists, 74 were soldiers. The number of released prisoners was updated to 3,233 in early March 2019. At the end of December 2019, a new prisoner exchange took place, with Ukraine releasing 124 separatist fighters and their supporters, while 76 prisoners, including 12 soldiers, were returned to Ukraine by the rebels. Another five or six prisoners released by the separatists decided to stay in rebel-controlled territories. The last exchange took place on 16 April 2020, with the separatists releasing 20 people, including 17 civilians, in exchange for 14. while 214 remained in captivity.\nForeign fighters\nForeign volunteers have been involved in the conflict, fighting on both sides. The NGO Cargo 200 reported that they documented the deaths of 1,479 Russian citizens while fighting as part of the rebel forces. The United States Department of State estimated 400–500 of these were regular Russian soldiers. Two Kyrgyz and one Georgian have also been killed fighting on the separatist side. Additionally, at least 253 foreign-born Ukrainian citizens or foreigners died on the Ukrainian side. One of those killed was the former Chechen rebel commander Isa Munayev.\nIn late August 2015, according to a reported leak by a Russian news site, Business Life (Delovaya Zhizn), 2,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine by 1 February 2015.\nForeign civilians and journalists\nAt least 306 foreign civilians were killed in the war in Donbas prior to the 2022 invasion:\n* 298 passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17\n* Italian journalist Andrea Rocchelli and his Russian fixer and interpreter, activist Andrei Mironov\n* Four other civilian journalists and media workers from Russia: Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin, a correspondent and sound engineer respectively; Anatoly Klyan, a camera operator; and Andrey Stenin, a photojournalist\n* One Russian civilian killed in the shelling of Donetsk, Russia\n* One Lithuanian diplomat\nLandmines and other explosive remnants\nAs a consequence of the conflict, large swaths of the Donbas region have become contaminated with landmines and other explosive remnants of war (ERW). According to the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, in 2020 Ukraine was one of the countries most affected by ERW in the world, and had had nearly 1,200 casualties caused by mines or ERW since the beginning of the conflict in 2014. A report by UNICEF released in December 2019 said that 172 children had been injured or killed due to landmines and other explosives.\nRussian invasion of Ukraine (2022–present)\nTotal casualties\nUkrainian estimates of Russian military losses tended to be high, while Russian estimates of their own losses tended to be low. Combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources, including satellite imagery and video image of military actions. According to a researcher at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University in Sweden, regarding Russian military losses, Ukraine engaged in a misinformation campaign to boost morale and Western media were generally happy to accept its claims, while Russia was \"probably\" downplaying its own casualties. Ukraine also tended to be quieter about its own military fatalities. According to BBC News, Ukrainian claims of Russian fatalities included the injured as well. Western countries emphasized the Russian military's toll, while Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting on the Russian death toll. In early June 2022, the Svetlogorsk City Court in the Kaliningrad region ruled that a list of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, published by privately owned news websites, constituted \"classified information\" and its publication could be considered a criminal offense.\nInformation on military casualties is a state secret in both Russia and Ukraine, while the Ukrainian government has been especially secretive, restricting access to demographic data that could be used to estimate its losses. In addition, Western intelligence agencies have been reluctant to disclose their internal calculations of Ukrainian military casualties for fear of undermining an ally. American officials previously said that Ukraine withholds this information from even its closest allies.\nThe number of civilian and military deaths is impossible to determine with precision. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) considers the number of civilian casualties to be considerably higher than the one the United Nations are able to certify.\nPolitical scientist Neta Crawford estimated 323,000 dead in the war by July 2025, with an average rate of 7,690 killed per month—surpassing the average of 2,826 killed per month in the Gaza war and 772 killed in the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021). According to Crawford, while civilians accounted for 80 percent of the fatalities in the Gaza War and 26 percent in the War in Afghanistan, four percent of those killed in Ukraine were civilians.\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Breakdown\n!scope=\"col\"|Casualties\n!scope=\"col\"|Time period\n!scope=\"col\"|Source\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Civilians in Ukraine\n|14,534 killed, 38,472 wounded(confirmed minimum, thought higher)\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 31 Oct. 2025\n|United Nations\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Ukrainian civilians\n|12,000+ killed (confirmed),16,000+ captive like journalist Victoria Roshchyna.}}\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 17 June 202424 Feb. 2022 – 16 Dec. 2024\n|Ukraine\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" |Russian civilians\n|394 killed (in Western Russia)\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 25 Dec. 2024\n|7x7\n|-\n|621 killed (including Crimea),789 missing\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 19 May 2025\n|Russia\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\"|Ukrainian forces\n| 80,000 killed, 400,000 wounded\n|24 Feb. 2022 – before Sep. 2024\n|WSJ citing confidentialUkrainian estimate\n|-\n|\n|-\n|73,000–140,000 killed\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 9 July 2025\n|The Economist estimate\n|-\n|79,213 killed (incl. non-combat),81,728 missing, 4,467 captured(conf. by names)\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 21 Oct. 2025\n|UALosses project\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\"|Ukrainian forces (AFU)\n|70,000 killed, 35,000 missing\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 4 Dec. 2024\n|Yuriy Butusov citing sourceswithin the AFU headquarters\n|-\n|50,000 killed, 380,000 wounded,56,700 missing8,000 captured\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 6 March 202524 Feb. 2022 – 17 Feb. 202524 Feb. 2022 – 30 Oct. 2024\n|Ukraine\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\" |Russian forces\n|984,000–1,438,000 casualties(190,000–480,000 killed)\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 13 Oct. 2025\n|The Economist estimate\n|-\n|247,541–350,726 killed\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 14 Nov. 2025\n|BBC News Russian estimate\n|-\n|1,140,000 killed and wounded\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 4 Nov. 2025\n|UK estimate\n|-\n|1,147,740 losses}}\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 6 Nov. 2025\n|Armed Forces of Ukraine\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\"|Russian forces(DPR & LPR militia excluded)\n|219,000 killed\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 29 Aug. 2025\n|Mediazona & Meduza estimate\n|-\n|226,541–327,226 killed(147,252 conf. by names)\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 14 Nov. 2025\n|BBC News Russian &Mediazona estimate\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" |Russian forces(PMC Wagner)\n|22,000 killed, 40,000 wounded\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 20 May 2023\n|PMC Wagner\n|-\n|20,000 killed, 40,000 wounded\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 30 Nov. 2023\n|UK estimate\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Russian forces(PMCs Wagner, Redut & others)\n|14,981–20,042 killed(conf. by names)\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 5 Nov. 2025\n|BBC News Russian &Mediazona\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Russian forces(Donetsk & Luhansk PR)\n|21,000–23,500 killed\n|24 Feb. 2022 – 30 Sep. 2024\n|BBC News Russian estimate\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\" |DPRK forces\n|6,000+ killed and wounded\n|14 Dec. 2024 – 15 June 2025\n|UK estimate\n|-\n|350 killed\n|14 Dec. 2024 – 1 Sep. 2025\n|DPRK\n|-\n|2,000 killed, 2 captured\n|14 Dec. 2024 – 1 Sep. 2025\n|South Korean estimate[https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/09/02/around-2k-north-korean-soldiers-killed-fighting-for-russia-seoul-claims-a90400 Around 2K North Korean Soldiers Killed Fighting for Russia, Seoul Claims][https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-soldiers-capture-ukraine-russia-defect-141433c872649d55358748b179781758 Seoul's spy agency says North Korean soldiers captured in Ukraine haven't shown desire to defect]\n|-\n|}\nRussian losses\nIn September 2022, Russia's Ministry of Defence confirmed that 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed in combat. In addition, the DPR confirmed that by 22 December 2022, 4,163 of their servicemen had been killed and 17,329 wounded. of which 13 died and 50 were wounded between 1 January and 25 February 2022, leaving a total of 4,163 killed and 17,329 wounded in the period of the Russian invasion.}} Subsequently, leaked US intelligence documents cited the Russian FSB that Russian forces suffered 110,000 casualties by 28 February 2023.\nWagner PMC chief Yevgeny Prigozhin confirmed that his organization had lost over 20,000 troops killed by 25 May 2023. He went on to claim that overall, the Russian military had lost 120,000 dead in Ukraine by late June 2023. He accused the Ministry of Defence of systematically downplaying Russian losses.\nAccording to BBC News Russian and the Mediazona news website, out of 147,252 Russian soldiers and contractors whose deaths they had documented by 14 November 2025, 4.1 percent (6,059) were officers, while 9.1 percent (13,394) were Motorized Rifle Troops and 2.7 percent (4,016) were members of the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV). In addition, 10.8 percent (15,847) of Russian soldiers whose deaths had been confirmed were people who were mobilized, while 12.9 percent (19,012) were convicts. The BBC further stated that The actual toll is likely much higher than can be determined through open sources. Military experts we interviewed suggest that our analysis of Russian cemeteries, war memorials, and obituaries may account for between 45% and 65% of the real death toll. Thus, the BBC stated that the actual death toll of Russian forces, counting only Russian servicemen and contractors (i.e. excluding DPR/LPR militia), was 226,541–327,226 by mid-November 2025.\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that more Russian soldiers died in the first year of the war in Ukraine than in all its other wars since World War II combined, an average 5,000 to 5,800 soldiers a month, vs 13,000 to 25,000 in Chechnya over 15 years and 14,000 to 16,000 in Afghanistan. Thus, the first year of the Ukraine war was 25 times deadlier than Chechnya and 35 times more so than Afghanistan.\nMeduza, analyzing data on confirmed soldiers killed and data retrieved from the Russian probate registry, estimated 75,000 Russian soldiers were killed since the start of the invasion and by the end of 2023, a statistical estimate within a wide range of between 66,000 and 88,000 killed. Subsequently, several months later, Meduza gave a new estimate of 64,000 soldiers killed in 2022 and 2023, based on excess deaths reported by Rosstat, including those in Crimea, but not other Ukrainian regions seized by Russia. Using a similar analysis, but in addition using a statistical model of the ratio of total deaths to deaths confirmed by name, stratified by age group, and the Mediazona updated counts of named deaths, Meduza gave an updated estimate of total Russian deaths of 120,000 killed through to 30 June 2024. Several days later, The Economist made its own calculation using the severely-wounded-to-killed ratio from leaked documents by the United States Department of Defense, giving an estimate of between 462,000 and 728,000 Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the conflict. According to their estimate, approximately 2% of all Russian men between the ages of 20 and 50 may have been killed or seriously wounded in Ukraine since February 2022. By the end of 2024, Meduza estimated that over 165,000 Russian soldiers had died during the war.\nAccording to NATO and Western military officials, around 1,200 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded in Ukraine every day on average in May and June 2024. In July 2024, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army Sir Roland Walker said that with the current way of fighting, it would take Russia five years to control the four regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia that Russia claims as its own, and it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties. He said there are \"no winners\" in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding that \"it is an utter devastation for both sides and lost generations.\" By August 2024, the daily average of Russian military casualties in the conflict was about 1,000 soldiers, according to a Western official.\nIn late January 2025, The New York Times reported that analysts concluded that Russia's losses, including killed and severely injured, were slightly fewer than two soldiers for every Ukrainian soldier killed or severely wounded, after they combined multiple different estimates of Ukrainian losses.\nIn June 2025, Russia's ambassador to the UK Andrey Kelin denied that Russian casualties in the war in Ukraine had reached one million, but refused to give the actual number of casualties, telling CNN that there were about 600,000 Russian troops in Ukraine, down from 700,000 in June 2024, and that 50–60,000 new troops were being recruited and sent to Ukraine every month.\nIn October 2025, Institute for the Study of War (ISW) cited alleged leaked Russian data published by the I Want to Live hotline operated by the Main Directorate of Intelligence of Ukraine, according to which Russia suffered 281,550 total losses between January and August 2025, including: 86,744 killed, 33,996 missing and 158,529 wounded. The Mediazona's data department's analysis of the published list concluded that \"significant anomalies\" were revealed, stating the figures in the leak appeared \"questionable\", but also that it \"appears plausible, to put it cautiously, albeit at the very highest end of the probable range\" and questioned certain figures like losses reported for the \"Dnepr\" group or abnormally high killed-to-wounded ratio, though acknowledging that the \"grey zone\" between front lines means the wounded are often left with very little chance of survival. According to online intelligence group Frontelligence Insight the numbers appeared to be \"fairly accurate\", and some other groups agreed with this assessment.\nAccording to a UK Defence Intelligence report on 14 October 2025, Russia suffered approximately 1.118 million total casualties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, including 332,000 casualties since 1 January. According to the report, Russia's casualty rate reached its high in December of 2024 with 1,570 losses per day on average. Afterwards it was gradually decreasing and dropped to 930 daily casualties in August. It has been steadily increasing again since then, surpassing 1,000 daily casualties between October 5–12.\nAn analysis published by The Economist on 17 October 2025, based on data from satellites and \"more than 200 credible estimates of casualties from Western governments and independent researchers\", stated that Russia's total casualty toll had increased by 60% since the start of the year, with over 100,000 soldiers reportedly killed since the beginning of 2025. According to the report, even if the total number of Ukrainian soldiers killed since the start of 2025 was twice the tally reported by the UALosses project, it would still result in a ratio of \"roughly five Russian soldiers killed for one Ukrainian\". The report also stated that the number of Russian soldiers killed in the war amount to 0.5%–1.2% of the country's pre-war cohort of men under the age of 60.\nUkrainian losses\nUkraine confirmed it had 10,000 killed and 30,000 wounded by the start of June 2022,\nwhile 7,200 troops were missing,[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62125343 Ukraine war: 7,200 Ukrainian service personnel missing – ombudsman] including 5,600 captured. At the height of the fighting in May and June 2022, according to Ukrainian president Zelenskyy and presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, between 100 and 200 Ukrainian soldiers were being killed in combat daily, while presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said 150 soldiers were being killed and 800 wounded daily. Mid-June, Davyd Arakhamia, Ukraine's chief negotiator with Russia, told Axios that between 200 and 500 Ukrainian soldiers were killed every day. By late July, Ukrainian daily losses fell to around 30 killed and about 250 wounded. In August 2023, The New York Times quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that up to 70,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed and 100,000 to 120,000 wounded. However, a new estimate by a U.S. official in October 2024, put the number of Ukrainian casualties at more than 57,500 killed and 250,000 wounded. As of 25 February 2024, Ukraine confirmed 31,000 of its soldiers had been killed in the conflict. In late November 2024, based on all previous estimates of Ukrainian military casualties, The Economist estimated Ukrainian losses at between 60,000 and 100,000 killed and 400,000 wounded. On 8 December 2024, US president-elect Donald Trump claimed 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and seriously wounded so far during the war. Subsequently, President Zelenskyy announced 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 370,000 were wounded, but that \"approximately 50%\" of these soldiers recovered and had returned to active duty. He updated the Ukrainian military's casualty toll in mid-February 2025, to over 46,000 killed and 380,000 wounded.\nRussia's Ministry of Defence claimed 61,207 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 49,368 wounded by September 2022. Mid-December 2024, Russia updated its claim of Ukrainian military casualties to almost 1,000,000 killed and wounded.\nAccording to the UALosses project started at the end of 2023, found to be reliable by Mediazona, Meduza, the Book of Memory group, BBC News Russian and The Economist, themselves also running projects tracking military fatalities in the conflict, it had documented by name the deaths of 79,213 Ukrainian fighters as of 21 October 2025, as well as 81,728 missing in action, for a total of 160,941 dead or missing since the start of the invasion, including non-combat losses.\nAs of mid-April 2023, around 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers remained missing, of whom some 60-65 per cent were believed to be prisoners. The number of missing was updated to 63,000 by mid-February 2025, 90 percent of which were thought to be soldiers.\nYuriy Lutsenko, the former Ukrainian Prosecutor General and member of the opposition party European Solidarity, said on Ukrainian television in January 2024 that around 500,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed or wounded, and that about 30,000 were becoming casualties every month.\nRegions and officers\nMen from the poverty-stricken regions of Russia's Far North, Far East and Siberia were overrepresented among Russian war casualties. Buryats, Kalmyks, Tuvans, Chukchi, and Nenets were reported as Russia's ethnic minority groups suffering disproportionately high casualty rates among Russian forces. On the Ukrainian side, per UA Losses, as of 21 October 2025, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast has the highest number of confirmed Ukrainian soldiers dead or missing at 15,661, while the Kirovohrad Oblast has the highest confirmed death and missing count per capita at 7.029 per 1,000.\nIn terms of confirmed deaths of officers of both belligerents, according to groups collecting that information, 6,059 Russian officers had been killed as of 14 November 2025, and 6,418 Ukrainian officers were dead as of 21 October 2025.\nCivilian casualties\non 10 October 2022]]\nBy 31 October 2025, OHCHR had recorded 53,006 civilian casualties in Ukraine since 24 February 2022: 14,534 killed and 38,472 injured, but said they believe the real number is higher. This included 45,713 (11,782 killed and 33,931 injured) occurred on territory covered by the government of Ukraine and 7,293 (2,752 killed and 4,541 injured) on territory controlled by Russian armed forces or their affiliates. 12,715 deaths were caused by explosive weapons \"with wide area effects\", 467 by mines and explosive remnants, 1,352 by small arms, including from crossfire, or road accidents involving military or civilian vehicles.\nAs of 30 June 2023, OHCHR said it had received information on 287 civilian casualties in Western Russia, with 58 killed and 229 injured, while six more were killed and 16 injured in the Republic of Crimea. Another two civilians were killed and one injured in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Crimean bridge on 17 July 2023, while five civilians were killed and 151 were injured by a Ukrainian missile attack in Sevastopol, in Crimea, on 23 June 2024. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-installed head of Crimea, also alleged that a Ukrainian attack on drilling platforms in the Black Sea near Crimea had left seven Chernomorneftegaz workers missing. The 7x7 Russian opposition media outlet confirmed the deaths of 394 civilians in Russia by 25 December 2024, not including those in Crimea. In addition, missiles struck the Polish border village of Przewodów in Lublin Voivodeship on 15 November 2022, and killed two Polish civilians. Elsewhere, Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 was mistakenly shot down and crashed at Aktau, Kazakhstan, on 25 December 2024, killing 38 people, including 23 Azerbaijanis, seven Russians, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyz.\nIn April 2022, the civilian death toll included more than 200 children. In March 2022, 55 of the war-related child deaths were from the Kyiv area and another 34 were from Kharkiv. On 17 February 2023, the Ukrainian prosecutor general announced that at least 461 children had been killed since the start of the invasion, with a further 923 wounded. Most of these child victims were from the Donetsk region.\nBy February 2023, Ukrainian chief prosecutor for war crimes Yuriy Belousov claimed that \"there could be 100,000 civilians killed across Ukraine, whose bodies will have to be found and identified once occupied territory is liberated.\" A Project on Defense Alternatives study calculated a \"modest\" figure of 40,000 Ukrainian civilian dead by April 2023. In May 2023, US officials claimed Ukrainian civilian deaths were at 42,000, twice the then-estimated figure for Ukrainian military losses. According to the Kyiv Independent, Russia does not allow monitoring in territories it controls, where civilian deaths are thought to be highest.\nUkrainian humanitarian NGOs estimate that 7,000–30,000 Ukrainian civilians have been abducted by Russian forces from territories under their control. One group estimated 70,000 civilians were abducted. Many of them are reported to be held in Russian prisons and penal colonies, and some reportedly died (e.g. Victoria Roshchyna).\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Civilian deaths by area (Ukrainian-controlled & formerly Ukrainian-controlled)\n|-\n!

The initiative, called Ishchi Svoikh (), appeared aimed in part at undermining morale and support for the war in Russia and was quickly blocked by the Russian government's media regulator the day the initiative began at the request of Russia's Prosecutor-General's Office.\nUkrainian authorities began using facial recognition technology supplied to them by Clearview AI on 12 March 2022, to help identify the deceased, along with potentially using it to uncover Russian spies, vet people at checkpoints and potentially combat misinformation. The Chief Executive of Clearview claimed that the technology could be more effective than matching fingerprints or other identifiable aspects of the individual, although a study by US Department of Energy raised concerns about decomposition reducing its effectiveness.\n*  Kyiv authorities have also reached out to the International Commission on Missing Persons, which was formed to help after the 1990s Balkan conflicts and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, and identifies individuals by collecting DNA samples from the deceased and families to cross match. The organization will also document the location of the body and how the individual died.\nAs Russian soldiers began to retreat the identification of the dead civilians who had been unreported due to communication issues and constant fighting began to be reported. Documentation and identification of the bodies began with many hastily dug graves and rubble being cleared away to photograph and identify the bodies as well as count the number involved. Handwritten tags and passports have been attached to the bodies after identification before they are taken by coroners and officials. In some locations villagers kept track of the deceased, such as in Yahidne, a village north of Kyiv, where they used a school basement wall to write the names of the deceased while under Russian control.\nAs of late May 2022, Ukrainian authorities had stored at least 137 bodies of Russian soldiers that were collected near Kyiv, as well as 62 in the Kharkiv region.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Dates ofremains exchanges\n! scope=\"col\" | Russian dead\n! scope=\"col\" | Ukrainian dead\n! scope=\"col\" ! class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n|June 2022\n|374 soldiers\n|365 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|29 March 2024\n|29 soldiers\n|121 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|12 April 2024\n|23 soldiers\n|99 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|2 August 2024\n|38 soldiers\n|250 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|18 October 2024\n|89 soldiers\n|501 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|8 November 2024\n|37 soldiers\n|563 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|20 December 2024\n|42 soldiers\n|503 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|24 January 2025\n|49 soldiers\n|757 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|14 February 2025\n|45 soldiers\n|757 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|28 March 2025\n|43 soldiers\n|909 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|18 April 2025\n|41 soldiers\n|909 soldiers\n|[https://united24media.com/latest-news/ukraine-repatriates-bodies-of-909-fallen-soldiers-from-frontlines-and-russian-territory-7703 Ukraine Repatriates Bodies of 909 Fallen Soldiers From Frontlines and Russian Territory]\n|-\n|16 May 2025\n|34 soldiers\n|909 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|10-16 June 2025\n|78 soldiers\n|6,060 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|16 July 2025\n|19 soldiers\n|1,000 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|19 August 2025\n|19 soldiers\n|1,000 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|19 September 2025\n|24 soldiers\n|1,000 soldiers\n|\n|}\nIn December 2024, Russia's Deputy Minister of Defence Anna Tsivilyova mentioned 48,000 soldiers missing in action for whom relatives have contributed DNA samples as part of search applications.\nAmputations\nin Kharkiv region]]\nOn 2 August 2023, an investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that Ukrainian medical amputations in the war came to between 20,000 and 50,000 including both military and civilians. In August 2025, the  reported that officially, the National Health Service of Ukraine recorded 95,000 amputations carried out in Ukraine on military personnel and civilians. Including amputations carried outside Ukraine the number was as high as 120,000. In comparison, during World War One 41,000 British and 67,000 Germans needed amputations.\nPrisoners of war\n.]]\n.]]\nRussia reported it had captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022, while Ukraine stated 562 Russian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 19 March, with 10 previously reported released in prisoner exchanges for five Ukrainian soldiers and the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov. Subsequently, the first large prisoner exchange took place on 24 March, when 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russian and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged. Among the released Ukrainian soldiers was one of 13 Ukrainian border-guard members captured during the Russian attack on Snake Island. Later, on 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged for an unknown number of Russian troops.\nUkraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, reported that a platoon of the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Kemerovo Oblast surrendered to Ukraine, saying they \"didn't know that they were brought to Ukraine to kill Ukrainians\". Ukraine held a series of press conferences with about a dozen POWs, where the POWs made comments against the invasion, how they had been manipulated and for the conflict to end. According to The Guardian, while it was likely that Ukraine was using the discomfort of captured soldiers for propaganda purposes, still the videos succeeded in showing the Russian servicemen's \"authentic sense\" of regret for having come to Ukraine. Amnesty International said that Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention prohibits videos of captured soldiers. Captured Ukrainian soldiers with British citizenship were recorded calling for Boris Johnson to arrange for them to be freed in exchange for pro-Kremlin Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk. MP Robert Jenrick called the videos, broadcast separately on Russia-24, a \"flagrant breach\" of the Geneva Convention. A Russian spokeswoman claimed that she told Johnson in a phone call about the men's treatment that the UK should \"show mercy\" to Ukrainian citizens by stopping military aid to the Ukrainian government when asked to show the men mercy.\nThe head of the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for POW Treatment, Iryna Vereshchuk, raised concerns that Russia had not released information to Ukrainian authorities on the location of any Ukrainian POW's and the International Red Cross had not been allowed to see them, as of 16 March.\nBy 21 April, Russia claimed that 1,478 Ukrainian troops had been captured during the course of the siege of Mariupol. On 22 April, Yuri Sirovatko, Minister of Justice of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed that some 3,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war were held in the territory of the DPR. On 20 May, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that 2,439 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken prisoner over the previous five days as a result of the surrender of the last defenders of Mariupol, entrenched inside the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works. On 26 May, Rodion Miroshnik, ambassador of the Luhansk People's Republic to Russia, claimed that around 8,000 Ukrainian POWs were held within the territory of the DPR and LPR. According to a statement by Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Minister of Defence, in early June 2022, 6,489 Ukrainian soldiers had surrendered since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn a report by The Independent on 9 June, it cited an intelligence report that more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers had been captured, while the number of Russian servicemen being held as prisoners had fallen to 550, from 900 in April, following several prisoner exchanges. In contrast, the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper claimed 1,000 Russian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 20 June.\nAccording to Ukraine, as of mid-November 2023, 4,337 Ukrainians were being held by Russia as prisoners of war, including 3,574 soldiers and 763 civilians, while by this point 2,598 Ukrainians had been released, including 133 civilians. As of early June 2024, according to Russia, 6,465 Ukrainian soldiers were still being held prisoner in Russia and 1,348 Russian soldiers were prisoners in Ukraine, while by this point 3,210 Ukrainians had been confirmed released, including 143 civilians. By 24 August 2025, the number of prisoners released by Russia during prisoner exchanges rose to 6,095, including more than 240 civilians. An additional 555 Ukrainians were released by Russia outside of the exchanges. At least 800 Russian soldiers had also been confirmed to have been released by late February 2023. Between August 2024 and March 2025, 971 Russian soldiers had been captured during fighting in Kursk Oblast, according to Ukraine. As of the beginning of February 2025, 1,382 Russian servicemen that were previously thought missing were confirmed to be in Ukrainian captivity, while the overall number of Russian prisoners of war was thought to be much higher.\nAccording to the UALosses project, 6,404 Ukrainian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 23 April 2025. By 21 October 2025, the number had fallen to 4,467.\nA study of Russian prisoners of war captured by Ukraine found that 55% of the soldiers had been motivated to fight to \"improve their livelihoods\", while 36% were ideologically motivated.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Official prisoner exchanges\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Number ofexchange\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Russian POWs\n! scope=\"col\" | Ukrainian POWs\n! scope=\"col\" ! class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n|1.\n|24 March 2022\n|10 soldiers, 11 civilians\n|10 soldiers, 19 civilians\n|\n|-\n|2.\n|1 April 2022\n|Unknown\n|86 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|3.\n|9 April 2022\n|Unk. soldiers, 18 civilians\n|12 soldiers, 14 civilians\n|\n|-\n|4.\n|14 April 2022\n|Unknown\n|22 soldiers, 8 civilians\n|\n|-\n|5.\n|19 April 2022\n|Unknown\n|60 soldiers, 16 civilians\n|\n|-\n|6.\n|21 April 2022\n|Unknown\n|10 soldiers, 9 civilians\n|\n|-\n|7.\n|28 April 2022\n|Unknown\n|33 soldiers, 12 civilians\n|\n|-\n|8.\n|30 April 2022\n|Unknown\n|7 soldiers, 7 civilians\n|\n|-\n|9.\n|6 May 2022\n|Unk. soldiers, 11 civilians\n|28 soldiers, 13 civilians\n|\n|-\n|11.\n|10 June 2022\n|4 soldiers\n|4 soldiers, 1 civilian\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|17 June 2022\n|Unknown\n|Unknown (at least 1 civ.)\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|18 June 2022\n|5 N/A\n|5 civilians\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|28 June 2022\n|15 N/A\n|16 soldiers, 1 civilian\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|29 June 2022\n|144 soldiers\n|144 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|2 September 2022\n|Unknown\n|14 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|23.\n|21 September 2022\n|55 soldiers, 1 civilian\n|213 soldiers, 2 civilian\n|\n|-\n|24.\n|30 September 2022\n|Unknown\n|4 soldiers, 2 civilians\n|\n|-\n|25.\n|11 October 2022\n|Unknown\n|32 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|26.\n|13 October 2022\n|20 soldiers\n|20 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|27.\n|17 October 2022\n|30 soldiers, 80 civilians\n|96 soldiers, 12 civilians\n|\n|-\n|28.\n|26 October 2022\n|Unknown\n|10 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|29.\n|29 October 2022\n|50 soldiers\n|50 soldiers, 2 civilians\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|3 November 2022\n|107 soldiers\n|107 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|11 November 2022\n|45 soldiers\n|45 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|23-24 November 2022\n|85 soldiers\n|85 soldiers, 1 civilian\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|26 November 2022\n|9 soldiers\n|9 soldiers, 3 civilians\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|1 December 2022\n|50 soldiers\n|50 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|6 December 2022\n|60 soldiers\n|60 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|N/A\n|14 December 2022\n|Unknown\n|64 soldiers, 1 civilian\n|\n|-\n|35.\n|31 December 2022\n|82 soldiers\n|140 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|36.-48.\n|2023\n|592+ soldiers\n|995 soldiers, 7 civilians\n| The number of released prisoners in four exchanges was not made known.}}\n|-\n|49.-59.\n|2024\n|1,310 soldiers\n|1,329 soldiers, 29 civilians\n|}}\n|-\n|60.\n|15 January 2025\n|25 soldiers\n|24 soldiers, 1 civilian\n|\n|-\n|61.\n|5 February 2025\n|150 soldiers\n|150 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|62.\n|19 March 2025\n|175 soldiers\n|197 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|63.\n|19 April 2025\n|261 soldiers\n|277 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|64.\n|6 May 2025\n|205 soldiers\n|205 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|65.\n|23-25 May 2025\n|880 soldiers, 120 civilians\n|880 soldiers, 120 civilians\n|\n|-\n|66.\n|9 June-23 July 2025\n|1,200 soldiers, 2 civilians\n|1,100 soldiers and civilians\n|\n|-\n|67.\n|14 August 2025\n|84 soldiers\n|33 soldiers, 51 civilians\n|\n|-\n|68.\n|24 August 2025\n|146 soldiers, 8 civilians\n|146 soldiers, 8 civilians\n|\n|-\n|69.\n|2 October 2025\n|185 soldiers, 20 civilians\n|185 soldiers, 20 civilians\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Unofficial prisoner releases\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Russian POWs\n! scope=\"col\" | Ukrainian POWs\n! scope=\"col\" ! class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n|1 March 2022\n|1 soldier\n|5 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|16 March 2022\n|9 soldiers\n|1 civilian\n|\n|-\n|15 April 2022\n|4 soldiers\n|5 soldiers\n|\n|-\n|12 July 2022\n|None\n|2 soldiers, 3 civilians\n|\n|-\n|24 March 2023\n|5 soldiers\n|None\n|\n|-\n|8 June 2023\n|None\n|11 soldiers\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of ongoing armed conflicts\n* Outline of the Russo-Ukrainian War\n* The Wall of Remembrance of the Fallen for Ukraine\n* Casualties during the 2013–2014 Ukraine crisis\n* Military history of the Russian Federation\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
