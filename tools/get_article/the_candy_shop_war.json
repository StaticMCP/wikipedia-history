      "text": "# The Candy Shop War\n\nThe Candy Shop War is a children's fantasy novel written by American author Brandon Mull. It was published by Shadow Mountain Publishing on September 11, 2007. The story follows a boy named Nate and his friends, who become the recipients of magical candy from magicians seeking a powerful treasure. The book is partly based on Mull's own childhood experience of moving to and living in a Northern California town.\nPlot summary\nFifth grade Nate Sutter and his family move to the fictional town of Colson, California, where he became friends with children at school Summer Atler, Trevor, and Paul \"Pigeon\" Bowen.\nThe four acquaint themselves with Belinda White, proprietor of a candy shop, who rewards them with candy in exchange for helping clean the store.\nBelinda White instructs them to complete more difficult tasks, rewarding them with candy with magical properties, though the tasks grow more concerning and the four begin to doubt her true intentions after she reveals that she is a magician hunting for an ancient treasure.\nSummer and Pigeon back out after White directs the four to taint the food of Sebastian Stott, whom she claims is an evil magician, with a \"Clean Slate\", which causes amnesia. Nate and Trevor pretend to accept the assignment and warn Stott.\nNate and Trevor infiltrate White's shop, but Trevor is captured.\nThe three friends meet the mysterious man whom they fought during one of White's tasks; he reveals himself as John Dart, who tells them that the treasure is a draught from the Fountain of Youth, which both Stott and White are seeking to augment their power.\nWith Stott's help, Nate rescues Trevor but is captured and forced to retrieve the draught for White. However, Nate foils White's plans by putting the \"Clean Slate\" candy (from the mission to give Mr. Stott amnesia) into the draught before giving it to White, so White is reverted to a child and loses her memory when she drinks it.\nMain characters\n*Nathan \"Nate\" Sutter: The book's fifth-grade protagonist.
