It was established on 1 September 1999, in accordance with the new Statute of Sejm signed by Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, as well as Minister of Education Mirosław Handke, in August of the same year. Ryszard Górecki became its first chancellor. The Faculty of Theology was established with an agreement between the Polish Episcopate and the government, in the presence of Cardinal Józef Glemp and religious figures. The university's first academic year started in October 1999.\nThe core structure of the university was based on an agreement between the academic senates of three institutions of higher learning already established in the city: the Academy of Agriculture and Technology, the Pedagogical Institute, and the Warmia Institute of Theology.\nThe university has 16 faculties, out of which eight hold full academic rights and therefore entitle the university to operate as an autonomous unit.\nFaculties\n* The Faculty of Animal Bioengineering\n* The Faculty of Fine Arts\n* The Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology\n* The Faculty of Economic Sciences\n* The Faculty of Environmental Management and Agriculture\n* The Faculty of Environmental Sciences\n* The Faculty of Food Sciences\n* The Faculty of Geoengineering\n* The Faculty of Humanities\n* The Faculty of Law and Administration\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Sciences\n* Collegium Medicum: Faculty of Health Sciences and School of Medicine\n* The Faculty of Social Sciences\n* The Faculty of Technical Sciences\n* The Faculty of Theology\n* The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\nAutonomous Entities\n*University Library\nThe University Library is a unit of University structure which performs teaching and research assignments, as well as provides services to other units.
