He was a Research Fellow at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge and a lecturer at Aberystwyth University in International Politics.\nDockter is a former member of the council of the British Institute at Ankara.  Dockter now serves as the President and CEO of the East Tennessee Historical Society in Knoxville, TN.\nBiography\nWarren Dockter is a graduate of the University of Tennessee and gained his PhD at the University of Nottingham. His book Churchill and the Islamic World: Orientalism, Empire and Diplomacy in the Middle East (2015) challenged notions surrounding Winston Churchill's Islamophobia. According to Dockter, Churchill's often quoted criticism of Islam was written  during a time of a fundamentalist revolt in Sudan and this statement does not reflect his full views of Islam as a religion, which were \"often paradoxical and complex.\" He could be critical but at times \"romanticized\" the Islamic world; he exhibited great \"respect, understanding and magnanimity.\" Churchill had a fascination of Islam and Islamic civilization. Winston Churchill's future sister-in-law expressed concerns about his fascination by stating, \"[p]lease don't become converted to Islam; I have noticed in your disposition a tendency to orientalism.\" However, Dockter also asserted that Churchill \"never seriously considered converting\" to Islam.\nDockter worked  with Boris Johnson as his research assistant for the book The Churchill Factor: How One Man made History. He was not credited, but was thanked in its acknowledgments.\nPublications\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-warren-dokter\n* http://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/our-people/warren-dockter\nReferences"
