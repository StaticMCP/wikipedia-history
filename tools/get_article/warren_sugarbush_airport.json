The airport closes in the winter when snow is on the ground and is transformed into a Nordic ski center called Ole's. Ole's uses the airport and surrounding land for trails.\nSee also\n* List of airports in Vermont\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=1&s=11&lat=44.1167272&lon=-72.8270581&w=700&h=700 Aerial photo as of May 1993] from USGS The National Map via MSR Maps\n* [http://www.sugarbush.org Sugarbush Soaring]"
