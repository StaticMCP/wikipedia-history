The house was built in 1764 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1974, for its significance in agriculture, architecture, and politics.\nThe two-story frame house was built by John Wardell in 1764. According to the nomination form, it was redecorated using Greek Revival style in the early 19th century, probably by William L. Lippincott, who acquired the house after confiscation.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Monmouth County, New Jersey\nReferences"
