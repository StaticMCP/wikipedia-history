Founded by Richard Barbrook and Fabian Tompsett in 2007, the group has since reproduced Guy Debord's Le Jeu de la Guerre and proceeded to tour Europe, Asia and South America. In contrast to the electronic version of Debord's game, created by the Radical Software Group, Class Wargames is based on a real rather than digital version of the Game of War and allows for convivial interaction through which anyone can become a situationist.\nMeaningful Votes: The Brexit Simulation was a wargame designed by Richard Barbrook to help understand the dynamics of the political factions in United Kingdoms in regards to the Brexit referendum.\nPublications\n*Barbrook, Richard (2014).
