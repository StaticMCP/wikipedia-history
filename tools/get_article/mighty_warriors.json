      "text": "# Mighty Warriors\n\nMighty Warriors is an adventure board game created by Games Workshop in 1991 and set in the Warhammer Fantasy fictional universe. The core rules allowed players to explore dungeons, which were randomly generated, and fight monsters, also randomly generated. This was a simplified version of Advanced HeroQuest.\nSynopsis\nBelow the cities of humanity, underneath the deepest drains and sewers, mutant creatures rule a world of caverns and tunnels. The worst of these creatures are Skaven – Chaos ratmen whose secret tunnel systems connect with the cellars and drains of humanity's proud cities. No-one suspects the extent of the Skaven's crawling evil. They bring plague, fire and death to the prosperous cities of mankind.\nIn Mighty Warriors a band of heroes, led by a Noble Knight, Fearless Dwarf and Heroic Elf enter a castle that has been overrun by the hideous ratmen. The Heroes and Skaven must fight a battle for ultimate control of the castle.\nMighty Warriors is a game for two to four players. You can play either the forces of Chaos or a band of Heroic Adventurers as they clash in underground battles. Your task is to defeat your opponent by capturing his command room before he can capture yours!\nGame components\n16 Skaven Warriors\n4 Skaven Champions\n12 Warriors\n1 Knight\n1 Elf\n1 Dwarf\n1 Chaos Wizard\n1 Heroic shield\n1 Chaos Shield\n20 Door Stands\n28 Black slotta Bases\n4 Green Slotta Bases\n4 Dice\nCard Sheets:\nMW1  – Heroic Army List\nMW2  – Chaos Army List\nMW3  – Chaos Spell Scroll\nMW4  – Heroic Spell Scroll\nMW5  – Dungeon\nMW6  – Guard Room\nMW7  – Ancient Temple\nMW8  – Barracks\nMW9  – Wizards Study\nMW10 – Great Hall\nMW11 – Doors (7 vertical wood)\nMW12 – Doors (7 green vertical wood)\nMW13 – Doors (3 diagonal wood, 3 spiked vertical wood)\nMW14 – Library\nMW15 – Vampires Chamber\nMW16 – Treasure Room\nMW17 – Alchemists Laboratory\nMW18 – Dragon Chamber\nMW19 – Skaven Lair\nThe lid of the game box also contained a rules summary and a printed 3x3 grid forming a \"combat tray\".\nSee also\n* Dungeonquest\n* HeroQuest (board game)\n* Warhammer Fantasy (setting)\n* Warhammer Quest\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
