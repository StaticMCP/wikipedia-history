The name means the Guard in Polish and also the name of the river Warta on which Poznań is located. As of the 2025–26 season, they compete in the third division, after being relegated from the 2024–25 I liga.\nFounded in 1912, the association football club are two-time winners of the Polish Football Championship, in 1929 and 1947. In 2020, Warta returned to the Polish Ekstraklasa after being absent for 25 years. The club played four seasons in the top division until relegation in 2024. The club also played in the top level of the Polish football league system from 1927 to 1939, 1946 to 1950, and 1993 to 1995.\nIn its history, the club celebrated many successes in disciplines such as boxing (the club won the Polish championship 11 times between 1927 and 1939), field hockey (the club won the Polish championship 12 times between 1963 and 1980) and tennis (Wiesław Gąsiorek of Warta was Polish champion 12 times between 1959 and 1970). In total, Warta teams, sportsmen and sportswomen won almost 800 medals in Polish championship competitions in different sports disciplines.\nHistory\nBeginnings (1912–1918)\nhonouring the club's 100th anniversary in 2012]]\nOn 15 June 1912, the Warta Poznań Sports Club (Klub Sportowy Warta Poznań) was established, which later became known as \"the first lady of Wielkopolska\". Its founders were young Poles who previously played in the German clubs in Poznań, including Marian Bey, Stefan Malinowski, Stefan Mórkowski, brothers Edmund and Franciszek Szyc and Ludwik Zysnarski. They were included in the first board of the club, whose first president - as the oldest member of the board - became Franciszek Szyc. His brother Edmund was appointed secretary, and Marian Bey was the team captain. At the founding meeting, white and green were chosen as statutory colours. In addition to football, Warta formed an athletics section in 1912 and then a tennis section in 1914.\nDuring German rule, matches involving Polish teams were forbidden, which prompted the decision to organize the first Wielkopolska football championship in 1913, in which three teams participated: Warta Poznań, Posnania and Ostrovia Ostrów Wielkopolski. Warta became the first champion. The results were as follows: Posnania - Warta 1–1, Warta - Ostrovia 3–2, Ostrovia - Warta 3–4, Warta - Posnania 2–2.\nThe inaugural championship of the region resulted in a surge of football popularity in Poznań. New football teams emerged such as Trytonia founded in Łazarz and a team called Sparta established in Jeżyce. In 1914, despite the start of hostilities related to the outbreak of World War I, efforts were made in Poznań to organize sports events, which was made more difficult by the martial law imposed by the Germans. In general, the regulations did not allow any kind of meeting or assembly to be held without official permits. Despite these difficulties, in 1914 the second Wielkopolska Championships were held, in which only two teams participated: Warta Poznań and KS Posnania. In this two-legged tie, Warta smoothly defeated Posnania 6–3 and 2–1.\nThere is no reliable information about the 1915 Wielkopolska championship. But Warta also played various friendly matches against Polish and German teams during the war years, including Fever Kościan  (1–3 and 5–5) and DSV Posen (2–2) in 1915, and Stella Gniezno (2–2) in 1916. Particularly noteworthy was the 4–0 victory against DSV Posen in 1916 - DSV (Deutscher Sport Verein) was a German football club considered the best football club in Poznań until then. In 1917, Warta celebrated its 5th anniversary year by organising a tournament with the participation of the best football teams from Poznań.\nAlso in 1917, Franciszek Rotnicki became chairman of the club and, during his chairmanship (1917–1924), he laid the structural foundations for Warta's future successes. It was said at the time: \"... A man of great authority, energetic and enterprising. It is he, together with a skilfully selected group of associates, who builds solid foundations for the future size of the club in this difficult period.\".\nInterwar period (1918–1939)\nWorld War I hostilities caused enormous losses. Out of 100 Warta club members in 1914, 45 fought in the war, and two founding membersEdmund Szyc and Stefan Malinowskidied in the war. During the successful Greater Poland Uprising against German partitioning authorities, many footballers from Poznań volunteered for military service to fight for their country but the restoration of an independent Polish state after 123 years in 1918 also provided new opportunities, as Polish sports clubs were able to function without interference from foreign powers.\nIn 1919, pre-war sports structures were re-activated, and the first post-war Wielkopolska championship was held. Five teams entered the competition, including four teams from Poznań - Unia, Warta, Posnania, and Pogoń - as well as Ostrovia from Ostrów Wielkopolski. Warta won the championship, after beating Ostrovia 7–1, Unia 3–2, Posnania 7–0 and Pogoń 7–0. In the following year, the regional championship was abandoned because of the Polish-Soviet War.\nin August 1924, Władysław Przybysz of Warta on the right]]\nIn 1921, the first Polish national football championship was successfully held (the championship was previously started and then abandoned in 1920 because of the Polish–Soviet War). It was run similar to a cup competition, according to the \"spring-autumn\" system, until 1927. In the spring, Warta participated in the Klasa A regional district championship (Warta became champion in 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1926, in 1924-1925 no champion was crowned), with football clubs from Wielkopolska such as Warta, Pogoń and Stella Gniezno. In the autumn, the winners from five regional districts played against each other at national level. Under the club chairmanship of Stanisław Broniarz (chairman 1924 to 1927, deputy chairman 1927 to 1929), Warta was a leading proponent and founding member of the Polish football league, which was launched in 1927.\nThe interwar period was Warta's golden era and Warta was a leading football team in Poland. Between 1922 and 1928, Warta was always in the top three teams in the Polish football championship (there was no championship in 1924). Finally, with the Hungarian coach Béla Fűrst in charge, Warta won its first Polish football championship in 1929. In that season, Warta won 15 out of 24 league matches, it lost fewest goals of all teams (33) and it had - jointly with Cracovia - the best goal difference (+25).\nThe global economic crisis of 1929 negatively affected Polish sports clubs, including Warta. Despite these difficulties, throughout the 1930s, Warta was again in the top three football clubs in the top division on four occasions. In 1932, Kajetan Kryszkiewicz and Friedrich Scherfke were jointly the top goal scorers in the league, with 15 goals each. Other sports disciplines also fared well. In 1920, the Poznań municipal government handed over large sports grounds to Warta. Warta launched new sports sections, including field hockey (1923), boxing (1924), swimming (1928) and ice hockey (1930). Warta's boxing team won the Polish championship 11 times and Warta's athletics team won the Polish championship five times.\nin 1937, Wilimowski on the ball, Kajetan Kryszkiewicz and Edmund Twórz of Warta defending]]\nWarta Poznań encouraged innovations in sports in the inter-war period. In 1929, the victorious Warta match against the Dutch champions Philips Eindhoven (today's PSV Eindhoven) was the first football match broadcast on Polish radio (Warta won 5–2). In September 1933, the Warta match against Legia Poznań was the first football match in Poland to be played using artificial lighting.\nPolish teams did not yet participate in annual European football club competitions, but the Warta team travelled abroad on many occasions to play friendly games and to take part in football tournaments. Every year, various football teams from Germany, Hungary and elsewhere travelled to Poznań to play Warta. In September 1934, for example, FC Milan (today's AC Milan) travelled to Poznań to play against Warta (Warta lost 1–3).\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\nAt the start of World War II in 1939, the football season was interrupted and was never completed. The club was forced to suspend its operations. Poles were not permitted to participate in organised sports events during the German occupation, but some Warta football players clandestinely took part in an unofficial Poznań football championship in 1940 and 1941, with games played on football pitches on the outskirts of town.\nDuring the war, the German occupiers destroyed many documents and club mementos. Some former Warta sportsmen and board members were murdered in German concentration camps. For example, former Warta footballers Marian Einbacher and Adam Knioła were murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp, while former Warta club chairman Stanisław Broniarz was murdered in the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Three pre-war players, Marian Spoida, Konrad Ofierzyński and Telesfor Banaszkiewicz, were among Poles murdered by the Soviets in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.\nPostwar period (1945–1990)\nharvest festival in the Edmund Szyc stadium in 1974]]\nA formal general meeting was held on 18 March 1945 and the club's operations were revived. Already in the first post-war season of the Polish football league in 1946, Warta finished the season in second place, losing in the final against Polonia Warsaw (for two years after the war, the Polish championship was contested like a cup competition).\nA year later in 1947, Warta played outstanding football under the direction of the Hungarian coach Károly Fogl. In the semi-final of the Polish championship competition, Warta won against AKS Chorzów 4–1 and 2–0. In the final, Warta beat Wisła Kraków 2–0 away in Kraków. Interest in the final match in Poznań was enormous and the stadium attendance was higher than nominal capacity (over 20 000 spectators). The exciting match finished with Warta's victory 5–2 and Warta won its second – and so far, last – championship title in its history.\nHowever, the Stalinism era ended the series of Warta's successes, as regional Communist leadership favoured the local rival Lech Poznań. In 1949, Warta was de facto forced to change its name to Związkowiec Poznań, which resulted in the disappearance of the historical name Warta. In 1950, Warta was forced to merge with the sports club HCP, which belonged to the Hipolit Cegielski Poznań works – a leading industrial company in Poznań. The HCP team played under the name Stal and the merged club used the name. In the same year, Warta's football team was relegated from the top division. From 1951 to 1956, the club played under the name Stal Poznań.\nOn 29 December 1956, a general meeting of the club decided to return to the old name Warta. The Hipolit Cegielski Poznań works continued to sponsor the club. Their involvement did not return Warta to its former glory, but it significantly helped to develop the club's logistical base. Warta received funds to re-develop its sports facilities and was able to use the Edmund Szyc Stadium (then called 22 July Stadium\") with a capacity of 60,000.\nDuring the post-war period, the Warta football team never returned to the top flight. However, Warta celebrated successes in other sports – most notably, in field hockey and tennis. In field hockey, Warta won the Polish championship 12 times between 1963 and 1980 and they were runners-up nine times between 1957 and 1981. Warta participated in the EuroHockey Club Champions Cup (Europe's premier field hockey club competition) six times between 1969 and 1977, coming fifth in Europe in the 1969 EuroHockey Club Champions Cup.\nIn the Polish tennis league, Warta's tennis team became Polish champions in 1965 and 1970 and were runners-up in 1961, 1964, 1966, and 1969. Warta's tennis section was particularly known for the individual achievements of Wiesław Gąsiorek, who was Polish men's singles champion 12 times between 1959 and 1970. In gymnastics, artistic gymnasts Zdzisław Lesiński and Urszula Łukomska represented the club at the 1952 Summer Olympics.\nIn 1989, at the end of the Communist period, Warta and Hipolit Cegielski Poznań works parted ways. After some negotiations, the Edmund Szyc Stadium and the sports grounds were transferred to the club.\nPost-Communist period (1990–2011)\n- former Warta captain and club hero who was with Warta since its youth team]]\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, Warta returned to the top tier of the Polish football league system after 43 years.\nIn 1993, Warta was promoted to Poland’s top tier division for the first time since 1950, after winning the “Western conference” of the second tier league in the 1992-1993 season. Warta finished the 1993-1994 Ekstraklasa season in 14th position, with 8 points above the relegation zone.\nThe 1994-1995 Ekstraklasa season was historic, as it was the only season in history that featured three football clubs from Poznań in the top tier division: Warta Poznań, Lech Poznań and Olimpia Poznań. However, suffering from ailing debts, Warta finished bottom of the table and the club was relegated from the top division.\nWarta's bad run continued and the club was relegated from the second tier in 1996. The club mostly played in the third tier of the league system over the next decade.\nThe Edmund Szyc Stadium fell into disrepair by 1998. Warta subsequently played its football matches in the Warta Poznań Stadium, the former training ground of the Edmund Szyc Stadium, nicknamed Ogródek (Little Garden).\nIn the 2007–08 season, Warta returned to the second tier of the Polish football league system. The club's best result was the 7th position (out of 18 teams) in the 2010-11 season. in the 2010–11 season]]\nPyżalska era (2011-2018)\nIn January 2011, former model and new owner Izabella Łukomska-Pyżalska became chairwoman. Debts of the ailing club were repaid and the budget was increased. Warta started to play its games in the Municipal Stadium in Poznań. However, Warta remained in the second tier. After relegation in 2013 and because of club debts, Warta landed in the fourth tier of the league system where it spent the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons.\nIn 2016, Warta was promoted to II liga (the third tier of the league system).\nIn 2018, Warta was able to advance to the second tier again.\nHowever, by the autumn of 2018, the club's finances were in serious trouble. The situation was so desperate that the football team captain Bartosz Kieliba said: \"Several months of player wages are in arrears, there is no certainty whether we will ever play another game, which does not help our work in training or our stance in matches\".\nFarjaszewski era (2018–present)\nIn August 2018, businessman Bartłomiej Farjaszewski bought the football section of Warta (under the name: Warta Poznań SA) and repaid the club's debts. Following the legal separation in 2018, there are now two organisations: Warta Poznań SA focuses on all football teams, whereas KS Warta Poznań continues as a multi-sports club (which includes fencing, field hockey and swimming sections, among others).\nIn June 2019, Piotr Tworek replaced Petr Němec as football coach. In 2020, with experienced players such as Bartosz Kieliba and Łukasz Trałka, Warta surprisingly finished the 2019–20 I liga season in third place. After winning the promotion playoffs, Warta returned to the Polish Ekstraklasa after being absent for 25 years.\nduring the league match between Warta Poznań and Piast Gliwice in September 2020]]\nAt the start of the 2020–21 season, many football pundits predicted Warta's relegation. Defying expectations, with new players such as striker Mateusz Kuzimski (summer 2020 signing) and winger Makana Baku (on loan from January 2021), Warta finished fifth in the league, missing out on qualification to the UEFA Europa Conference League by just one point. This represented Warta football team's best result since winning the football championship in 1947.\nFollowing Warta's poor start to the 2021–22 season (17th place in the league with eight points in thirteen league games), Dawid Szulczek replaced Tworek as head coach in November 2021. Under Szulczek, Warta finished 11th in the league in the 2021–22 season and 8th in the 2022–23 season.\nWarta contested the 2023–24 season much in the same way as their recent top-flight campaigns, with a below-average budget and limited transfer activity. On 18 April 2024, Szulczek announced he would not extend his contract and depart Warta at the end of the season. On 25 May that year, the last matchday, Warta suffered a 0–3 defeat to Jagiellonia Białystok and were jumped in the standings by Korona Kielce following their away win over Lech Poznań. As a result, Warta finished 16th and were relegated, ending their four-year stay in the top division.\nOn 24 June 2024, Piotr Jacek was appointed as Szulczek's successor. With most of last season's roster replaced by youngsters and experienced second division players, Jacek was sacked two months into his stint and succeeded by Piotr Klepczarek. On 10 March 2025, after earning one point in the first four games of the year, Klepczarek was replaced with the experienced Ryszard Tarasiewicz. Warta's winless run continued until their successive relegation to II liga was confirmed on 11 May, following a 2–0 away defeat to Chrobry Głogów.\nAs the Warta Poznań Municipal Stadium (Ogródek) did not conform to Ekstraklasa and I liga licensing requirements, the senior Warta football team played its home games in the Stadion Dyskobolii Grodzisk Wielkopolski from 2020 to 2025. Subsequently, Ogródek underwent renovations in order to fulfil the II liga licensing requirements. After nearly six years, Warta played its first home game there on 7 September 2025, winning 1–0 against Zagłębie Sosnowiec.\nOther teams\nWarta also operates youth teams (both boys and girls) in different age groups in the Central Junior League and an amputee football team. It also briefly fielded a women's football section.\nHonours\nFootball\n* Polish Football Championship/Ekstraklasa\n**Champions: 1929, 1947\n** Runners-up: 1922, 1925, 1928, 1938, 1946\n** Third place: 1921, 1923, 1926, 1927, 1932, 1935, 1936\n*Polish Football Championship (Prussia):\n**Champions: 1913, 1914\n** Runners-up: 1919\nYouth teams\n*Polish U19 Championship\n** Runners-up: 1936, 1975\nAmputee football\n* Amp Futbol Ekstraklasa (Polish amputee football championship):\n** Third place: 2023\n* Marcin Oleksy: 2022 FIFA Puskás Award\nField hockey\n* '''Polish men's championship:\n**Champions: 1963, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1980\n** Runners-up: 1938, 1957, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981\n** Third place: 1952, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1958, 1982, 2011, 2019\n*Polish indoor men's championship:\n**Champions: 1964, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1979, 1982\n** Runners-up: 1974, 1977, 1978\n** Third place: 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1985\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" |European cup competitions\n|-\n|Year\n|Competition\n|Tier level\n|Ranking\n|Host city\n|-\n|1969\n|Club Champions Cup\n|1\n|5\n|Brussels\n|-\n|1971\n|Club Champions Cup\n|1\n|12\n|Rome\n|-\n|1973\n|Club Champions Cup\n|1\n|6\n|Frankfurt am Main\n|-\n|1974\n|Club Champions Cup\n|1\n|7\n|Utrecht\n|-\n|1976\n|Club Champions Cup\n|1\n|11\n|Amsterdam\n|-\n|1977\n|Club Champions Cup\n|1\n|8\n|London\n|-\n|1981\n|Club Champions Trophy\n|2\n|4\n|Rome\n|}\nPlayers\nCurrent squad\nOther players under contract\nNotable players\nHad international caps for their respective countries.
