It was released on Netflix on March 21, 2019.\nPremise\nAntoine Griezmann: The Making of a Legend covers the ups and downs of modern professional football, through archival footage and interviews with Antoine and his father. It's the tale of a boy who didn't seem to have the physical attributes necessary for the game, a game that has become increasingly physical and fast-paced, but proved skeptics wrong. We see the struggle to get signed at an early age as well as the hundreds of failed tryouts along the way, until getting a breakthrough at Real Sociedad.\nRelease\nThe documentary was released on March 21, 2019 on Netflix streaming but was removed in March 2023.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
