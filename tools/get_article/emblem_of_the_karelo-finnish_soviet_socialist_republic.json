It shows symbols of agriculture (pine boughs and rye) and the local terrain (a swift-flowing river from the hills). The rising Sun stands for the future of the Karelo-Finnish nation; and the red star as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of Communism and the \"world-wide socialist community of states\".\nThe slogan on the banner bears the Soviet Union state motto (\"Workers of the world, unite!\") in both the Russian and Finnish languages. In Finnish, it is \"Kaikkien maiden proletaarit, liittykää yhteen!\".\nThe name of the Karelo-Finnish SSR is shown in both Russian and Finnish.\nFrom 1956 to 1991, the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic used a variant of the Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.\nFile:Герб КФССР на ВДНХ.jpg|The Emblem of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic facade of the Main Pavilion of VDNKh\nFile:USSR 1941 707-708 1359 0.jpg|The Emblem of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic on a 1941 postage stamp\nFile:Stamp of USSR.
