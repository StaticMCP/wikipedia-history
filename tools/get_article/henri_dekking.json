In that time he did it for four consecutive months; seen at the time as a long period. At the 1928 Winter Olympics in Saint Moritz he was part of the first Dutch bobsleigh team in the four-man event (the Dutch didn't participate in 1924) together with Curt van de Sandt (captain), Hubert Menten, Edwin Louis Teixeira de Mattos and Jacques Delprat. The Dutch team finished 8th in the first run and finished 12th overall after the second run.\nReferences"
