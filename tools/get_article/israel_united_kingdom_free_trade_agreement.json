The trade agreement would be the third FTA to cover Israel–UK trade, and superseding the Israel–UK Trade Continuity Agreement, extending the deal to cover services and digital trade. Trade value between Israel and the United Kingdom was worth £6,881 million in 2022.\nOn 20 May 2025, the United Kingdom suspended free trade negotiations due to the Israeli military expansion in Gaza; Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the suspension in the House of Commons where he stated said events in Gaza were damaging Britain’s relationship with Israel.\nHistory\nFrom 1 June 2000 until 30 December 2020, trade between Israel and the UK was governed by the Israel–European Union Association Agreement, while the United Kingdom was a member of the European Union. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK and Israel signed a continuity trade agreement on 18 February 2019, based on the EU free trade agreement; the agreement entered into force on 1 January 2021.\nNegotiations\nIsrael and the United Kingdom formally launched negotiations for the new free trade agreement on 20 July 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ IUKFTA Round of Negotiations\n|-\n!

The trading relationship between the UK and Israel was valued at £6.4 billion, as of September 2023. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak rejected the notion that the threatened invasion of Rafah would affect negotiations on the UK–Israel Free Trade Agreement.\nOn 20 May 2025, the UK suspended FTA negotiations with Israel. In spite of this, the UK continued to send trade representatives for meetings with Israel, and the trade volume between Israel and the UK increased 3.7%.\nSee also\n*Israel–United Kingdom relations\n*Free trade agreements of Israel\n*Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\n*Foreign relations of Israel\n*Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n*United Kingdom and the Gaza war\nReferences\nExternal links"
