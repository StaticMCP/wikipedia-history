It carries Interstate 80 (I-80) and Interstate 94 (I-94) from the Illinois–Indiana border at the Borman Expressway west to Illinois Route 394 (IL&nbsp;394), I-294 (the Tri-State Tollway), and the southern end of the Bishop Ford Freeway (where I-94 turns north to downtown Chicago). It also carries U.S. Route 6 (US&nbsp;6) west from the Indiana state line to the US&nbsp;6 exit with IL&nbsp;83 (Torrence Avenue).\nRoute description\n.]]\nThe Kingery Expressway begins at an interchange with the Tri-State Tollway to the west, the Bishop Ford Freeway to the north, and IL&nbsp;394 to the south. From here, the expressway heads east through Lansing. The highway then reaches its only exit, a junction with IL&nbsp;83 and US&nbsp;6; east of here, US&nbsp;6  runs concurrently with the expressway. Past the exit, the highway continues east; it briefly curves east-southeast before crossing into Indiana and becoming the Borman Expressway.\nHistory\nThe Tri-State Expressway opened to traffic on November 1, 1950. The highway was renamed the Kingery Expressway in 1953, two years after the death of Robert Kingery. He was a former director of the Illinois Public Works, a regional director for the Chicago Regional Planning Association, as well as a proponent of the current northeastern Illinois tollway configuration until his death in 1951. The expressway was rebuilt in 2005–2007 to add traffic lanes and better accommodate the large amount of truck traffic that travels between Chicago and all points east and southeast. Construction was completed in July 2007. Among the improvements is the separation of traffic heading to the Bishop Ford Freeway and Torrence Avenue, with the westbound split for the Bishop Ford east of Torrence near Burnham Avenue, and an eastbound collector-distributor lane allowing a right hand exit from either I-80 or I-94 eastbound to Torrence without having to cross expressway through lanes. The Southland Interchange with the Bishop Ford Freeway, IL&nbsp;394, and the Tri-State Tollway was also rebuilt and reconfigured.\nExit list\n}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of I-294\n}}\n|notes=Western end of US 6 concurrency\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of I-94 (Bishop Ford Freeway); northern terminus of IL 394\n}}\n|notes=Continuation into Indiana as the Borman Expressway\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100102135843/http://gcmtravel.com/gcm/home.jsp Illinois Department of Transportation Gary–Chicago–Milwaukee Corridor]"
