      "text": "# Kings County Colored Mens Association\n\nThe Kings County Colored Mens Association of Brooklyn, New York, in the United States, was a Reconstruction-era political advocacy group. The group, seemingly led by Rev. A. N. Freeman, held regular meetings and debates, elected convention delegates, and endorsed candidates, namely Ulysses S. Grant for president. In 1866 the group met to discuss the progress of civil rights legislation and the conversation turned to the allegiances of President Andrew Johnson.\nThe group may have been a \"9th Ward appendage\" of the Republican Party, and seems to have been disbanded by the 1880s.\nReferences"
