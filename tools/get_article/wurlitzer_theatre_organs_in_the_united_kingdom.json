A very small, six-rank instrument, it was installed at the Picture House, Walsall, Staffordshire, where it opened on 26 January 1925. After a period in private ownership in Sedgley, also in Staffordshire, during the mid-1950s, it is now installed and operational in the Congregational Church in Beer, Devon.\nThe second Wurlitzer theatre organ to be opened in Great Britain was at the Palace Cinema in Tottenham, North London. This instrument was inaugurated on 6 April 1925. Like the Beer Wurlitzer it was a 2-manual, 6-rank instrument. This organ is now located at Rye College in East Sussex.\nThe Trocadero Elephant and Castle Wurlitzer was the largest organ ever shipped to the UK, installed in 1930 for the grand opening of the 3,400-seater cinema.\nThe Blackpool Opera House organ of 1939, designed by Horace Finch, was the last new Wurlitzer to be installed in the UK. The Granada, Kingston also received a Wurlitzer in or around 1939, but most of this came from an earlier installation in Edinburgh. This was the last Wurlitzer installation to be opened, with Reginald Dixon at the console.\nWurlitzers made regular radio broadcasts via the BBC, becoming stars themselves beside their organists. The more famous of these organs were at the Empire Cinema, London, and the Tower Ballroom, Blackpool, the latterly most regularly played by Reginald Dixon creating what became known as the \"Blackpool sound\". In the late 1960s the BBC acquired a Wurlitzer from the Empress Ballroom Blackpool, which was installed as the new BBC Theatre Organ at the BBC Playhouse studios in Manchester until the studios closed in 1986. It was introduced on 12 November 1970 as a gala performance edition of The Organist Entertains by Robin Richmond, with performances by Ernest Broadbent, Reginald Dixon and Reginald Porter Brown.\nMany Wurlitzer organs have survived and are installed in private homes, town halls, concert halls and ballrooms throughout the country. The Cinema Organ Society has an extensive list of British cinema organs.\nList of Wurlitzers in the United Kingdom\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Wurlitzer Organs in the United Kingdom\n!

Shipped via Southampton Docks, opened end of January 1925 by Jack Courtnay. In run-up to World War 2, Wilfred Gregory became resident organist. Sold to Allan Hickling post-war; he installed it in Dormston House in Sedgley, Staffordshire. Deciding he wanted something bigger, he sold it to Arthur Thorn of Beer, Devon, who installed it in the local Congregational Church. The percussions and \"toy counter\" division were removed and re-cycled when the organ was installed in the church, since it was not considered necessary for church purposes. Since 2008 money has been raised to replace the missing percussion items and novelty effects and take the Beer Wurlitzer back to its former glory. The Beer Wurlitzer is in regular use for concerts and shows throughout the year.\n|-\n|Style 260\n|1926\n|Plaza Lower Regent Street (Plaza Piccadilly Circus)\n|\n|Operational\n|Dreamfactory, Degersheim, Switzerland\n|Second Wurlitzer imported to the UK but fourth to be playing.\n|-\n| Style D\n| 1925\n| Palace Cinema in Tottenham, North London\n|\n| Operational\n| Rye College, Rye, East Sussex\n| Second Wurlitzer installed in the UK.

Restoration and installation of the Wurlitzer in the Troxy began in January 2011 and took over four years to complete.\n|-\n| Special\n| 1937\n| Gaumont State Cinema, Kilburn, London\n|\n| Operational\n| Still in situ\n| Largest functioning Wurlitzer in a British cinema, though the building is now an evangelical church\n|-\n| Granada 2\n| 1937\n| Granada Theatre, Greenford\n|\n| Operational\n| Scarborough Fair Collection\n| Used both for tea dances and regular concerts.

Wurlitizer presented Dixon with a gold watch after the first performance, and its regular performances on the BBC became known as the \"Blackpool sound\".
