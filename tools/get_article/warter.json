It is situated approximately  east of Pocklington on the B1246 road and  from the city of York.\nAccording to the 2011 UK census, Warter parish had a population of 144, a reduction on the 2001 UK census figure of 159.\nThe name Warter probably derives from the Old English weargtrēow meaning 'the tree of the felon'. Alternatively, it may derive from wearrtrēow meaning 'callused tree'.\nIt is the location for Warter Priory, which was an Augustinian Priory dedicated to St James founded in 1132 by Geoffrey Fitz-Pain. The chronicler Stephen Eyton was a canon there. It was dissolved in 1536 by the dissolution under King Henry VIII. The site of this priory is now a scheduled monument to the north of St James' Church.\nThe dimensions of St James' Church, cloister, other buildings and the shape of their roofs were recorded along with details of the vestments and church plate. The church was 40 by 12 yards with a quire of 28 by 9 yards; the cloister 96 yards in circuit and 4 yards in breadth. The parish church of St James was designated a Grade II listed building in January 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.\nA coppice near the village was the inspiration for the landscape painting Bigger Trees Near Warter by David Hockney.\nEducation\nWarter has a primary school located on Addlekeld, the main street through Warter. The school is called Warter Church of England Primary School and most of its pupils transfer after Year 6 to Woldgate College in Pocklington.\nTransport\nWarter is served by buses operated by East Yorkshire Motor Services.\nGallery\nFile:St James Church Warter (Nigel Coates).jpg|St James Church\nFile:Cottages at Warter - geograph.org.uk - 10349.jpg|Cottages at Warter\nFile:The War Memorial, Warter, East Yorks. - geograph.org.uk - 728869.jpg|Warter War Memorial\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
