To take advantage of this, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch developed a strategy which became known as the Grand Offensive, in which attacks were made on the German lines over as wide a front as possible. Belgian, British and French forces around the Ypres Salient were to form the northern pincer of an offensive towards the Belgian city of Liège. The British Second Army had followed up some minor withdrawals and had fought the action at Outtersteene Ridge on 18 August, after which there was a lull. Allied troops in the area were well rested by late September.\nBattle\nThe  (GAF, Flanders Army Group, King of the Belgians) attacked at  on 28 September, after a three hour artillery preparation. The GAF attacked with  divisions,  divisions of the Second Army and  divisions of the Sixth Army. The British attacked on a  front up to the Ypres–Zonnebeke road, from where the Belgian army attacked on a line north to Dixmude. The Allied attacks quickly penetrated the German defences and advanced up to . Much of the ground west of Passchendaele, abandoned during the withdrawal of early 1918, was recaptured. Rain began to fall but by the evening the British had taken Kortewilde, Zandvoorde, Kruiseecke and Becelaere; Belgian troops had captured Zonnebeke, Poelcappelle, Schaap Baillie and Houthulst Forest. On the southern flank, minor operations by three British divisions advanced to St. Yves, Messines and the ridge from Wytschaete to Hollebeke. The German front line ran from Diksmuide to Houthult, Becelare, Zandvoorde and Hollebeke.\nMessines, Terhand and Dadizeele fell on 29 September and by the next day, despite the captured ground becoming another slough of mud, all of the high ground around Ypres was occupied by the Allies. By 1 October, the left bank of the leie (Lys) had been captured up to Comines and the Belgians were east of a line from Moorslede to Staden and Diksmuide. The advance continued until 2 October when German reinforcements arrived and the offensive outran its supplies. Due to the state of the ground,  were delivered by parachute from  and British aircraft.\nAftermath\nCasualties\nThe British suffered  the Belgians \"nett\" casualties from among  and  ill or wounded. The Allies advanced up to , with an average advance of  and captured  prisoners,  and\nSubsequent operations\nThe offensive was continued with the Battle of Courtrai (14–19 October).\nOrder of battle\nThe Allied units of Army Group Flanders (King Albert I of Belgium), had the French General Jean Degoutte as Chief of Staff.\n* British Second Army (General Herbert Plumer)\n** XV Corps (Lieutenant General Beauvoir De Lisle)\n*** 31st Division\n** X Corps (Lieutenant General Reginald Stephens)\n*** 30th Division\n*** 34th Division\n** XIX Corps (Lieutenant General Herbert Watts)\n*** 14th (Light) Division\n*** 35th Division\n*** 41st Division - in reserve\n** II Corps (Lieutenant General Claud Jacob)\n*** 9th (Scottish) Division\n*** 29th Division\n*** 36th (Ulster) Division - in reserve\n* Belgian Army (King Albert)\n** South Group (Lieutenant General Aloïs Biebuyck)\n*** 11th Division\n*** 8th Division\n*** 12th Division\n*** 6th Division\n** Centre Group (Lieutenant General Jules Jacques de Dixmude)\n*** 9th Division\n*** 3rd Division\n*** French  - in the rear\n** North Group (Lieutenant General Louis Bernheim)\n*** 7th Division\n*** 1st Division\n*** 10th Division\n** The remaining Belgian infantry divisions protected the inundated Yser Front from Clercken to the sea\n*** 4th Division\n*** 2nd Division\n*** 5th Division\n** Belgian Cavalry Division\n* French Sixth Army (Antoine Baucheron de Boissoudy) - as reserves\n**  (Gen ) - under Belgian Command\n*** 41st Division\n***\n***  - attached to the Belgian Army\n**  (Gen Alphonse Nudant) - still under the control of Foch\n***\n***\n***\n**  (Gen ) - bivouacked in the area of Proven-Houtkerque-Herzeele\n***\n***\n***\nGerman 4th Army\nArmy Group Rupprecht of Bavaria (Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria), commanding the northern German army group, held Flanders with the 4th Army, which had less than five divisions in the area.\n* 4th Army ( Friedrich Sixt von Armin)\n** Naval Corps (Admiral Ludwig von Schröder)\n** Guard Corps ( Alfred von Böckmann)\n** X Reserve Corps ( Arthur von Gabain)\nSee also\n* First Battle of Ypres, 1914\n* Second Battle of Ypres, 1915\n* Battle of Passchendaele, also known as the Third Battle of Ypres, 1917\n* Battle of the Lys, also known as the Fourth Battle of Ypres, 1918\nFootnotes\nReferences==\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|author= |series=Les armées françaises dans la Grande guerre |title=La campagne offensive de 1918 et la marche au Rhin (18 juillet 1918 – 28 juin 1919), Premier volume. 18 juillet 1918 – 25 septembre 1918. |trans-title=The Offensive Campaign of 1918 and the Advance to the Rhine (18 July 1918 – 28 June 1919): 18 July 1918 – 25 September 1918 Part VII |volume=I |url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/rechercher.do?index=TOUS3&numNotice=41052951&typeNotice=E |year=1928a |orig-year=1923 |publisher=Imprimerie Nationale |location=Paris |edition=online |via=BnF Catalogue Général |oclc=772837636}}\n*\n|author= |series=Les armées françaises dans la Grande guerre |title=La campagne offensive de 1918 et la marche au Rhin (18 juillet 1918 – 28 juin 1919), Deuxième volume: 26 septembre 1918 – 28 juin 1919. |trans-title=The Offensive Campaign of 1918 and the Advance to the Rhine (18 July 1918 – 28 June 1919): 26 September 1918 – 28 June 1919 Part VII |volume=II |url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/rechercher.do?index=TOUS3&numNotice=41052951&typeNotice=E |year=1928b |orig-year=1923 |publisher=Imprimerie Nationale |location=Paris |edition=online |via=BnF Catalogue Général |oclc=772837639}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~dccfarr/summary.htm Ypres and the Great War, Summary of Events]\n* [http://www.1914-1918.net/bat31.htm The final advance in Flanders]\n* [http://www.cwgc.org/victory1918/content.asp?menuid=38&submenuid=53&id=53&menuname=Ypres&menu=sub The Battle of Ypres, 28 September – 2 October 1918]"
