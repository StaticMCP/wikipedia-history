It peaked at number 3 on the Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart, making it Williams' first Top 5 album since 1969's Live at Cobo Hall. Four of the ten tracks were released as singles, the first single being \"I Fought the Law\". \"I Fought the Law\" was originally a hit for the rock & roll group The Bobby Fuller Four in the early 1960s and the song was a moderate success for Williams, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The follow-up singles, \"Old Flame, New Fire\" and \"To Love Somebody\" had little success, only peaking at number 54 and number 49 respectively. The final single, the album's title track, \"Family Tradition\", would become one of Williams' most popular and recognized songs.

Williams' performance received rave reviews by critics and he received his first Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.
