He claimed it took 10,000 hours to complete and that he devoted an entire summer just to completing construction of the passenger seats. CNET declared the model \"the coolest paper airplane ever\"  while WIRED named Iaconi-Stewart \"the world's best paper plane maker\". According to Iaconi-Stewart, he dropped out of college at Vassar in order to devote more time to constructing the model. In an interview with The Independent, Iaconi-Stewart said his work had been inspired by an effort to \"push the limits of what could be done\" with manila folders.\nAs of 2014, Iaconi-Stewart is employed doing odd jobs in the San Francisco area.\nSee also\n*Model aircraft\n*Paper plane\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Busch, Simon. \"[http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/03/travel/manila-airplane/ Possibly the world's most impressive paper plane]\", CNN, February 3, 2014.
