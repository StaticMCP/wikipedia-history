Located at the intersection of President Street and Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays.\nHistory\nThe Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920, and the President Street station opened along with it.\nDuring the 1950s the platform was lengthened at its southern end to be able to accommodate 10-car trains which are 514 feet (157 m) long.\nPresident Street, along with the Franklin Avenue station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, are the two closest stations to the City University of New York's Medgar Evers College. In 2019, a bill to add the college's name to both stations' names was passed in the New York state legislature and signed into law. The name of the President Street station was officially changed to President Street–Medgar Evers College on October 1, 2020, both to reflect the station's proximity to the college and to honor the college's namesake, civil rights figure Medgar Evers.\nAs part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\nStation layout\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|Ground\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=600|Exit/entrance\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control, station agent\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=4 valign=top|Platform level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| Northbound\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|←  toward  ()←  toward  or  (Franklin Avenue–Medgar Evers College)\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| Southbound\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|  toward  () →\n|}\nThis deep underground station is the northernmost on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line and the only one that has one island platform and two tracks. All stations to the south are set up as two track and two side platforms. To the north, the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line curves west and joins the local tracks of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, where there are crossovers to the express tracks in an interlocking called Rogers Junction. The Nostrand Avenue station on that line is just two blocks north. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is between Sterling Street to the south and Franklin Avenue to the north.\nFixed platform barriers, which are intended to prevent commuters falling to the tracks, are positioned near the platform edges. This station's platform has wide I-beam columns painted in blue on both sides at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate with white lettering. The track walls have their original Dual Contracts trim line with \"P\" tablets on it at regular intervals for \"President.\" Towards the south end of the station, where the platform was extended in the 1950s to accommodate the current standard IRT train length of 510 feet (160 m), the walls have \"PRESIDENT ST\" in white sans serif font on a blue border.\nExits\nThe station's only entrance/exit is near the north end of the platform. A single double-flight staircase and up-only escalator go up three stories to a small waiting area, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the system. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two street stairs going up to both northern corners of President Street and Nostrand Avenue.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
