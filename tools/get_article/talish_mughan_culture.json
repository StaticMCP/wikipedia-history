A basket-shaped “censer” and dishes in the shape of teapots were distinguished.\nGrave inventories reflect a decomposition process of ancestral relations and property differentiation among tribes of the given culture.\nReferences\nLiterature\n* Пассек Т. и Латынин Б., Очерк до-истории Северного Азербайджана, \"Известия Общества обследования и изучения Азербайджана\", Баку, 1926, No 3;\n* Morgan J., Mission scientifique en Perse, t. 1, P., 1894."
