For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n25 & 26 Geo. 5\nContinuing the fourth session of the 36th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 20 November 1934 until 25 October 1935.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 25 & 26 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\nby increasing to nineteen the number of puisne judges who may be appointed to be attached to the King's Bench Division of the High Court, by making provision for the appointment and precedence of a Vice-President of the Court of Appeal, by permitting certain orders of court in matrimonial proceedings to be made before decree absolute, and by providing for the hearing in camera of certain evidence in nullity proceedings; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as amended by the Educational Endowments (Scotland) Act, 1931, may be exercised, and to empower the Scottish Education Department to disapprove schemes submitted to them under the said Acts and to frame amended schemes, and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  to persons who but for the operation of subsection (2) of section fifty-nine of that Act would at any time since the sixth day of January nineteen hundred and thirty-five have been entitled to transitional payments, shall not be less than the transitional payments that would have been payable to them but for the operation of the said subsection; to postpone the second appointed day for the purposes of the said Act; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and the provisions of section thirteen of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act, 1933.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and other enactments relating to the Post Office.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  may be exercised.|note4= }}\n-\n|  so far as it relates to persons wandering abroad and lodging in barns or other places.}}\n|\n|  having been postponed from the first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-five; and to authorise the borrowing by public assistance authorities of sums required for the purpose of meeting expenditure incurred by them for the year ended on the thirty-first day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty-five, in excess of their estimates for that year.|note4= }}\n|  and for the modification or revocation of the rules made under section six of that Act; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|\n|  to Scotland; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  shall apply to persons otherwise qualified under that section who, at any time during the period of four months ending with the third day of September nineteen hundred and thirty-five, were continuing to receive whole-time education.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for the purpose of sewers or water supply requires to be repaid, and of the period for which the Public Works Loan Commissioners may lend money to local authorities for the said purposes.|note4= }}\n|  and to make further provision as to the rate of such subsidy payable under the said Act as so amended.|note4= }}\n|  in relation to certain Ministers who have not the charge of any public department.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |public|42|02-08-1935|repealed=y|An Act to make further provision for the government of India.|note4= }}\n|  and for purposes incidental thereto.}}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nand 1933 relating to Edinburgh Corporation (Tramways &c.).|note4=|po1=Edinburgh Corporation (Tramways, &c.)
