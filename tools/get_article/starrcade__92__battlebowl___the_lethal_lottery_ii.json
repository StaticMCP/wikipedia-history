It was broadcast December 28, 1992, from The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe show's focus was the second-ever \"Lethal Lottery\" / \"Battle Bowl\" tournament, where randomly paired tag teams competed for a spot in the Battle Bowl battle royal at the end of the night. Unlike the previous Starrcade, it was only a 16-man tournament with 8 finalists in a single ring battle royal. It also saw Ron Simmons defend the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams; the team of Shane Douglas and Ricky Steamboat putting the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the line against the team of Brian Pillman and Barry Windham; and Masahiro Chono defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against The Great Muta. In addition, Sting faced off against Big Van Vader in the finals of the \"King of Cable\" tournament.\nIt was the last WCW Pay-Per-View for announcer Jim Ross, who left for the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) shortly thereafter.\nThis was also the last Starrcade featuring championships from the National Wrestling Alliance, WCW would leave the NWA for good in September, 1993.\nIn 2001, WCW, including all rights to their television and pay-per-view shows, was bought by WWE. In 2014, all WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.\nStorylines\nThe event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. The first match of the \"Lethal Lottery\" was drawn at random as part of the Clash of the Champions XXI show on November 18, 1992, which paired up Johnny B. Badd and Cactus Jack to face the team of Van Hammer and Danny Spivey, who won as part of the Starrcade show. Sting won the first BattleBowl at the 1991 Starrcade and thus was guaranteed to be one of the 16 wrestlers in the tournament.\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentator\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Jesse Ventura\n|-\n|Interviewer\n|Tony Schiavone\n|-\n|Battlebowl Commissioner\n|Larry Zbyszko\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Gary Michael Cappetta\n|}\nRon Simmons was originally scheduled to defend the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Rick Rude, but Rude was injured in the weeks prior to the show and had to be replaced by \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams instead. The \"King of Cable\" tournament was an eight-man tournament conducted to celebrate the 20th anniversary of wrestling airing on TBS Superstation.\nReception\nJ.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 5.0 [Not So Good], stating, \"Bill Watts got fired almost immediately following this show, and Verne Gagne's coffee boy Eric Bischoff would take over and surprisingly not get fired himself after a dismal 1993. I appreciate that Watts tried to bring back realism and sportsmanship to WCW, but he booked to his tastes and not the audience when it came to who to push, and that came back to bite him. The show, like a lot of early 1990s WCW shows, had a hebetudinous pace and deathly atmosphere. The two matches worth seeing are on the Essential Starrcade, so no need to pick this one up.\nThumbs down.\"\nAftermath\nRon Simmons would lose the WCW World Heavyweight Championship two days later back to Big Van Vader in Baltimore, MD, on the same site Simmons had defeated Vader on August 2.\nRick Rude appeared at the event distraught over being unable to challenge for the WCW World title and even more upset over WCW’s decision to strip him of the WCW United States Championship if he failed to defend by January 23, 1993. A tournament that was to begin the following month to determine a number one contender would eventually become a tournament final to determine a new champion, won by Dustin Rhodes. When Rude returned he would feud with Rhodes over the title. Rude’s next shot at a World title came at Fall Brawl '93: War Games, where he defeated Ric Flair to win the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship.\nResults\n|note1 = dark\n|match1 = Brad Armstrong defeated Shanghai Pierce\n|stip1 = Singles match\n|time1 = 07:30\n|match2 = Van Hammer and Danny Spivey defeated Johnny B.
