Redfield Lifetime Achievement Award\n\nThe Lifetime Achievement Award was first presented in 1994 to honor major long-term achievements in the fields of limnology and oceanography, including research, education and service to the community and society. In 2004, the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography board renamed the award in honor of Alfred C. Redfield.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
