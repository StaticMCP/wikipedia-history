In 1856, he married Julia Agnes Jolliffe, daughter of William Joliffe and Eleanor (née Paget) Jolliffe, and they had at least one son: Howard Henry Howard-Vyse (1858–1927).\nHoward-Vyse was elected Conservative MP for South Northamptonshire at a by-election in 1846—caused by the resignation of William Ralph Cartwright—and held the seat until 1857 when he was defeated. He later returned to Parliament for Windsor at a by-election in 1863—caused by the death of George William Hope—but lost the seat at the next general election in 1865.\nHoward-Vyse was also a Justice of the Peace and a colonel in the Royal Horse Guards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
