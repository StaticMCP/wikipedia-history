The battle was fought between the Northumbrian army of King Edwin of Northumbria and an anti-Northumbrian alliance between King Cadwallon of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia. The battle ended the Northumbrian domination of Gwynedd, and preceded a Welsh campaign into Northumbria, which led to Edwin's death at the Battle of Hatfield Chase.\nReferences"
