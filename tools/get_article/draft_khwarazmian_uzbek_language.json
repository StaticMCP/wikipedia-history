It’s primarily spoken by ethnic Uzbeks in the Khorezm region of Uzbekistan. This language shares close relationships to neighboring Turkmen and also Azerbaijani language.\nRegarding the distinct qualities of Khorezm Uzbek, some separatist-like views exist. And it is understandable considering how different it sounds from standard Uzbek. Because of it, speakers of Standard Uzbek typically find it hard to understand Khwarazm Uzbek. Instead, Khwarazm Uzbek shares more similarities with other Oghuz Turkic languages.\nHistory\nThe Khwarazmian Uzbek language have it’s roots from the migrations of the Oghuz Turks into the area between the 9th and 11th centuries. The ancient land of Khwarazm, which might also spelled as Chorasmia, was originally home to speakers of Eastern Iranian languages, particularly Khwarezmian. However, this region experienced a significant Turkification during Oghuz kingdoms.\nUnder various empires, including the Khwarazmian Empire, Timurids, and Khanate of Khiva, the region became a stronghold of Turkic-speaking populations. Over time, the local dialect developed into a unique Oghuz variety, which today survives as Khwarazmian Uzbek.\nGeographic Distribution\nKhwarazmian Uzbek is primarily spoken in a few key areas:\n* The Khorezm Region, which includes cities like Khiva, Urgench, and Hazarasp\n* Some parts of Karakalpakstan and Bukhara\n* Certain regions in northern Turkmenistan.\nEstimates suggest that up to 2 million people may speak this dialect, though precise figures are difficult due to its classification under the general category of “Uzbek” in national censuses.\nLinguistic Classification\nKhwarazmian Uzbek has a lot in common with other Oghuz Turkic languages, especially when it comes to grammar and sound patterns. It features vowel harmony, the voicing of stops, and unique Oghuz verb endings and particles. However, it stands apart from Standard Uzbek in terms of vocabulary, sound structure, and morphosyntax, which means that understanding each other can be quite challenging.\nReferences"
