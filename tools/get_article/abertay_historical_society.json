It aims to promote interest in history, with a special focus on the history of Perthshire, Angus and Fife. The AHS runs a regular programme of public lectures on historical topics and also organises special events. The Society also publishes books, usually producing at least one publication per year.\nHistory\nThe Society was founded at a meeting held at University College, Dundee on 29 May 1947. The founders were the Principal of University College, Major-General Douglas Wimberley, and the college's history lecturer, Dr Frederick T Wainwright. It has been suggested that the Society was promoted as part of a process of developing 'town and gown links' in Dundee by Wimberley. The AHS was set up with the goal of encouraging the study of local history in the Abertay area (Perthshire, Angus and northern Fife). The Society pursued this aim by organising regular talks and lectures as well as other events such as excursions.\nThe Society formerly had an Archaeological Section which organised excavations in the local area and its own series of meetings. However, in 1993 the activities of this section came under the control of the Society's Council. For a time in the 1970s the AHS also had an Industrial Archaeology Section, which mainly sought to record the region's industrial heritage. In 2015 the archaeological activities of the Society were taken over by a newly established fieldwork division, which has undertaken projects including the recording of stones that survive from the demolished Dundee Royal Arch.\nSince 1953 the Society has published books on local history, the first of which was Dundee and the American Civil War by David Carrie. A number of notable historians and authors have written volumes published by the Society including Bruce Lenman, Andrew Murray Scott and Christopher Whatley. The 51st AHS publication Ten Taysiders: Forgotten Figures from Dundee, Angus and Perthshire was published in 2011 and was edited by members of the Society's Council. In 2011 the AHS began to make copies of out-of-print titles available for free download from their website. The Society's publications are regularly cited in academic literature.\nAs well as running events, the AHS has undertaken various heritage activities. The Society has lobbied for the preservation of local buildings and historic sites, and played a key role in the creation of Dundee Civic Trust and Dundee Heritage Trust. The Abertay Historical Society was also a benefactor of The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum Fundraising Appeal which allowed the restoration and refurbishment of Dundee's main museum and galleries between 2006 and 2009.\nA number of notable individuals have been associated with the Abertay Historical Society. These include Sir Francis Mudie who was President of the Society from 1963 to 1965 and also contributed to its publications. Another key figure in the society's history was  S. G. Edgar Lythe, a founder member who went on to be Vice Principal of the University of Strathclyde. Lythe, who edited and wrote several of the Society's publications, was credited with moving the AHS away from simply organising events and towards actively encouraging research into local history. The Dundee bibliophile and antiquarian Catherine Kinnear was a founder member of the Society and later went on to be its president.\nActivities\nThe AHS has been described as \"one of Scotland's most successful local history organisations\". It organises a regular programme of evening lectures, which are usually held in Discovery Point, Dundee, although other venues are also used from time to time. These lectures cover a wide range of topics relating to the local area. The Society also works with other Dundee-based groups to run the Dundee Afternoon Lectures series. The AHS is a registered charity.\nSome events are held jointly with other local groups. For example, in 2010 the AHS joined with the Perth Strathspey and Reel Society to have an event at the A. K. Bell Library, Perth entitled \"The Fiddle Music of Perth\" as part of the Perth 800 celebrations. In 2011 the AHS contributed to the Dundee Science Festival by organising a public lecture on the design and construction of the Bell Rock Lighthouse.\nThe Society is a partner in Great War Dundee, a project commemorating the First World War, and its impact on Dundee set up to mark the centenary of the conflict.\nOffice bearers\nThe Society is run by a council whose membership includes the President, General Secretary, other office bearers and various ordinary members. In addition the Lord Provost of Dundee, the Provost of Perth and Kinross, the Provost of Angus, the Principal of the University of Dundee and the Principal of the University of St Andrews all serve as Honorary Presidents of the Society.\nRelationship with the University of Dundee\nAs noted above the Abertay Historical Society was founded at what was then University College, Dundee by my members of that institution's staff. Since that time the AHS has maintained close links with the institution, which has since 1967 been known as the University of Dundee. The Principal of the University of Dundee is one five Honorary Presidents of the Society, and many of the Society's members and office-holders, including past presidents, have been University staff and students. Equally many of its publications have been authored by figures connected with the university and the AHS' lecture programme has offers University staff and students the chance to present their research to the local community.\nAn annual prize is awarded by the AHS to the undergraduate at the University of Dundee who produces the dissertation which makes the most significant contribution to local history. Some of these dissertations have been expanded and published by the AHS. For example, the AHS publication No. 44 Scottish Cowboys and the Dundee Investors by Claire E. Swan evolved from a dissertation which won the Abertay History Prize in 2003.  Julie Danskin, author of the Society's 54th publication is also a past winner of the Abertay History Prize.\nThe archives of the AHS are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee.\nCurrently most of the Society's lectures are held at the university, usually in the Dalhousie Building.\nPublications\nThe first publication by the society was Dundee and the American Civil War which was published in 1953 and was written by one of the Society's members, David Carrie. An editorial note in the publication announced that it was hoped, if finances allowed, that it would to 'be followed by others of similar\ncharacter, produced to a uniform size to simplify binding into convenient volumes'.  It was also stated that while its publications would 'always have a strong local flavour the Society aims to\navoid undue parochialism and seeks to set its studies against the wide backcloth of general historical development'.  As of December 2015 the Society has published a further 55 books relating to the history of Tayside and Fife. Members of the Society are sent a free copy of each new publication, while other copies are made available for sale either from the Society or via booksellers. The publications have covered a wide number of topics and have varied in style. While most are monographs some titles have been collections of essays written by various authors. An example of the latter is the 2011 publication Ten Taysiders which featured biographical essays on ten historic figures from Dundee, Pethshire and Angus, such as Mary Ann Baxter, A.K. Bell and William Sharpey and which was written by various authors including Steve Connelly, Fiona Scharlau, Charles Waterston, Graham Lowe, John MacEwen, John Kerr, William Kenefick and Kenneth Baxter.\nThe following books have been published by the AHS:\n* No 1.
