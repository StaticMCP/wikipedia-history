In the , Carrara had a population of 13,138 people.\nGeography\nCarrara is bounded to the east by the southern bank of the Nerang River and to the west mostly by the Pacific Motorway.\nCarrara is built on the Guragunbah Plain () which was officially named in 2000, having previously been unofficially known as the Merrimac-Carrara Flood Plain.\nIt is the home of Carrara Stadium (also known as People First Stadium for sponsorship reasons), the purpose-built cricket and Australian rules football ground where the Gold Coast Suns began playing matches in 2011.\nHistory\nThe name Carrara comes from the Aboriginal word Karara meaning long flat.\nCarrara was first used by the Manchester Cotton Company as a cotton plantation that began in the early 1860s.\nCarrara Provisional School opened in February 1902 on premises lent by farmer Francis Parr until a permanent building could be constructed on land donated by farmer William Lees. Tenders were called for the building in October 1902 with the tender being awarded in February 1903 to carpenters John Lather & Sons of Southport. On 1 January 1909 it became Carrara State School. It closed circa 1925. In 1929, the school building was relocated to Guanaba. In 1932, due to the growing population in the area, there was unsuccessful local lobbying to re-open the school by constructing a new building to operate as a provisional school on the existing site. The approximate location of the school was near the intersection of Nerang Broadbeach Road and Carrara Road () near to the ferry which crossed the Nerang River.\nIn 1958, Keith Williams established the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens on the south bank of the Nerang River in Carrara. It quickly became a popular tourist attraction featuring shows of water skiing and speed boat driving. It also hosted Australian Water Ski championships. In 1971 the attraction relocated to a larger site on the Southport Spit as renamed Ski Land, and then was renamed Sea World in 1972 with the addition of dolphin shows and other attractions.
