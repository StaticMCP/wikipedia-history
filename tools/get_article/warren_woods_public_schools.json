Currently it is the site of the district's middle school. Robert Tower High School was dedicated in 1973. The schools combined in the fall of 1983 at the Tower High School site, forming Warren Woods Tower High School.\nIn 2005 the school district began a three-year program intended to update and renovate its school buildings. In 2017 The district proposed a $20 Million bond issue. The money was to be allocated to infrastructure and technology improvements. It would also be used to replace some buses.
