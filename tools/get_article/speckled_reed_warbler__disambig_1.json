The species was first described by Robert Swinhoe in 1863.\nIt is found in China and the Philippines. Its natural habitats are swamps and arable land. It is threatened by habitat loss, particularly wetland loss in its wintering area of Candaba Swamp.\nDescription\nEBird describes the bird as \"A mysterious and secretive reed warbler; formerly fairly common but now increasingly rare and possibly near extinction. The only Asian reed warbler with a streaked crown and back. Adults bear a passing resemblance to the much more common Black-browed Reed Warbler but have prominent striping all along the back and crown, a less contrasting brow pattern, and are noticeably paler in color. Recorded in marshes and wet fields on passage and during the winter, but breeding grounds remain unknown. Gives a rattling, grating song akin to an Oriental Reed Warbler, but reportedly quieter.\"\nHabitat and conservation status\nOn passage, it has been recorded in marshland and millet crops, and it occurs near the water in reed and grass marshes in the winter.  It possibly uses willow scrub and reedbeds in its breeding range. It probably feeds largely on invertebrates and may  consume seeds but more research is needed.  Spring passage in China is from late May to early June, with autumn passage from late August to early September.  All Philippine records are from September to June.\nIUCN has assessed this bird as critically endangered with the population estimated at just 250 to 999 mature individuals and continuing to decline. This species' main threat is habitat loss with wholesale clearance of wetland habitats particularly the only known wintering ground in Candaba Swamp which has been converted into agricultural lands, particularly for rice.\nThe Candaba Swamp is a Ramsar site; however, habitat conversion and hunting still continues.\nConservation actions proposed include attempting to locate the breeding areas in China and Russia; surveying wetlands in the Philippines to try and locate further wintering sites; and initiating a new ringing programme at Dalton Pass and other migrant trapping locations.  Investigation of the potential for stable isotope analysis of museum specimens could identify areas in which the species breeds. Finally, it should be listed as a protected species in China.\nReferences\n* [https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=558430 ITES]"
