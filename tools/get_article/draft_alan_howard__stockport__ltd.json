In 1975, Alan Howard expanded through the acquisition of an existing business in Oldham, which later relocated to the location of its current Oldham store. Over the subsequent two decades, the business grew rapidly, opening branches across the North West of England, over the Pennines to Yorkshire, and extending into the West Midlands.\nIn 1982, the company established Woodbank Ceramics, a ceramics manufacturing facility based at its Stockport location, and was among the first in the UK to produce salon basins in 20 different colours. The ceramics enterprise now operates under the name Chatsworth Ceramics.\nIn April 2015, the company moved into a new headquarters off the M60 in Stockport, featuring training classrooms, a cash-and-carry outlet, and a 100-seat conference theatre.\nAs of today, Alan Howard remains a family-led business, chaired by co-founder Howard Littler, with his sons Jonathan and Anton participating in its management.\nReferences"
