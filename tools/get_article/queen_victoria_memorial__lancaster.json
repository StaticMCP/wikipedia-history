It stands in the centre of Dalton Square, facing Lancaster Town Hall. It was erected in 1906, being commissioned and paid for by James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton.\nThe monument was designed by Herbert Hampton (1862–1929), a prolific sculptor and stone carver who also designed the exterior of the Ashton Memorial in Lancaster.\nDescription\nThe memorial is of Portland stone with bronze sculpture. A statue of Queen Victoria stands on a tall pedestal facing south, \"looking a little pensively over the square,\" according to Nikolaus Pevsner.\nThe pedestal sits on a tall square plinth with rounded corners accompanied by four bronze lions at the ordinal points.\nAround the plinth is an unbroken bas relief frieze of bronze. At the corners, facing ordinal points, are four figurative sculptures, each depicting an allegory of Freedom (northeast), Truth (southeast), Wisdom (southwest) and Justice (northwest).\nOn the four cardinal faces are near life size likenesses of fifty three prominent British figures from the Victorian era.\nOf the fifty three persons depicted upon the plinth of the Queen Victoria Monument only two are women: George Eliot and Florence Nightingale.\nFive of those depicted were born in Lancaster or the surrounding area: William Turner, Edward Frankland, Richard Owen, William Whewell, James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton.\nAt the time of construction, of the people featured on the monument, six were still alive: William Turner, Luke Fildes, Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, Florence Nightingale and James Williamson, 1st Baron Ashton himself, the author of the monument.\nAmongst the people of Lancaster, the monument is also known as \"King Victoria\", because of the shape of the silhouette against the western sky at dusk.\nGallery\nImage:Queen Victoria Memorial Lancaster Freedom NE Corner.JPG|Allegory of \"freedom\" depicted on the NE corner\nImage:Queen Victoria Memorial Lancaster Wisdom SW Corner.JPG|Allegory of \"wisdom\" depicted on the SW corner\nImage:Queen Victoria Memorial Lancaster Truth SE Corner.JPG|Allegory of \"truth\" depicted on the SE corner\nFile:Lancaster Justice 6839.JPG|Allegory of \"justice\" depicted on the NW corner\nEast frieze\nEast frieze\nThe frieze on the east face of the monument depicts thirteen prominent Victorians from the fields of arts and culture.
