Starting with its first release, the horizontally scrolling shooter Airstrike, English Software focused on Atari 8-bit computers of home, then expanded to other platforms. The company used the slogan \"The power of excitement\".\nHistory\nThe company was set up in 1982 by Philip Morris, owner of the Gemini Electronics computer store in Manchester, to release video games for the Atari 8-bit computers. By the end of 1983, English Software was the largest producer of Atari 8-bit software in the UK and Morris closed Gemini Electronics to concentrate on English Software.\nThe company continued to concentrate on the Atari 8-bit market but also released games for other home computers including Commodore 64, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, and Amiga.\nPopular games include platformers Jet-Boot Jack (1983) and ''Henry's House (1984), racer Elektra Glide (1985), the multi-event Knight Games'' (1986) and shoot 'em up Leviathan (1987).\nEnglish had licensing deals that saw some of their games released internationally e.g. through Dynamics Marketing in Germany and Datamost in the US. A number of English's games were sold at budget price by Mastertronic in the US, which included exclusive ports such as the Atari version of ''Henry's House and the IBM PC compatible version of Knight Games. Philip Morris said in 2013 that he did not license the Atari version to Mastertronic UK, even though English Software had the option to do this.\nGames\n1982\n*Airstrike (Atari 8-bit)\n*Time Warp (Atari 8-bit)\n1983\n*Airstrike II (Atari 8-bit)\n*Batty Builders (Atari 8-bit)\n*Bombastic!
