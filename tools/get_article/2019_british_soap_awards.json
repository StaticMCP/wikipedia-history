The ceremony was held on 1 June 2019 at the Lowry theatre in Salford Quays, Salford, and was broadcast live on ITV1 and STV. The publicly voted categories were announced on 9 April 2019, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Actress and Actor awards. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 30 April 2019, alongside tickets for the ceremony being made available for sale.\nChannel 4 soap Hollyoaks won two of the three viewer-voted categories, including Best British Soap, while ITV soap Coronation Street took home the most awards that night, with five wins. One of Coronation Streets wins included the Outstanding Achievement accolade, which went to actress Sue Nicholls, for her role as Audrey Roberts. EastEnders child actress Kara-Leah Fernandes won two awards, Best Young Actor and Best On-Screen Partnership, the latter of which was shared with her on-screen father, played by Roger Griffiths. Doctors also won Best Comedy Performance for the second year in a row when Sarah Moyle won for her role as Valerie Pitman.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Award\n!
