These are theoretically open to pupils of all faiths or none, although if the school is over-subscribed priority will be given to Roman Catholic children.\nHistory\nDuring the Reformation, Catholic schools were created on the European continent for the training of children of Catholic families from Britain. During the 18th century, colleges for the training of priests were created in Scotland, such as in Scalan and Lismore Seminary. After the Re-establishment of the English hierarchy and the Scottish hierarchy new schools were created. After the Education Act 1918 in Scotland and the Education Act 1944 in England and Wales, state-funded Catholic schools were built. Nevertheless, today there has been some controversy over Roman Catholic schools. Some Labour backbenchers would like to see them closed along with all other faith-based schools, and this was the official policy of the Scottish Green Party at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. Some local authorities – such as in Lanarkshire – have chosen to build so-called \"shared campuses\" where a Roman Catholic and non-denominational school share grounds, a building, and facilities such as canteen, sport halls etc., but lessons are taught separately. This policy has had mixed success – although supporters say it reduces the risk of \"us and them\" sectarianism, some shared campuses have suffered disruptions on opening. At one stage the Scottish Catholic Church even considered legal action against North Lanarkshire Council to stop another \"shared campus\" being built.\nIn Northern Ireland, Roman Catholic schools are state-funded and organised and run by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS).\nEngland and Wales\nThe Catholic Education Service provides the central co-ordination under the Bishops' Conference for Catholic schools in England and Wales. In England and Wales, Catholic schools come under the jurisdiction of their local diocese who can inspect the religious education and acts of worship of the school under Section 48 of the Education Act 2005. Many schools were also founded by religious orders who continue to maintain a presence, property ownership or trusteeship of their schools.\nIn England and Wales are joint Anglican and Catholic schools. These include primary schools such as: All Saints, Cambridge; The Bishops’ School, Chelmsford; Emmaus School, Liverpool; The Faith School, Liverpool; St John’s Sunderland; Christ the King, Macclesfield. There is a joint middle school: St Edward’s Royal Free School, Windsor.  Joint secondary schools and academies include: St Cuthbert Mayne School, Torquay; St Augustine, Taunton; St Bede, Cambridge; St Bede, Redhill; St Michael, Barnsley; St Edward, Poole; St Francis Xavier High School, Richmond, North Yorkshire; Emmaus, Sheffield; Holy Family College, Heywood, Rochdale; Christ’s College, Cheltenham; St Francis of Assisi, Liverpool; St Chad’s, Runcorn. In 2006, the first joint Church in Wales and Catholic school was opened in Wales: St Joseph’s, Wrexham.\nEngland\nBedfordshire\nDiocese of Northampton\n* St Thomas More Catholic School, Bedford\n*
