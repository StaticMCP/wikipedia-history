The treaty was a decisive step in the dissolution of the Maratha Empire, which led to the East India Company's annexation of the empire's territories in western India in 1818.\nOn 13 May 1803, Baji Rao II was restored as Peshwa under the protection of the East India Company and Peshwa had thus become a client ruler of the British. The treaty led to expansion of the Company rule over the Indian subcontinent. However, the treaty was not acceptable to all Marathas chieftains, and resulted in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.\nTerms\nThe terms of the treaty entailed the following:\n#A British force of around 6,000 troops be permanently stationed with the Peshwa.\n#Any territorial districts yielding 2.6 million rupees were to be paid to the East India Company.\n#The Peshwa could not enter into any other treaty without first consulting the Company.\n#The Peshwa could not declare war without first consulting the Company.\n#Any territorial claims made by the Peshwa would be subject to the arbitration of the Company (i.e. Nizam and Gaekwar).\n#The Peshwa must reanounce his claim over Surat and Baroda.\n#The Peshwa must exclude all Europeans from his service.\n#To conduct his foreign relations in consultation with the British.\nSee also\n*Treaty of Poona\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20031203024120/http://sify.com/itihaas/fullstory.php?id=13258646 1802: Treaty of Bassein]\n*[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9013668/Treaty-of-Bassein Encyclopædia Britannica – Treaty of Bassein]"
