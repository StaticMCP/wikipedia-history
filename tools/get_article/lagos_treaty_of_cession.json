In 1849, Britain appointed John Beecroft as Consul of the Bights of Benin and Biafra, a position he held (along with his governorship of Fernando Po) until his death in 1854. John Duncan was appointed Vice Consul and was located at Wydah. At the time of Beecroft's appointment, the Kingdom of Lagos (under Oba Kosoko) was in the western part of the Consulate of the Bights of Benin and Biafra and was a key slave trading port. In 1851 and with pressure from liberated slaves who now wielded political and business influence, Britain intervened in Lagos in what is now known as the Reduction of Lagos resulting in the installation of Oba Akitoye (and the ouster of Oba Kosoko) who signed the Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852. The signing of the 1852 treaty ushered in the Consular Period in Lagos' history wherein Britain provided military protection to Lagos.\nThe Treaty of Cession\nFollowing threats from Kosoko and the French who were positioned at kingdom of Wydah, a decision was made by Lord Palmerston (British Prime Minister) who noted \"the expediency of losing no time in assuming the formal Protectorate of Lagos\". William McCoskry, the Acting Consul in Lagos with Commander Bedingfield convened a meeting with Oba Dosunmu on July 30, 1861, aboard  where Britain's intent was explained and a response to the terms were required by August 1861. Dosunmu resisted the terms of the treaty but due to the threat to unleash a bombardment on Lagos by Commander Bedingfield, Dosunmu relented and signed the treaty.\nTreaty text\nThe text of the Lagos Treaty of Cession is transcribed below:\nTreaty between Norman B.
