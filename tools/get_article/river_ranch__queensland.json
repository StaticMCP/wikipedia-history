In the , River Ranch had a population of 269 people.\nGeography\nThe Calliope River forms part of the western boundary before flowing through to form part of the eastern boundary. Calliope Crossing is a ford over the river ().\nThe Bruce Highway passes through the north of the locality.\nHistory\nIn 1930, a bridge was built at the Calliope Crossing over the Calliope River to replace the dangerous stone causeway which was under the water and was slimy and dangerous. When the weather was bad, the causeway could not be used, necessitating a  deviation to avoid it. The bridge carried the Bruce Highway until it was rerouted further north and crosses the river at Burua.\nThe centenary celebrations of the Shire of Calliope in 1979 created a collection of historic material, which led to the establishment of the Port Curtis Historical Society. As a new bridge was being constructed for the Bruce Highway to cross the Calliope River, the diversion of the highway to the new bridge created a parcel of land that the shire proposed to use as a historical village. Following site works, the village commenced operation in 1983 with the arrival of the first building, the Ambrose railway station.\nDemographics\nIn the , River Ranch had a population of 313 people.\nIn the , River Ranch had a population of 357 people.\nIn the , River Ranch had a population of 269 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in River Ranch.

It is managed by the Gladstone Regional Council. It is adjacent to the Old Bruce Highway Fishing Bridge (), which has been closed to traffic since 2009, but is still accessible for fishing.\nAttractions\nThe Calliope River Historical Village is at 50951 Bruce Highway, but accessed from the Old Bruce Highway where it crosses the Calliope River ().\nReferences"
