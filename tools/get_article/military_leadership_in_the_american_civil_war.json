The overall military leadership of the United States during the Civil War was ultimately vested in the President of the United States as constitutional commander-in-chief, and in the political heads of the military departments he appointed. Most of the major Union wartime commanders had, however, previous regular army experience. A smaller number of military leaders originated from the United States Volunteers. Some of them   derived from nations other than the United States.\nIn the Southern Confederacy, the constitutional commander-in-chief was educated at West Point and had served in the Mexican War. Many officers in the United States Army, most of them educated at West Point at the expense of the United States, and having taken an oath of allegiance to the same, joined the rebellion against it. Several significant Confederate military leaders emerged from state unit commands. Some military leaders derived from countries other than the United States.\nThe United States (The Union)\nWinfield ScottJohn E. Wool\nGeorge B. McClellan\nHenry W. Halleck\nUlysses S.

Lincoln's first Secretary of War was Simon Cameron; Edwin M. Stanton was confirmed to replace Cameron in January 13, 1862. Thomas A. Scott was Assistant Secretary of War. Gideon Welles was Secretary of the Navy, aided by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! width=25% colspan=2 |Name\n! width=25% |Tenure\n!

Wool\nMilitia and political leaders appointed to Union military leadership\nUnder the United States Constitution, each state recruited, trained,  equipped, and maintained local militia; regimental officers were appointed and promoted by state governors. After states answered Lincoln's April 15, 1861, ninety-day call for 75,000 volunteer soldiers, most Union states' regiments and batteries became known as United States Volunteers to distinguish between state-raised forces and regular army units. Union brigade-level officers (generals) could receive two different types of Federal commissions: U.S. Army or U.S. Volunteers (ex: Major General, U.S.A. as opposed to Major General, U.S.V.). While most Civil War generals held volunteer or brevet rank, many generals held both types of commission; regular rank was considered superior.\n*Edward D.

Handicapped by an aging 90 ship fleet, and despite significant manpower losses to the Confederate Navy after secession, a massive ship construction campaign embracing technological innovations from civil engineer James Buchanan Eads and naval engineers like Benjamin F. Isherwood and John Ericsson, along with four years' daily experience with modern naval conflict put the U. S. Navy onto a path which has led to today's world naval dominance.\nCommanding Officer, U.S.N.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=5% |No.\n! width=25% colspan=2 |Name\n! width=25% |Tenure\n! width=25% |Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=1 | -\n|\n| Flag Officer Charles Stewart\n| March 2, 1859 – December 21, 1861\n| Served as \"Senior Flag Officer, U.S.N.\" until his retirement on 21 December 1861; promoted Rear Admiral on the Retired list July 16, 1862\n|-\n| rowspan=1 | 1\n|\n| Vice Admiral David Farragut\n| December 21, 1861 – August 14, 1870\n| Commanded the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in addition to serving as Commanding Officer.

Alexander H. Stephens was appointed as Vice President of the Confederate States of America on February 18, 1861, and later assumed identical vice presidential responsibilities as Hannibal Hamlin did. Several men served the Confederacy as Secretary of War, including Leroy Pope Walker, Judah P. Benjamin, George W. Randolph, James Seddon, and John C. Breckinridge. Stephen Mallory was Confederate Secretary of the Navy throughout the conflict.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! width=\"25%\" colspan=2 |Name\n! width=\"25%\" |Tenure\n!

Himself a graduate of West Point and a former regular officer, Confederate President Jefferson Davis highly prized these valuable recruits to the cause and saw that former regular officers were given positions of authority and responsibility.\n*Richard H.

The South had abundant navigable inland waterways, but after the Union built a vast fleet of gunboats, they soon dominated the Mississippi, Tennessee, Cumberland, Red and other rivers, rendering those waterways almost useless to the Confederacy.  Confederates did seize several Union Navy vessels in harbor after secession and converted a few into ironclads, like the CSS Virginia. Blockade runners were built and operated by British naval interests, although by late in the war the C.S. Navy operated some. A few new vessels were built or purchased in Britain, notably the CSS Shenandoah and the CSS Alabama. These warships acted as raiders, wreaking havoc with commercial shipping. Aggrieved by these losses, in 1871 the U.S. government was awarded damages from Great Britain in the Alabama Claims.\n*John Mercer Brooke\n*Isaac Newton Brown\n*Franklin Buchanan\n*James Dunwoody Bulloch\n*Catesby ap Roger Jones\n*Matthew Fontaine Maury\n*Raphael Semmes\n*Josiah Tattnall III\n*James Iredell Waddell\nSee also\n*History of Confederate States Army Generals\n*Confederate States Armed Forces\n*Union Army\n*Union Navy\nNotes\nReferences\n* Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.
