In 1791, they cleared trees and built a log cabin. For many years after, their land was the only cleared area beyond the Middle Road.\nCoal mining\nCoal mining was the chief industry in the region. In 1864, the Warrior Run Mining Company was organized; it reopened the old Holland and Hillman mine. The company built a breaker at the foot of the mountain; it opened in 1867.\nAt about the same time, both the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Nanticoke Branch of the Central Railroad of New Jersey completed their lines through the area, thus making it possible to conveniently mine, transport, and market the area's coal.
