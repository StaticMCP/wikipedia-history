The approach combines aspects of prior Chinese diplomatic doctrine, including the preceding wolf warrior diplomacy and the 2000s-era peaceful rise doctrine. It is characterised by inclusive and pragmatic dialogue, emphasising stability, mutual economic collaboration, and an avoidance of aggressive public diplomacy to improve China's reputational standing abroad.\nHistory\nPre-PRC background\nChina's modern diplomatic identity is rooted in the ancient Tianxia political framework, where China was the centre of the civilised world and all other societies were either tributaries or less developed peripheries. This worldview positioned China as both a cultural leader and political ruler of “all under heaven”. According to historian Ge Zhaoguang, this cosmology underpinned Chinese intellectual, political, and religious authority for centuries, defining the empire’s self-conception as the Heavenly Kingdom.\nIn the nineteenth century, the Qing Dynasty faced territorial losses and unequal treaties following the Opium Wars and subsequent conflict with Western and Japanese empires. These losses undermined Tianxia and damaged China's international reputation. The subsequent “Century of Humiliation” (1839–1949) became a foundational trauma in the modern Chinese collective memory.\nEarly People’s Republic (1949–1978)\nFollowing their victory in the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) declared an end to the century of humiliation and sought to restore territorial sovereignty and national dignity. As Dong Lisheng argues, this historical consciousness remains central to the CCP's legitimacy, framing itself as the guardian responsible for ending national suffering and reclaiming China’s rightful global position.\nMao Zedong’s early diplomacy was guided by a deep suspicion of imperialism and a determination to prevent external domination. This phase was characterised by a dual strategy of rejection and resistance. The CCP repudiated all unequal treaties and tried to restore territorial unity and integrity, reasserting China’s independence first from Western and later Soviet influence.\nMao also pursued the development of solidarity among anti-colonial movements and newly decolonised nations, positioning China as a leader of the “Third World” while prioritising autonomy over alliances, maintaining a sovereignty-first diplomatic approach.\nReform and Opening-Up (1978–2012)\nFollowing Mao’s death, Deng Xiaoping initiated the Reform and Opening-Up policy, shifting China's diplomatic approach from revolutionary isolationism to economic pragmatism, wherein diplomacy was used to attract foreign capital, technology, and expertise for domestic development.\nUnder Deng's understated “hide your strength, bide your time” diplomatic approach, which continued under Jiang Zemin, China consolidated relations with the United States, joined the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and acceded to the World Trade Organisation.\nThrough the 2000s, Hu Jintao's “peaceful rise” and “Harmonious Society” doctrines increased China's presence abroad while reassuring neighbours and Western partners that China’s ascent would not threaten international norms. However, China remained vigilant towards perceived threats to sovereignty, particularly Tibet and Taiwan.\nXi Jinping’s agenda (2012–present)\nOn the international stage, Xi Jinping’s rise to power in 2012 marked greater ideological discipline, bolder assertions of national autonomy, and international agenda-setting in competition with the United States.\nXi Jinping’s diplomatic approach involves diplomatic dualism, where China took a proactive international role through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the digital renminbi (e-CNY), while rebutting foreign criticism of its domestic policies.\nDomestically, Xi repeatedly highlighted the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\" reiterating the CCP as the only entity capable of restoring China’s dignity.\nWolf warrior diplomacy and decline\nSee also: wolf warrior diplomacy\nIssued in 2018, Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy justified open ideological struggle with the West, alongside more combative protection of Chinese sovereignty. The term itself was coined in reference to a 2019 Twitter argument between Zhao Lijian and US diplomat Susan Rice over the treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. The same year, Gui Congyou, the Chinese ambassador to Sweden, asserted, “For our enemies we have shotguns,” during a dispute with a Swedish journalist in Taiwan.\nSuch assertive rhetoric increased around April 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Kerry Liu (2024), the crisis enabled Chinese diplomats to adopt a combative stance against critics of China's zero-COVID policy. Some scholars also believe such rhetoric aimed to create clear international divisions between China's allies and the West.\nThe new tone was publicly validated when Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended the combative approach during the National People’s Congress in May 2020. Incidents including Chinese sanctions on European officials in 2021 and another tweet by Zhao Lijian, then deputy spokesman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, mocking Australian soldiers in 2020 exemplified this continued posture.\nBy 2021, despite positive responses from domestic nationalists, international backlash to wolf warrior diplomacy was widespread. Xi Jinping declared his goal for a \"trustworthy, lovable, and respectable\" reputation abroad in response, after which internal criticism of wolf warrior diplomats increased.\nReduced aggression in Chinese diplomatic statements was first observed in 2022, while 2023 reshuffles in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs marked wolf warrior diplomacy's wider decline, which was considered complete by 2025.\nCauses\nChinese face culture in foreign relations\nMain article: Face (Sociological Concept)Face is a widespread sociological concept which usually refers to social standing and self-esteem. Chinese culture divides the concept into two components: Liǎn (脸), which refers to social reputation and prestige determined by an individual's lifetime accomplishments, and miànzi (面子), which refers to self-esteem, external judgements of an individual's moral character, and corresponding acts of respect. In diplomacy, liǎn refers to China's international standing while miànzi refers to domestic conceptions of its international presence.\nAccording to Confucian beliefs, which prioritise social harmony and hierarchy, individuals may improve their social standing and dignity (face) by establishing guānxi (关系, connections) with other actors. This involves engaging in repeated goodwill gestures and praising the other for satisfying the responsibilities associated with their prestige. Conversely, individuals lose face if guānxi are rejected or terminated.\nFace culture's explanations for China's softening diplomacy\nFollowing China's emergence as the world's largest exporter, much of its domestic social prestige (miànzi) and international reputation (liǎn) rests on its support of economic incentives in Latin America and Africa. To Chinese citizens, this support represents both domestic strength and a recovery of international prestige following the century of humiliation. However, economic uncertainty stemming from rising youth unemployment, lockdown policies, and the US-China trade war created concerns over the longevity of goodwill through foreign investment amid backlash against aggressive wolf warrior diplomacy tactics. Therefore, China sought to \"save face\" by avoiding government accountability and leadership positions if it cannot influence global geopolitics to its favour, reflecting Confucian teachings of \"saving face\" where acknowledgment of failure is the greatest form of dishonour.\nFor example, post-pandemic China faced strained diplomatic relations with Western countries over its treatment of the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests, national security concerns, and doubts about China's commitment to the liberal international system. This is signified by Italy's withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative in 2023 over fears that Chinese economic influence weakened Italian sovereignty. Under Confucian philosophy, China risked losing face from this suspension of bilateral co-operation. In Chinese culture, such humiliation outweighs corresponding material benefits, justifying temporary material or reputational sacrifice with long-term strategic goals and reputation in mind. Xi Jinping's renewed focus on \"international communications\" at the 30th CCP Politburo group study session can be understood as an attempt to restore China's pragmatic international reputation by moderating its projection of ultra-nationalism abroad, while projecting patriotism (miànzi) to domestic audiences through constructive means.\nCharacteristics\nPost-wolf warrior diplomacy instead counters international perceptions of a belligerent China, to which wolf warrior diplomacy itself contributed. This contrasts the confrontational, hostile, or aggressive ideological approach of wolf warrior diplomacy, particularly regarding Chinese sovereignty, justified by Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy.\nIn the event of public diplomatic disputes, stern public responses and compromises are both largely avoided. Wu Lunting describes Beijing's use of “Ghosting Diplomacy”, a controlled disengagement tactic allowing China to express dissatisfaction without direct confrontation by interrupting communications, refusing meetings, or ignoring dialogue requests from other countries. Following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan in 2022, China cut off several bilateral communication channels with the United States. This non-violent form of retaliation enables China to at once signal anger to maintain domestic expectations, and avoid uncontrolled escalation with other states.\nSimultaneously, Xi’s government renewed China's soft power initiatives and cultural diplomacy, promoting Chinese values and narratives to global audiences. In public discourse, China has emphasised fostering positive international perceptions, paralleling aspects of Hu Jintao's peaceful rise doctrine. State media emphasises guiding the international community into a new global order by creating a positive atmosphere and employing an accommodating diplomatic approach, with the eventual goal of resolving domestic economic challenges. At the BRICS plus dialogue in 2024, President Xi Jinping articulated this change in stance, stating that \"We should uphold peace and strive for common security.\" Wang Yi also spoke about implementing a new global governance initiative during the 23rd Lanting forum in October 2025.\nReception\nDomestic\nBoth the assertive wolf warrior era and the newer, harmony-oriented diplomatic approaches fuelled expressions of Chinese nationalism. Online audiences often respond to official diplomatic statements with intense national pride regardless of the statement's tone. There is evidence, however, that constructive diplomatic messaging is more effective than aggressive rhetoric in cultivating constructive forms of nationalism. Nevertheless, digital reactions remain unpredictable, as shown by the K-visa controversy, when a policy inviting foreign STEM graduates was met with nationalist backlash on Weibo. Afterwards, the People’s Daily published editorials defending the policy as a symbol of “a more open and confident China”. This kind of online controversy is an example of the “top-down versus bottom-up” dynamics of digital nationalism, where official discourse transmitted by state media is reinterpreted by the public through a nationalist or xenophobic lens.\nAmong overseas Chinese\nAmong overseas Chinese, the retreat from confrontational rhetoric generally has positive implications. A more measured diplomatic style has eased concerns that aggressive language from state officials could stigmatise diaspora communities. At the same time, some nationalist critics argue that restraint may dilute China’s ability to defend ethnic Chinese interests abroad.\nImpact on diplomatic relations\nChina’s recent emphasis on “face” and harmony reflects long-standing East Asian norms in diplomacy. Analysts describe this as an effort to rebuild credibility after the wolf warrior diplomacy period, portraying China as a responsible power and conflict mediator. This moderate narrative can also be seen as strategic, with little guarantee that China's diplomatic promises will be implemented.\nIn the West\nWestern governments and media greeted this shift with cautious optimism. Some analysts note that geopolitical competition will continue, particularly with the United States, to whom most remaining aggression is directed, and view the new diplomatic approach as a rebranding exercise. Nevertheless, a calmer diplomatic tone has reduced controversies on social media and at press conferences.\nIn the Global South\nin Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2025.]]\nThe diplomatic shift generally benefits the Global South. China continues to frame itself as an advocate for mutual development through BRICS, the Belt and Road Initiative, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi described China and Africa as “good brothers who fight side by side” in his 2025 Africa Day speech. This underscores Mao-era anti-colonial ties between China and Africa and reaffirms the Chinese “community of common destiny” narrative, which presents it as an alternative developmental partner to Western states. At the same time, as diplomacy softens, partner states increasingly bargain for stronger institutional oversight, accountability, and more equitable agreement terms.\nReferences"
