It was a spin-off of the Call of Duty series, and based on the Zombies mode of Call of Duty: World at War. The game was released worldwide for iPhone on November 16, 2009, and for iPad on April 1, 2010. The game allowed for multiplayer cooperative gameplay locally via an ad hoc Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network, or globally via the internet. It also came with the three other maps, Verrückt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. A sequel to the game, Call of Duty: Black Ops – Zombies, has been published by Activision.\nThe game's setting originally takes place in a German bunker (Nacht der Untoten, meaning \"Night of the Undead\" in German) during World War II from the viewpoint of a US Marine. SS soldiers who have become zombies attempt to infiltrate the bunker and attack the players, and the players must defend themselves in the process.\nGameplay\nThe objective of the game is to survive each round of invading zombies after which a more difficult round begins. The player begins the game with a Colt 1911 and has access to a melee attack via a combat knife, as well as a maximum of 4 hand grenades. As players fight the zombies, they receive points. These points are used to buy weapons, perks, and access to different parts of the map. Some maps have different variations of zombies that spawn on specific waves, like zombie hell hounds.\nZombies enter from outside the playable map via barricaded entries. As the rounds progress, difficulty increases and the zombies can remove barricades faster. Players are awarded points for replacing barricades as well as killing zombies.\nThe game has a variety of perks that can be bought with points which award players with enhanced abilities. In addition to perks, there are random instances of power-up drops that are left behind when a zombie is killed to further aid players.\nSome maps may also contain 'Easter Eggs' that players can perform to play music, earn some kind of reward, or learn more about the series' cryptic lore.\nReception\n(iPhone) 78/100\n| Destruct = (iPad) 7.5/10(iPhone) 7/10\n| GSpot = (iPhone) 8/10\n| GameZone = (iPhone) 7.5/10\n| IGN = (iPhone) 7/10\n| JXV = (iPhone) 9/20\n| MW =\n| PG = (iPhone)\n| TA = (iPhone)\n}}\nThe iPhone and iPad versions received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
