Following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, the entire shopping centre closed for urgent safety inspections, partially reopening eleven days later. One building in the northeast corner of the mall, containing the Event Cinema and part of the carpark, was deemed structurally unsafe and was demolished. During the deconstruction of the northeast corner, half of the stores remained closed. The mall was completely reopened on 6 April 2017.\nIn 2017, a car dealer opened a showroom in the mall, complete with cars for a brief period.\nCinema and carpark rebuild\nIn 2019, rebuilding of the carpark and cinema commenced. On 17 September 2019, Event Cinemas were confirmed to be the new cinema complex operator. It was also announced that the region's first VMAX movie theatre would open in the site.
