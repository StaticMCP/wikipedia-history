It was founded in 1987 as an Indigenous offshoot of the 34th Front of Northwestern Bloc of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), historically Colombia's oldest and largest left-wing guerrilla organization.\nThe FARIP is estimated to have contained up to 1,000 members at its height and carried out acts of sabotage, assassination, extortion, and military attacks on government and civilian targets within its zone of operation, sometimes in coordination with the FARC. The FARIP was dissolved in 1996, due in part to the efforts of Indigenous civil society organizations such the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC).\nReferences"
