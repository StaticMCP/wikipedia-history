Venni is generally identified with Kovil Venni east of Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.\nA confederacy of eleven rulers, led by the Chera and Pandya, including several minor velir chieftains, were defeated at Venni.\nThe Chera ruler, named \"Cheraman Perum Cheralathan\", was wounded on the back while leading the warriors (pierced by a shaft). Not being able to bear the disgrace, he committed suicide by slow starvation (\"Sitting by Facing the North\"). It is said that some of his companions also committed suicide unwilling to part with him.\nThe Chera ruler generally is identified with \"Adu Kottu Pattu\" Cheralathan.\nReferences"
