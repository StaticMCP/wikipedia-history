He received his D.M.A. in music composition from the University of Illinois at Urbana (1994); the M.M. from Michigan State University (1987) and the B.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Parkside (1984). From 1996 to 1999, Edgerton was a postdoctoral fellow with the National Center for Voice and Speech, based at the Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He has studied composition with William Brooks, Morgan Powell, Jere Hutcheson and August Wegner.\nAwards/recognition\n* 2007 Kompositionspreis der Landeshauptstadt Stuttgart\n* 2007 Composition Contest of the Netherlands Radio Choir – Semifinalist (Kalevi Matus, #58)\n* 2003 5th Dutilleaux International Composition Compétition – Selection (1 sonata, #70)\n* 2001 31 Festival Synthese Bourges – Sélection (The Elements of Risk in Creation, #59)\n* 1999 Sal Martirano composition competition – Finalist (Regret of a Noiseless Sundering, #22)\n* 1995 MacDowell Club Award for composition – First Prize (Unspoken Crime, #9)\n* 1993 Friends and Enemies of New Music – reading (Net/Byrinth, #15)\n* 1988 Midwest Composers Symposium – selection (A Penny for the Young Guy, #3 )\n* 1987 National Federation of Music Clubs Composition Competition – Third Prize (Ai, #5)\n* 1987 National Federation of Music Clubs Composition Competition – Honorable Mention (Dwellers of the Southwest, #2)\n* 1986 Michigan State University Orchestral Composition Competition – First Prize (The Final Diary of a Branch, #1)\nStyle\nSince mid-1990 Edgerton has been pioneering the compositional use of scaled & desynchronized multidimensional networks in order to unlock nonlinear phenomenon inherent in mechanical sound production systems (voice and musical instruments). These procedures utilize topological inquiry focused on little traveled regions of the total sonic map. For Edgerton, these multidimensional networks do not just focus on articulation, which is dominant with many who utilize multi-parametric organization. Rather, with Edgerton, these networks utilize all structural components of the mechanical system: power, source, resonance and articulation in order to affect a meaningful (perceptible) sound difference from ordinario. Additionally, more than a focus on unusual sounds or performance practice, the systematic use of desynchronized procedures coupled tightly to expected bifurcations amongst attractor states are utilized as intelligent generative procedures encompassing the consonance/dissonance and musical tension of these extra-complex sonorities (tones that exceed a single fundamental frequency with gradually sloping spectra).\nIn works such as adjusting to beams falling and his String Quartet #1, he attempts to convey an expression similar to Edward Said's notion of an artwork exhibiting \"intransigence, difficulty, and unresolved contradiction\" in order to provide an \"occasion to stir up more anxiety, tamper irrevocably with the possibility of closure and leave the audience more perplexed than before... to explore...a nonharmonious, non-serene tension, and above all, a sort of deliberately unproductive productiveness, going 'against'...\"\nLinkage. Other composers who have worked with desynchronized and/or multidimensional methods include Richard Barrett, Aaron Cassidy, Frank Cox, Julio Estrada, Brian Ferneyhough, Klaus K. Hübler, among others. Edgerton's work is sometimes associated with New Complexity in music.\nVoice\nEdgerton is a specialist of the extra-normal voice as composer, pedagogue, researcher and performer.\nVoice composition: Edgerton has written numerous compositions involving normal and extra-normal voice. Since the mid-90s his voice compositions have focused on searching for the bio-acoustic limits of vocal sound production that involve: 1) nonlinear phenomena; 2) simultaneous sound sources in the vocal tract; 3) multidimensionalty of vocal sound production. Additionally, Edgerton has incorporated sound production procedures seen in ethnic musical traditions from Tuva, Tibet, South Africa, Korea and India, to name a few. Representative compositions featuring the extra-normal voice include: #82 Cataphora, #77 A Marriage of Shadows, #68 prana, #62 Anaphora, #54 Friedrich’s Comma, #45 Taffy Twisters, among others.\nVoice pedagogue: Edgerton is a teacher of voice, focusing on methods of extra-normal voice production that extend western avant-garde (anti)traditions, which are influenced from nonwestern music and informed by voice science. Edgerton’s methods are, in the first instance, based upon the healthy voice (i.e. bel canto) that attempt to explore the biodiversity of sound production, in order to expand the limits of the voice – particularly those involving nonlinear phenomena. Edgerton gives individual lessons as well as workshops.\nHis pedagogical activities includes writings designed to spread the idea of systematic processes in voice exploration, these include a book (The 21st Century Voice), two forthcoming book chapters – one in The Oxford Handbook of Singing and the other in Teaching Singing in the 21st Century and two collections of pedagogical compositions, each focused on a separate aspect of the extra-normal voice.\nVoice Research: In 1995 Edgerton was asked by Barney Childs and Phillip Rehfeldt, then editors of the New Instrumentation Series at the University of California Press, to contribute a book discussing extended vocal techniques. As a result, Edgerton applied for and received a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship from the National Center for Voice and Speech (1996 to 1999) to conduct research for this project. Under the supervision of Diane Bless, Edgerton began the formal study of voice science which has led to the publication of articles and his book, The 21st Century Voice, as part of the New Instrumentation Series at Scarecrow Press.\nVoice performer: Edgerton as performer focuses on contemporary and ethnic-influenced vocal music as well as in improvised settings. Edgerton views the process of voice production as similar to electro-acoustic composition in which the elements of production: power {airflow}, acoustic source {vocal folds or upper vocal tract disruption}, resonators {lower, upper, nasal vocal tract} and articulation {tongue, velum, lips, etc.} are identified and separately emphasized in order to change timbre or even the class of sound production. Edgerton has improvised with Mathias Bauer, Frédérique Bruyas, Axel Dörner, Fern Chern Hwei, Andrés Galeano, Goh Lee-Kwong, Johan van Kreij, Romain Mercier, Izumi Ose, Hugues Vincent, Yong Yandsen, Etienne Ziemniak. A CD of improvised performance to the text of \"The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe, in three versions: one in translation by Charles Baudelaire, one in translation by Stéphane Mallarmé, and the original by Poe. The CD was a collaboration by Frédérique Bruyas and Edgerton and is titled the raven/le Corbeau edgar Poe published by Escargot MNT.\nWork\nOrchestra/sinfonietta\n* #87__Party Pieces Project, for orchestra (2013)\n* #84__The Garden of Risk, for sinfonietta (2009/2012)\n* #42__Pyramid of Unas, for orchestra and six voices (1998 – revision needed)\n* #01__The Final Diary of a Branch, for orchestra (1985)\nOpera/music theater\n* #33__No!!!, for two voices, rope climbers and drummers (1996)\n* #21__A Broken Collaboration, for solo actor, 3 voices, electric guitar and cello (1994)\n* #19__The 15th Century Walled Garden – Apokatastasis, for solo percussion, mosh pit, geodesic dome, car hoods, rocks, metal and other objects (1993)\n* #18__The Electric Meat Factory, for soprano, chanter, guitar, percussion, wall bass, electronic tape, spatialization in a three-story house played as an instrument (1993)\n* #17__Fracture Zone: Clipperton et Ragusii, an underwater drama designed to be performed within the Clipperton Transform Fault in the Pacific Ocean (1993)\n* #16__Fama Fraternitatis, for solo voice, assorted instruments, dancers and tunnelers (1992)\n* #11__Hour History, an opera for four principal actors, 11 male voices, percussion ensemble (1989)\nLarge ensemble\n* #92__In Silence I Hide my Loudest Scream, for 9 players (A.Fl., B,Cl., Trpt., Tbn., Perc., 2 Vl., Vla., Vlc.)

Most importantly the text and associated recordings propose methods for continued creative exploration. The book has received exceptional reviews and is now available from Scarecrow Press. Due to the comprehensive treatment of extra-complex vocal production within a scientific framework, the book has a broad appeal that extends beyond musical composition and performance to include voice science, acoustics, linguistics, computer modeling and more.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Chandra, A.
