Gallup polling has often been accurate in predicting the outcome of presidential elections and the margin of victory for the winner. However, it missed some close elections: 1948, 1976 and 2004, the popular vote in 2000, and the likely-voter numbers in 2012. The month section in the tables represents the month in which the opinion poll was conducted. D represents the Democratic Party, and R represents the Republican Party. Third parties, such as the Dixiecrats and the Reform Party, were included in some polls.\n1936\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1936\n!Month\n!Franklin D.

Roosevelt win, based on statistical random sampling within 1.1 percent of the Literary Digest results.\nThe accuracy of Gallup's forecasts indicated the value of modern statistical methods; according to data collected in the Gallup poll, the Literary Digest poll failed primarily due to non-response bias (Roosevelt won 69 percent of Literary Digest readers who did not participate in the poll) rather than selection bias as commonly believed. Roosevelt won 57 percent of Literary Digest readers who received the poll. Roosevelt won in the largest landslide since the uncontested 1820 election, winning every state except Maine and Vermont, since his New Deal programs were popular with the American people (apart from the respondents to the Literary Digest poll). Although Landon said that the New Deal was costly and ineffective and Roosevelt was slowly molding the United States into a dictatorship, his attacks gained little traction.\n1940\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1940\n!Month\n!Franklin D.

Wendell Willkie unsuccessfully attacked Roosevelt for seeking a third term and accused him of trying to turn the United States into a dictatorship by refusing to leave office. Roosevelt led in all polls, and was re-elected by a large margin.\n1944\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1944\n!Month\n!Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) %\n!Thomas E.

Truman's popularity was low at the end of 1946, it improved with his attack on the \"Do-Nothing\" Republican Congress of 1947–1948 and his association of Thomas E. Dewey with it. Truman also energized segments of the Democratic base by ending segregation in the military and recognizing Israel. Gallup and other polling organizations stopped polling in mid-October, believing that Dewey would win the election, and failed to predict Truman's comeback or his subsequent victory.\n1952\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1952\n!Month\n!Dwight D.

Incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon initially led, but then had problems (a poor image in the first television debate and a knee injury which prevented him from campaigning) which gave John F.

Johnson had been the early frontrunner for the Democratic Party's nomination. However, after he only narrowly won the New Hampshire primary, he eventually withdrew form the race, and Vice President Hubert Humphrey was proclaimed the new Democratic candidate. The campaign was always close according to the polls, but after the tumultuous 1968 Democratic National Convention, Nixon established and maintained a lead. American Independent candidate George Wallace ran in opposition to civil rights and in support of segregation and received considerable support in the South. Humphrey began catching up to Nixon in the polls late in the campaign, but ran out of time as Nixon won a narrow victory.\n1972\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1972\n!Month\n!Richard Nixon (R) %\n!George McGovern (D) %\n|-\n|May\n|53%\n|34%\n|-\n|June\n|53%\n|37%\n|-\n|July\n|56%\n|37%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|August\n|57%\n|31%\n|-\n|64%\n|30%\n|-\n|September\n|61%\n|33%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|October\n|60%\n|34%\n|-\n|59%\n|36%\n|-\n|November\n|62%\n|38%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Actual result\n|60.67%\n|37.52%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Difference between actual result and final poll\n|1.33%\n|0.48%\n|}\nIncumbent President Nixon was re-elected in a landslide, winning every state except Massachusetts after maintaining a large poll lead due to the economic recovery from the 1969–1970 recession and his portrayal of George McGovern as a foreign-policy lightweight and social radical (\"amnesty, abortion, and acid\").

Ford closed the gap near the end of the campaign with good debate performances, among other things. He was hurt by his comment that there was no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and ran out of time to close the polling gap with Carter, who won by a narrow margin.\n1980\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1980\n!Month\n!Ronald Reagan (R) %\n!Jimmy Carter (D) %\n!John B.

Reagan, the former Governor of California and GE spokesman, passed Carter in the polls after the primaries, winning over voters dissatisfied with Carter's handling of the economy, the energy crisis, and the Iran hostage crisis. As the race neared its finish, Carter had apparently closed the gap with Reagan; some outlets gave him the lead. Reagan ran an upbeat campaign focused on fixing the economy and restoring America's image, diminished by Watergate and the war in Vietnam. Carter was more negative, attacking Reagan's record on civil rights and social issues. Reagan defeated Carter in a blowout on election night, the third win for Republicans in the past four presidential races.\n1984\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1984\n!Month\n!Ronald Reagan (R) %\n!Walter Mondale (D) %\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|December 1983/January 1984\n|48%\n|47%\n|-\n|53%\n|43%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|February/March\n|52%\n|42%\n|-\n|50%\n|45%\n|-\n|52%\n|44%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|April/May\n|54%\n|41%\n|-\n|52%\n|44%\n|-\n|50%\n|46%\n|-\n|53%\n|43%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|June/July\n|53%\n|44%\n|-\n|55%\n|38%\n|-\n|51%\n|43%\n|-\n|53%\n|39%\n|-\n|53%\n|41%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|August/September\n|52%\n|41%\n|-\n|56%\n|37%\n|-\n|58%\n|37%\n|-\n|55%\n|39%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|October/November\n|58%\n|38%\n|-\n|56%\n|39%\n|-\n|59%\n|41%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Actual result\n|58.77%\n|40.56%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Difference between actual result and final poll\n|0.23%\n|0.44%\n|}\nReagan had low approval ratings early in his first term, but by 1983 the economy had improved enough to give him a boost for re-election. His challenger was former Vice President Walter Mondale, who advocated a nuclear freeze, the Equal Rights Amendment and a balanced budget. Mondale benefited from a strong first debate (where the 73-year-old Reagan seemed slow), but the Reagan-Bush ticket had a resounding election victory. Reagan again cast himself as the candidate of optimism, taking credit for an improved economy and an increase in national pride after the social upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Mondale's unpopular proposal to raise taxes to reduce the deficit and association with the Carter administration's \"malaise\" largely doomed his campaign from the start.\n1988\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1988\n!Month\n!George H.

Although Perot returned to the race in September, he could not regain his previous support and Clinton won the general election by a comfortable margin.\n1996\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+1996\n!Month\n!Bill Clinton (D) %\n!Bob Dole (R) %\n!Ross Perot (Reform) %\n|-\n|January\n|43%\n|39%\n|16%\n|-\n|February\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|March\n|47%\n|34%\n|17%\n|-\n|April\n|49%\n|35%\n|15%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|May\n|47%\n|32%\n|19%\n|-\n|49%\n|35%\n|15%\n|-\n|June\n|49%\n|33%\n|17%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|July\n|50%\n|33%\n|12%\n|-\n|50%\n|35%\n|10%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|August\n|52%\n|30%\n|12%\n|-\n|48%\n|39%\n|7%\n|-\n|50%\n|38%\n|7%\n|-\n|51%\n|38%\n|7%\n|-\n|55%\n|34%\n|6%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"13\"|September\n|53%\n|36%\n|5%\n|-\n|54%\n|36%\n|4%\n|-\n|55%\n|34%\n|5%\n|-\n|55%\n|34%\n|5%\n|-\n|55%\n|32%\n|6%\n|-\n|51%\n|34%\n|8%\n|-\n|50%\n|36%\n|6%\n|-\n|52%\n|36%\n|4%\n|-\n|53%\n|34%\n|6%\n|-\n|51%\n|38%\n|5%\n|-\n|49%\n|39%\n|6%\n|-\n|51%\n|37%\n|6%\n|-\n|57%\n|32%\n|5%\n|-\n|rowspan=\"15\"|October\n|53%\n|36%\n|6%\n|-\n|51%\n|39%\n|5%\n|-\n|55%\n|35%\n|5%\n|-\n|55%\n|34%\n|6%\n|-\n|51%\n|38%\n|5%\n|-\n|56%\n|35%\n|4%\n|-\n|48%\n|39%\n|5%\n|-\n|51%\n|36%\n|8%\n|-\n|54%\n|35%\n|6%\n|-\n|52%\n|33%\n|8%\n|-\n|53%\n|34%\n|6%\n|-\n|54%\n|34%\n|7%\n|-\n|49%\n|37%\n|7%\n|-\n|51%\n|35%\n|10%\n|-\n|50%\n|37%\n|7%\n|-\n|November\n|52%\n|41%\n|7%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Actual result\n|49.24%\n|40.71%\n|8.40%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Difference between actual result and final poll\n|2.76%\n|0.29%\n|1.40%\n|}\nIncumbent President Bill Clinton held a comfortable lead in the polls throughout the campaign due to the good economy, stable international situation, and tying Bob Dole to Newt Gingrich (the unpopular speaker of the House), easily winning the presidential election.\n2000\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2000\n!Month\n!George W.

The Great Recession started in December 2007, but Obama was initially hurt in the polls by Hillary Clinton supporters. The Republicans attacked him for being inexperienced, and McCain got a temporary bump in the polls after choosing Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential nominee. The 2008 financial crisis allowed Obama to open a consistent, comfortable lead in the polls at the beginning of October, however, and he won the election by a comfortable margin.\n2012\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2012\n!Month\n!Barack Obama (D) %\n!Mitt Romney (R) %\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|February\n|48%\n|44%\n|-\n|49%\n|43%\n|-\n|49%\n|44%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |March\n|47%\n|45%\n|-\n|48%\n|44%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |April\n|48%\n|43%\n|-\n|49%\n|43%\n|-\n|47%\n|44%\n|-\n|48%\n|44%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |May\n|47%\n|44%\n|-\n|46%\n|46%\n|-\n|47%\n|45%\n|-\n|46%\n|44%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |June\n|48%\n|45%\n|-\n|46%\n|45%\n|-\n|47%\n|44%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |July\n|46%\n|45%\n|-\n|47%\n|45%\n|-\n|46%\n|45%\n|-\n|47%\n|45%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |August\n|48%\n|44%\n|-\n|47%\n|45%\n|-\n|47%\n|46%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |September\n|47%\n|47%\n|-\n|49%\n|45%\n|-\n|48%\n|45%\n|-\n|49%\n|45%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |October\n|49%\n|46%\n|-\n|47%\n|48%\n|-\n|47%\n|47%\n|-\n|47%\n|48%\n|-\n|November\n|49%\n|48%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Actual result\n|51.06%\n|47.20%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Difference between actual result and final poll\n|2.06%\n|0.80%\n|}\nPresident Obama and his campaign aired early negative ads calling Republican challenger Mitt Romney an out-of-touch, plutocratic, wealthy job destroyer since his days as CEO at Bain Capital. Romney bounced back in the polls after strong performances in the primaries and because the economy was still recovering from the 2007–2009 recession.\nIn April, after Obama publicly expressed his support of same-sex marriage and a story was published about Romney bullying a high-school classmate who was thought to be gay, Obama took larger leads in the polls. Romney and the Republicans attacked him for claiming that the economy was doing well, for welfare waivers, and China's unfair trade practices. The polls were close during most of the summer as Romney made several gaffes on a trip to Europe and Israel during the Olympics. He was also hurt by the release of a speech he delivered at a campaign fundraiser in which suggested that 47 percent of Americans, who did not pay federal income taxes, would \"vote for the President, no matter what\" because they felt \"entitled to health care, to food, to housing - you name it.\"\nAfter the conventions, Obama had a clear lead until he performed poorly in the first debate. Romney took the lead, and the polls were tied in early and mid-October. The Democrats then regained their momentum but Obama became the first President since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940 to win re-election by a narrower margin in both the popular vote and in the Electoral College.\n2016\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2016\n!Month\n!Donald Trump (R) %\n!Hillary Clinton (D) %\n!Gary Johnson (L) %\n!Jill Stein (G) %\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |June\n|36%\n|41%\n|7%\n|4%\n|-\n|37%\n|42%\n|8%\n|5%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |July\n|37%\n|41%\n|7%\n|4%\n|-\n|38%\n|41%\n|9%\n|4%\n|-\n|40%\n|40%\n|7%\n|3%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |August\n|38%\n|42%\n|7%\n|3%\n|-\n|36%\n|44%\n|9%\n|4%\n|-\n|37%\n|44%\n|9%\n|3%\n|-\n|37%\n|42%\n|9%\n|3%\n|-\n|38%\n|42%\n|8%\n|3%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |September\n|39%\n|41%\n|8%\n|3%\n|-\n|40%\n|42%\n|9%\n|3%\n|-\n|40%\n|41%\n|8%\n|3%\n|-\n|42%\n|43%\n|7%\n|2%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |October\n|41%\n|44%\n|7%\n|3%\n|-\n|39%\n|44%\n|7%\n|2%\n|-\n|39%\n|46%\n|7%\n|2%\n|-\n|40%\n|45%\n|6%\n|2%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |November\n|43%\n|45%\n|5%\n|2%\n|-\n|42%\n|46%\n|5%\n|2%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Actual result\n|46.09%\n|48.18%\n|3.28%\n|1.13%\n|- style=\"background:#9bddff;\"\n|Difference between actual result and final poll\n|4.09%\n|2.18%\n|1.72%\n|0.87%\n|}\nPolitical outsider, businessman and Republican candidate Donald Trump and former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton were seen unfavorably by many pollsters and pundits, and it was predicted that Trump would lose by a large margin to Democratic opponent Clinton.

This leading increased even more after his poor presidential debate performance and Trump's assassination attempt. Eventually, President Biden withdrew form the race, and Vice President Kamala Harris was proclaimed the new Democratic candidate. After this change, Harris was able to surpass Trump in most polls, but her advantage soon decreased as she ran out of time while Election Day was approaching. Eventually, Trump won the presidency after sweeping all of the seven swing states (Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Nevada), and winning the national popular vote for the first time (unlike his 2016 victory and his 2020 defeat). The 2024 U.S. presidential pre-election polls exhibited notable discrepancies, reflecting persistent challenges in U.S. electoral forecasting. It has been suggested that statistically significant directional bias resides in several 2024 polling contexts. Interestingly, the primary source of these biases stems from the underestimation of Republican vote, rather than the overestimation of Democratic support.\nNotes\nReferences"
