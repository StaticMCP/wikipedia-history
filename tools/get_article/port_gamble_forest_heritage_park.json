Invoking the Olmsted Brothers park planning, local groups envisioned a regional \"String of Pearls\" trail plan  2011 in the Pacific Northwest linking water trails linking the Olympic National Park on the Olympic Peninsula with the Kitsap Peninsula. A proposed system, the Sound to Olympics Trail, would allow one to cross Washington State by foot on a continuous trail system from the Pacific Ocean to the Idaho border. Kitsap County plans to embody a portion of the Sound to Olympics Trail in the Port Gamble Forest.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*"
