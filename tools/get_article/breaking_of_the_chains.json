At the base of the sculpture is a plaque with a quote by Martin Luther King, reading: \"Along the way of life, someone must have the sense enough, and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center of our lives.\"\nFile:San Diego, 2016 - 573.jpg|Plaque for the sculpture\nSee also\n* 1995 in art\nReferences"
