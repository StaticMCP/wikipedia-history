On his debut, in April 1962, he took 5 for 46 in the first innings of the Fifth Test against India at Sabina Park, Kingston. He played first-class cricket for Jamaica from 1961 to 1968.\nCricket career\nKing was a right-arm fast bowler who had played only two first-class matches before being selected to play Test cricket. Despite taking seven wickets in a West Indies victory in his first Test, he lost his place in the team to Charlie Griffith, who formed a powerful Test pace attack with Wes Hall and Garry Sobers throughout the 1960s. He toured England in 1963, India in 1966–67, and Australia and New Zealand in 1968–69, without playing a Test on any of his tours.\nKing was one of four West Indian fast bowlers who played a season of domestic cricket in India in 1962–63 in order to give Indian batsmen more experience of playing fast bowling. He played for Bengal and East Zone, taking 19 wickets in six matches with a best return of 5 for 146 in Bengal's victory in the Ranji Trophy quarter-final against Hyderabad. He played Lancashire League cricket for Rawtenstall in 1964 and 1965.\nSee also\n* List of West Indies cricketers who have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
