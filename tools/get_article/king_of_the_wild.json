He later went after explorer Percy Fawcett, who had disappeared in Brazil several years earlier. DeWinton also disappeared in the Amazon in early 1934 and was presumed dead. Bimi, the Ape Man, was played by actor Victor McLaglen's brother Arthur, and Mischa Auer plays an escaped lunatic named Dakka.\nKing of the Wild is sometimes misreported as an alternate title for the serial King of the Kongo, which also co-starred Boris Karloff, but they are two different serials.\nChapter titles\n# Man Eaters\n# Tiger of Destiny\n# The Avenging Horde\n# Secret of the Volcano\n# Pit of Peril\n# Creeping Doom\n# Sealed Lips\n# Jaws of the Jungle\n# Door of Dread\n# Leopard's Lair\n# The Fire of the Gods\n# Jungle Justice\nSource:\nSee also\n* Boris Karloff filmography\n* List of film serials by year\n* List of film serials by studio\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
