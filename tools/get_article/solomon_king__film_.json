The film was co-directed by Jack Bomay.\nPlot\nManey King (\"Little Jamie\" Watts) is in a Middle Eastern country overseeing oil fields.  When Prince Hassan (Richard Scarso) starts a coup to take over the country, Maney escapes with Princess Oneeba (Claudia Russo), his brother's girlfriend.  They head to Oakland, California, where his brother &ndash; Solomon King (Sal Watts), a former special forces operative and CIA agent &ndash; is a rich and influential businessman.  When the princess is killed, dying in Solomon's arms, he takes revenge, rounding up his former Green Beret pals to stage a counter-coup.}}\nProduction\nSal Watts was a businessman in Oakland, California who raised $140,000 from within the African American community to make this film in response to \"black complaints about 'blaxploitation movies'\". The working title was \"Black Agent Lucky King\".  Production for the film took place from late 1973 to early 1974, with location shooting taking place in Oakland and around the San Francisco Bay area.  The entire process of financing and making the film took two years.\nThe men's clothing for the film came from Watts' chain of clothing stores.\nWhen the film premiered in Oakland, it ran two hours.  Watts then trimmed it to 88 minutes.\nAs of the 2020s, the original negative and all other printing elements of the film were believed to have been lost. The UCLA Film and Television Archive owned a complete 35mm Eastman Kodak print, which was badly faded to pink and was damaged, and Watts' widow, Belinda Burton-Watts, had a 35mm sound track negative. From these Deaf Crocodile Films made a 4K restoration, which was released at the Fantastic Fest at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas in 2022. The restored film is 85 minutes long.\nSongs\n*\"Theme From Solomon King,\" written by J. Steiger\n*\"Ain't That Nothing,\" written by J. Steiger\n*\"Changes,\" written by Carol L.
