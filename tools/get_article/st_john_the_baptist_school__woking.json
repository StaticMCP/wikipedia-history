The school was one of the first 100 designated teaching schools in the UK.\nLocation\nThe school serves primarily the Catholic community of the Woking Deanery, which comprises the parishes of Woking with Send, Camberley, Camberley North with Bagshot, Frimley, Knaphill and West Byfleet. The deanery primary schools located in that community which are the feeder schools for St John the Baptist School are: St Dunstan’s Primary School, Woking; St Augustine’s Primary School, St Mary's Byfleet, Camberley; St Hugh of Lincoln Catholic Primary School, Knaphill and The Marist Primary School, West Byfleet.\nNational teaching school\nSJB was designated a teaching school in July 2011. There are currently ten members of staff seconded to other schools and under the leadership of Ani Magill, 16 senior leaders have become head teachers.\nAs a national teaching School they offer training and support to:\n* Play a greater role in training new entrants to the profession\n* Lead peer-to-peer professional and leadership development\n* Identify and develop leadership potential\n* Provide support for other schools\n* Designate and broker Specialist Leaders of Education (SLEs)\n* Engage in research and development\nIn conjunction with The Surrey Teaching Schools Network, SJB has been successful in securing the licence for leadership provision of the National College for School Leadership's programmes. As a teaching school, St John the Baptist School is responsible for the NPQH.\nAcademy\nPreviously a voluntary aided school administered by the Surrey County Council, St. John the Baptist School converted to academy status in September 2016. The school is now sponsored by the Xavier Catholic Education Trust.\nAcademics\nIn 2022/23, overall pupil absence at the school was 6.4%. This compares to 8% in the Surrey local authority, and 9% in England.\nIn 2010, the A Level results were 100% pass with 71% at A*-B.\nThe GCSE results were 97.4% of students achieved 5 or more GCSEs at grade C or above (89.4% including English and Maths). 51% of grades were A* and A putting the school at 128 in the Daily Mail rankings. However, this is a non-selective school so the comparisons may be questioned as many of the schools higher in the table select on ability.\nRecently the school had been given the 'Go Ahead' to create a new SEN classroom to educate 30 autistic students within the local area aged 11-16, this has been done due to the fact that there are no SEN classrooms in and around the area\nNotable former pupils\n* Claire Darke MBE, 161st Mayor of Wolverhampton\n* Sean Lock, English comedian\n* Ali-A, British Content Creator\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://w.sjb.school/ Official school website]"
