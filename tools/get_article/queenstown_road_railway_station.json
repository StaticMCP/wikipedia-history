It is a short walk from Battersea Park station and Battersea Park to the west. It has three platforms, two of which are in use by all stopping services related to the Waterloo to Reading Line: its branch services to Weybridge (via Hounslow) and two separate sets of bidirectional Waterloo-to-Waterloo services via Hounslow using the Hounslow Loop and via Kingston using the Kingston Loop.  In addition, 50% of maximum peak hour trains serving the Shepperton branch line call at the station.\nHistory\nThe station was opened on 1 November 1877, by the London and South Western Railway, as Queen's Road (Battersea). The entrance still bears the name 'Queen's Road''', not to be confused with Queens Road Peckham, Walthamstow Queen's Road or Queensway Underground station, which was also originally called Queens Road.\nQueen's Road was also the name of the road in which the station is located. Named after Queen Victoria, after the Second World War the street's name was changed to Queenstown Road. The station was renamed Queenstown Road (Battersea), to go with the road, on 12 May 1980. The station's modern entrance and platform signage lacks the \"(Battersea)\" suffix that appears in timetables and on some maps. The latest \"Oyster Rail Services\" map produced by Transport for London shows the station as plain \"Queenstown Road\". On the map produced by the station managers, South Western Railway, the station is called \"Queenstown Road\".\nThe station is Grade II listed.\nServices\nAll services at Queenstown Road are operated by South Western Railway.\nThe typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:\n* 4 tph to London Waterloo\n* 2 tph to  via , returning to London Waterloo via  and\n* 2 tph to  via\nAdditional services call at the station during the peak hours.\n|next=|route=South Western Railway  |col= }}\nConnections\nLondon Buses routes 137, 156, 452 and night route N137 serve the station.\nFuture\nNetwork Rail plans to reopen Platform 1 at Queenstown Road to permit the segregation of Windsor and Mainline services flows, providing additional capacity on the approach to London Waterloo.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
