Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), ratified the convention on 12 October 1988. Five sites, all cultural, were inscribed at the 14th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, held in Banff, Alberta, Canada, in 1990. The Soviet Union collapsed a year later and management of all the sites are continued by the successor states: three in Russia, and one each in Ukraine and Uzbekistan.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. \"SSR\" stands for Soviet Socialist Republic, whereas \"SFSR\" stands for Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:180px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Kiev: Saint-Sophia Cathedral and Related Monastic Buildings, Kiev-Pechersk Lavra\n|\n| Kiev, Ukrainian SSR\n| 1990\n| 527; i, ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n| The Saint-Sophia Cathedral was constructed in the 11th century, soon after the Christianization of Kievan Rus'.
