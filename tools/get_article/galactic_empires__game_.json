      "text": "# Galactic Empires (game)\n\nGalactic Empires is a space-based open-end, play-by-mail (PBM) wargame.\nHistory and development\nGalactic Empires was a computer moderated. open-ended, space-based, science fiction play-by-mail wargame of medium complexity published by Pierce Enterprises and later by Wy'East Games. The game launched in 1979 and was \"well established\" by 1984. By 1986, some of the empires were \"massive\". Turns had no time limit, enabling overseas players as well. The game designer was Dan Pierce, who attempted to improve on Starweb. By 1985, the publisher had moved the game system from a \"TRS 80-1 to a Tandy 1200 HD\" for speed and expansion purposes. Dan eventually lost interest in the game, so his brother David took over for many year. In the Mid-90's Mark Wardell, Wy'East Games, took over first under a licensing agreement and later purchasing the game outright.\nGameplay\nGameplay shared similarities with Starweb. Four empires types were available: \"Empire Builder, Star Merchant, Xenophobe, [and] Pirate\". Players choose between four character types. Available elements include \"ships, ground based military equipment, economic components, etc.\", providing gameplay options for players.\nReception\nDave Weidner reviewed the game in a 1986 issue of Flagship. He gave it a generally positive review, stating that \"In all, Galactic Empires is a game that is simple enough for a novice, while still\nchallenging enough for the most advanced player, at a reasonable cost\".\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
