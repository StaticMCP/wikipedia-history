Located north of Winchester in far northern Clark County, the site is part of a group of Indian mounds lining Stoner Creek, although by far the largest of the group.  The mound has frequently attracted attention from mapmakers and other surveyors, due to its large size; it was measured at  (circumference) and  (height) by an 1884 survey, which pronounced it a \"romantic sight\" due to its hilltop location between Stoner Creek and Pretty Run.  The surveyors suggested that its linear shape with a central depression might have been the result of erosion or of the construction of multiple mounds that were later merged into one.  It lies approximately  west of the rest of the group, which occupies the summit of a narrow ridgeline known as the \"Devil's Backbone.\"  Digging at these mounds, which were seemingly related to Mound Hill, produced artifacts such as pottery and a pipe, as well as numerous stone box graves.\nIn 1978, Mound Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  One of several Clark County archaeological sites on the Register, it was deemed to encompass an area of  for preservation purposes.  It is believed to have been built by peoples of the Adena culture.\nReferences"
