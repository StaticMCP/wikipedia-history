The regiment was first formed in 1915 as the 75th (Mississauga) Battalion, CEF, and was later reorganized several times before being officially designated as The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's Own).\nThe regiment's current mission task is to provide direct fire support (DFS). Members of the regiment are trained in the tactical and strategic employment of various company-level heavy weapon systems, including the Browning M2 heavy machine gun (HMG), the C16 Automatic Grenade Launcher System (AGLS), and the BGM-71 tube-launched optically-tracked wire-guided (TOW) antitank guided missile (ATGM) to provide DFS to a manoeuvring battle group.\nAs a Primary Reserve infantry regiment, The Toronto Scottish Regiment augments 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment in Petawawa, Ontario, by providing DFS on exercises and operations.\nHistory\nThe First World War\nThe 75th (Mississauga) Battalion, the predecessor to The Toronto Scottish Regiment was raised on July 1, 1915, by Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Beckett. Within three weeks more than 1,500 personnel had been recruited. On 29 March 1916 the battalion was fully trained and sailed for Liverpool. Over 5,500 soldiers served in the battalion during the First World War, of whom 1,049 were killed, including Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Beckett. The 75th Battalion CEF was awarded 16 battle honours, and Captain Bellenden Hutcheson, the medical officer, was awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1921 the regiment was renamed The Toronto Scottish Regiment by the commanding officer of the day, Lieutenant-Colonel Colin Harbottle, CMG, DSO, VD.\nThe 84th Battalion, CEF was authorized on 10 July 1915 and embarked for Great Britain on 18 June 1916. There, on 30 June 1916, its personnel were absorbed by the 73rd Battalion (Royal Highlanders of Canada), CEF, 75th Battalion (Mississauga), CEF and other units of the 4th Canadian Division, to provide reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field. The battalion disbanded on 11 April 1918.\nFile:75th Bn CEF.svg|The Great War distinguishing patch of the 75th Battalion (Mississauga), CEF.\nThe Second World War\nDuring the Second World War, the regiment initially mobilized a machine gun battalion for the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. Following a reorganization early in 1940, the battalion was reassigned to the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, where it operated as a support battalion, providing machine-gun detachments for the Operation Jubilee force at Dieppe in 1942, and then with an additional company of mortars, it operated in support of the rifle battalions of the 2nd Division in northwest Europe from July 1944 to VE Day. In April 1940, the 1st Battalion also mounted the King's Guard at Buckingham Palace. The 2nd Battalion served in the reserve army in Canada.\nDuring the Second World War, the Regiment mobilized as The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Machine Gun), CASF for active service on 1 September 1939. It was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Machine Gun), CASF on 7 November 1940; as the 2nd Infantry Division Support Battalion (The Toronto Scottish Regiment), CIC, CASF on 1 May 1943; and as the 1st Battalion, The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Machine Gun), CIC, CASF on 24 February 1944. On 7 December 1939, it embarked for Great Britain. In April 1940, the 1st Battalion also mounted the King's Guard at Buckingham Palace. The 2nd Battalion served in the reserve army in Canada. The battalion took part in Operation Jubilee on 19 August 1942. It landed again in France on 6 and 7 July 1944, as part of the 2nd Infantry Division. The battalion continued to fight in North-West Europe until the end of the war. The overseas battalion disbanded on 31 December 1945.\nFile:Torontoscottishkingsguard.jpg|The Toronto Scottish mount the King's Guard in London, 1940\nPost War to the Present Day\nIn 2000, the regiment added a secondary title in recognition of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's long association as colonel-in-chief. She had held the position since 1938. The regiment was now referred to as \"The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's Own).\" The regiment was part of the escort at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 2002. The regimental tartan is Hodden Grey.\nOn September 12, 2009, the regimental headquarters, A Company and Administration Company moved to the Captain Bellenden Seymour Hutcheson VC Armoury, which is shared with the Toronto Police Service. The armoury is a green building, earning a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDS) silver rating. On May 8, 2012, 75th Company moved from its previous location in Mississauga to a new shared government facility, The Garry W. Morden Centre, with the City of Mississauga Emergency Training Services.\nThe regiment contributed an aggregate of more than 20% of its authorized strength to the various Task Forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014. On 26 October 2015 the Afghanistan battle honour was presented to the regiment and added to the regimental colour by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.\nFile:Presentation of Colours March Past TSR.JPG|Toronto Scottish Regiment Presentation of Colours March Past\nFile:Presentation of Colours March Off TSR.JPG|Toronto Scottish Regiment Presentation of Colours March Off\nOn 31 March 2025, The Regiment appointed Lieutenant-Colonel A.M. Lockhart C.D as their commanding officer, taking over command of The Regiment from Lieutenant-Colonel R.J.C. Kearney C.D.
