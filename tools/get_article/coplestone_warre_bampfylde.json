They are now listed Grade 1 on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.\nIn November 1758, during the Seven Years' War, he was commissioned as major of the 1st Somerset Militia, which was embodied for fulltime service in home defence on 3 July 1759. The regiment served in the Plymouth defences, and Bampfylde was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in December 1761 on the resignation of Lord North. The regiment was disembodied on 31 December 1762 as the war drew to a close. He was appointed as Colonel of the Regiment on 2 June 1797.\n's collection (3/1953/1)]]\nBampfylde was a notable amateur painter, and exhibited his works at the Society of Artists, the Free Society of Artists, and the Royal Academy between 1763 and 1783. He made a few etchings of landscapes, and drew some humorous illustrations for Christopher Anstey's Election Ball which were etched by William Hassel, and published at Bath in 1776. He also designed the Market House in Taunton in 1772.\nHe died at Hestercombe on 29 August 1791 and was buried in the Warre family tomb at St Mary's Church, Kingston. He had married Mary Knight (died 1806), daughter of Edward Knight, a Worcestershire ironmaster. They had no children and Hestercombe was left to his nephew, John Tyndale.\nThere are paintings by Bampfylde in the collections of National Trust, The UK Government and Exeter University.\nReferences\n;Attribution"
