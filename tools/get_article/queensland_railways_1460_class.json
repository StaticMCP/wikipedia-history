Five were fitted with dynamic braking for descending the Haughton Range from Charters Towers to Townsville on the Great Northern Railway (Mt Isa line). They operated services along the North Coast line.\nThe first was withdrawn in December 1986. 1492 being the first withdrawn, only after a level crossing accident in Townsville. In 1995, 21 were sold to New Zealand Rail (later Tranz Rail) in New Zealand. Eighteen were overhauled at Hutt Workshops in Wellington, and placed in service with Tranz Rail as the DQ and QR classes or with the Australian Transport Network in Tasmania as the DQ2000 class. Four Tranz Rail DQs were exported to South Africa in 2013.\n1461 has been preserved by Queensland Rail's Heritage Division and stored at Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich.\nClass register\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
