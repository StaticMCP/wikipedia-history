In the , the locality of Charleville had a population of 2,992.\nGeography\nLocated in southwestern Queensland, Australia, Charleville is the terminus for the Warrego Highway, which stretches  from Brisbane and is situated:\n* 89 kilometres (55 miles) west of Morven\n* 135 kilometres (83 miles) west of Mungallala\n* 178 kilometres (111 miles) west of Mitchell\n* 203 kilometres (126 miles) west of Amby\n* 226 kilometres (140 miles) west of Muckadilla\n*  west of Roma\n*  west of Miles\n* 454 kilometres (282 miles) west of Chinchilla\n*  west of Dalby\n* 591 kilometres (367 miles) west of Oakey\n*  west of Toowoomba\n*  west of Brisbane\nIt is the largest town and administrative centre of the Shire of Murweh, which covers an area of 43,905 square kilometres. Charleville is situated on the banks of the Warrego River.\nThe Mitchell Highway also connects Charleville with:\n* Augathella –  north\n* Wyandra –  south\n* Cunnamulla –  south\n* Bourke –  south\n* Dubbo –  south\n* Sydney –  south-east via Great Western Highway\nHistory\nBidjara (also known as Bidyara, Pitjara, and Peechara) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bidjara people. The Bidjara language region includes the local government areas of the Shire of Murweh, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall as well as the properties of Nive Downs and Mount Tabor.\nGungabula (also known as Kongabula and Khungabula) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the headwaters of the Dawson River in Central Queensland. The language region includes areas within the local government area of Maranoa Region, particularly the towns of Charleville, Augathella and Blackall and as well as the Carnarvon Range.\nThe first European exploration of the area, which was Kunja tribal land, was conducted by Edmund Kennedy in 1847.\nGowrie Station had been established around the Gowrie Crossing, a ford across the Warrego River () along a natural stock route, for the grazing of sheep and cattle.\nThe town was gazetted on 11 January 1865. It was situated near Gowrie's Crossing, a permanent waterhole, now on the outskirts of the modern town. It was planned with very wide streets to enable bullock teams of up to 14 pairs to turn with their wagons. It was William Alcock Tully, who was Commissioner of Crown Lands in the Warrego District from 1863 to 1864 and would later serve as Surveyor General of Queensland from 1875 to 1889, who laid out the town's streets. An Irishman, Tully probably named the town after the town of Charleville, County Cork, Ireland.\nA hotel was built in 1865. Charleville Post Office opened on 1 August 1865 and a town began to grow to service the region. Members of the Roma-based Skinner family established a store in the town in 1872 that became known as the Warrego Stores and Edward and Margot Kelly ran the Charleville Hotel together from 1928.\nIn September 1875, the Queensland Government called for tenders to erect a courthouse in Charleville. The foundation stone (actually a bloodwood block) was laid on 23 November 1875. By January 1876, the courthouse was almost finished.\nIn December 1884, the Queensland Government called for tenders to erect a hospital in Charleville. In March 1885 the contract was awarded to Richards and King for  £2,265 10s. In November 1885, a hospital ball was held in the new hospital building, suggesting it was completed and opened around that time.\nCobb and Co, the legendary Australian stagecoach company, established a coach building business in the town in 1886. however, the railway arrived in 1888, beginning the long demise of coach transport in the area. Charleville railway station opened on 1 March 1888 and was the terminus for the Western railway line until the line was extended south to Cunnamulla in 1898. Facilities included a locomotive depot, cattle and sheep yards, a 50-ton weighbridge, a booking and telegraph offices, goods shed, stationmaster's house, and guards, enginemen and firemen's cottages. Apart from the railway station in Charleville, there were also two now-abandoned railway sidings:\n* Dalgety's Siding railway siding ()\n* Glenroy Scour Siding ()\nCharleville railway station is a railway station used by Queensland Rail and a passenger stop for the intercity bus services operated by Greyhound Australia.\nIn July 1886 the Anglican residents of the town decided to erect a church. All Saint's Anglican Church was opened on by Rev. B. R. Wilson on 20 November 1887. It was designed by diocesan architect John Hingestone Buckeridge and built by Mr Wood. It was dedicated in 1897. The foundation stone for the present church was laid in September 1957 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. The new church was dedicated in 1958 and consecrated in 1967.\nIn 1902 Charleville was the location of an unsuccessful attempt by Clement Lindley Wragge to fire cannons into the clouds in order to break a drought. The cannons used remain on display in Charleville today.\nSt Mary's Catholic Primary School was opened on 26 January 1913 by the Sisters of Mercy with 108 students. By the 1950s, there were over 400 students with a dozen sisters teaching at the school. During the 1960s and 1970s, the school also offered secondary education. The school suffered extensive damage during the April 1990 flood which devastated Charleville.\nIn 1922, Qantas established an airmail service between Charleville and Cloncurry. At the same time, this was Qantas's first regularly scheduled route and the second scheduled air route in Australia.\nOn 9 October 1924, the Charleville War Memorial was unveiled by Sir Matthew Nathan, the Governor of Queensland.\nThe Anglican Chapel of the Holy Angels Hostels was consecrated circa 1929. It closed circa 1984.\nCharleville was also one of the compulsory stopover/check points during the London to Melbourne MacRobertson Air Race in 1934. The winners of the great race were Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott. Their triumph was reported in Time magazine as:\n\"Scott and Black, keeping up their sensational pace, flashed into Charleville, refueled, sped toward the finish where waiting thousands cheered their progress, reported over loudspeakers. With one motor dead, with only two hours sleep since leaving England, the Britons triumphantly set their scarlet torpedo down in Melbourne at 3:34 p.m. In 71 hr. 1 min. 3 sec. – Just under three days – they had flown halfway around the world.\"\nProximity to the Warrego River has been problematic. Charleville was hit by flooding in 1971 caused by a rain depression that was formed from the remnants of Cyclone Althea.\nIn April 1990, major floods hit western Queensland, with Charleville being badly affected. Floodwaters peaked at 8.54 metres, over 1,000 homes were inundated, and almost 3,000 people evacuated. Charleville State School and St Mary's School both suffered extensive damage during the April 1990 floods which devastated Charleville.\nThe district suffered flooding again in 1997, 2008 and March 2010. Flooding also occurred in February 2012.\nA levee was built by the Murweh Shire Council, which was completed in 2009, which protected the town during the 2012 floods (although the floodwater rose close to the top of the levee), but there was still significant flooding in the wider area. In 2013, a diversion and levee system was built to also protect the town from flooding in Bradley’s Gully.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Charleville had a population of 3,335 people.
