It was awarded for a published collection by an Australian poet.\nHistory\nThe ACT Poetry Award for unpublished poets was awarded in 2003 and 2004 by the ACT Government. From 2005 to 2011, there were four prizes awarded: the Rosemary Dobson Award, the David Campbell Award, the Judith Wright Award and the Alec Bolton Award.\nIn 2012, the Government reviewed the ACT Poetry Prize, and developed three new initiatives: the ACT Poetry Prize for a single poem, a Centenary Poetry in ACTION program and Youth Poetry Slams, to begin in ACT schools in 2013.
