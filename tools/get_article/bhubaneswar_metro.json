In the first phase, a  metro trunk route will be created from SCB Medical College in Cuttack to the Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar.\nHistory\nOn 27-July-2010, the state transport department said that it had asked  Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to conduct a survey on the possibility of connecting Bhubaneswar and Cuttack by metro rail. On 08-January-2013, E. Sreedharan, principal advisor of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said that a metro rail was unsuitable for Bhubaneswar, because it was more suited for cities with more than 2 million in population. He suggested that Bhubaneswar should invest in bus rapid transit system or high speed tramway system instead. Subhash Singh, then conveyor of Cuttack Banchao Committee, wrote multiple petitions on the same and urged the authorities to reconsider the same keeping in mind population growth in next 50 years. Mr.Singh said \" Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri are emerging cities with great potential to become the center of health, sport, manufacturing, technology and tourism in eastern India. Metro project to connect these cities will boost the economic activities of the region and further more will be instrumental in overall socio-economic development of the state\".\nOn 09-January-2013, Engineering Projects India Ltd. gave a proposal to the state government about a monorail project between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. On 23-August-2014, the state government signed a contract with Balaji Railroad Systems Ltd. (BARSYL) for preparation of a detailed project report for a mass rapid transit system (MRTS) between Bhubaneswar and Cuttack covering 30&nbsp;km. BARSYL would get  crore for preparation of the plan to be submitted in ten months.\nIn January 2013, E. Sreedharan stated that Bhubaneswar is not ready yet for metro rail citing its low population. Orissa Chief Secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi stated in February 2017 that there was no immediate feasibility for a metro rail system in Bhubaneswar, and a bus rapid transit system would be developed instead.\nIn January 2018, Odisha CM demanded for Metro rail connectivity between Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. also in June 2019, Governor of Odisha said that the state government will attempt to connect the heritage silver city of Cuttack with smart city Bhubaneswar by Metro train.\nIn April 2023, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik approved the proposal for the metro train service between Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Khordha, and Puri. Odisha CM directed the Housing and Urban Development Department to complete the DPR on a war-footing for the project, which is entirely funded by the Government of Odisha.\nIn August 2023, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation was engaged with the responsibility of preparing the DPR. After conducting traffic survey, geo-technical investigation, topo-graphic survey, environmental & social impact assessments, DMRC completed the DPR preparation and submitted to Odisha Chief Secretary Pradeep Kumar Jena.\nRoute network\nPhase 1\nIn Phase 1, 20 metro stations may or may not be built on the Line 1 from Trisulia to Biju Patnaik Airport, including Capital Hospital, Sishu Bhawan, Bapuji Nagar, Bhubaneswar Railway Station, Ram Mandir Square, Vani Vihar, Acharya Vihar Square, Jaydev Vihar Square, Xavier Square, Rail Sadan, District Centre, Damana Square, Patia Square, KIIT Square, Nandan Vihar, Raghunathpur, Nandankanan Zoological Park, Barang Station and Phulapokhari. which would be further extended to Cuttack Netaji Bus Terminal in future expansion.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%;margin:auto;text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#ADD8E6;\" |Phase 1 Network\n|-\n!|No.\n!|Line Name\n!Stations\n!Length(km)\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" |Terminals\n!Opening Date\n|-\n| text-align:center;\" |1\n| text-align:center;\" |Line 1\n| text-align:center;\" |20\n| text-align:center;\" |\n|Trisulia (Cuttack)\n|Biju Patnaik Airport\n| text-align:center;\" |2027\n|}\nTimeline\n* April 2023: Metro project announced for Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Khordha, and Puri.
