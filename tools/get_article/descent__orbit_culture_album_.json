It was released on 18 August 2023, via Seek & Strike Records in LP, CD and digital formats. Frontman Niklas Karlsson stated that Descent was meant to be \"a live-friendly album, but in the end it turned out to be this big-ass darker monster,\" referring to its balance of light and dark elements. \"That's what we're pushing for: the highest mountain to the lowest abyss.\" The album was well-received by critics and audiences, receiving praise and favorable ratings from reviewers. Two songs from the album's recording sessions were later released as part of an EP titled The Forgotten, released later that year.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nOrbit Culture\n* Niklas Karlsson – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, production, mixing, mastering, engineering\n* Richard Hansson – lead guitar\n* Fredrik Lennartsson – bass guitar\n* Christopher Wallerstedt – drums\nAdditional contributor\n* Max Wellaston – artwork\nReferences"
