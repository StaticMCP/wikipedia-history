Schooled at Reigate, he was interested in natural history like his siblings. He joined the business of his father at Lloyds Bank, studying entomology in his spare time. His earliest publication was Coleoptera  at  Lowestoft in the first volume of the Entomologists’  Monthly  Magazine when he was sixteen years old. He would later become an editor of the Magazine.  His Catalogus Buprestidarum of 1871 was \"a work whose importance was immediately recognised, and which has ever since remained a classic. In order to render the synonymies ... as reliable as possible, he undertook the only foreign tour of his life, visiting in succession all the chief museums of Europe and examining personally the types\".\nSaunders was a Fellow of the Entomological Society, the Linnean Society and the Royal Society (FRS, June 1902).  Saunders lived at Reigate, Wandsworth, and Bromley, and settled in Woking  in 1887.  He married Mary Agnes Brown in 1872 and eight of their twelve children lived beyond him. He died at Bognor on 6 February 1910, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery.\nFamily\nIn 1872, Saunders married Mary Agnes Brown; they had eight sons and four daughters.\nWorks\nSaunders published, with scientific papers in entomological journals:\n*1871 Catalogus Buprestidarum synonymicus et systematicus Janson, London.\n*1892 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/12459 The Hemiptera Heteroptera of the British Islands]London.\n*1896, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/10494#/summary The Hymenoptera Aculeata of the British Isles]'' London.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/search?searchTerm=Edward+Saunders#/titles Edward Saunders titles at BHL]\n*\n*\n*"
