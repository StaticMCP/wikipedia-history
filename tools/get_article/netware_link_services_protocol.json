NLSP enables NetWare servers to exchange routing and service information without the high broadcast overhead generated by Routing Information Protocol and Service Advertising Protocol.  Instead of periodically retransmitting its information every few minutes like RIP and SAP, NLSP only transmits every two hours, or when there is a change in a route or service, making it much more suitable for use over a wide area network.\nSee also\n*IS-IS\n*Routing Information Protocol\n*Service Advertising Protocol\n*NetWare\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/ana19940505.html NetWare Link Services Protocol: Link-State Routing in a NetWare Environment]\n*[http://docwiki.cisco.com/wiki/NetWare_Link-Services_Protocol NetWare Link-Services Protocol]\n*[https://routingfreak.wordpress.com/tag/ipx/ Tag Archives: IPX]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130423101101/http://defoenet.com/ccna/osi_l3.htm The Network Layer - Layer 3]"
