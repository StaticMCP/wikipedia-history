The musical group founded on the eastern border, in the Tunisian city of Melag. Following the signing of the Évian Accords, the music group moved to the city of Constantine. In 1963, after being transferred to \"L'Ecole des Cadets de la Révolution à Koléa\", certain elements continued their studies, while others joined the National Radio Orchestra. After the cease-fire, the military band formed its first services in a large parade of the NLA in Oujda in honor of the members of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. In January 1963, this formation was moved to the Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense, where it provided music training for the benefit of elements of the Armed Forces The first class, made up of 160 elements, was formed, in record time, in military music.
