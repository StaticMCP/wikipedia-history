The winners across different categories are voted on by the FAAAF's membership and awarded a statuette called the \"Black Reel Award\".\nThe ceremony was spun-off from the Black Reel Awards through an announcement on June 5, 2017. The annual BRAs were first presented on February 16, 2000, to honor merit across both film and television. The first TV BRAs were held on August 5, 2017, as the Black Reel Awards for Television, before adopting its current name in 2021.
