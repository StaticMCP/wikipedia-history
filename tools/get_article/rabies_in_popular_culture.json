Due to the long history of the virus as well as its neurotropic nature, rabies has been a potent symbol of madness, irrationalism, or an unstoppable plague in numerous fictional works, in many genres. Many notable examples are listed below.\nExamples\nIn films\n(Chronological, then alphabetical within years)\n* The Lighthouse Keepers (1929), a film directed by Jean Grémillon, based on a play\n* Rabies (1958), a film directed by Ingmar Bergman\n* In the classic film Rage (1966), starring Glenn Ford and Stella Stevens, a doctor in rural Mexico is infected with rabies and desperately struggles to return to civilization and seek treatment. A major scene in the film shows a rabid man exhibiting symptoms being restrained by locals.\n* I Drink Your Blood (1970; also known as Hydro-Phobia) is a cult horror film about a gang of Satanic hippies who get infected with rabies.\n* In the horror film Rabid (1977) starring Marilyn Chambers, a critically injured woman receives plastic surgery that treats some of her intact tissue to become morphogenetically neutral, in hopes that tissue grafts to fire-damaged areas of her body will differentiate and replace the damaged skin and organs. Instead, the woman becomes a parasitic monster whose victims transform into rabid zombies whose bites spread the disease.\n* Desperate Living (1977), a dark comedy film directed by John Waters. Set in a fictional slum of 1970s Baltimore, the film ends with Queen Carlotta (Edith Massey) infecting all her denizens with rabies. She is, however, overthrown.

The virus exhibits similar features to rabies, with discoloration of the eyes, unpredictable behavior, the urge to bite, and the spread of the virus through saliva.  While the behaviour of the infected characters in the film was modeled after the effects of advanced rabies in humans, the comic book 28 Days Later: The Aftermath states that the virus is, in fact, a carrier of ebola mixed with a calming agent that went rogue.\n* [●REC] (2007), is a zombie horror film in which an apartment building is quarantined after the breakout of an unknown virus (a strain of rabies).\n* In Quarantine (2008), a Hollywood remake of the Spanish horror movie REC about a mutated variation of rabies, an apartment building is quarantined after an outbreak of an unknown virus.
