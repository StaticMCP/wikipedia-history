Unlike the Schwarzlose M1908, the Davis-Warner guns are fairly conventional, striker-fired, blowbacks, using a breechblock rather than a slide, though, since Browning had patented the idea of an auto pistol slide with an integral breechblock.\nThey had one serious drawback. At the back of the guns, there is a small lever and a push-through pin. If the shooter disassembled the pistol and forgot to turn the lever the right way or forgot to push the pin all the way in, the breechblock would be stopped only by a small projection, and could come back in his face. The guns were not \"infallible,\" and the company soon went out of business.\nReferences\n* [http://www.thefirearmsforum.com/showthread.php?t=2644 Infallible 32ACP Pistol thread]  at TheFirearmsForum.com\n* [http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/EveryGun/GunMfgDetail.aspx?id=265 Davis Warner Arms Corp]  at Cheaper Than Dirt"
