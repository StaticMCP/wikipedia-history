If the maintainer stops doing their work on the project, then the development of the project stops. If another person not associated with the maintainer releases a new version of the project, it is said that a fork has been created. So for example happened with uClibc.\nMaintainers often cryptographically sign binaries so that people can verify their authenticity.\nSee also\n*Software maintenance\n*Software developer\n*Code review\n*List of software package management systems\nReferences\nfi:Ylläpitäjä"
