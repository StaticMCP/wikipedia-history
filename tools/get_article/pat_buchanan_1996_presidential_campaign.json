He lost the nomination to Bob Dole, who lost the general election.\nBuchanan had run for the nomination in 1992, but lost to George H.W. Bush. After the 1996 election, Buchanan associated with the Reform Party, and successfully became that party's nomination for the 2000 presidential election; he again lost the general election.\nBackground\nPat Buchanan was an aide to presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan. Meanwhile, he became an author and political commentator on TV and radio. He was a \"harsh critic\" of President George H.W. Bush during his term, and in 1992, Buchanan ran for the Republican nomination in the 1992 presidential election, against him. Bush ultimately won the nomination. Buchanan received 23% of the primary vote.\nCampaign\nPat Buchanan announced his campaign in February 1995. The Christian Science Monitor wrote that he \"has highlighted an ideological schism within the GOP at a time when the party would rather be closing ranks to defeat President Clinton.\" He used \"blunt, memorable\" populist and nativist language and divided the right wing, especially because of his opposition to free trade economic policies like NAFTA which many conservatives supported. Britannica writes: \"Buchanan criticized U.S. attempts to broker peace in the world and what he saw as the undue influence of Israel on U.S. foreign policy. He advocated [for] a temporary moratorium on immigration. He decried the feminist and homosexual rights movements and was adamantly opposed to abortion. He denounced as futile Republican attempts to win elections by moving toward the middle of the political spectrum.\" He also wanted the U.S. stop giving foreign countries aid and take American soldiers out of Bosnia, saying American troops should be sent to the U.S.-Mexico border instead.\nAfter being compared ideologically to Ku Klux Klan member David Duke, Buchanan disavowed Duke and removed a campaign adviser who had ties to him.\nBuchanan made opposition to concentrated animal feeding operations and intensive pig farming a central theme of his campaign in Iowa, citing opposition by Iowa family farmers. He placed second in the Iowa caucus, receiving 23% of the vote and establishing himself as a serious challenger to frontrunner Bob Dole.\nBuchanan won the New Hampshire primary, receiving 27% of the vote, compared to Dole at 26% and former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander at 23%. Buchanan had difficulty later on. He continued his campaign until August 1996, and did not endorse Bob Dole, who won the nomination but later lost the general election. He encouraged his supporters not to leave the Republican Party.\nBuchanan received 20% of the primary vote or 3,184,943 votes and 4 states (Alaska, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Missouri).\nEndorsements\n* William P.
