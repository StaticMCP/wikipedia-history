The organisation was established as a Marxist alternative to Plaid Cymru, arising from frustration with that party's perceived failure to take a strong stance on Welsh independence and socialist principles.\nBackground and formation\nPolitical context\nThe WSRM emerged in the aftermath of the devastating defeat of Welsh devolution in the 1979 Welsh devolution referendum. On 1 March 1979 (St David's Day), the people of Wales rejected devolution by a ratio of almost 4 to 1, with only 20.3% voting in favour of the Wales Act 1978. This crushing defeat was seen by many Welsh nationalists as a catastrophic failure, compounded by the Conservative victory in the 1979 general election under Margaret Thatcher, which brought threats to Wales's steel and coal industries.\nFounding and early development\nThe WSRM was founded by former Plaid Cymru activists, most notably Robert Griffiths, who had served as Plaid Cymru's Research Officer, and Gareth Miles, a prominent Welsh-language author and activist. Griffiths's employment with Plaid Cymru was terminated amid suspicions that it was because the WSRM had criticised the party's failure to oppose the devolution referendum strongly enough.\nThe movement initially operated as a pressure group within Plaid Cymru before declaring a separate existence. The founding statement of the WSRM clearly expressed the intention of creating a revolutionary Marxist organisation, though it was described as having a heterodox ideological composition—less a centralist Leninist machine and more a radical collective of Welsh socialists.\nOrganisation and ideology\nPolitical philosophy\nThe WSRM combined Welsh nationalism with Marxist-Leninist ideology, arguing for a Welsh Socialist Republic. The organisation contained \"a variety of Marxisms\" ranging from non-aligned traditional Communist Party supporters to those aligned with the International Marxist Group and Maoist tendencies. This ideological diversity ultimately contributed to internal contradictions that weakened the movement.\nThe movement attracted attention from English-based leftist groups and expressed solidarity with the republican struggle in Northern Ireland, which later drew the attention of British security services.\nPublications\nThe WSRM initially continued the publication of  (The Red Flag), a newspaper originally started by Plaid Cymru activists to promote Welsh socialist republicanism. The publication was later replaced by Welsh Republic, which maintained a radical working-class orientation. The movement also produced pamphlets including \"Neil Kinnock and the Anti-Taffy League\" in 1979 and published \"For Socialism and National Liberation: Resolutions and Reports of the First Congress of the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement\" in 1981.\nPolice operations and arrests\nOperation Fire\nBetween October 1979 and September 1980, a series of police raids targeted left-wing and nationalist activists across Wales as part of \"Operation Fire\" (), ostensibly aimed at finding those responsible for the Meibion Glyndŵr arson campaign against English-owned holiday homes. In March 1980, WSRM activists and 30 members of Cofiwn were arrested, with masses of political material confiscated in the search for suspected arsonists.\nThe police operation also included arrests of Sinn Féin members who were subsequently charged with offences unrelated to the Welsh arson campaign. The WSRM's public support for the republican struggle in Northern Ireland had raised alarm bells with the authorities.\nThe conspiracy trial\nIn May 1982, five people connected to the WSRM were arrested on charges related to explosives allegedly intended for use during the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Wales in October 1981. The charges included:\n* Nicholas Hodges and Adrian Stone – charged with intent to cause explosions at British Steel's premises in Gabalfa, Cardiff\n* Gareth Westacott and David Burns – charged with similar offences relating to an army recruiting office in Pontypridd\nThe subsequent conspiracy trial took place in Cardiff between September and November 1983. Eight defendants were accused of conspiracy to cause explosions between March 1980 and March 1982. Of these, one failed to surrender to bail, one was acquitted with the agreement of the prosecution, one pleaded guilty to possession of detonators, one was found guilty by the jury of possession of detonators, and four were entirely acquitted by the jury of all charges against them.\nMany WSRM members spent 11 months on remand only to be released when found innocent of any violent actions.\nWelsh Political Prisoners' Defence Campaign\nA support organisation called the Welsh Political Prisoners' Defence Campaign was established in May 1982 to coordinate defence strategy and publicise the circumstances of police involvement in the arrests. The campaign argued that the prosecutions represented political policing and harassment of legitimate political activists.\nDissolution and aftermath\nCollapse of the movement\nThe experience of arrests, pre-trial detention, police interviews, and surveillance severely damaged the cohesion of the WSRM, which failed to survive the disruption. The combination of state pressure and internal ideological contradictions led to the movement's dissolution around 1982.\nSuccessor organisations and dispersal\nAfter the WSRM's collapse, its members dispersed in several directions. Around half a dozen members, including founding figures Gareth Miles and Robert Griffiths, joined what became the Communist Party of Britain. Some members returned to Plaid Cymru, whilst others became active in single-issue campaign movements. The socialist remnants published a few more copies of  before reforming in 1986 to create Cymru Goch (Red Wales), a small socialist political party that lasted another 20 years and continued publishing  until 2003.\nHistorical assessments\nJohn Osmond, founder of the Institute of Welsh Affairs, wrote a detailed account of the conspiracy trial in his book Police Conspiracy? (1984), which examined the police investigation methods and raised questions about political policing in Wales. The book was not without controversy, with some defendants criticising Osmond's account.\nA public enquiry into \"Political policing in Wales\" was held at South Glamorgan County Council headquarters in March 1984, organised by the Welsh Campaign for Civil and Political Liberties in the aftermath of the conspiracy trial.\nModern assessments suggest that while the WSRM represented \"the best of the so-called Welsh Republicanism failures,\" it was ultimately \"shut down by the state in 1982\" through police operations and prosecutions that disrupted its organisation beyond recovery.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*  (Originally published by Victor Gollancz, 1971)\n* \"Political policing in Wales\" – Welsh Campaign for Civil and Political Liberties (1984)"
