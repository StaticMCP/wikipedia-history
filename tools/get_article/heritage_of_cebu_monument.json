It was made by Filipino sculptor Eduardo Castrillo and architects Heradio Español and Ildefonso Santos. It is the centerpiece of the Parian Park which was the site of the Saint John the Baptist Church which was demolished in 1875 by the Diocese of Cebu.\nThe artwork is a tableau depicting several of Cebu's involvement in Philippine history including the Battle of Mactan, inauguration of Sergio Osmeña as President of the Philippines, and the canonization of Pedro Calungsod as saint by the Roman Catholic Church. It consists of a mixture of concrete, bronze, brass and steel sculptures.\nReferences"
