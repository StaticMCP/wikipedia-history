      "text": "# Leena (Warehouse 13)\n\n}}\nLeena (Genelle Williams) is a fictional character on the U.S. television science fiction series, Warehouse 13 (2009–2014). She was the proprietor of '''Leena's Bed and Breakfast''', where the Warehouse Agents live. Leena has the ability to read a person's aura and sense their life force.\nCharacter history\nLeena is a fictional character from the television series Warehouse 13, portrayed by Genelle Williams. Throughout the series, Leena's personal history remains largely undisclosed, including her last name. However, it is suggested that she had a significant relationship with Mrs. Frederic (portrayed by C. C. H. Pounder), the caretaker of Warehouse 13.\nCharacter Development\nLeena's character is gradually revealed over the course of the series. In the Season 3 finale episode \"Stand,\" it is implied that she shares a long-standing connection with Mrs. Frederic. When threatened by Marcus Diamond, Leena is saved by Mrs. Frederic, who references a promise made to Leena years ago.\nRole within Warehouse 13\nLeena is introduced as an employee at Warehouse 13, primarily serving as a consultant. Her duties involve sensing the energies of artifacts and determining their appropriate storage locations within the warehouse. She also oversees the maintenance of certain artifacts to prevent them from causing disruptions. Leena possesses intimate knowledge of the warehouse's secrets, often assisting field agents in their missions.\nRelationships with Other Characters\nLeena's relationship with Artie Nielsen, the warehouse's caretaker, predates the arrival of Agents Myka Bering and Pete Lattimer. While the exact duration of their acquaintance is undisclosed, Leena mentions not being present during an event fifteen years prior involving Artie and his former partner, James MacPherson.\nInvolvement in Storylines\nIn the Season 1 finale episode \"MacPherson,\" Leena is briefly implicated in collaborating with James MacPherson, although it is later revealed that her actions were under MacPherson's control through an artifact. This incident results in residual effects, causing Leena to suffer from headaches and vertigo until the Regents intervene.\nIn Season 4, Leena tragically meets her demise during a confrontation with Artie, who is influenced by an artifact's evil. Despite efforts to save her, her death proves irreversible, leaving Artie burdened with guilt.\nLegacy\nLeena's character contributes to the emotional depth and narrative complexity of Warehouse 13, leaving a lasting impact on both the storyline and the characters she interacted with.\nSkills and abilities\nLeena is able to read or sense auras and energy forces. She can sense whether something is living or not. She uses her aura-reading abilities on new artifact arrivals at the Warehouse. Likewise, she apparently does this so that the energies of the artifacts do not react badly with each other and cause unwanted static build-up that could harm Warehouse agents. For example, when handling the arrival of the Honjo Masamune samurai sword, she wandered the aisles, looking for an appropriate location to store it, finally stopping at an apparently random spot and stating, \"This feels right.\" Leena's authority over artifact placement is further demonstrated when Artie, while contemplating where to store Edgar Allan Poe artifacts, states, \"We'll stick them in, yeah, Madrid section, that is if Leena agrees.\"\nHer aura-reading ability is also helpful in catching any potentially over-active objects that try to \"escape\" Warehouse confines, such as Harry Houdini's Wallet, which she sensed in the B&B and recovered from its hiding place under Myka's bed.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
