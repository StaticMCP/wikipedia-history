      "text": "# Court of Claims (United Kingdom)\n\nThe Court of Claims in the United Kingdom was a special court established after the accession of a sovereign to judge the validity of the claims of persons to perform certain honorary services at the coronation.\nThe first recorded such court was held in 1377 before the lord high steward. Since the time of Henry VII, commissioners were appointed in lieu, and the court thereafter consisted of a royal commission appointed under the Great Seal.\nThe court could refer any claim to the sovereign's pleasure, and the sovereign could withdraw a claim from the commission and transfer it to another tribunal.\nFor the 2023 coronation of Charles III and Camilla, a Coronation Claims Office in the Cabinet Office replaced the court.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second : minutes of the proceedings of the Court of claims (Crown Office, 1952)\n*Coronation Claims, Gerald Wollaston (London, 1910)\nExternal links\n* — Court of Claims 1910\n* — Court of Claims 1936"
