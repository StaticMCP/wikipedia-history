The expedition ended in failure.\nExpedition\nIn May 1516, Nuno Fernandes initiated a military expedition to punish the Moroccan tribe of Oulad Amrane, part of the tribal confederation of Doukkala, upon a request for help from the Oulad Motaa, vassals of the Portuguese Crown, who complained that the Oulad 'Amran had plundered their lands. Nuno Fernandes prepared an army of 450 Portuguese knights and 60 dismounted arquebusiers and took another 3,500 Moors from Garbia. The Portuguese, supported by the Abda and other Doukkala tribes, initially achieved success. They chased them all night and plundered the rebel base of Oulad 'Amran in the hills. On their return, they captured many women, children, and old people.\nThe Oulad 'Amran leader, Rahu ben Xamut, pursued the group with a hundred horsemen and shouted to the Moors, who were on the side of the Portuguese, inciting them to rebel against the Portuguese, who had done so much harm to them. Rahu attacked the vanguard, who were commanded by Nuno's son-of-law. Rahu approached him and killed him with a blow to the neck with a javelin. The allied tribes switched sides and joined forces with the Oulad Amrane. The Portuguese were subsequently massacred or captured by the Moroccans, including Nuno, and only a hundred men managed to escape. The Moors captured 35 Portuguese nobles, and Rahu took the prisoners to Marrakesh.\nReferences"
