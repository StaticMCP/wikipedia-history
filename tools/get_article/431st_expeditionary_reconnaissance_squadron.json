McClellan was the Air Force Logistics Command prime support depot for the F-111 and changes and modifications could be made there and tested by the detachment.\nThe 431st's mission was to test and evaluate Time Compliance Technical Order modifications to the F-111A/D/E and F models prior to those changes being released to operational F-111 tactical wings in the United States and Europe.  In addition was tasked with exploiting foreign technologies, and developing leading-edge tactics to improve the future combat capability of aerospace forces.
