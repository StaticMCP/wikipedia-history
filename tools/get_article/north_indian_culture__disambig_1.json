Around the 12th-century, Hindustani classical music diverged from what eventually came to be identified as Carnatic music of South India. The central notion in both these systems is that of a melodic mode or raga, sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala. Indian classical music has seven basic notes, Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni, with five interspersed half-notes, resulting in a 12-note scale. The rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called tala. The melodic foundations are called ragas. Noted representatives of Shastriya Sangeet with a worldwide acclaim are Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.\nMany different folk dance styles of North India include bhangra and giddha from Punjab, kathak in Uttar Pradesh, ghoomar and kalbelia from Rajasthan, nati from Himachal Pradesh, jagars and Pandva Nritya from Uttarakhand.\nKud dance of Jammu and Kashmir is the way to thank local deities in the night of rainy season with the beats of drum like instrument narsingha. Kathak is one of the eight Indian classical dance forms as conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi. This dance form traces its origins to the nomadic bards of ancient northern India, known as kathaks, or storytellers. Some believe it evolved from god Krishna's raas lilas, forms of which have also evolved into the popular garba-style dances popular in other parts of the region and Gujarat in western India. Raas lilas portrays the love stories of lord Krishna. A dance form which depicts the eternal love. It was quintessential theatre, using instrumental and vocal music along with stylized gestures, to enliven the stories.\nArchitecture and art\nis one of UNESCO world heritage sites in the region and regarded as one of the seven wonders of the world.]]\nOut of twenty-three cultural world heritage sites in India which have been declared by UNESCO, ten are in North India. The Taj Mahal, the quintessential Indo-Islamic architecture, is one of the seven wonders of the world. The Mahabodhi Temple complex at Bodh Gaya, Bihar built by Mauryan emperor Ashoka in 260 BC, marks the enlightenment of Buddha. Khajuraho temple and Buddhist monuments of Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh finds itself in the list of world heritage sites. Other renowned architectural and holy sites are the Golden Temple in Amritsar (Punjab), Urban and Architectural Work of Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, Dilwara Temples of Mount Abu(Rajasthan) to name a few. A different genre of paintings evolved in North India especially the miniature paintings. Rajput painting a style of Indian painting that evolved and flourished during the 18th-century, in the royal courts of Rajputana. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans.\nOne of the best-known examples of North Indian sculpture is the Lion Capital of Ashoka, Sarnath. It is the source for the national emblem of India and hints at the richness and grandeur of the ancient Mauryan Empire. The Rampurva bull capital is one of the best specimens of animal sculpture.\nTwo different schools of art namely the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art evolved in ancient times which represented the developments in sculptures, stucco, and clay as well as in mural paintings. The Kushana emperors, particularly Kanishka, encouraged the Gandhara artists to sculpture themes from Buddha's life and the Jatakas. The distinctive school of art which grew here is called the Gandhara school of art. A large number of the images of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas were produced. Mathura art, however, reached its peak during the Gupta period.  The human figure reached its most sublime representation in the Gupta classical phase when divine images, conceived and rendered in human shape, attained a superhuman aspect and manifested great spiritual import. The sculptures were marked by sharp and beautiful features, graceful and slim bodies, with many folds of transparent drapery and a new style of coiffure.\nLiterature\nawaits her lover in the forest.

Apart from these Sanskrit dramas, Pāṇini's Ashtadhyayi standardized Sanskrit grammar and phonetics and left an indelible mark on these aspects of Sanskrit.\nMedieval North India had great literary scholars like Tulsidas, Surdas, Chand Bardai, Amir Khusrauwhose works Ramcharitmanas, Sur Sagar, Prithiviraj Raso and Khamsa of Amir Khusrau respectively contributed to the richness of literature.

Other important writers of this period are Munshi Premchand, Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, Maithilisharan Gupt. Premchand's Hindi-Urdu works, such as Godaan and Gaban have been translated into various languages, and are known for their subtlety and depiction of human psychology and emotions.\nSee also\n*Culture of India\n*Culture of Jammu and Kashmir\n*Culture of Himachal Pradesh\n*Culture of Punjab, India\n*Culture of Chandigarh\n*Culture of Haryana\n*Culture of Uttarakhand\n*Culture of Delhi\n*Culture of Rajasthan\n*Culture of Uttar Pradesh\n*Culture of Madhya Pradesh\n*Culture of Chhattisgarh\nNotes\nReferences and bibliography\n* Flavours of India.
