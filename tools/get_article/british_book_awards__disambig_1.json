The awards have had several previous names, owners and sponsors since being launched in 1990, including the National Book Awards from 2010 to 2014.\nBook award history\nThe British Book Awards, or Nibbies, ran from 1990 to 2009 and were founded by the editor of Publishing News. The awards were then acquired by Agile Marketing, which renamed them the National Book Awards and called them the Galaxy National Book Awards (2010–2011) and later the Specsavers National Book Awards (2012–2014) after their headline sponsors.  There were no National Book Awards after 2014; in 2017 the awards were acquired by The Bookseller from the estate of Publishing News founder, Fred Newman, and renamed back to the British Book Awards or Nibbies.\nIn 2018, a Specsavers National Book Awards ceremony was held on 20 November but was unrelated to the Nibbies.\nIn 2005, The Bookseller launched a separate scheme, The Bookseller Retail Awards (winners not listed in this article). In 2010, running parallel to the National Book Awards, The Bookseller unified The Nibbies with its retail awards to produce The Bookseller Industry Awards (winners not listed in this article).\nThe awards are known as the Nibbies because of the golden nib-shaped trophy given to winners.\nName history\n* 1990–2009: British Book Awards\n* 2010–2011: Galaxy National Book Awards\n* 2012–2014: Specsavers National Book Awards\n* 2015–2016: no awards\n* 2017–Pres: British Book Awards\nAward winners (recent)\n2025 Books of the Year\nMargaret Atwood received the Freedom to Publish Award at the 35th British Book Awards on May 12, 2025, in London. In her videotaped acceptance comments, the Canadian author reflected on current threats to free expression, noting she couldn't remember a time \"when words themselves felt under such threat\" due to increasing political polarization, and urged publishers and booksellers to have courage in defending free expression.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n|+\nPresented: 12 May 2025 – Venue: Grosvenor House Hotel, London.\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Overall Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" | Author of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" | Illustrator of the year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Patriot by Alexei Navalny (Bodley Head)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Percival Everett\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Rob Biddulph\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Fiction Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" | Debut Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"33%\" | Crime and Thriller Book of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* James by Percival Everett (Mantle)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Butter by Asako Yuzuki, translated by Polly Barton (Fourth Estate)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Hunted by Abir Mukherjee (Harvill Secker)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Non-fiction: Narrative Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Non-fiction: Lifestyle and Illustrated\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Page-turner of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Patriot by Alexei Navalny (Bodley Head)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* What I Ate in One Year by Stanley Tucci (Fig Tree)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Faebound by Saara El-Arifi (Piatkus, Little, Brown Book Group)'\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Children's Fiction Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Children's Non-fiction Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" |Children's Illustrated Book of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hot Mess  by Jeff Kinney (Puffin)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Wilding: How to Bring Wildlife Back'' by Isabella Tree, illustrated by Angela Harding (Macmillan Children's Books )\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Jonty Gentoo: The Adventures of a Penguin by Julia Donaldson, illustrated by Axel Scheffler (Alison Green Books)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Discover Book of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Non-fiction Audiobook of the Year\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"34%\" | Fiction Audiobook of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* poyums by Len Pennie,  (Canongate)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Sociopath by Patric Gagne, narrated by Patric Gagne (Brazen, Octopus Publishing)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* My Favourite Mistake by Marian Keyes, narrated by Marian Keyes (Penguin Random House)'''\n|}\n2024 Books of the Year\nThe shortlisted nominees were announced on 8 March 2024.
