The motte was then altered to form a platform for a manor house which was built on the site.  In 1812 the manor house was demolished and replaced by Kingerby Hall, which still stands on the site.\nSee also\n*Castles in Great Britain and Ireland\n*List of castles in England\n*St Peter's Church, Kingerby\nReferences"
