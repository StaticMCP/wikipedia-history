In the years leading up to the Islamic Revolution, Mousavi and his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, moved to the United States. They returned shortly after the establishment of the Islamic Republic. Mousavi later ran for office in the 2009 Iranian presidential election, but lost to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nin 2009]]\nPast elections\n1997 presidential election\nMousavi refused to run for president in the 1997 presidential election. As a result, reformists chose Mohammad Khatami, who won by a landslide. His wife would later explain in an interview that her husband did not run in the 1997 election because of  discouraging messages from \"higher officials\", possibly referring to the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, or the president at the time, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n2005 presidential election\nMousavi was considered a potential reformist candidate in the 2005 presidential election. However, on October 12, 2004, he announced he would not run.  This decision came after a meeting with President Mohammad Khatami and the two other high-ranking members of the Association of Combatant Clerics, Mehdi Karroubi and Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha.\n2009 presidential election\nIn the 2009 presidential election, Mousavi ran as an independent reformist candidate. Although he was one of the original founders of the Iranian reformist camp, he shared many conservative principles. Many reformist parties, including Khatami's Islamic Iran Participation Front, supported his candidacy after Khatami withdrew from the race. However, other supporters of the reformist movement objected to Mousavi's candidacy, arguing that he was not committed to the principles of the reformist parties. Although Mousavi stated he was not running as a reformist, he indicated that he welcomed the support of various parties, both reformist and conservative.\nHe began his campaign at the center of Iranian politics but gradually shifted towards the reformist camp by declaring his support for reform. Although some active members of the conservative camp, such as Emad Afroogh, and the conservative newspaper Jomhouri Eslami, supported Mousavi's candidacy, he did not receive the official backing of any major conservative party. His candidacy made it more difficult for conservatives to support Ahmadinejad, and major conservative parties, such as the Combatant Clergy Association, did not endorse Ahmadinejad for a second term.\nThe BBC reported that Mousavi \"called for greater personal freedoms in Iran and criticized the ban on private television channels\", but \"refused to back down from the country's disputed nuclear program\", stating it was \"for peaceful purposes\".\nOn May 30, 2009, Mousavi pledged to amend \"discriminatory and unjust regulations\" against women and to take other measures in favour of women's rights and equality.\nOn May 23, 2009, the Iranian government blocked access to Facebook across the country but rescinded the blockage after public protests The Guardian reported that the blockage had been a response to the use of Facebook by candidates running against Ahmadinejad. Mousavi had strong support from those using social networking sites like Facebook; PC World reported that Mousavi's Facebook page had more than 6,600 supporters at the time.\nOn June 13, 2009, it was announced that Mousavi lost the election to Ahmadinejad. Accusations of fraud were widespread; the announcement of the results led to widespread protests, which were suppressed by the Iranian government.\nFile:Mir Hossein Mousavi in Zanjan by Mardetanha 0885.jpg|Mousavi addressing supporters during a presidential campaign stop in Zanjan\nFile:Mirhossein musavi in Zanjan By Mardetanha video.ogv|Mousavi delivering a speech in Zanjan in Azerbaijani\nEndorsements\n* Fatemeh Motamed-Aria, Iranian actress\n* Islamic Iran Participation Front\n* Association of Combatant Clerics\n* Executives of Construction Party\n* Society of Forces Following the Line of the Imam\n* Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution of Iran Organization\n* Islamic Labour Party\n* Workers' House\n* Nationalist-Religious Forces\n* Invite and Correction of Iran\n* Democracy Party\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090523082158/http://www.kalemeh.ir/ Kalemeh News]\n*[http://ghalamnews.ir/ Ghalam News]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090529044421/http://www.mirhussein.com/ Mir Hussein Mousavi]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090530214559/http://www.setadema.com/index.php Setad e Ma - ستاد ما]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090525083610/http://portal.setademan.com/ Setad e Man]\n* Vote for Change - Vote for Mir Hossein Mousavi, a promotional video by a number of Iranian motion-picture celebrities, including Dariush Mehrjoui, Kiumars Pourahmad, Manijeh Hekmat, Masoud Kimiai and Mohsen Makhmalbaf: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HaEBTyueCs YouTube] (9 min 54 sec).\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_8088000/8088194.stm \"The changing face of Iranian politics\"], BBC video, June 7, 2009 (on the prospect of Mousavi's election)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090612041051/http://www.ghalamdownload.com/dolateomid.pdf Mousavi's Program booklet, first version]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mir-Hossein-Mousavi-/45061919453?ref=ts Mousavi's public Facebook page]"
