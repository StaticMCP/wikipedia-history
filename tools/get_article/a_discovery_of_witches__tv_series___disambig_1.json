She was raised by her aunts Sarah and Emily after her parents were killed by humans who feared their powers. She is also an accomplished historian with tenure at Yale University, currently conducting research at Oxford. While studying in the Bodleian Library, she summons the long-missing manuscript Ashmole 782, thought to contain information on the origin of supernatural species, thus catching the attention of witches, vampires and daemons alike. Biochemist Matthew Clairmont, a vampire, is drawn to her initially because of the book, but their repeated encounters spark something in both of them.\n| LineColor       = 2B0A09\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.64\n| ShortSummary    = Matthew leaves Oxford for a few days hunting with a daemon friend, Hamish.

Satu, a Finnish witch allied with Knox, stalks Diana and threatens her. Even Diana's friend Gillian betrays her to Knox. With no one else to turn to, she seeks help from Matthew. He introduces her to his vampire colleagues Marcus and Miriam and reveals their DNA research into why the three supernatural species are in decline: vampires are failing to sire, witches are much less powerful than their ancestors and daemons are increasingly prone to mental illness.\n| LineColor       = 2B0A09\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.42\n| ShortSummary    = As creatures continue to flock to the Bodleian Library in the hope the Ashmole 782 will reveal itself again, Matthew distracts Diana with a trip to his home.

Nathaniel's mother Agatha, a Congregation member, cautions them against pushing for radical change. Diana invites Matthew to dinner but unwittingly drives him away. The next day she receives photos from the scene of her parents' murder, a threat from Knox. She goes to confront him and his witch allies at the Bodleian, summoning witch wind, a powerful elemental force she can't control. Matthew comes to her aid and decides to take her away from Oxford to his family home in France.\n| LineColor       = 2B0A09\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.15\n| ShortSummary    = Matthew and Diana arrive at Sept-Tours to a frosty welcome.

Baldwin orders Matthew to kill Jack, but Matthew's hesitation allows him to escape. Hubbard reveals Benjamin has been stoking Jack's rage, exploiting his desperation to find his family. Matthew locates Jack and brings him home to Diana. Defying Baldwin in this way leaves Matthew no choice but to seek independence. Chris and Miriam have made progress in their studies of vampire DNA, but to find a cure for blood rage they need more samples and additional resources. Matthew reluctantly agrees to let a group of student researchers join the project after signing a non-disclosure agreement.

They identify an occult text at the British Library which Diana uses her magic on, revealing one of the missing pages from the Book of Life is in Father Hubbard's possession. Peter Knox had already made a visit to Hubbard's office, resorting to his usual threats. Explaining what lies at stake for all creatures, Diana persuades Hubbard to trust her with the page. Sarah feels useless in the current fight and tries to sneak away. Gallowglass reveals to Sarah he has watched over Diana since birth, at Philippe's command, and convinces her Diana still needs her. Marcus manages to get an audience with Ransome, the head of his vampire brood, who will talk to Matthew only if he takes responsibility for what he did. Matthew recalls the name and face of every vampire he killed in New Orleans, including Ransome's mate, and apologizes sincerely to both Ransome and Marcus.

Diana visits the site where Goody Alsop's house once stood and meets the local coven who honors Goody's legacy. The spell leads Diana to the daemon Timothy Weston, a frightened recluse who considers the page part of his family and will not surrender it. Armed with additional DNA samples from the New Orleans vampires, Chris discovers the gene for blood rage is activated by something within the human genome, and thus depends on the genetic makeup of the individual being sired. Miriam brings the news to Matthew in person, convincing him even without a cure, he cannot let fear of failure keep him from returning home. Agatha accompanies Diana on a return visit to Timothy, promising the troubled daemon he will no longer be alone. Having secured the page, Diana goes into labor. Matthew requests Baldwin's permission to form a scion, but his brother refuses. Matthew then rushes back to London, joining Diana as she gives birth to a girl and a boy.

Marcus wants to strengthen the Knights of Lazarus with more members who can protect each other if the Congregation comes for them. Diana and Matthew pledge on behalf of the twins, with Miriam, Jack, Sarah, and Chris joining the ranks as well.

Diana departs for Poland with Baldwin, Miriam, Marcus, and Gallowglass. Confronted by illusions crafted by Satu, Diana sees through them and spellbinds her fellow weaver. She then advances on Benjamin, weaving the tenth and final knot to end his life. Matthew is too far gone to be helped by anyone's blood but Ysabeau's, so they transport him back to Sept-Tours, where he slowly recovers. Miriam and Chris have pieced together the genetic information Diana gained from the Book of Life and discovered the reason creatures are in decline is precisely because they have been segregated. Interbreeding is the key to their survival. Diana takes over as the de Clermont representative to the Congregation and convinces all but Gerbert to repeal the Covenant and elect Agatha as their new leader. Baldwin and Matthew reconcile, Fernando is officially recognized as Hugh's mate, Phoebe and Marcus get engaged, and Agatha is reunited with her family.
