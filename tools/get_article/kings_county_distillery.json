It produces corn whiskey, bourbon whiskey, and rye whiskey, as well as other American craft whiskeys.\nHistory\nKings County Distillery was founded by Colin Spoelman and David Haskell in 2009, spurred by changes in New York State law regarding the licensing of microdistilleries.  It officially began production out of its  warehouse in April 2010.\nIn 2012, the distillery moved into the Brooklyn Navy Yard and installed copper whiskey stills imported from Scotland. The distillery focuses on American whiskeys, being named part of America's New Whiskey Rebellion by Whiskey Advocate, with unusual whiskeys like a Peated Bourbon, American Single Malt, and a craft Bottled in bond bourbon. The distillery also makes Empire Rye, a project to establish a new standard of identity for New York made rye with other craft distillers.\nIn 2016, Kings County Distillery opened The Gatehouses, a tasting room in the historic Sands Street gate of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.\nProducts\nKings County began by releasing an unaged corn whiskey, and later had a wider portfolio of whiskeys aged 2–7 years.\n* Kings County Moonshine\n* Kings County Straight Bourbon Whiskey\n* Kings County Peated Bourbon\n* Kings County Single Malt Whiskey\n* Kings County Bottled-in-Bond Bourbon\n* Kings County Empire Rye\n* Kings County Chocolate Whiskey\nAwards\nIn 2016, Kings County Distillery was named \"Distillery of the Year\" by the American Distilling Institute.\nReferences"
