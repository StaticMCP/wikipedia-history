After the formation of the UAR in 1958, the National Union also became the only legal political movement in Syria. In the latter country, the National Union was controlled by former Ba'athists and anti-communists.\nThe main objective of the National Union was to mobilize the population behind Nasser's policies, which consisted of pan-Arabism, reforms and the building of a welfare state. However, the National Union did not become a real mass movement, certainly not in Syria. The latter country withdrew from the UAR in September 1961. In 1962 Nasser replaced the National Union with the Arab Socialist Union (ASU).\nNotes\nReferences"
