He spent his early career at Bell Labs and subsequently moved to Drexel Burnham Lambert. In 1987, claiming to have \"a better model for valuing interest rate swaps,\" he and two colleagues left Drexel to found American International Group Financial Products, where they took advantage of a triple-A balance sheet to pioneer the creation of many long-dated over-the-counter derivative products. Sosin left AIG in 1993 after a falling out with Chairman Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://bigthink.com/howardsosin/turning-insolvent-banks-to-financial-health Howard Sosin's Plan to Return Insolvent Banks to Financial Health] - Big Think\n* [http://www.derivativesstrategy.com/magazine/archive/1997/0797qa.asp The World According to Lee Wakeman]  - on Howard Sosin and financial derivatives\n* [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/03/25/national/a074256S33.DTL Cheating Wife Awarded More Than $40M] - San Francisco Chronicle\n* [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,151520,00.html Wife Cheats on Husband, Gets $40M in Divorce] - FOX News\n* [http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/case/divorce Settlements and Verdicts:Howard Sosin] - Lawyers and Settlements\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003748/http://www.connpost.com/news/ci_2620034 Record $24m awarded in divorce] - Connecticut Post\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/28/AR2008122801916.html?nav=rss_email%2Fcomponents The Beautiful Machine] - The Washington Post"
