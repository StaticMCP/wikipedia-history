Beyond the trees are the columns of Widener Library.]]\nMost upperclass Houses have preliminary rituals of their own. At Lowell House, for example, a perambulating bagpiper alerts seniors at 6:15am for a 6:30 breakfast in the House dining hall with members of the Senior Common Room, after which all process (along with members of Eliot House, who have been similarly roused) to Memorial Church for a chapel service at 7:45. }}ment|work=Harvard Gazette|date=May 26, 2011 |first1=Corydon|last1=Ireland|first2=Katie|last2=Koch|first3=Colleen|last3=Walsh\n}} }}\nMorning exercises\nMorning Exercises are held in the central green of Harvard Yard (known as Tercentenary Theatre); the dais is before the steps of Memorial Church, facing Widener Library.ment Office |access-date=October 10, 2013\n}} }}\nEarly commencements were held in a variety of locations, all indoors.

Buckley objected to the traditional costume he would be required to wear. After Suffolk Sheriff Thomas S. Eisenstadt was asked to open and close in Buckley's stead, Cambridge mayor Alfred Vellucci mused, \"Now I see they're going to have Tom Eisenstadt march with the sword.

Feasting, drinking, and merrymaking at earlier commencements often got out of hand. Fights were not unheard of\",\nand commencements in various years have featured two-headed calves, an elephant, and Indians-versus-scholars archery competitions.\nSuch goings-on were sufficiently common knowledge that in 1749, Bostonian William Douglass explained to a general readership that the siege and capture of Louisbourg had been \"carried on in a tumultuary random Manner, and resembled a Cambridge Commencement.\"\nThus in 1781, ment day, [the Corporation] voted that the Honble Henry Gardner Esq: and the Honble Abraham Fuller Esq: Justices of the Peace thro' the State, and Loammi Baldwin Esq: Sheriff of the County of Middlesex, be requested to give their attendance on that day...}}\n}}\nEarlier measures had included the 1693 banning of plum cakethe enjoyment of which, officials asserted, was unknown at other universities, \"dishonourable to ye Colledge, not gratefull to Wise men, and chargable to [i.e. the fault of] ye Parents\".\nThis was one of many efforts by Increase Mather (Harvard's president from 1692 to 1701) toward \"Reformation of those excesses... [of] Commencement day and  so that I might [prevent] disorder and profaneness\"for Harvard officials a recurring headache.\n1.That the Order... phibiting any Scholar to have Plum-cake&c in his Study or Chamber [at] Commencement be strictly observed.\n2.That all mix'd drink make with distill'd Spts be also phibited...\n3.That the Presidt and Fellows be desired to exhort& direct the Scholars to be more moderate and frugall in the Entertainmts.\n4.And that the publick dinner usual on the day after Commencmt be lessen'd or laid aside, as the Presidt and Fellows of the House [i.e. the Tutors] shall think most convenient.\"\n|hide=y}}\nIn 1722, the Corporation \"took more stringent action still\": \"Whereas the Countrey in general and the College in Particular have bin under Such Circumstances, as call aloud for Humiliation, and all due manifestations of it; and that a Suitable retrenchmt of every thing that has the face of Exorbitance or [extravegence] in Expences, especially at Commencmt out to be endeavrd.

And every-->[E]very Candidate for a first degree shall be clothed in a black gown, or in a coat of blue grey, a dark blue, or a black color; and no one shall wear any silk nightgown, on said day, nor any gold or silver lace, cord, or edging upon his hat, waistcoat, or any other part of his clothing, in the College, or town of Cambridge.\n}} }}\n2024 Gaza war protest\nAt least several hundred degree candidates and faculty walked out of the 2024 morning exercises to protest the denial of degrees, pending appeal, to thirteen Harvard College seniors; the degrees had been withheld due to the students' conduct during a weeks-long \"encampment\" in Harvard Yard protesting the Gaza–Israel conflict.\nAccording to the Harvard undergraduate newspaper, The Crimson, the walkout had been \"something of a foregone conclusion... so widely expected by students and administrators alike that it could just as well have been added to the official Commencement program.\"\nHonorary degrees\nSeveral hundred Harvard honorary degrees (which with few exceptions must be accepted in person) }} have been awarded since the first were awarded in 1692.  Notable recipients have included at least 14 U.S. Presidents,  as well as numerous writers, artists, and Nobel Prize recipients.\nIn 1984 the Harvard Corporation decided that no honorary degrees would be granted at the 1986 commencement (marking Harvard's 350th year), ending controversy over whether Ronald Reagan would be awarded a degree. A Harvard official called the decision \"the only graceful way out\" of the situation; Reagan was nonetheless invited to speak at the ceremony.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw\nIn 1935 playwright George Bernard Shaw declined nomination for a Harvard honorary degree, urging instead that Harvard celebrate its three-hundredth anniversary by \"burning itself to the ground... as an example to all the other famous old corrupters of youth\" such as Yale.\nResponding to the prospect of being nominated for an honorary degree on the occasion of Harvard's Tercentenary celebration  in 1936, George Bernard Shaw wrote:\nA handwritten postscript read: \"I appreciate the friendliness of your attitude.\"\n}}\nCommencement speakers\n* 2024: Maria Ressa, journalist and media entrepreneur – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dETo7ECQKc video]; [https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2024/05/harvard-commencement-2024-maria-ressa-address text])\n* 2023: Tom Hanks, Academy Award-winning actor and filmmaker – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkPo5nfEk1w video]; [https://www.harvard.edu/media-relations/2023/05/25/tom-hanks-commencement-speech/ text])\n* 2020 and 2021 (held in person in 2022): Merrick Garland, 86th Attorney General of the United States – ([https://www.youtube.com/live/bKTbwiFpYuE?feature=share&t=10063 video]; [https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-commencement-address-harvard-classes-2020-and text])\n* 2022: Jacinda Ardern, 40th Prime Minister of New Zealand\n* 2021 (virtual): Ruth Simmons, president of Prairie View A&M University, president emerita of both Brown University and Smith College\n* 2020 (virtual): Martin Baron, editor of The Washington Post\n* 2019: Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ofED6BInFs video])\n* 2018: John Lewis, civil rights activist and US representative representing Georgia\n* 2017: Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook\n* 2016: Steven Spielberg, film director, producer, and screenwriter – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYtoDunfu00&index=1&list=PL309451B70B1DE1FF video]; [https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/276561 text])\n* 2015: Deval Patrick, 71st Governor of Massachusetts – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-flgIKTSIas video])\n* 2014: Michael Bloomberg, businessman and philanthropist, former Mayor of New York City – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhfn2zgFFJ8 video]; [https://soundcloud.com/harvard/former-nyc-mayor-michael audio])\n* 2013: Oprah Winfrey, businesswoman and talk show host – ([http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/multimedia/oprah-winfrey-commencement-speech-harvard-commencement-2013/ video]; [https://soundcloud.com/harvard/oprah-winfrey-harvard-commencement audio]; [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/05/winfreys-commencement-address/ text])\n* 2012: Fareed Zakaria, journalist, author, former TIME editor – (\"We Live in an Age of Progress\" [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/multimedia/fareed-zakaria-commencement-2012-speech/ video]; [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/05/text-of-fareed-zakarias-commencement-address/ text])\n* 2011: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 24th President of Liberia – ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLnpgb6Gb-Y&list=PL309451B70B1DE1FF&index=71 video])\n* 2010: David Souter, former Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCxaDwOCXD8 video]; [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/05/text-of-justice-david-souters-speech/ text])\n* 2009: Steven Chu, former United States Secretary of Energy ([https://vimeo.com/5007822 video]; [http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/06/u-s-energy-secretary-steven-chus-address-at-harvards-afternoon-exercises/ text])\n* 2008: J.
