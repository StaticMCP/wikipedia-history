It was the prelude to the Battle of Warka fought a day later.\nBattle\nOn 6 April, Czarniecki's troops reached Zwoleń, where he learned of the retreat of Frederick of Baden, who had originally rushed to the aid of Karol Gustav, trapped in a camp at the forks of the San and Vistula. Czarniecki immediately decided to give chase and, near Kozienice, struck at the Swedish artillery consisting of 240 raiders and dragoons under the command of Tornskjöld. The fight lasted for a few hours and ended with the dispersal of the 300 man Swedish unit.\nOn hearing that the rear guard had been defeated, the margrave hastened his retreat, and on the night of 6-7 April reached Warka, where he was joined by Ritter's troop, drawing from Radom with several hundred carts full of the spoils of war. It took all night to get the wagons across the Pilica, until finally, in the morning, the Swedes destroyed the bridges, and the margrave himself set off for Warsaw.\nAftermath\nIn the meantime, Czarniecki was joined in Kozienice by Jerzy Lubomirski and at night his troops set off for Warka, where they arrived at dawn on 7 April. Over here the Battle of Warka started\nThe battle of Kozienice was described by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his novel Potop:\nCitations"
