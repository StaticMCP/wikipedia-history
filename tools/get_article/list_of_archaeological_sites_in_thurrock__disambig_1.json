The list is arranged by location and then chronologically by the date of the discovery or excavation. The archaeological finds and features cover all periods from the Paleolithic to the 20th century. Most editions of Panorama (the Journal of the Thurrock Local History Society) contain further information about local archaeology. A brief review of archaeology in Thurrock by the Mucking weekenders is in an article by Margaret Jones in Panorama 24. There is a fuller account of archaeology in Thurrock between 1954 and 2002 (including reminiscences of the Mucking excavation) in Thurrock Gold published by the Thurrock Local History Society.\nRecent editions of Essex Archaeology and History contain short reports of archaeological activity in Essex (including Thurrock) during the previous year. These reports include trial excavations and surveys that revealed no significant features or finds and which are not included in this list.\nThis list does not include most individual finds housed in the Thurrock Museum. A list of Paleolithic and Neolithic finds was published in Panorama – Journal of the Thurrock Local History Society, 3, 1958. Many Romano-British and Saxon finds in the museum are listed in The Archaeology of Thurrock: Romano-British and Saxon by Randal Bingley (supplement to Panorama – the Journal of the Thurrock Local History Society, 1973).\nSites of archaeological finds or excavations\nAveley\n*Multi-period finds and features (Iron Age to Saxon) (1956)\n*The Ice House, Belhus; post-medieval (1979)\n*Ship Lane; Iron Age and Romano-British (1994/5)\n*Remains of formal gardens at Belhus discovered by geophys; Tudor and Jacobean\nChadwell St Mary\n(See also Tilbury Docks and Tilbury Fort.
