Since 1950 he had more than two dozen solo exhibitions of his paintings in galleries across the United States. His paintings have been seen in hundreds of group exhibitions over the years.\nBiography\nEdward Dugmore was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on February 20, 1915.  He underwent traditional art training at the Hartford Art School before going to Kansas City in the summer of 1941 to study with Thomas Hart Benton at the Kansas City Art Institute.  He entered the Marine Corps in 1943, and upon his discharge, taught painting and drawing at St. Joseph's College in West Hartford, Connecticut.  In 1948, Dugmore took advantage of the G.I. Bill and moved out west to San Francisco to further his studies in art at the California School of Fine Arts.  There he studied with Clyfford Still, who was influential on his development, both as an artist and a close friend.  Dugmore also became a lifelong friend of fellow student and artist Ernest Briggs. During this time, he co-organized an artists collaborative gallery called the Metart Gallery.  In 1951 he moved to Guadalajara, Mexico to study at the University of Guadalajara, where he received his M.F.A.  He moved to New York City in 1952 and began exhibiting along with other Abstract Expressionist artists at the Stable Gallery, where he subsequently had three solo exhibitions.\nHis paintings have been in exhibitions in important museums, institutions and art galleries over the course of eight decades beginning in the 1940s.
