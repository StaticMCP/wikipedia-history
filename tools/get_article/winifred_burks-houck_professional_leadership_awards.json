The award is named for Winifred Burks-Houck, environmental chemist and the first female president of NOBCChE.\nThe award seeks to highlight achievements in science, technology, engineering and math; leadership; creativity; community service; and entrepreneurship.\nHistory\nWinifred Burks-Houck was a notable leader in the NOBCChE having established its West Coast branch and serving as its first female president for four consecutive terms. She was credited with positive change within the organization such as the increase of its chapters by more than 100%, partnerships with other scientific and engineering-related organizations, increasing NOBCChE visibility and advancing the interests of Black chemists. Though Burks-Houck had died in 2004, the NOBCChE in 2010 decided to honour her legacy through the creation of the Winifred Burks-Houck Professional Leadership Awards and Symposium where recipients are recognized.\nAwards\nThe Winifred Burks-Houck Professional Leadership Awards are awarded to three categories of recipients: Professional Leadership, Graduate Leadership, and Undergraduate Leadership. Professional women in STEM who exemplify leadership while contributing to the community and students pursuing a degree in a STEM field are considered for this award. Distinguished Lecturers are the speakers at the annual Winifred Burks-Houck Professional Leadership Symposium selected based on their status as thought leaders on STEM and roles in leadership, organizational development, entrepreneurship, and other success enabling areas.\nDistinguished lecturer\n* 2010: Dr. Margaret E.
