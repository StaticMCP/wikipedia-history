By the end of February the nationalists had reached the outskirts of Gandesa. The XV International Brigade had been retreating since the Aragón Offensive began, and the republican lines collapsed.\nThe battle followed the decision of the XV International Brigade to dig in and hold the town of Gandesa in an effort to slow down  the Francoist troops, which had been advancing steadily since the beginning of the offensive.\nBattle\nThe town of Gandesa was held by the XV International Brigade. The Nationalists attacked with troops of Mario Berti's CTV and Monasterio's Army Corps. Despite the prowess of the British troops, Gandesa fell on 3 April and 140 British and American members of the International Brigades were captured. However, the resistance of the XV Brigade allowed the Republican troops to regroup and to withdraw some material across the Ebro River.\nCultural references\nThis battle is mentioned in the song Jamie Foyers, where the fictional hero is killed.\nSee also\n* List of Spanish Nationalist military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\n* List of weapons of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie\n* Aviazione Legionaria\n* Condor Legion\n* List of Spanish Republican military equipment of the Spanish Civil War\nReferences"
