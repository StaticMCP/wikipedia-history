It was his first major public speech after succeeding his father Kim Jong Il after his death in 2011. He had given at least one speech, Let Us Brilliantly Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche, Holding Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as the Eternal General Secretary of Our Party, }} to party officials the week before.\nBackground\nKim delivered the speech at the Kim Il-sung Square in Pyongyang. He delivered it in 20 minutes. The speech was broadcast on North Korean television. Kim's public speech was noted for departing from the customs of his father Kim Jong Il, who spoke in public extremely rarely. A song, \"Onwards Toward the Final Victory\", was created on the basis of the speech.\nSynopsis\nIn the speech, Kim tells officials to respect Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. He makes 16 mentions of the leaders, 11 of which refer to both as if they are a single unit. The speech places heavy emphasis on the Songun (military-first) ideology. Kim says the army is tasked with safeguarding the leading Kim dynasty.\nSee also\n* Kim Jong Un bibliography\n* Songun\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*"
