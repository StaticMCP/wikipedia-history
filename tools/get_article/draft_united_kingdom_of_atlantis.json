This history was passed down to Plato by his grandfather CRITIAS, who in turn heard it from his grandfather Dropidas, and Dropidas from Solon the famous Athenian statesman, who also heard it from an Egyptian priest. Atlantis, often regarded as a myth or work of fiction, is one of human history's most enduring and captivating stories. The legendary island originated from the ancient Greek philosopher Plato's dialogue \"Timaeus\" and \"Kratius (Critias)\" two of his much written around 360 BCE. In these texts, Plato describes Atlantis as a powerful and advanced civilization that existed around 9,200 years before his time.\nPlato describes Atlantis as a wealthy and technologically advanced society, boasting impressive architecture, engineering feats, and a prosperous economy. The Atlanteans were said to have constructed grand buildings, temples, and canals, utilizing their knowledge of science and engineering.

According to Plato, Atlantis was a maritime empire in the Atlantic Ocean, located beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules,\" often associated with the Strait of Gibraltar. Atlantis is said to be larger than Libya and Asia combined\nFoundation\nAtlantis was founded ages ago by King Atlan, and eventually, the empire grew to become the most technologically advanced and most powerful nation of the time under his great leadership. As the Atlanteans grew in power and strength, their moral principles weakened. Their armies expanded their dominion, reaching as far as Egypt in Africa and Tyrrhenia (Etruscan Italy) in Europe, before encountering resistance from an alliance led by Athens. Following this, the island suffered divine punishment in the form of earthquakes and floods, eventually sinking into a muddy sea.\nIt is important to note, that; Atlantis is not a lost course. Former U.S. congressman Ignatius L. Donnelly in 1882 published “Atlantis The Antediluvian World\" he called it an advanced Civilization, whose immigrants had populated much of ancient Europe, Africa & America, whose Heroes had inspired Greeks, Hindus, and Scandinavian Mythology.
