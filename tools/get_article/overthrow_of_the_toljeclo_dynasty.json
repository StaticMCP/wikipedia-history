      "text": "# Overthrow of the Toljeclo dynasty\n\nThe overthrow of the Tolje'lo occurred in 1749 in the Isaaq Kingdom when King Dhuh Baraar, the last monarch of the Tolje'lo dynasty, was overthrown and killed in a coup led by a coalition of Isaaq clans under Abdi Eissa, a religious mullah and military leader.\nBackground\nBy the 1300s, the Isaaq clans had united to defend their territories and resources during conflicts with migrating clans. By the 1600s, after the fall of the Adal Sultanate, Somali-inhabited lands fragmented into various clan states, including the Isaaq.\nAccording to oral tradition, the Isaaq clan family was ruled by a dynasty from the Tolje'lo branch, descendants of Ahmed \"Tol Je'lo,\" the eldest son of Sheikh Ishaaq. Eight Tolje'lo rulers governed starting from the 13th century.\nSee also\n* Isaaq Sultanate\n* House of Guled\nReferences"
