After the death of Tadahira, there was no regent and although contemporaries praised Murakami as the emperor who governed the state directly, in reality the Fujiwara clan seized power and ruled Japan. The brothers Fujiwara no Saneyori and Fujiwara no Morosuke became the de facto rulers of Japan.\n* 23 October 949 (Tenryaku 3, 29th day of the 9th month):  The  former-Emperor Yōzei died at the age of 82.\n* 951 (Tenryaku 5): The emperor ordered the compilation of Gosen Wakashū; this work was undertaken by the Five Men of the Pear Chamber under his patronage.\n* 6 September 952 (Tenryaku 6, 15th day of the 8th month):  The  former-Emperor Suzaku died at the age of 30.\n* 16 October 960 (Tentoku 4, 23rd day of the 9th month): The Imperial palace burned down, the first time it had been  ravaged by fire since the capital was removed from Nara to Heian-kyō in 794.\nMurakami was a central figure in Heian period culture. He was also a skilled flute and koto (Japanese harp) player.\n* 5 July 967 (Kōhō 4, 25th day of the 5th month):  The  former-Emperor Murakami died at the age of 42.\nThe actual site of Murakami's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Murakami's mausoleum.  It is formally named Murakami no misasagi\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.
