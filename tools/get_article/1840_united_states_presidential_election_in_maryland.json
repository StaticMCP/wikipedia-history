Voters chose 10 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nMaryland voted for the Whig candidate, William Henry Harrison, over Democratic candidate Martin Van Buren, by a margin of 7.66%. As of 2020, this remains the only time in history that an incumbent Democratic president who served a full term has failed to carry any of Maryland's electoral votes in a reelection bid.\nThis was the first presidential election that Carroll County was able to vote in.\nResults\n}}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\"  |William Henry Harrison\nWhig\n! colspan=\"2\"  |Martin Van Buren\nDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |Margin\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total\nVotes\nCast\n|-\n! |#\n! |%\n! |#\n! |%\n!#\n!%\n|-\n|| Allegany\n|1271\n|53.76%\n|1093\n|46.24%\n|178\n|7.53%\n|2364\n|-\n|| Anne Arundel\n|1604\n|53.68%\n|1384\n|46.32%\n|220\n|7.36%\n|2988\n|-\n|| Baltimore (City and County)\n|9237\n|48.15%\n|9946\n|51.85%\n| -709\n| -3.70%\n|19183\n|-\n||  Calvert\n|494\n|60.32%\n|325\n|39.68%\n|169\n|20.64%\n|819\n|-\n|| Caroline\n|687\n|56.22%\n|535\n|43.78%\n|152\n|12.44%\n|1222\n|-\n|| Carroll\n|1554\n|49.12%\n|1610\n|50.88%\n| -56\n| -1.77%\n|3164\n|-\n|| Cecil\n|1448\n|52.43%\n|1314\n|47.57%\n| 134\n|4.85%\n|3164\n|-\n|| Charles\n|841\n|62.62%\n|502\n|37.38%\n|339\n|25.24%\n|1343\n|-\n|| Dorchester\n|1381\n|62.21%\n|839\n|37.79%\n|542\n|24.41%\n|2220\n|-\n|| Frederick\n|2958\n|53.00%\n|2623\n|47.00%\n|335\n|6.00%\n|5581\n|-\n|| Harford\n|1342\n|51.81%\n|1248\n|48.19%\n|94\n|3.62%\n|2590\n|-\n|| Kent\n|679\n|58.79%\n|476\n|41.21%\n|203\n|17.58%\n|1155\n|-\n|| Montgomery\n|1099\n|62.30%\n|665\n|37.70%\n|434\n|24.60%\n|1764\n|-\n|| Prince George's\n|1017\n|62.55%\n|609\n|37.45%\n|408\n|25.09%\n|1626\n|-\n|| Queen Anne's\n|778\n|54.07%\n|661\n|45.93%\n|117\n|8.13%\n|1439\n|-\n|| St. Mary's\n|895\n|68.32%\n|415\n|31.68%\n|480\n|36.64%\n|1310\n|-\n|| Somerset\n|1516\n|64.24%\n|844\n|35.76%\n|672\n|28.47%\n|2360\n|-\n|| Talbot\n|749\n|52.34%\n|682\n|47.66%\n|67\n|4.68%\n|1431\n|-\n|| Washington\n|2484\n|52.03%\n|2290\n|47.97%\n|194\n|4.06%\n|4774\n|-\n|| Worcester\n|1494\n|68.38%\n|691\n|31.62%\n|803\n|36.75%\n|2185\n|-\n|Total\n|33,528\n|53.83%\n|28,752\n|46.17%\n|4,776\n|7.66%\n|62,280\n|}\nCounties that flipped from Democratic to Whig\n* Cecil\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Maryland\n* 1840 United States presidential election\n* 1840 United States elections\nReferences"
