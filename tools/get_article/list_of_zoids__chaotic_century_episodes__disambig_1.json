Inspired by the sacrifice of his father to protect their village, Van dreams of becoming a great Zoid pilot. He is attacked by desert bandits, and takes refuge in some ruins. While hiding he discovers an 'organoid' whom he names Zeke, who has the power to revive and merge with another Zoid. Using Zeke's power he restores a Shield Liger and uses it to defeat the bandits, then returns to the ruins to find a girl with amnesia inside a pod.\nWith his new Zoids and mystery companion in tow, Van sets out to discover the girl's identity and become a great Zoid pilot like his father before him.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 19, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Returning to his village, Van introduces Zeke and the girl, Fiona, to his sister Maria and the rest of the town, explaining how they both emerged from pods, and how Fiona had lost her memory. Bandits attack while Van is out giving Fiona a tour of the area in the Liger, taking Maria hostage in exchange for Zeke. Briefly tied up while the villagers take Zeke the bandits, Van gets free with Fiona's help, and rushes off to save his sister. Before Zeke can merge with the Shield Liger however, the Liger gets damaged and Zeke is knocked unconscious. Zeke is apparently awakened through some mysterious ability of Fiona's before the Liger can be destroyed. After the battle, the townsfolk accept Van's choice to leave his town in his new role as a Zoid pilot, following in his father's footsteps as he chases after Fiona's memories.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 20, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Temporarily separated from Zeke and the Shield Liger, Van and Fiona are rescued from the desert by a man named Irvine, the pilot to a Command Wolf, who offers them food and a place to sleep for the night. After reuniting with Zeke and the Liger, the two find an ancient fortress guarded by a Gordos and are forced to sneak in through the sewer. As they search through the ruins they find a diary of a soldier who was stationed at the fortress fifty years early, and through reading it learn that the Gordos was abandoned by the soldier due to its damaged leg, which Van attempts to fix. It turns out that Irvine is trying to capture Zeke, as he reappears to attack the Gordos, and later Van, only to retreat when the Gordos defends the damaged Shield Liger.\nWhile exploring the ruins, Van and Fiona find an ancient tablet with mysterious writing on it, and Fiona remembers something called the 'Zoid Eve'. Though neither Van nor Fiona knows what it means, they decide to set off in search of more information about this 'Zoid Eve'.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 21, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After a misunderstanding where Fiona dumps out all of the water the group was carrying, Van and Fiona find themselves in a village regularly attacked by the same bandits that have given Van trouble before. The village has hired Irvine as a protector, spurring Van to prove himself just as capable when the bandits attack. Despite being outnumbered, Van manages to take out most of the bandits by blowing up an aquifer, though in the end he has to be saved by Irvine.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 22, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After saving the village from the Desert Alcavaleno Gang, the Shield Liger had some pretty serious damage. Van almost has a heart-attack when he finds out that Fiona ate his Papaya. Soon afterward, they meet a sassy girl, Moonbay. She examines his Shield Liger and notices that the front-back leg has missile damage on it. They talk until a couple of sleeper Guysacks attack them. With Moonbay's Gustav burdened by the heavy load, she can not put any weapons onto it. But Irvine arrives and destroys all of the Guysacks except one that managed to slip by and cause him some damage. Moonbay finds a good place to camp out for the night, an ancient fortress base. Both the Command Wolf and the Shield Liger are seriously damaged. Irvine becomes suspicious and asked Moonbay if her cargo had any Imperial firepower. Moonbay verified that and told Irvine that it was all loaded with Imperial arms and that they would explode if anything hit it. At dinner, Van tells Moonbay and Irvine what they have been doing. Van, Fiona and Zeke go for a treasure hunt and wind up swimming. During his swim, Van finds the remains of a Zoid. Irvine goes to get his electromagnetic whip to get Zeke and just then more sleeper Guysacks attack. Irvine figures that it was a sleeper trap. The Guysacks they fought earlier were decoys that led them into the ruins so that they could easily be surrounded. The remains that Van saw were one of its captured prey that the sleepers had defeated. Moonbay took her cargo and left out the back with Van while Irvine made a complete 360 and came around. There is a fierce battle with just two zoids against more than a battalion of sleepers. Moonbay drives half of them her way. Then Van and Irvine reappear, but this time Moonbay decides to jettison her cargo and leaves. When the Guysacks attack the ammunition it blows them all up. Moonbay returns and asks Van to be her protector.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 25, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Van and Co. are traveling along when they come across soldiers of the Helic Republic, who mistake them for Imperials, especially after registering the earlier explosion. They take them prisoner after a scuffle and impound the zoids. Irvine reveals his true resourcefulness when he uses a hidden trick to break himself out and Van along with him. Van promises to return for the girls and takes off with Irvine for the zoids. Zeke and the Liger merge and Van and Irvine take off through the base. The Republican soldiers mobilize several Petras and try to stop them. Out of the base, Van tries to lose the soldiers among the crevices, but when he is cornered and goes for the ammunition he finds out the zoids were stripped of their firepower and is chastised by Irvine for his stupidity. Irvine tries to figure out a way to save his own skin when Van gets an idea and starts running the Liger at the walls of the canyon. He bounces from side to side gaining altitude, and finally clears the canyon, taking out two of the Republicans following them. He makes a try for the third, piloted by Capt. Herman. Irvine, showing that he's actually beginning to like the kid, offers a hand, and coordinates jumps with the Command Wolf so that at its peak jump from the canyon the Liger could jump off it and strike Herman who thought he was just high enough. The pilots of the Petras bail, and as he's floating down Herman makes a respectful note of Van's achievements. The episode ends with Major Schubaltz of the Empire preparing his forces for the assault on the Republicans at Red River, and Irvine scouting around.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 26, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After beating the captain, Van and Zeke decide to go and rescue Moonbay and Fiona. When they barge in, they are told that they are working for the Republic. Both Moonbay and Fiona are told that they will be given cargo loaded with explosives that are to be detonated at Fire Bridge. Then Major Schubaltz and Minister Prozan have a discussion about the attack on the rebels. Major Schubaltz says that he will only attack if they are attacked first. At the battlefield, the Republic had its Godos' and Guysacks all lined up with the main captain in the green Gordos. On the Imperial front, they had all 50 Molgas lined up with their commander Major Schubaltz in the Dark Horn. Both captains step out, have a word with each other, and return to their respective zoids. Then Minister Prozan has a word with Marcus, a soldier from the front line. He tells him to launch the first attack and make it look like the Republic did it. If he did, he would be promoted. Then Marcus tells Rosso to use the Pteras they got and attack their forces and in which would begin the battle. Then after a long wait, a Pteras attacks their side and the battle starts up again. Van is ordered to destroy Fire Bridge because the explosives did not work and they had lost contact with the girls. At the gorge Irvine assists Van in making it across the River. Van destroys Fire Bridge. He makes it through the front lines of the Imperial Army and finally makes it to the Republican Side.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 27, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After meeting success at Red River, the gang thinks that if they make it to the Republican Capital they may find a clue to Zoid Eve. Before they leave Captain Herman gives them a letter of introduction, while Irvine tries to take Zeke, but fails. Moonbay and the others stop by a near village to load up on supplies. Moonbay and the others go out to get some supplies. Irvine, Fiona and Zeke get separated from Van. Meanwhile, Fiona goes on a shopping spree for fruit and makes Irvine pay. Van and Moonbay get tailed by Rosso's gang and chased all over the village, and finally get caught. Irvine hears a gunshot in the village. He rushes and finds out that Moonbay and Van have been caught, they have been trapped and are tied around the Shield Liger's foot. Fiona tries to untie them but also gets caught, but Irvine manages to get Van and Moonbay free. Van and Zeke get in the Shield Liger. Then, Rosso shows up in his Red Horn and launches a devastating assault with all of his weapons on the Red Horn. Van survives after learning that he could put up a shield with the Shield Liger. He then rams the Red Horn and Rosso does the same. Van and the rest of the gang leave because the Imperial Army shows up. Rosso surrenders to the army only after telling everyone of his gang to leave. Rosso gets caught and tells Van not to get caught because he defeated the Desert Alcavaleno Gang.\n}}\n| AltDate             = February 28, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Van and the gang barely make it past the Imperial Army. The Shield Liger was not working too well either; its sights were not aligned properly. Then the zoids started to do something weird, and Irvine finds out that they are in the Valley of the Rare Hertz. In this valley there is a pulse that gets emitted that makes the zoids not work properly. Zoids affected by the rare-hertz begin to take on violent tendencies and run out of control, usually destroying themselves. The proof was an old, rusted Godos which was damaged beyond repair. They put on their pulse guards which protects their zoids from the rare-hertz. When they are about to leave Zeke is also affected by the rare-hertz. He looks sick. But then he becomes completely controlled by the rare-hertz and rams the Gustav. He then fuses with the Shield Liger, damages Irvine's Command Wolf, and leaves. Moonbay fixes Irvine's Command Wolf. Van flees after Irvine tells him he cannot use his Command Wolf. He walks until the Shield Liger's tracks disappear, then notices the Shield Liger atop the cliff. He climbs it and falls down, when he wakes up Fiona is bandaging his wounds. Irvine's Command Wolf performance was downgraded by 30%. Van finds Zeke and the Shield Liger. Zeke fuses with the Shield Liger and attempts to kill Van. Then Irvine shows up and traps the Shield Liger against the side of the raised cliff. Zeke escapes and Van chases him on the hover board. After a little organoid vs boy duel. Zeke falls down the cliff and Van catches him by the face. At this time, Zeke realizes that Van is a true friend and returns to normal.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 1, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After getting Zeke back to normal, Van learns that there is an old scientist who was important in the Republican Army and lives here. He might give a lead about Zoid Eve. As they move through the forest they hear an explosion. They come to a house with a man frozen in ice. It is revealed that Fiona likes here coffee salty. Later that morning, Dr. D is gone and is using Irvine's Command Wolf. He tells Irvine that the site of the main gun was off by exactly three degrees. Dr. D tricks Van into doing all of his housework. Otherwise, he will not tell him what Zoid Eve is. Dr. D then confronts Irvine and tricks him into doing more work. He tells both Van and Irvine to get in their zoids because the so-called enemy was coming, his grandson on a bike. Irvine's finger slips thanks to Dr. D. Then the old guy takes them on a suicide mission to an unmanned Republican supply base that was protected by several sleeper Guysacks. Van and Irvine become trapped and Van asks Dr. D about Zoid Eve, the doc smoothly replies he has never heard of it. Dr. D returns home after raiding the supply base. Suddenly, a sleeper Guysack comes after them, it had followed Dr. D there. It destroys his house, then Moonbay shows up and destroys the Guysack. Then Van and Irvine arrive after the place is already blown up. They all discuss Dr. D., Van, Irvine, Moonbay, Fiona, his grandson and Zeke. Dr. D's dream is to make it snow here so Van and Irvine help the Doctor make a machine that will make it snow. They launch the thing. It starts to snow a couple of minutes later, but Fiona and Moonbay notice that the machine had not started. It was really snowing.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 4, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After making it snow, Van and the rest head off to Mount Iselina. Mount Iselina is known for being treacherous. Meanwhile, Viola and Jarro are making plans to attack and get revenge on Van. In the middle of the fog of Mount Isolina, Van stops everyone so he can get his flying papaya, Irvine and Fiona go after him and get lost. Moonbay tells Van about the Shadow Monster story. Then some sort of Shadow Monster appears, it turns out that it was just the shadow of a Godos that was being piloted by a girl named Rosa. Viola and Jarro strategize that those punks (Van) would be at the colony that is in the middle of Mt. Iselina. Rosa takes Van and Moonbay to her colony, and that is where Van stocks up on food. The villagers are surprised at what kind of strangers these people are. They are also fascinated at the zoids that they carry. Then, Van and Rosa talk for a while and exchange stories. Viola and Jarro get there; they did not want to attack the village so they lured Van into a foggy gorge. Van quickly takes out Jarro the Pteras pilot with the same maneuver that he took out Captain Herman, with cliff to cliff jump maneuver. He takes out Viola with the help of Rosa and the Godos. Then Rosa and Viola have a sister-to-sister talk and Van is surprised that Viola is the sister of Rosa. Van covers for Viola and then leaves. Then, Moonbay and Van find Irvine and Fiona and they leave.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 5, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After getting away from the treacherous Mount Iselina, Van and the gang made it into Republican Territory. They make it to a village only after going through a zoid graveyard of 30 Guysacks. Van and the gang get in trouble as a few soldiers try to arrest them because they think it's someone else. Van and Fiona escape but Irvine, Moonbay and Zeke are caught. Then they are chased until they come across a boy lying down. The boy rescues them from the Republican Soldiers. More of them come, and as they are about to reach them, Fiona grabs the boy (who is just as old as Van/Fiona) and they make a break for it. Both Moonbay and Irvine are released due to a misunderstanding. Major Ford, leader and commander of this unit fills both Irvine and Moonbay in on the details. Two days ago, an entire sleeper battalion was whipped out because of one Saber Fang and a black organoid. A black organoid similar to Zeke had attacked them except it had wings instead of boosters. Raven (the boy) leads Van and Fiona to fresh water and asks them how is he can rescue their friends. Irvine gets to Van and warns him about Raven. By that time, the Republican Army has come in a small battalion of Godos'. Raven takes care of all of them. After that, Van takes on Raven and fights him. Raven is a superior fighter and defeats him but has enough sympathy to leave them be. He leaves Van with his broken pride.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 6, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After Van loses to Raven, he sits down and says he's waiting until Raven shows up. Some of the villagers warn them of the advancing Imperial Army. Major Marcus tells Major Schubaltz of the new objectives and different strike plans. Major Marcus's unit will attack and capture the Chronos Fortress and the Schubaltz unit will advance on to Mount Osa Base. After snooping and sneaking around Irvine learns that even though the Republican Army is on the defensive, they have a bold strategy. After several attempts by Moonbay and Fiona, Van still does not want to go. He is trying to pull the full potential of the Shield Liger out. Meanwhile, in the village Raven explains the strategy to Major Schubaltz, and asks him why they could not merge their forces. It would be too overwhelming for the Republicans and might force the President to negotiate a ceasefire treaty between both nations. After his talk Raven leaves with his Saber Fang and Shadow. Van finds him and says that he wants a rematch. Irvine, as always, is standing by if Van needs help. For a couple of seconds, it looked like Van has the match under control, but then Raven, still being the superior pilot, quickly figures his strategy out and rips the dual-gun mounted on the Shield Liger off. Then Irvine comes charging in but Raven takes him out easily enough. Van puts up his Shield and charges for Raven; he hits his Saber and Raven goes down. He then fused with his black organoid, shadow. He takes Van out with one blow and after that Zeke is hurt pretty bad. The Chronos Fortress falls and blows itself up along with the part of Marcus's unit.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 7, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After Van loses the battle to Raven again, we find out that Zeke is hurt badly this time. Colonel Krueger knows it's a huge blow losing the fortress, but he wants to know how much time it would take them to start advancing again. He estimates about thirty hours and tells Major Ford of Chronos Unit that he should return to Mount Osa Base and prepare for a counter-attack. Meanwhile, at the deserted village Van seeks help for Zeke. Dr. D shows up trying to find sunscreen and Van gets Dr. D to see Zeke. Dr. D. tells Van that to revive Zeke he would have to go to Mt. Osa and get a bright blue rock called Zoid Magnite. Irvine goes to the Republican Base to get armed with a multiple missile diffusion systems. He gets to test it out. Van and Moonbay make it to Mt. Osa Volcano and are struggling to keep alive and get the rock. In the meantime, Irvine takes on Raven and his Saber Fang with his multiple missile diffusion system. Van tells Moonbay he see the rock and she should lower him down. He gets the rock and gets pulled up and both Van and Moonbay get out of there with a second to spare. Irvine traps Raven with the needle missiles and Raven fuses with his organoid and takes out Irvine in a flash. Meanwhile, the combined forces of the Schubaltz and Marcus unit make their way to Mount Osa Base.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 8, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After Van finally revives Zeke with the Zoid Magnite, Zeke needs some time to recover. Major Schubaltz joins and the Imperial unit is delayed due to an avalanche of rocks. The delay is really severe they are delayed at least 2 hours. Marcus believes that it had to have been a fluke. Major Schubaltz on the other hand believes this was no fluke, it was the work of Colonel Krueger and that he knew exactly what he was doing. The severe losses due to the Chronos Fortress and this delay with rocks was no fluke. It starts to rain and the roof starts leaking where Van and the others are at. Colonel Krueger gives the command of Mt. Osa base to Major Ford while he pilots the ZG (Gojulas) onto the front lines. At only fifty-percent of its true capability, the ZG still has firepower equivalent to twelve zoids. Irvine sneaks into the base and sees just what they are planning for the upcoming battle against the Empire. The advancing Imperial unit is caught by surprise with several sleeper Guysacks. The Iron Kong, under the control of Major Schubaltz, takes out all the Guysacks with just one round of its 70mm chain guns. Up above them under the cover of thick storm clouds, four Pteras' under the command of Captain Herman from Red River Base comes here to assist with the battle. Back at the deserted village Van asks Dr. D where he can find Irvine. With some reluctance Dr. D tells Van that he is at the Mount Osa Base. Van gets in the Shield Liger and runs off to rescue Irvine. While in the Mount Osa Base, Irvine and Colonel Krueger are having a pilot to pilot talk with each other about the zoids. Captain Herman arrives at the base with his Pteras squadron, but instead of Colonel Krueger, Captain Herman will be piloting the ZG. The advancing Imperial unit makes it to the Mount Osa Base and starts attacking them, but unfortunately, Colonel Krueger is caught in one of the rounds and is hurt. Fortunately, it's not bad. Herman jumps into the cockpit of the ZG and starts his one-zoid barrage against the Imperial Army. Van makes it to the base safely and rescues Irvine right before he falls to the ground. He also learns that he can access the power of the Shield Liger on his own. As Raven looks on, Herman takes out most of the Imperial Army forces, until Major Schubaltz starts retreating. After that Herman grounds the Gojulas.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 11, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = There's a parade in New Helic City celebrating the Republicans' latest victory and Irvine, Moonbay, and Fiona watch it. Van and Zeke wander away and see a lone Imperial soldier being harassed by some Republicans. The Imperial soldier had escaped and was trying to get away from the city. Van feels that the right thing to do is to help him, so he and Zeke chase the Republicans away. The soldier runs away and drops a picture of him and his mother, and Van picks it up. He meets the others at a cafe and tells them what happened. Irvine leaves for a moment and Moonbay says that they should go to the institute that specializes in ancient ruins. Just then, a few trucks pull up with Republican guards in them and one of them is the person that Van and Zeke had chased away (he had told the guards about how Van helped the Imperial soldier). The guards accuse him of being an Imperial spy and do not believe that Hermann gave them their letter that he wrote for them. Irvine drives up in a jeep, throws a smoke bomb, and Van and the others get in and drive away with Zeke running after them. Irvine drives until one of the tires on his jeep is shot, and then they start running. The run into a dead end, but then a guy wearing a frog mask that covers his whole head pops out of the sewer. He takes them down into the sewer while a balloon is released to distract the guards. Irvine takes off the guy's mask and he turns out to be Dr. D! Dr. D takes them to the institute and they break in. They explore the building and find a huge rock pillar with ancient writing on it, like the one Fiona was looking at when she first said 'Zoid Eve', but Fiona does not remember anything and just gets a headache. Then they are surrounded and captured by Republican soldiers. Meanwhile, a large iceberg is headed towards the city. A lady informs the President (President Camford) about the prisoners, Hermann (her son), and the letter (they can not confirm if it's real because Herman is away checking out the iceberg). A guard laughs at Van and tells him that Zeke has been taken away and will be dissected. Van yells at him and then the President and the lady enter. Van yells at them too, but finds out that the old lady is the President and that Hermann is her son. The President sees Dr. D with them and lets them out. Later, Van and Zeke meet up happily and the President asks Dr. D to help out the Republic in the war, but Dr. D does not want to be dragged into another one. Van and the others are looking at the city when they see explosions. The Imperial soldier Van helped has stolen a powerful modified Command Wolf and is fighting some Republic zoids on the streets. Later, Van and the others look at the damage and Van becomes really angry, drops the soldier's picture, and runs off with Zeke. Meanwhile, the soldier is running away from the city when he sees a Shield Liger ahead of him. Van yells at him and the soldier attacks out of fear. Van blocks the shots with his shield, and then knocks him over with his shield and the guy is thrown out of the cockpit. The soldier runs, but Van leaps out of his zoid and chases after him. He jumps on the guy screaming and asking how he could do that. The guy says he was afraid and just trying to get away. Van nearly punches him and starts crying. Irvine and the others arrive and Irvine yells for the soldier to leave or else, and he does. Dr. D tells Van that he did the right thing by helping the soldier, because a life is a life. It does not matter if it's a Republican or Imperial one. Van still cries, though. Meanwhile, Hermann, in a Pteras with two other Pteras units, checks out the iceberg and shoots it to make sure everything's okay, but then he sees oil near the bottom of it. Missiles are launched from the iceberg and snow appears. Then the two other Pteras units are shot down and Hermann tries to contact New Helic City, but can not (due to the jamming snow). Hermann is then shot down. Beneath the iceberg, there is a large Imperial submarine. Inside the submarine is Prozen, planning an attack on New Helic City.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 12, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = As the Imperial Army is getting closer, Captain Herman is swimming really fast to warn their side about the attack from the Empire. While Van, Moonbay and Irvine are planning their next move to the Guerrial Plateau. They also find out a general in the Imperial Army also seeks it and will pay a large reward for any leads. Madam President drops in on the Mount Osa base to check on how Colonel Kruegar is doing. Lieutenant O'Connell of the Red River Base wants to send out a search party to look for the Captain. But the president denies their request. Irvine, Van, Moonbay and Fiona are having dinner while the Lieutenant drops in and is really mad, he says that he will pay anyone enough money from the military to retire if they would steal a Pteras and go rescue the Captain. While on the Imperial Side, Admiral Prozen was making his daily report to the Imperial King Zeppelin. They talked for a bit on how he was going to deal the final blow to the rebels. Then Van and Irvine alongside Moonbay and Fiona broke into the base and stole a Pteras to rescue the Captain. Van and Irvine both stayed at the shore in case the captain returned. Dr. D catches the three soldiers including Captain Rob Herman. Then Van and Irvine appear to rescue Captain Herman. Herman tells the girls that they should tell the Mt. Osa Base to about the attack. Irvine also runs off and Van/Herman go to a nearby Naval Base. Then Raven blows the Naval Base up and challenges him. Van accepts, and all the while Moonbay had made it to the Mount Osa Base. Irvine warns Major Ford who is piloting the Gojulas to make a retreat to the Helic capital, because these Imperial Troops were just trying to get the attention of the Rebels and the ZG. On the battlefield, Van and Raven are having a pretty nice zoid battle, until the Imperial Army decides to attack them. Then Van flees.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 13, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Barely escaping and making it to the front lines at the New Helic Shore, the Republican Army stands and waits for the Imperial Army to attack. Prince Rudolph of the Empire has some bad news about his grandfather. While Prozen gives the Republican President a final ultimatum of surrender or be completely annihilated. Then the Republican Army finds out more bad news, Old Man Krueger, Moonbay and Fiona are still at the Mount Osa Base. Colonel Krueger has an idea of destroying the Mount Osa Base so the Empire can not get its hands on it. Moonbay, Fiona and the Colonel escape through the Pteras. But the explosives did not explode. So the Colonel comes thinks if he blows the Volcano up, the base would explode and all the combat systems on the zoids would freeze. Dr. D was also thinking the same thing. They would fly in with just a couple of Pteras alongside Van and Zeke. Rudolph is informed the current emperor Zeppelin passes away at exactly 11:00 AM. Then Colonel Krueger, Fiona and Moonbay launch the missiles and fail, they needed more missiles if they were going to pull this off. Then Raven shows up with his Saber Fang and blasts them. Van and Raven duke it out then Dr. D and his members of the Pteras team make the Volcano explode and the base explodes along with Marcus. Then Prince Rudolph orders an immediate ceasefire between both nations. Then in the fight, Van had managed to destroy Raven's Saber Fang, but Shadow pulls Raven out of the Saber Fang before it explodes. The Imperial Army starts retreating and the Republicans pull a strategic victory over the Empire.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 14, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After stopping the war and making the Empire retreat peace was restored to the Republic. Van and his friends were off to the Guerrial Plateau to restore Fiona's memory. While at an Imperial Prison Cell, where the bandit Rosso has been residing for the past couple of weeks, is freed with the help of his comrades from the Desert Alcavaleno Gang. Since the death of the late emperor Zeppelin, Crown Prince Rudolph is next in line to become emperor of the Empire. Minister Prozen also mourns the loss of his emperor. Minister Prozen, as regent to Crown Prince Rudolph, would become emperor if anything were to happen to Prince Rudolph. The Desert Alcavaleno Gang is planning on kidnapping the Crown Prince Rudolph and asking for a ransom from the Empire for treating them the way they did. Late at night, Minister Prozen went to a shabby shop where a special forces operative commander by the name of Metlenick was. Metlenick had arranged three republican command wolves to assure that the assassination would look like the republicans had done it to re-new the war. Minister Prozen gives the details of how Rudolph would leave the palace. He would be flying in a Redler guarded by two or three Rev. Raptors basic models at that. The mission would be to take Rudolph out as quickly as possible and most importantly make it look like the Republicans had done it. Rosso and Viola are scoping out the palace while a person from the special forces operative spots them, and tells his boss Metlenick and tails them. Rosso and Viola make it to their hideout but Metlenick's group launches a missile right into their hideout, assuming that they are dead Metlenick resumes his mission. Fortunately, all four of them had gotten into their Molga. The Desert Alcavaleno gang finds Metlenick's hideout and they also learn they are doing a serious co-operative mission to make it look like the rebels had done it. They hit the Command Wolves and knock them all into a Frozen Combat System. Rosso and Viola attack the palace, get Prince Rudolph, and head back to the Iron Kong. Rosso also learns Metlenick's mission was to take out the Prince Rudolph. Van and the gang make it near the Guerrial Plateau only four more days until they get there.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 15, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = A scientist talks to Minister Prozen about the loading process of the new type zoid they had found and the other zoid to which they had made alterations to its zoid core. Van and the rest were going to the Guerrial Ruins. Meanwhile, Rosso and Viola were safe for the time being, they were not chased by the Imperial Army. They planned to ransom the prince to the highest bidder in the Empire. After such a long and hard struggle from the palace to the desert, Rudolph was fast asleep. Rosso and Viola were about to have dinner, but then Rudolph starts to escape. Van, Moonbay, Irvine and Fiona had made it to the Guerrial Plateau and started searching around the ruins. They had split up, Van/Fiona/Zeke went one way and Moonbay/Irvine went around the other way. They had learned that someone had recently been here, after crossing a trapped line, Irvine and Moonbay were chased all over the ruins by a Rev Raptor. Then the same had happened to Van, Fiona and Zeke. Barely hiding from the Rev Raptor, Irvine learned the movements of these zoids were sluggish and they had to be sleeper zoids, later he was able to confirm that by spotting its computer in the cockpit. Irvine also discovers that they had to be programmed not to fire, because it would damage the ruins. Van and Fiona were still running from the Rev Rapter and were cornered by the Rapter, they jumped off the cliff and the Shield Liger w/Zeke had rescued them. Then with a few swift moves, Van takes out all the Rev Raptors with the Liger's shield. Meanwhile, Rosso is having an exchange with Metlenick, Rudolph for money. He gets the money but throws it back and takes Rudolph again. Viola backs them up and they escape. Meanwhile at the ruins, after touching one of the stone tablets, Fiona remembers something called Death Saurer. Later at the Prozen's scientific lab, he calls in Raven and gives him a new type of zoid with modifications to its Zoid Core.\n}}\n| AltDate             = March 18, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Raven starts to rush after Rosso and enters a punk guys territory called Brad.

Rosso and Viola can not find Rudolph anywhere and went searching for him. Moonbay tries to swindle Rudolph out of his Imperial Ring but Van cancels that transaction. While at the Imperial Palace, Prozen gives a magnificent speech on how, if Prince Rudolph does not return before the funeral of the late emperor Zeppelin, he would take office. A fast zoid attacks through the cover of the forest, Viola goes to check it out and it turns out it's Raven in a Geno Saurer (purple/dark purple/black). Rosso was coming to but he'd be a little late. Rudolph was just leaving and was stopped when Fiona creeped everyone out with her little forewarning. Raven arrives and launches his Charged Particle Cannon at Viola and launches another between the Command Wolf and Shield Liger, knocking them down. Raven attacks Van and Irvine, but it proves too much for the heroes. His zoid is much stronger than any of theirs. The Shield Liger's ultimate move had no effect against the Charged Particle Cannon. Rosso and Viola arrive in the Iron Kong and try to hold off Raven so Van can escape. Raven destroys the Iron Kong and then stops his pursuit of Van and Rudolph.

Dr. D tells everyone about the Legend of Beast of Destruction, the Death Saurer. It goes: One Death Saurer, destroyed a platoon of 1,000 zoids and wiped out a whole nation in one night. They figured that Raven has the Death Saurer, and is using its power to destroy the Redlers. In the middle of the night, Van could not sleep because of the Death Saurer and Rudolph was about to run away. He was stopped as Van stood in his way. They also find out that Rudolph is the next in line for the imperial throne. Rudolph also tells about the ambitions that Prozen has to rule the empire and take control of it.

While at the campsite, Fiona starts hearing a voice calling her name. At the mines, Van had given Rudolph his ring back and were looking for a way out. Irvine made it out, but Van and Rudolph were still inside. Then Van took Rudolph after he blinded Metelinick's guys by the stun bomb, into a cart and flew right into the River.

While watching with his comrades, Stinger Thomas finds out that Van is slacking off. Unknowingly, he gives Emperor Rudolph a noogie. Then Lady Marian, the girl that is supposed to wed Rudolph, shows up and starts yelling at Thomas. Stinger scopes the area out and sees that Van's Blade Liger is there. Marian also learns that Thomas is in love with Fiona. She helps out Thomas in trying to get Fiona's affection, they try several methods and none of them seem to work. While all this is going on, Stingers' flunkies the two with the desert Heldigunner zoids, plant explosives under the Redlers so when the lift off they would explode. They cause a distraction, and the Redlers lift off and explode. Then Van and Thomas hear the fire works, they try to head off to their zoids. While they are running, Zeke is caught in a net but not taken\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 18, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Plot: After going head to head combat with Raven, Thomas's Dibison is completely totaled and barely makes it near to a familiar Gustav. Van does some simulation tests at a nearby base to prepare for Raven's arrival. The normal routine, couple of Pteras' and Command Wolves. Then in the middle of the simulation Irvine shows up in his Red Command Wolf, and challenges Van. After a vicious duel at the first, both Irvine and Van stop and try to wash on a nearby lake. Irvine tells Van that he made a heap of prize money in winning a couple of tournaments and then he relaxed for the past couple days at La Fray Beach. When he heard of Raven returning he started coming to this base. Then just before they are about to start Round 2 of their duel, Dr. D drops in with a parachute coming straight from the Wind Colony. He said that there was a way to strengthen the shield on the Blade Liger by at least 2 or 3 times. Unfortunately, Raven hammered his shield and before he was able to finish Van, Shadow took the Geno Saurer away from the battle. Raven was angered by this until he witnesses Shadow form an evolution cocoon around the Geno Saurer.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 19, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Two Stealth Storm Sworders (Triple SSS) were being brought to a Dragon Head Base near the Red River as a symbol for peace. Behind them was Mueller and Major Ralph from the Imperial Air Base Ebinar. Irvine and Van are taking Moonbay's Gustav to the Dragon Head Base, and are wondering why Raven did not finish him off when he had the chance. They find out it was not the Geno Saurer or Raven's will to leave the battlefield, instead it was Shadow's decision to leave. Then the Triple SSS are stolen by Major Ralph and Mueller with the help of Ambient, the red organoid that belongs to Hiltz. When Van and the rest of the gang make it to Dragon Head Base, they find out about the stolen Triple SSS's, and since it fell under Guardian Force headlines, it was their mission to stop them and bring them back. Van believes since the Triple SSSs are not yet equipped with Command Options, they will return for the Command Options. Then Van strategizes a complete and nice way to trap the Triple SSS when they come.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 22, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After taking back the Triple SSS's from Major Ralph and Mueller Van and Fiona are called toward Lumiere Island. It turns out that Dr. D brought them for a swim. After swimming around relaxing. Van starts to search for Fiona and has trouble finding her. Reice tortures Fiona by her psycho waves and plays mind games with her head. Dr. D shows Van the operations room in which all of his girls are doing the hard work of looking at the lost city of the Ancient Zoidians. Fiona is having terrible visions of her life. Dr. D tells Van about the legend on how the city will awake. When two moons are aligned just right, the sea level near the city will fall dramatically, and this only happens every 60 years. The Lost City is accessible for a short amount of time. The eclipse starts and the lost city is unveiled quite nicely. Reice starts attacking Van, first with a decoy Double Sworder and then with after trapping him underwater, with a Hammerhead.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 23, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After returning from Lumiere Island and defeating the Hammerhead, Van had returned to a base near the Geno Saurer's cocoon. An Imperial soldier finds Raven by the Geno Saurer's cocoon. Then the rest of the Imperial soldiers come and arrest Raven. Raven was being interrogated by Major Schubaltz. Then everyone checks out the Geno Saurer's cocoon. The Geno Saurer is evolving but into what? The Republican and Imperial forces collaborate to destroy the cocoon. An all-out assault against the cocoon fails because the glowing cocoon protects and diverts all firepower away from it, the same would have happened if someone had launched an assault on the Shield Liger's cocoon. They were going to wait until the cocoon hatches and the Geno Saurer is reborn for their second assault. There was a fleet of zoids many mixes in the Imperial zoids, several Red Horns and Iron Kong surrounded by Molga and Heldigunner units.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 24, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After suffering major losses at the hands of Raven, the Command Wolf was badly damaged. It was struck with a fatal blow to the Zoid Core, that like the heart. Irvine, pilot of the red Command Wolf, was hurt bad and was in the hospital bed from the last encounter with the Geno Breaker. Then Dr. D shows everyone the Lightning Saix, a new ultra-fast zoid that he was developing for the Empire. Its theories in capability were not enough for Thomas, he wanted to see a test run and that's exactly what he got. In the test run, it took out the Saber Fangs and Helcats within a couple of minutes. But the pilot had lost consciousness with the last launch of anti-zoid missiles and so he was ejected so that he would not get hurt. The Lightning Saix memory bank was damaged really bad. Irvine leaves his bed and goes off to check on his Command Wolf. In a conference, that Emperor Rudolph is holding near the base, where Irvine and the rest are at, the Madam President is traveling by a white Hammerhead.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 25, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After not faring so well against the Geno Breaker last time, this time they brought in Colonel Halford, used to work with Major Dan Flyheight (Van's Father), Halford is a complete jerk and lacks respect for anyone below him. He does have one good point that makes up for his ugly face, he is a Geno Breaker specialist. He analyzed all the aspects of the Geno Breaker, for example, it has a window of 1:05 seconds before it can recharge after the first Particle Beam. It also needs 5.33 seconds to charge the Particle Beam. In their strategy, they want to neutralize the foot locks of the Geno Breaker so it can not fire its Particle Beam. But he does not realize the Geno Breaker can fire from the air as well, it can use it thrusters mounted on the back, where the Pulse Laser Cannons once were, and boost and it would not need a recoil because it is in the air. Then, Thomas, Irvine and Van repeatedly do some exercise.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 26, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After training hard for the arrival of the Geno Breaker, Van had upgraded the booster on the Blade Liger. The upgraded booster made the Blade Liger faster than the Lightning Saix w/o a booster. Reice has a talk about the Geno-Breaker and why it is Red instead of being Dark Blue or Black. It seems that Hiltz must've done something to the previous Geno Saurer that made it come out Red. Also, Hiltz is not interested in either Van or Raven, he just wants who wins. Then Colonel Halford talks to the three pilots about the Geno-Breaker, and how it just finished attacking the Lightning Siax development plant of the Empire and its next target is this base. He also has a talk with Fiona, tells her to ask Thomas and Irvine to remove the electrical pulse generators and degrade the booster of the Blade Liger. He also tells Fiona after that she would be working with the ancient ruins study team again with him instead of this Guardian Force Team.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 29, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After fighting the Geno-Breaker and falling over a cliff into a river Van washes up in a shore. Irvine, Thomas, Fiona and Moonbay start looking for Van, and had been searching for hours without a trace of him, the Blade Liger nor Zeke. Fiona sensed that Van is in a valley, hurt and unable to move for the time being. Irvine and Thomas go into the valley, Irvine spots the Blade Liger and Zeke but no sign of Van though. Then Zeke tells Fiona the cockpit flew open and Van fell into the river. Van, alive and makes it to a village but the people there do not help him. Then after passing out Van gets some sort of dream. In a shock Van wakes up and finds a boy named Nichalo who helped patching him up and his zoid, T-roll. Van teaches Nichalo how to pilot T-roll really fast and smoothly. Meanwhile, the Imperial Army Division base is getting closer to the Village of Nordinance. Thomas does some research on the village, it turns out 10 years ago the Republican Army attacked and destroyed the village.\n}}\n| AltDate             = April 30, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After capturing Captain Sephers and healing up, Van and the newly repaired Blade Liger were ready for some action. The Blade Liger repairs were all completed. Van did a test run with the Blade Liger, and it turned out the Blade Liger was feeling kind of sluggish. Van found out after Dr. D explained to him, that all the motion systems were worn out on the Blade Liger when came here and it also seems that Van has been running the Blade Liger well beyond its capabilities, so now the Blade Liger is not good enough for Van anymore. Then Dr. D shows everyone some of the semi-functional boosters, that may increase the Blade Liger's potential. Moonbay tries to test the boosters out on her Gustav to see how they would work, but it did not work at all, it took the Gustav all over the place. Then Dr. D attaches some functional boosters to the Blade Liger. Before the test run, Fiona wanted to talk about something strange happening to Zeke. But Van told her he will address it after the test run.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 1, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After pulling out the full potential of Zeke and the Blade Liger, the Blade Liger has reached its absolute best under the piloting of Van. A couple of people who were conspiring to kill Emperor Rudolph were placed under arrest. Phantom, the assassin they hired is notorious and he has never missed his intended target or given up on an assignment. When he receives an assignment he thoroughly accomplishes it. Van and Thomas discover that the plot to kill emperor Rudolph will be carried out at the Guylos Grand Prix, the generals who still claim loyalty to Prozen want Emperor Rudolph dead. The Grand Prix attracts much attention from throughout Planet Zi. Moonbay, aka the Red Fireball, will make a grand return to the Grand Prix and is burning every opponent in sight except for one called Masquerade. Meanwhile, Phantom is in the harbor with his stealth Gun Sniper, where, unbeknownst to Van, a sniping shot can be made from the sea.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 2, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After taking down Phantom, before he could kill Emperor Rudolph, Captain O'Connell and Colonel Herman examine the remains of the Gun Snipers that Van destroyed. Thomas and Beek were looking around at the place where the Geno Breaker was first born in search of residual radiation. They are wondering how a Gun Sniper could change shape with just fusing with an organoid. Colonel Schubaltz made it to the Dragon Head Base and they all, including Thomas, make it to the briefing. Dr. D started the briefing for the various enemies more than the Guardian Force had to deal with. Then Dr. D goes over the biographies of the following enemies they have had to tangle with. First they start with a man called Hiltz, then they go on to, Ambient, Reice, Specular, then finally Raven and Shadow. After that briefing was over, Fiona had done a special briefing of her own on the top members of the Guardian Force and analyzes the best tactics the Guardian Force can use against the Geno-Breaker.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 3, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After somehow defeating the Whale King, Van and Thomas find themselves in a mystery. Some people are stealing zoid parts which are still being developed. The weapons have their clear advantage, after finding it out against a couple of Heldigunners. Meanwhile, a Gustav carrying stolen zoid parts from both respective nations stops after it drops some of its cargo. Irvine piloting the Lightning Saix sees they could use a hand and jumps out offering assistance. Irvine finds out what they are carrying and demands an explanation but before that happens, he gets knocked out. He turns on his one eye video piece. He captures the general's face and is later used for military intelligence. When Irvine wakes up he finds out he is being accused of stealing the zoid parts and also his Lightning Saix has been stolen. After the officer in charge denies every one of his statements, they board a militaristic brown Hammerhead.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 6, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = A lone Iron Kong moves to a place with windmills. 3 Saber Fangs appear and declare the Iron Kong's pilot guilty. The Iron Kong fires at them but they disappear. Suddenly a giant zoid with 3 heads appears, Cerberus. It fires at the Iron Kong and defeats it. Its 3 creators laughed as the Iron Kong burns. Meanwhile, Thomas briefs Van and Fiona about the Trinity Ghost, a group responsible for the attack on zoid pilots. unknown to them they are being watched by the Trinity Ghost, and they declare Thomas guilty. When Thomas shows them a sample of the message, he receives one himself. He goes and meet them by himself, and gets beaten pretty badly. Thomas is hospitalized and Van and Fiona visit him, after hearing his account, they go to the site of the incident. Van finds a piece of glass. The trinity ghost watches them and declare Van guilty. Van and Fiona go to the Thomas' former university where new imperial weapons are developed to ask for help.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 7, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = Van, Irvine and Thomas are making some adjustments to the Attack Booster. It seems they attack booster can be upgraded to make the Blade Liger go several times faster. Which would increases the chances of defeating the Geno-Breaker. In some cliffs, Hiltz and Ambient are about to release an ancient type of zoid. At the base, Fiona senses the heat signature of this crude zoid and rushes off. Then Hiltz reports to the Dark Kaizer as Hiltz is talking to the Dark Kaizer, Raven drops in on Hiltz and after a few seconds leaves to the top of the mountain and looks at the stars. He vows next time Van and him meet that one of us will die. Fiona has a bad dream and finds what she sought. At the base, Van went to try out the enhanced booster while, Moonbay, Thomas and Fiona flew off in the Pteras' and Dibison. Later on, Van and Irvine prep their zoids for battle as they hear Raven is approaching in the Geno-Breaker. Moonbay, Thomas and Fiona arrive at the cliffs to find Hiltz has unleashed an ancient scorpion-type zoid, the Death Stinger. Thomas's Dibison unleashes its strongest attack against the resurrected zoid and fails. Finally, while Van, Irvine, and Raven are fighting at a base, the Death Stinger fires a beam from the Charged Particle Gun aimed directly in their path. After the beam is fired the Geno Breaker is damaged and crashes. The story ends with Shadow overheating from being attached to its zoid core and hardening into a stone statue with Raven holding it in tears.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 8, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After being unsuccessful in stopping Hiltz, he takes to orbit in the Hammer Kaizer with the Death Stinger inside. Fiona piloting a Pteras and Moonbay piloting a silver Pteras, they were monitoring the Hammer Kaizer. Hiltz announces to everyone in the Republic about the Death Stinger and asks them the name of the town below there, Major Herman tells him if he does not know then he would not tell him. Hiltz destroys it with a blast of the Charged Particle Gun from the Death Stinger. Major Herman goes to the Capital and asks the Madam President, about taking two Storm Sworders into space. He wants the pilots on Storm Sworders to be Van Flyheight and Thomas Schubaltz. At the battlefield where both Van and Thomas are alongside Irvine, are attacked by a couple of Heldigunners. Van tells Irvine to take his place as the Storm Sworder pilot, and they should leave now. Meanwhile, surrounded by several cliffs, the severely damaged Geno Breaker rests along with Shadow in its left claw.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 9, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After making a direct hit with the surface and surviving the Hammer Kaizer destruction, the Death Stinger made its way to New Helic City. At traveling forty km per day, it would make it to the Capital within two hours. The evacuations of the Republic were mostly complete, only the South and West sectors remain. Emperor Rudolph reassures the president, the defense forces of the Empire will be arriving to give assistance, among them will be Colonel Schubaltz's Armored Panzer Division. Colonel Herman gets an idea to sin the Death Stinger into molten magma, with some strategic bombing the crust will break and the Death Stinger will fall into the magma. Van is still battling it out with Blue Geno Saurer, Reice. While, Raven is still mourning the loss of his organoid, Shadow. As Irvine and Thomas were making it to the Storm Sworders for the bombing run, the Death Stinger changes course and starts heading for the molten lava himself.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 13, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After retreating from the doomed Capital, the Republican and Imperial Forces have been going to Wendeen Lake. This is where the Republican's secret weapon, the Ultrasaurus was resting. A last-ditch strategy they will use to defeat the Death Stinger is under way. They are planning to awaken the Ultrasaurus, a heavy carrier zoid, which would provide them with cover and firepower to take on the Death Stinger. Colonel Herman believes there is only a 50% chance the Ultrasaurus will awaken. Van talks some sense into Colonel Herman and eventually makes him realize, he has to believe in the 50% chance the Ultrasaurus will awaken or it's hopeless. Six power blocks of the Ultrasaurus are ready for action and are functioning well to their maximum. Moonbay got an idea to kick start the seventh power block of the Ultrasaurus. Meanwhile, the Death Stinger slumbering in the molten lava within a mountain, it blows through the mountain with a Charged Particle Beam and sets out after the Ultrasaurus.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 14, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = After the Ultrasaurus had awoken and made it to sea and starts on the journey to the Empire, Van and Irvine start engaging the Helcats and start taking them one by one until the Death Stinger charged its Charged Particle Beam. Van and Irvine, knowing the power of the beam, turned around started to run. As the Charged Particle Beam made its way toward them, both the Blade Liger and Lighting Saix kicked into their boosters and started to run as fast as their zoid's capacity. the beam was going to hit them, but Rosso and Viola picked them up and delivered them to the Ultrasaurus just in the nick of time. Colonel Herman goes over the meeting about the Ultrasaurus and its defenses. Besides basic armaments and normal defensive tactics its completely vulnerable, so they are going to a top secret Imperial Plant to get the Gravity Cannon, once this is in place the Ultrasaurus will be a truly powerful and invincible force to be reckoned with. They had sent out a Hammer Head for surveillance.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 15, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = The Ultrasaurus arrives in an area where there are a lot of islands and finds the one where the gravity cannon is ready to be installed onto it. Krueger is taken to Guygalos to recover and rest, and Rudolph arrives. Then everyone looks at the gravity cannon, and are surprised at how huge it is, but they have to equip it on the Ultrasaurus quickly or the enemy will find them. Meanwhile, Hiltz has arrived in the islands and sends many Sinkers to find the Ultrasaurus. At a meeting, Dr. D explains how the gravity cannon works. There are two parts to it, the actual gun and the power generators. The shell is made of a dense material that has its own gravitational field, and will make a \"\"black hole\"\" when it strikes its target. But there are only three shells, and one must be used for a test shot. Karl is appointed to aim and fire the gravity cannon. Van, Thomas, and Irvine check on their zoids. The gravity cannon is linked to the Ultrasaurus.\n}}\n| AltDate             = May 16, 2002\n| ShortSummary        = The gravity cannon is ready to go up against the Death Stinger, the only problem is that they must get the Death Stinger to hold still long enough for it to feel the full impact of the gravity cannon. The decision to use the delta formation is used. Once the Death Stinger is in sight Van, Irvine, and Thomas leave in their zoids leaving Van as the back point of the triangle. They complete the delta formation, but this time when they get into the formation it creates a pyramid shield barrier trapping the Death Stinger inside. The cannon shoots, but just before it gets close enough to the Death Stinger it breaks the shield barrier and fires its Charged Particle Beam, destroying the shell. The fighters conclude that if they take off their shields they can concentrate more energy on the barrier. The fight commences. Finally they reform the delta formation, this time concentrating all of the energy on the barrier.\n}}\n| AltDate             = January 4, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = After the Death Stinger seemed finished, it was renewed. The Death Stinger is destroyed by the gravity cannon, but Ambient appears and fuses with the destroyed Death Stinger, reviving it. Van and Irvine try to attack, but the DS buried itself into the ground, and went attacking the Ultrasaurus, which injured Dr. D. Also, Raven ran to Shadow, thinking Shadow would be pleased to see him again, but Shadow attacked Raven. The Dark Kaiser came up, and tells Raven that Shadow is now his slave. This angers Raven, and he charges after the Dark Kaiser, but is flipped. Later, Fiona is thunderstruck when she heard \"\"Zoid Eve\"\", and was hit by a stray bullet from the Death Stinger. As usual, Van exited his zoid, and ran to Fiona.\n}}\n| AltDate             = January 4, 2003\n| ShortSummary        =\n}}\n| AltDate             = January 4, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = The final battle between Van and Hiltz has arrived, but Fiona keeps seeing Prozen. Reice, flying on Specular, appears in front of Prozen (Raven, Reice, and their organoids were awakened when Fiona opened the gate to Zoids Eve). It's obvious that Reice is no longer taking orders from the Dark Kaizer. Just when the evil man is about to give her one of his energy blasts, Raven appears in the Geno Breaker. They exchange angry words, and Prozen sends three Geno Saurers to attack. Reice watches tearfully while Raven battles with them. Suddenly, stray gunfire hits the building holding Zoid Eve causing it to activate. The Death Stinger begins to glow. Meanwhile, Lt. O'Connell is flying overhead sending aerial photos to the Ultrasaurus. Captain Herman notices that the Death Stinger is resurrected. Also in the skies is Prince Rudolph and a group of Whale Kings. Rudolph sees a picture of the Dark Kaizer and immediately recognizes him as Prozen. On the ground, Van watches helplessly as the Death Stinger.\n}}\n| AltDate             = January 4, 2003\n| ShortSummary        = In the Final Episode, Van and Raven give it all they got to defeat the resurrected Death Saurer. Hiltz is on a rampage blasting away with the Saurer's Charged Particle Beam. To destroy the Death Saurer, Fiona and Zeke were prepared to sacrifice themselves to destroy Zoid Eve. Doing so, all of the Zoids on Zi would be destroyed. Van stopped them, exclaiming that he could destroy it, by launching himself from the Gravity Cannon on the Ultrasaurus. The energy shield was destroyed by Raven, with the Genobreakers charged particle beam. The Liger was shot out of the cannon and thrust through a charged particle blast right through the Zoid Core of the Death Saurer, destroying it and Hiltz. The Zoid Eve went back underground, and the Death Saurer exploded.\n}}\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
