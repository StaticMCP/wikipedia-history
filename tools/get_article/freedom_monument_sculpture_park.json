QR codes on display near the monument allow visitors to find other African Americans listed in later censuses with the same surname. The park includes 170-year-old dwellings from nearby cotton plantations, objects made by enslaved persons, replicas of rail cars and holding pens, and audio recordings of people speaking in the Muscogee language, the language of the indigenous people of the park's area. The park also includes various sculptures created by Charles Gaines, Alison Saar, and Kwame Akoto-Bamfo, Simone Leigh, Wangechi Mutu, Rose B. Simpson, Theaster Gates, Kehinde Wiley, and Hank Willis Thomas. The park opened on March 27, 2024. Stevenson stated to W that the idea was inspired by his 2021 visit to a former slave plantation (his first visit to any plantation), which he felt marginalized the slave experience in favor of the slaveowner's mansion's architecture.\nA visit to the park begins when visitors are taken across the Alabama River, the same route that enslaved Africans took to get to downtown Montgomery where enslaved families were split up and sold.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
