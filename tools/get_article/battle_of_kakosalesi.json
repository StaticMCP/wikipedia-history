Then came the main force of Skourtaniotis and was involved in the battle which lasted 4 hours, resulting in the flight of the Turks. The losses are recorded as 2 for the Turks and 2 prisoners, and 2 Greeks.\nAccording to a story recorded by a person of origin from Kakosalesi, the women of the village fought bravely and defeated the Turks together with the force of warriors, while it states that pursued they fell into the marshes of the area, where they were all killed by the force of Skourtaniotis who pursued them.\nReferences"
