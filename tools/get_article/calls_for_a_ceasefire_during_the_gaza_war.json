Many international actors perceived an urgent need for a ceasefire due to the severity of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the increasing death toll of civilians, primarily due to the Israeli blockade and invasion of the Gaza Strip. Notably, the leaders of some European governments that generally support Israel in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict were among the voices calling for a ceasefire, including France, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, alongside Turkey, Russia, Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, among others.\nDebates over the impact and timing of a ceasefire became a prominent part of domestic political discourse in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, whose governments have instead called for \"humanitarian pauses\" to the current fighting. As of 11 November 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to reject calls for a ceasefire, while on 13 November, a spokesman for Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades offered to release 70 Israeli hostages in exchange for a five-day truce and ceasefire.\nGovernments calling for a ceasefire\nAfrica\n* : In February 2024, Algeria put forward a United Nations resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and release of all hostages.
