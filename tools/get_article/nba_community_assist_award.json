      "text": "# NBA Community Assist Award\n\nThe National Basketball Association awards the Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for community engagement, philanthropic activity, and charity work. It is a monthly award, but season and off-season awards have also been given. In some cases multiple awards have been given in the same month. In 2022, the season-long award was renamed in honor of late Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer and NBA Global Ambassador, Bob Lanier, following his death for his dedication to teaching NBA values and making a positive impact on communities across the globe.  The award is sponsored by Kia Motors and is part of the NBA Cares program.\nIn the 2012–13 NBA season the season long award was accompanied by a $25,000 donation from Kia and the NBA to a charity of the recipients choice.\nDavid Robinson Plaque\nThe winner of the award is presented a plaque dedicated to David Robinson.
