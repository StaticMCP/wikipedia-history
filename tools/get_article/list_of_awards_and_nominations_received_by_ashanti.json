week of release in the US in April 2002, a record-breaking feat. It was the highest first week sales for a female artist's debut ever.\n*In the same week, she became the first female performer to simultaneously hold the top two places on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart with \"Foolish\", and \"What's Luv\" (with Fat Joe).\n*She broke records again by having four Top Ten songs (Foolish, What's Luv, Ain't It Funny, and Always on Time (with Ja Rule) on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in the same week. Only The Beatles have achieved this at that time. Then Cardi B achieved this later in 2018, making The Beatles, Ashanti, and Cardi B the only artists to achieve this. Ironically, Ashanti wrote and sang background on the remix of \"Ain't It Funny\" sung by Jennifer Lopez which was also in the top 10 charts at the same time as \"Foolish\", \"Always on Time\" (with Ja Rule), and \"What's Luv\" (with Fat Joe) so the singer actually had four top 10 singles in the top ten.\n*According to a report by Billboard.com in 2009, Ashanti has had the most top 10 songs (16 to date) on the R&B/Hip-hop charts by a female for that decade.\nIn 2002,[http://www.amiannoying.com/(S(dlwoc1qny1e1q245yz130y55))/view.aspx?id=3910&collection=482 AmIAnnoying.com]\n*Ashanti took home a record 8 billboard awards, winning all the categories she was nominated for.\n*E!'s 25 Sexiest Women in Entertainment (Ranked: 23)\n*FHM-Singapore's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 95)\n*Lycos' Top 10 Female Searches (Ranked: 17)\n*Lycos' Top 10 Musician Searches for the First Half of 2002 (Ranked: 10)\n*Rolling Stone magazine readers picked Ashanti as Best R&B Artist.\n*She was one Askmen.com's singers of the week Ashanti.[http://www.askmen.com/women/singer/archive13.html AskMen.com - Singers]\nIn 2003,\n*Maxim's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 21)\n*E!'s 25 Young Hollywood Stars (Ranked: 14)\n*FHM-US's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 76)\n*FHM-France's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 82)\n*FHM-Netherlands' 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 71)\n*FHM-Singapore's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 99)\n*Status World's Top 100 Female Celebrities (Ranked: 57)\n*Spike/TNN 100 Most Irresistible Women (Ranked: 82)\n*VH-1's 25 Greatest Rock Star Cameos (Ranked: 18)\nIn 2004,\n*Ashanti was ranked at #63 on VH1's list of The Greatest: 100 Hottest Hotties.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109215638/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_greatest/74681/episode_wildcard.jhtml?wildcard=/shows/dynamic/includes/wildcards/the_greatest/hottest_hotties/complete_list_80.jhtml&event_id=867693 The Greatest | Show Cast, Episodes, Guides, Trailers, Web Exclusives, Previews | VH1.com]\n*Ashanti became the 1st African-American female to lead a national campaign for Herbal Essence.\n*FHM-US's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 32)\n*FHM-Romania's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 92)\n*Maxim's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 29)\n*Real Access Top 24 for 2004 (Ranked: 15)\nIn 2005,\n*Ashanti ranked at #13 on the Maxim Hot 100 List of 2005.\n*Ashanti ranked #81 in FHM's \"100 Sexiest Women in the World 2005.\"\n*BET's All Shades of Fine - 25 Hottest Women of the Past 25 Years (Ranked 14)\n*Billboard's Top 100 Selling CD's (Ranked: 76)\n*Blender Magazine's the Rock Goddess 50 (Ranked: 17)\n*FHM-US's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 81)\n*Marc's List of Hottest Women (Ranked: 26)\n*VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era (Ranked: 46)\n*VH1's 100 Most Wanted Bodies (Ranked: 44)\nIn 2008,\n*Maxim's 100 Sexiest Women (Ranked: 37)\nIn 2009,\n*E!'s 25 Sexiest Pop Stars (Ranked: 19)\nReferences"
