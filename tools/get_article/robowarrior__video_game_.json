During a peaceful period on Altile, Robowarriors are decommissioned from Earth and the Xantho empire invades Altile and try to transform it for personal gain.\nThe player operates a cyborg named ZED (Z-type Earth Defence). In the game, ZED raids Altile to fight the Xantho empire and destroy its leader, Xur. ZED deploys bombs to clear a path through rocks, walls, and forests, while killing enemies and collecting items. Some gameplay elements resemble those of Bomberman (1983).\nThe original Japanese plot of Bomber King is similar, but with some distinct differences. In the year 2036 on the planet Altile, the weather and climate suddenly drastically change due to some mysterious reason. The combat android Knight is sent to the planet to try and track down whatever force is causing the changes and defeat it.\nGameplay\nRoboWarrior consists of five level formats and there are 27 levels in the game. In one, the player must obtain a key before the time limit expires. In another, the key is unavailable until the player acquires a crystal or chalice. Some levels are cast in darkness, rendering obstructions invisible unless the player has a lit lamp. Other levels are mazes where the player must find and blast through weak points in walls to proceed. Periodically, the player engages a boss level. Multiple bombs are required to blow up certain unconventional areas. Robowarrior also features water stages.\nEnemies respawn in each stage allowing the player to stock up on bombs. ZED is controlled via an overhead viewpoint and the player can move him in four directions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
