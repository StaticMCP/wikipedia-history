Though most of the buildings were designed by Dutch architects and dictated by Western architectural styles, even the most ardent style-purists among architects could not escape the forces of context and culture. Dutch colonial architecture often is a result of climatological adaptations or the use of local building materials - and more importantly, the rich and diverse cultural contexts. In this hybridity lies the quality of these buildings. Architecture shows that the strict racial taxonomy of a colonial system could not be maintained.\nDutch colonial architecture is most visible in Indonesia (especially Java and Sumatra), the United States, South Asia, and South Africa. In Indonesia, formerly Dutch East Indies, colonial architecture was studied academically and had developed into a new tropical architecture form which emphasizes on conforming to the tropical climate of the Indies and not completely imitating the architectural language of the Dutch colonists.\nIn Indonesia\nDutch colonial architecture in Indonesia were built across the archipelago that once was known as Dutch East Indies. Dutch colonial architecture in Indonesia is a unique cultural phenomenon. It is a mixture of Dutch colonial and Indonesian culture. It does not exist elsewhere, even in the other former colonized countries. The uniqueness of these buildings can be seen in their colonial relics. As a result, there are large number of colonial buildings concentrated in its cities. Plenty of old VOC era forts and warehouses are also scattered throughout the archipelago, particularly around Maluku Islands and Sulawesi. There are three Dutch colonial architectural styles: Old Indies Style, Indies Empire style, and New Indies Style.\nFile:Fort Rotterdam, Makassar, Indonesia - 20100227-02.jpg|alt=|Fort Rotterdam in Makassar, built in 1673\nFile:National Archives of Indonesia Building (Gedung Arsip Nasional).JPG|alt=|National Archives of Indonesia\nFile:Museum Fatahillah Jakarta 2018 pas.jpg|alt=|Jakarta History Museum, formerly Stadhuis van Batavia\nFile:Gedung_Kesenian_Jakarta,_2018.jpg|alt=|Jakarta Art Building\nFile:Gedung Sate Bandung Jawa Barat.jpg|alt=|Gedung Sate, Bandung\nFile:Lawang Sewu (Timothy Subroto) - Flickr.jpg|alt=|Lawang Sewu, Semarang\nFile:Museum_Wayang,_Jakarta_(2025)_-_img_01.jpg|alt=|Wayang Museum\nFile:Medan old city hall.jpg|alt=|Medan Old City Hall\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Museum-Bank-Indonesia-02.jpg|alt=|De Javasche Bank, now Bank Indonesia\nFile:Yogyakarta Indonesia Bank-Negara-Indonesia-01.jpg|alt=|Bank Negara Indonesia, Yogyakarta\nFile:Warenhuis de vries (27291444521).jpg|alt=|Warenhuis de Vries, Bandung\nFile:Alun_alun_Surabaya.jpg|alt=|Youth building, Surabaya\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Post-office-at-Fatahillah-Square-01.jpg|alt=|Kota Post Office\nFile:Stasiun Tugu 2020 2 New Signage + Nataru.jpg|alt=|Yogyakarta railway station\nFile:Istana Negara (30139691680).jpg|alt=|Merdeka Palace, currently resides the president of Indonesia.\nFile:Bandung - Hotel Savoy Homann (2025) - img 03.jpg|alt=|Savoy Homann Hotel with Dutch Art Deco architecture\nFile:Buildings_at_Braga_Street.jpg|alt=|Art Deco Row Buildings at Braga Street\nFile:Gereja Blenduk Kota Lama Semarang.jpg|alt=|Blenduk Church\nFile:Katedral Jakarta 2016 Bennylin 01.jpg|alt=|Jakarta Cathedral\nFile:Gereja Katolik Kelahiran Santa Perawan Maria, Surabaya.jpg|alt=|Church of the Birth of Our Lady\nIn Americas\nSuriname\nSuriname's capital, Paramaribo is a former Dutch colonial town from the 17th and 18th centuries planted on the northern coast of tropical South America.
