With captured cannon and prisoners, Lisowski moved to join the main forces of False Dmitry in Tushino.\nBattle\nWhile crossing the Moskva River between Kolomna and Moscow,  burdened with captives and a wagon train, Lisowczycy  was suddenly attacked by an elite cavalry regiment loyal to Tsar Vasily IV. Accustomed to maneuvering battles, Lisowczycy suffered a serious defeat and lost all of the Kolomna spoils.\nAftermath\nAfter this defeat, Lisowczycy escaped back to Tushino. False Dmitry II lost important siege equipment and could not attack fortified Moscow, but continued blockade instead.\nReferences"
