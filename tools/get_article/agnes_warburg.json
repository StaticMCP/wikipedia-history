As a result of her Pictorialist approach, she used photography as an art form rather than for commercial gain. Her results using the Autochrome process were of a remarkably high quality.\nWarburg died on 4 January 1953 at her home in Bramley, Surrey, where she had lived for the final seven years of her life. In her will, she gave  of land on Box Hill to the National Trust.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ssplprints.com/image/122699/morning-bathe-by-agnes-warburg-c-1937 Morning Bathe (1937) by Agnes Warburg]"
