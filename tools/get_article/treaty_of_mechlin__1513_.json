The treaty was the first of a series of treaties (the others being the Treaties of London of 1516 and 1518 and the Treaty of Cambrai of 1517) which attempted to unite the main European powers by building a holy league in order to establish a respublica christiana.\nMechlin (or Mechelen) was at the time the seat of Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy and location of her Hof van Savoye.\nReferences"
