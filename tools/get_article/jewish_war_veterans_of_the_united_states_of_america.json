It is the oldest active national veterans' service organization in the US.\nHistory\nJewish War Veterans of the United States of America was established in 1896 by a group of 63 Jewish Civil War veterans after a series of antisemitic comments about the lack of Jewish service in the American Civil War. JWV is one of the Veteran Services Organizations that holds a Congressional charter under Title 36 of the United States Code.\nJWV, as part of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA), opposed the Rosenberg Committee, believing them to be a Communist group. The council issued a statement that the Rosenberg Committee's accusation that the Rosenberg trial was motivated by antisemitism was causing public panic within the Jewish community.\nOrganization\nThe National Convention is the annual assembly of JWV, in which \"supreme power\" is vested. The 128th Annual National Convention in 2023, for example, was held August 27-31 in Jacksonville, Florida. Participation at National Conventions is restricted to voting members of the National Executive Committee who shall vote at the same time with their posts and delegates.\nThe last several years of JWV's annual National Convention:\n* 2018 Convention in Tampa, Florida.\n* 2019 Convention in Richmond, Virginia.\n* 2020 Convention was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* 2021 Convention was held in Orlando, Florida.\n* 2022 Convention was held in Savannah, Georgia.\n* 2023 Convention was held in Jacksonville, Florida.\n* 2024 Convention is slated to be held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\nSubsidiary organizations include the Ladies Auxiliary (Jewish War Veterans Auxiliary, or JWVA), posts or other echelons created outside the United States, and any other subsidiary organizations established by a two-thirds vote of the National Executive Committee.\nLeadership\nJewish War Veterans leadership is organized into, in descending order of rank, a National Commander, a National Vice Commander, the National Executive Committee, departments, district or county councils, and posts. At the 128th annual National Convention, held in Jacksonville, Florida (in August 2023), retired US Army Colonel Barry Lischinsky of Massachusetts was elected as the 92nd National Commander, and retired US Army Command Sergeant Major Gary Ginsburg of New York was elected as the 4th National Vice Commander.\nStaff\nJewish War Veterans is headquartered in Washington, District of Columbia inside the National Museum of American Jewish Military History. Paid staff comprises a National Executive Director, a Director of Operations, a Membership Director, a Communications Director, a National Service Officer, an Accounting Associate, a Building Manager, a Programs & Events Coordinator, and a Public Relations & Graphic Design Coordinator.\nMembership\nMembership eligibility is established in JWV's National Constitution, which lists the categories of membership as active, associate, patron, honorary, in-service, posthumous, life, and distinguished life [https://www.jwv.org/membership/membership-types/ Types of Membership - Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A.], and provides that \"No person who promotes, or is a member of any organization or group which believes in, or advocates, bigotry or the overthrow of the United States government by force of arms or subversion\" shall be eligible for membership.\nPrograms\nJROTC Americanism Award\nJROTC programs can be found at high schools throughout the United States and in Department of Defense Education Activity high schools around the world.

They meet with Members of Congress or their staffs to discuss issues of importance to their specific community, state, or region; these issues are generally related to veterans' issues or antisemitism.\nIn the spring of most calendar years, JWV is among those Veteran Service Organizations whose National Commander provides testimony to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.
