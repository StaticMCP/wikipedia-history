Like The Lego Star Wars Holiday Special, it is directed by Ken Cunningham from a script written by David Shayne. A stand-alone sequel to the Star Wars sequel trilogy, the special was released on Disney+ on August 5, 2022.\nPlot\nFollowing the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Finn, Rey, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, R2-D2 and C-3PO seek a relaxing summer vacation aboard Lando Calrissian's luxury Halcyon starcruiser. After being separated from the group on Calrissian's starcruiser, Finn talks to the Force ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Kenobi tells Finn of his previous summer adventures. With Lt. Valeria, a younger Obi-Wan dressed in a Hawaiian shirt sneaks into Jabba the Hutt's Palace on Tatooine in order to steal coaxium. Kenobi was originally meant to act as a distraction for Jabba but he performs a musical number called \"Gamorrean Girls\" alongside Jabba's dancer Sy Snootles.\nAnakin Skywalker's Force ghost tells Finn about a trip he once took Emperor Palpatine to as Darth Vader during Empire Day (which was after the events of Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith). He takes him to the planet of Scarif, where the original Death Star plans were held.\nPrincess Leia's Force ghost tells Finn about a trip she and Han Solo took the young Ben Solo on when he was a child before receiving Luke Skywalker's Jedi training. While traveling to Mimban, where Han first met Chewbacca, Ben is unimpressed. Wanting to impress him, Han takes him to the forest moon of Endor, where the Battle of Endor took place. They are greeted by resort owner Wick Cooper, whose daughter Ben has a crush on. A show-off joins them and belittles Ben for being short. After taking the Millennium Falcon, Ben flies at the ground and after dropping off Wick's daughter, Han, Leia, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Chewbacca drop Ben off at Luke's Jedi Academy.\nVoice cast\nRelease\nLego Star Wars: Summer Vacation was first announced on May 27, 2022, at Star Wars Celebration.
