It is hosted by Ogie Alcasid, as the journey host, Dingdong Dantes as gala presenter, and Jennylyn Mercado, the show's reality host. It is the first season of GMA's reality talent program, Protégé.\nThe show was first intended to be a \"talent search\" similar to StarStruck and Protégé might have been the replacement of the said show.\nThis show is stapled the timeslot between the two talent shows from other rival shows with ABS-CBN's Pilipinas Got Talent and TV5's Talentadong Pinoy.\nThe result reveals right after the performance. The first two results nights were shown one hour after the performance of the finalists.

As the competition open its doors to a wide array of talent, performances are bound to be spectacular and exciting.

They will groom and help the contestants to stay in the competition. A mentor's role is make his or her protégé shine.\nThey will be aided by two Audition Masters in searching for their protégés. These two audition masters are renowned starmaker Jojie Dingcong and GMA Artist Center Head Arsi Baltazar.\nAspiring protégés will come from two sources.

Second are the aspirants personally invited by the mentors based on the research that the staff conducted.\nWhen faced with the mentors, the aspiring protégés will hear Yes if they are to be considered for the next round or No if they are not. Those who got a Yes will be pooled and the mentors will choose only three each that they will take with them to Manila.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! Casting dates !!

Lovely Embuscado was the Texter's Choice Awardee given PhP50,000 and an exclusive Fanatxt contract from GMA New Media, Inc. and she also received the Sky Flakes Biggest Break Award which composed of PhP100,000. The winner was Krizza Nerri, the RNB Sistah. She received a PhP3,000,000 2-Bedroom Condo Unit from Suntrust Properties, Inc. and PhP1,000,000 from GMA as well as a five-year contract that the other two also received. On GMA Pinoy TV, several parts were unaired or edited out, such as Arnel Pineda's performance and the third round of the top three's performance which featured the song \"Perfect\" by Pink. As in past, it may have been with copyright issues with the songs featured and performed that caused those parts to be edited out and unaired internationally. But other non-copyright parts were unaired/edited out as well such as the judges final words on the three protégés and Krizza and Aiza's words after winning.\nResults show performances\nGroup song\n* Top 10: Song mashup of \"Under Pressure\" / \"Ice Ice Baby\" by Queen ft.
