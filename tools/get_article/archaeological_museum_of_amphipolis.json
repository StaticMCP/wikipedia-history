In the museum, finds from Amphipolis and its surroundings are exhibited.

In the first half of the 5th century BC Alexander I introduced coinage in the Macedonian Kingdom. By extending his kingdom to the east, Alexander I brought more mines, located in the vicinity of Philippi, under his control.  The yield from these mines alone was estimated at one TalentSilver (about 26 kg) per day. Depending on the sufficient availability of the raw material silver, the coins were either made of pure silver or of a silver alloy mixed with other metals. From the 5th century BC BC, two currencies existed in parallel. Heavier and more valuable coins for foreign trade and smaller, lower value, for payments within Macedonia. Towards the end of the 5th century, the smaller pieces of silver were gradually replaced by bronze coins. Philip II of Macedon continued to expand the Macedonian state, gaining control over more mines. In addition to the mint in Pella another was built in Amphipolis. From this time, gold coins were also made to the Attic standard (see Attic talent), which was introduced by Philip II.\nGallery\nImage:Amphipolis frescoes.jpg|Frescoes on display\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-25-Arx_Amphipolis-125.jpg|A sirens statue\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-25-Arx_Amphipolis-126.jpg|First floor exhibits\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-25-Arx_Amphipolis-127.jpg|Inscribed grave stele\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-25-Arx_Amphipolis-128.jpg|Mural paintings\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-25-Arx_Amphipolis-130.jpg|Statues of Orestes and Electra\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120318073827/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh155.jsp?obj_id=3250 Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism]\n*[http://www.museumsofmacedonia.gr/Archaeological_and_Byzantine/Arx_Amphipolis.html Museums of Macedonia]"
