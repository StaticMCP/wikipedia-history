One of the earliest long length films made by the United States government during the war, it attempted to explain the large picture of why the United States was at war, and the various causes and circumstances which brought the war into being.\nThe documentary opens with visuals of the attack on Pearl Harbor and its immediate aftermath. It then traces the previous decade of American involvement in the war, including Kuhn's address at the German-American Bund, speeches by isolationist U.S. Senators Nye and Wheeler, Japan's invasion of China, Italy's war on Ethiopia, Hitler's Anschluss, the Spanish Civil War, the Munich Agreement, the rape of Czechoslovakia, and the invasion of Poland. In covering the outbreak of total war, the film uses footage from Nazi propaganda films Feldzug in Polen and Sieg im Westen.\nIt was a precursor to the better known six-part Why We Fight propaganda film series directed by Frank Capra.\nSee also\n*List of Allied propaganda films of World War II\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
