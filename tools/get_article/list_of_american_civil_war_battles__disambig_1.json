Virginia in particular was the site of many major and decisive battles. These battles would change the standing and historical memory of the United States.\nFor lists of battles organized by campaign and theater, see:\n* Eastern Theater of the American Civil War\n* Western Theater of the American Civil War\n* Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War\n* Pacific Coast Theater of the American Civil War\n* Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War\n* :Category:Battles of the American Civil War\nSome battles have more than one name. For instance, the battles known in the North as Battle of Antietam and Second Battle of Bull Run were referred to as the Battle of Sharpsburg and the Battle of Manassas, respectively, by the South. This was because the North tended to name battles after landmarks (often rivers or bodies of water), whereas the South named battles after nearby towns.\nBattles rated by CWSAC\nThe American Battlefield Protection Program (ABPP) was established within the United States National Park Service to classify the preservation status of historic battlefield land. In 1993, the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission (CWSAC) reported to Congress and the ABPP on their extensive analysis of significant battles and battlefields. Of the estimated 8,000 occasions in which hostilities occurred in the American Civil War, this table and related articles describe the 384 battles that were classified in CWSAC's ''Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields''. In addition to the status of battlefield land preservation (not included in this table) CWSAC rated the military significance of the battles into four classes, as follows:\n:{| width=90%\n|Class A&nbsp;– Decisive: A general engagement involving field armies in which a commander achieved a vital strategic objective.  Such a result might include an indisputable victory on the field or be limited to the success or termination of a campaign offensive. Decisive battles had a direct, observable impact on the direction, duration, conduct, or outcome of the war.\n|-\n|Class B&nbsp;– Major: An engagement of magnitude involving field armies or divisions of the armies in which a commander achieved an important strategic objective within the context of an ongoing campaign offensive. Major battles had a direct, observable impact on the direction, duration, conduct, or outcome of the campaign.\n|-\n| Class C&nbsp;– Formative: An engagement involving divisions or detachments of the field armies in which a commander accomplished a limited campaign objective of reconnaissance, disruption, defense, or occupation. Formative battles had an observable influence on the direction, duration, or conduct of the campaign.\n|-\n| Class D&nbsp;– Limited: An engagement, typically involving detachments of the field armies, in which a commander achieved a limited tactical objective of reconnaissance, defense, or occupation. Limited battles maintained contact between the combatants without observable influence on the direction of the campaign.\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|+ Battles of the American Civil War Rated by CWSAC\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date !! rowspan=\"2\" width=20%\"|Battle !! rowspan=\"2\"|State !! rowspan=\"2\"|CWSAC !! colspan=\"2\"|Outcome\n|-\n!Victory !! class=\"unsortable\"|Notes\n|-\n| –13, 1861 || Battle of Fort Sumter || South Carolina || style=\"text-align:center;\" |A ||  style=\"background: #800000; color: white;\"|Confederate || Beauregard takes Charleston Federal fort in the first battle of the American Civil War.\n|-\n| –19, 1861 || Battle of Sewell's Point || Virginia || style=\"text-align:center;\" |D || Inconclusive || Union gunboats fight inconclusive battle with Confederate artillery.\n|-\n| &nbsp;– June 1, 1861 || Battle of Aquia Creek || Virginia || style=\"text-align:center;\" |D || Inconclusive || Confederate artillery hit by naval bombardment, later withdrawn.\n|-\n|  || Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) || West Virginia || style=\"text-align:center;\" |D ||  style=\"background: #1F305E; color: white;\"|Union || Union forces rout a small Confederate detachment in Western Virginia.\n|-\n|  || Battle of Big Bethel || Virginia || style=\"text-align:center;\" |C ||  style=\"background: #800000; color: white;\"|Confederate || Union attack on Confederate positions near a church repelled.\n|-\n|  || Battle of Boonville (Missouri) || Missouri || style=\"text-align:center;\" |C ||  style=\"background: #1F305E; color: white;\"|Union || Union forces defeat pro-Confederate governor's Missouri State Guard.\n|-\n|  || Battle of Hoke's Run || West Virginia || style=\"text-align:center;\" |D ||  style=\"background: #1F305E; color: white;\"|Union || Robert Patterson defeats Jackson's Confederates but fails to capitalize on his victory.\n|-\n|  || Battle of Carthage || Missouri || style=\"text-align:center;\" |C ||  style=\"background: #800000; color: white;\"|Confederate || Confederate victory in Missouri during U.S. Civil War.\n|-\n|  || Battle of Rich Mountain || West Virginia || style=\"text-align:center;\" |B ||  style=\"background: #1F305E; color: white;\"|Union || Confederate forces under Gen.
