The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are among the world's oldest and most prestigious film prizes. They were first handed out on May 16, 1929 by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and have been given annually ever since. Even though a separate prize has existed for foreign language films since the 1956 Academy Awards, such films continue to be eligible for Academy Awards in other categories, including Best Picture, provided that they have been commercially released in Los Angeles County, California and that they comply with the special rules governing those categories. The French comedy À Nous la Liberté (1931) was the first foreign language film to be nominated for an Academy Award (Best Art Direction); the German-language Swiss drama Marie-Louise (1944) was the first to actually win one (Best Original Screenplay).\nAlthough a Los Angeles theatrical release is not required for eligibility for the Best International Feature Film Award itself, it is a prerequisite for consideration for Academy Awards in other categories. In the past, this had enabled some foreign language films to receive nominations over multiple years, the most recent case being that of the Italian comedy-drama Amarcord (1973). Because such films were still unreleased in Los Angeles when they were submitted to the Academy, they could only be nominated in the Foreign Language Film category. However, upon their Los Angeles release, they became eligible for other Academy Awards, and often ended up receiving nominations in various categories one year after their initial Foreign Language Film nomination. Presently, such nominations over multiple years are no longer possible since the current rules of the Academy unambiguously state that: \"Films nominated for the Best International Feature Film Award shall not be eligible for Academy Awards consideration in any category in any subsequent Awards year.\" This restriction, however, does not apply to submitted films that were not selected as nominees. The Brazilian film City of God (2002) was thus able to receive four Academy Award nominations for the 2003 Academy Awards, even though it had failed to garner a Foreign Language Film nomination as Brazil's official submission for the 2002 Academy Awards.\nBackground\n(here in 1991) was the first ever actress to win an Academy Award for a foreign language performance, for her work in Two Women (1960)]]\nForeign films are not to be confused with foreign language films. A foreign film is a motion picture produced outside the United States, regardless of the language used in its dialogue track. A foreign language film, on the other hand, is a predominantly non-English speaking motion picture, regardless of where it was produced. Although the overwhelming majority of foreign language films are foreign, this is not always the case: in recent years, for instance, several non-English speaking American films such as The Passion of the Christ (2004), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) or Minari (2020) have been nominated for Academy Awards (American films have never been eligible for the Best International Feature Film Award, even if none of the dialogue is in English). Such films are included in this list. On the other hand, foreign films where the majority of the dialogue is in English — such as the Indo-British co-production of Gandhi (1982) — are not taken into account. The article also includes films such as the Japanese anime Spirited Away (2001) that were initially released in their native country in a foreign language but were nominated by the Academy for the English-dubbed version under which they were shown in Los Angeles. The films are grouped by award category, and are arranged chronologically within each category. The years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release; the ceremonies are always held the following year. The winning films are in bold and in light blue background; the presence of an Oscar statuette indicates the official recipient of the award.\nBest Picture\nThe Best Picture category has existed since the creation of the Academy Awards. Its name has changed several times over the years. When Grand Illusion (1937) was nominated, the name of the category was Outstanding Production; the Best Picture designation has been continuously used since the 1962 Academy Awards. Individual producers have been officially nominated for this award since the 1951 Academy Awards. Previously, the nominations went to the production companies instead.\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px #555 solid; text-align:center\"

The intended recipient(s) of this award must be designated by those responsible for the production of the film. Agreement on the designated recipient(s) has to be settled prior to the film's submission to the Academy. Unlike other Academy Awards, the Best Animated Feature Film Award therefore does not always go to the same crew member. However, the person(s) to whom it is given must always be \"the key creative individual most clearly responsible for the overall achievement or a two-person team with shared and equal directing credit\".\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px #555 solid; text-align:center\" class=\"sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"18%\" | Film title used in nomination\n! width=\"18%\" | Original title\n! width=\"18%\" | Award recipient(s)\n! width=\"18%\" | Country of production\n! width=\"18%\" | Language(s)\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|- bgcolor=\"#91CFF6\"\n| 2002(75th)\n| Spirited Away\n| Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi千と千尋の神隠し\n| (director & writer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese(nominated for its English-dubbed version)\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2003(76th)\n|\n| Les Triplettes de Belleville\n| (director & writer)\n| align=\"left\" |  France Belgium Canada United Kingdom\n| French\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2005(78th)\n| ''Howl's Moving Castle\n| Hauru no ugoku shiroハウルの動く城\n| (director, writer & executive producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese(nominated for its English-dubbed version)\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2007(80th)\n| Persepolis\n| Persépolis''\n| (directors & writers)\n| align=\"left\" |  France Iran\n| French(some parts in English, Persian & German)\n|\n|-bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2010(83rd)\n| The Illusionist\n| ''L'Illusionniste\n| (director & writer)\n| align=\"left\" |  France\n| French(some parts in English and Gaelic)\n|\n|-bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| rowspan=2|2011(84th)\n| A Cat in Paris\n| Une vie de chat\n| (director & writer)(director)\n| align=\"left\" |  France Belgium  Netherlands Switzerland\n| French\n|\n|-bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| Chico and Rita\n| Chico y Rita\n| (director & writer)(director)\n| align=\"left\" |  Spain United Kingdom\n| Spanish(some parts in English)\n|\n|-bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| rowspan=2|2013(86th)\n| Ernest & Celestine\n| Ernest et Célestine\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  France Belgium\n| French\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| The Wind Rises\n| Kaze tachinu風立ちぬ\n| (director & writer)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2014(87th)\n| The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\n| Kaguya-hime no Monogatariかぐや姫の物語\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n|rowspan=2| 2015(88th)\n| Boy and the World\n| O Menino e o Mundo\n| (director)\n| align=\"left\" |  Brazil\n| Brazilian Portuguese\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| When Marnie Was There\n| Omoide no Mānī思い出のマーニー\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n|rowspan=2| 2016(89th)\n| My Life as a Courgette\n| Ma vie de Courgette\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  France Switzerland\n| French\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| The Red Turtle\n| La Tortue Rougeレッドタートル ある島の物語\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  France Belgium Japan\n| No dialogue\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2018(91st)\n| Mirai\n| Mirai no Mirai未来のミライ\n| (director)Yuichiro Saito(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2019(92nd)\n| I Lost My Body\n| J'ai perdu mon corps\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  France\n| French\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\"\n| 2021(94th)\n| Flee\n| Flugt\n| (director)(producer)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  United States   United Kingdom   France   Sweden   Norway   Denmark\n| Danish\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#91CFF6\"\n| 2023(96th)\n| The Boy and the Heron\n| Kimitachi wa Dō Ikiru ka君たちはどう生きるか\n| (director)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Japan\n| Japanese\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#91CFF6\"\n| 2024(97th)\n| Flow\n| Straume''\n| (director & producer)(producer)(producer)(producer)\n| align=\"left\" |  Latvia France Belgium\n| No dialogue\n|\n|}\nAnimated Short Film\nThe Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film has been awarded since the 5th Academy Awards, covering the year 1931–32, to the present.
