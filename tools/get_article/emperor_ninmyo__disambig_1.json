Ninmyō's reign lasted from 833 to 850, during the Heian period.\nTraditional narrative\nNinmyō was the second son of Emperor Saga and the Empress Tachibana no Kachiko.  His personal name (imina) was .  After his death, he was given the title .\nNinmyō had nine Empresses, Imperial consorts, and concubines (kōi); and the emperor had 24 Imperial sons and daughters.\nEmperor Ninmyō is traditionally venerated at his tomb; the Imperial Household Agency designates , in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, as the location of Ninmyō's mausoleum.\nEvents of Ninmyō's life\n, 1800 and 1805, (Rijksmuseum Amsterdam)]]\nNinmyō ascended to the throne following the abdication of his uncle, Emperor Junna.\n* 6 January 823 (): Received the title of Crown Prince at the age of 14.\n* 22 March 833 (): In the 10th year of Emperor Junna's reign, the emperor abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by his adopted son.  Masara-shinnō was the natural son of Emperor Saga, and therefore would have been Junna's nephew.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Ninmyo is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\nShortly after Ninmyo was enthroned, he designated an heir.  He named Prince Tsunesada, a son of former Emperor Junna, as the crown prince.\n* 835 (): Kūkai (known posthumously as Kōbō-Daishi) died.  This monk, scholar, poet, and artist had been the founder of the Shingon or \"True Word\" school of Buddhism.\n* 838-839 (Jōwa  5-6): Diplomatic mission to Tang China headed by Fujiwara no Tsunetsugu.\n*842: Following a coup d'état called the Jōwa Incident, Tsunesada the crown prince was replaced with Ninmyō's first son, Prince Michiyasu (later Emperor Montoku) whose mother was the Empress Fujiwara no Junshi, a daughter of sadaijin Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu. It is supposed that this was the result of political intrigue planned by Ninmyō and Fujiwara no Yoshifusa.  The first of what would become a powerful line of Fujiwara regents,  Yoshifusa had numerous family ties to the imperial court; he was Ninmyō's brother in law (by virtue of his sister who became Ninmyō's consort), the second son of sadaijin Fuyutsugu, and uncle to the new crown prince.\nIn his lifetime, Ninmyō could not have anticipated that his third son, Prince Tokiyasu, would eventually ascend the throne in 884 as Emperor Kōkō.\n* 6 May 850 (): Emperor Ninmyō died at the age of 41.  He was sometimes posthumously referred to as \"the Emperor of Fukakusa\", because that was the name given to his tomb.\nEras of Ninmyō's reign\nThe years of Ninmyō's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (nengō).\n* Tenchō  (824–834)\n* Jōwa    (834–848)\n* Kashō    (848–851)\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.
