In the 1940s, during the occupation of Poland in the Second World War, it was turned into a farmland. In 1947, the land was donated to the city of Warsaw, for it to establish there a recreational area, named the Powsin Holiday Resort (Polish: Ośrodek Wczasów Świątecznych w Powsinie). In 1956, it was renamed to the Powsin Culture Park.\nCharacteristics\nThe Powsin Culture Park is located in the neighbourhood of Skarpa Powsińska, within the district of Ursynów, and near the border of Wilanów, at 1 Maślaków Street. It borders the Kabaty Woods and the Polish Academy of Sciences Botanical Garden – Powsin Centre for Biological Diversity Conservation. The park has the total area of 35 ha.\nIt is a recreational area with many sports and cultural amenities, including basketball and volleyball courts, swimmingpool, acoustical shell, and camping huts.\nThere grows a 24-metre-tall pedunculate oak tree, nicknamed Hetman, with the status of the natural monument.\nReferences"
