These include pain, drugs and sex. As Guide du Rôliste Galactique notes, \"some ideas and illustrations in the book are clearly reserved for adults.\"\nThe book covers the history of this tradition, the current state of the cult and its code of conduct, relations with sleepers, vampires, and satyrs, various classes within the cult, and several notable members of the cult.\nPublication history\nWhite Wolf first published Mage: The Acension in 1994, and supported it with many supplements, including a number of \"Tradition Books\" that described the various factions of Mages. This included Cult of Ecstacy, a 72-page softcover book released in July 1996. It was designed by Phil Brucato, with interior art by Darryl Elliott, Mark Jackson, Leif Jones, Heather J. McKinney-Chernik, and Joshua Gabriel Timbrook, and cover art by Michael Wm. Kaluta.\nAn expanded 104-page second edition was published in November 2001, designed by Lynn Davis and Jess Heinig, with interior art by Leif Jones, Matthew Mitchell, Steve Prescott, Alex Sheikman, Melissa Uran, and cover art by Christopher Shy.\nReception\nAdam Tinworth reviewed Cult of Ecstasy Tradition Book for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall, and commented that \"Any player or referee will find this a valuable guide to playing Ecstatics. It lends validity to the claim that roleplaying is becoming a mature hobby. And I guarantee everyone will be very keen to read it from its glittery front cover to its glittery back cover.\"\nOther reviews\n* #36 (Dec 2001) p. 104\n*Casus Belli V1 #97 (Sep 1996) p. 10\nReferences"
