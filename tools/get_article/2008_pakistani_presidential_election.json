The Electoral College of Pakistan – a joint sitting of the Senate, National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies – elected a new president after the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf. As required by the constitution, Muhammad Mian Soomro (in his position as Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan) automatically became acting president on 18 August 2008, upon the resignation of Musharraf. The constitution required that a new president be elected by Parliament within 30 days; Soomro was considered loyal to Musharraf, and it was considered certain that he would be replaced in that election.\nComposition of the Electoral College\nThe Electoral College of Pakistan is formed by a joint sitting of the six leading political bodies in Pakistan:\n* the Senate of Pakistan,\n* the National Assembly of Pakistan,\n* the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab,\n* the Provincial Assembly of Sindh,\n* the Provincial Assembly of Balochistan\n* the Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\nSo that each province has an equal vote, all provincial assemblies are given exactly 65 votes in the electoral college. This mean that the each member of the Punjab Assembly has 65/370 = 0.176 votes, each member of the Sindh Assembly has 65/166 = 0.392 votes, each member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly has 65/124 = 0.524 votes and each member of the Balochistan Assembly has 65/65 = 1 vote.\nThe political composition of these bodies at the time of the election was:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

BBC reported that Zardari \"won 419 votes, far more than the 372 votes that would have guaranteed him victory.\" The New York Times said that Zardari would be sworn in \"as soon as Saturday night or as late as Monday or Tuesday, diplomats and officials said.\"\nThe new president, who obtains the largest number of votes, will serve for 5 years as Pakistan's 11th since 1956, when the country became a republic, excluding acting presidents. Voting was in progress at the Parliament House, while the Senate members finished casting their votes, amid the death of 12 people, after a suicide car bomber blasted a security checkpoint on the outskirts of Peshawar.\nViolation of rules in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\nA number of MPAs of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly including the Chief Minister violated the secret ballot by displaying the stamped ballot papers in the presidential elections. So these votes have to be subtracted from the vote count.\nReaction\nPakistan Peoples Party activists in Pakistan held rallies and distributed sweets when the results were announced. The main opposition party, PML-N, said it was the \"success of the democratic process in the country\" but said he should resign as PPP co-chairman, as the President has traditionally been apolitical, and to transfer Presidential powers back to parliament. The newspaper 'Dawn' described Zardari as the most controversial President of Pakistan at the time of his election, and urged him to \"dispel the impression of a political wheeler-dealer and rise to the requirements of statesmanship\". The Regional Times of Sindh said Zardari had one of the stiffest jobs in the world as leader of the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic country, a frontline war on terror state and facing \"growing militancy\" and \"crippling economic woes\". However, they said his \"years of suffering have made him wiser and headstrong\" and he has \"displayed great acumen and maturity since returning to the political scene\". Privately, the Pakistan military, bureaucracy and business elite were said to be \"aghast\" at the result given past corruption allegations.\nThe United States Secretary of State welcomed Zardari's victory, praising his \"emphasis on fighting terrorism\" and \"very strong words of friendship and alliance with the United States\".\nSee also\n* Elections in Pakistan\n* President of Pakistan\n* Pakistan\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.president.gov.pk/The President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan]\n* [http://www.ecp.gov.pk/ Election Commission of Pakistan ]"
