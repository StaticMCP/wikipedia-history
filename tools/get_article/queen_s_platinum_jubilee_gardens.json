Each of the 13 gardens include plants suited to the local climate, tobacco being commonly incorporated to represent the relationship between Canada's Crown and Indigenous peoples. The tobacco seeds were drawn from plants grown for the chapel royal in Toronto.\nProvinces\nNew Brunswick\nThe Platinum Jubilee Garden was officially opened on June 26, in the grounds of Government House in Fredericton. Lieutenant Governor Brenda Murphy said the garden, \"will serve as a living tribute to Her Majesty, where New Brunswickers can reflect upon her unprecedented reign\".\nOntario\nOn September 30, Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, unveiled the Platinum Jubilee Garden on the grounds of the Legislative Building in Queen's Park. It was designed in partnership with Elder Carolyn King, of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, and tobacco plants place a special focus on the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples. It also features the first plaque in Queen's Park to recognize Treaty 13 territory and include an Indigenous language. The stone border of the garden also features four Moccasin Identifiers.\nPrince Edward Island\nin Charlottetown]]\nPrince Edward Island's Platinum Jubilee Garden was unveiled by Lieutenant Governor Antoinette Perry at Government House in Charlottetown, on June 2, 2022. The garden includes a special tulip created for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012, plants native to the island, flowers representing the first groups to settle in the province—lavender for the English and French and thistle for the Scottish and Irish. Ceremonial tobacco was also included to honour the Mi'kmaq people.\nPerry, who personally oversaw the garden's design, said she was \"so happy to have honoured Her Majesty's Platinum Jubilee in this way [...] I can just see her sitting on the bench admiring the beauty of this garden and treasuring it, because she does love Prince Edward Island. I know that, she told me that\".\nSaskatchewan\nSaskatchewan's Platinum Jubilee Garden, adjacent to the northwest lawn in the Edwardian Gardens, on the grounds of Government House, Regina, was unveiled by Lieutenant Governor Russ Mirasty on July 19, 2022.

At the centre is the Queen Elizabeth rose and, recognizing the ties between the Crown and Indigenous peoples, also includes tobacco plants, as well as flora native to the province, such as Labrador tea, prairie smoke, common yarrow, and western silvery aster.
