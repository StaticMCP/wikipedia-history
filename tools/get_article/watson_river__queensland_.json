From source to mouth, the Watson River is joined by four tributaries, descending  over its  course.\nThe catchment occupies an area of  and is bordered by the Archer River drainage basin to the south. The catchment contains large wetland areas with the margins covered in stringybark forests and paperbark lined lagoons that are vital refuges for wildlife during the dry season.\nSeveral species of fish are known to inhabit the river including the empire gudgeon, northern trout gudgeon, chequered rainbowfish,  black-banded rainbowfish, banded rainbowfish, spotted blue-eye, Obbes catfish, delicate blue-eyes fish and barramundi.\nThe traditional owners of the area are the Wik, Winda Winda and Mbelwum peoples.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences"
