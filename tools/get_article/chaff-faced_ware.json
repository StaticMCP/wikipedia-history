In the South Caucasus, its variant is known as Leyla-Tepe culture, while in northern Mesopotamia it is usually referred to as Amuq F pottery.\nOrigin\nInitially, Chaff-Faced Ware was associated with northern Mesopotamia, Syria and a migration of Uruk people, but recently the discovery of large number of Chaff-Faced Ware sites in the South Caucasus has changed the perceptions about its origins. Catherine Marro concluded that the core region from where the ware emerged was between the Euphrates and the Kura basin. The tempering chaff in the pottery was frequent in South Caucasian Neolithic sites.\nSee also\n* Leyla-Tepe culture\n* Amuq\n* Areni-1 cave\nReferences"
