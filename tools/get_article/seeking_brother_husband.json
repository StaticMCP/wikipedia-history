It is a spin-off of the show Seeking Sister Wife.\nBackground\nTLC tried to frame the show as polyandrous (one wife, multiple husbands), to parallel their other polygynous (one husband, multiple wives) show, Seeking Sister Wife. However polyandry is very rare, and many of the couples on the show have previously been public about being polyamorous (both parties have multiple partners, typically casual ones).\nElisa Alpizar & Mike Onorato have hosted a podcast called Poly+Amor=Us since Jan 31, 2021. Kenya and Carl Stevens run a website called the Progressive Love Academy (PSALMS) and Carl has a second wife, Corina Naré Seku.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Couple\n!
