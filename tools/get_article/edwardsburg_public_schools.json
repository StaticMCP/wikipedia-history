It serves Edwardsburg, Ontwa Township, and parts of Howard Township, Jefferson Township, Mason Township, and Milton Township in Cass County.\nHistory\nThe first school in Edwardsburg opened in 1829. A two-story school was built in 1861, and Edwardsburg Consolidated School opened in 1923.\nGroundbreaking for Edwardsburg High School, designed by architecture firm Louis C. Kingscott and Associates, was held on February 23, 1960. The school was largely complete by November, 1960 and was dedicated on May 21, 1961.\nThe junior high school, now known as the middle school, opened in fall of 1970. The Intermediate School opened in fall of 2001.\nBefore the current high school was built, the high school was located in Edwardsburg Consolidated School, at the southwest corner of Section Street and Main Street on the current high school campus. When the old Consolidated School was torn down around 2003, its entrance arch was retained and a small park built around it.\nSchools\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Schools in Edwardsburg Public School District\n!
