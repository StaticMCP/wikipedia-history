The match had a series of brutal fouls by both sides, due to the lax officiating of Hungarian referee Pál von Hertzka.\nOverview\nAt the match, which also opened the rebuilt Stade du Parc Lescure, Brazil took the lead 1–0, with Czechoslovakia equalizing on a penalty kick for ball handling by Domingos da Guia. The Brazilian Zezé Procópio was sent off after fourteen minutes. The Brazilian Arthur Machado and the Czechoslovak Jan Říha were sent off just before full time. It was the first time that three players were sent off in a World Cup match, a record that was equaled at the Battle of Berne 1954 between Hungary and Brazil, and exceeded at the 2006 World Cup match between Portugal and Netherlands. Captain František Plánička and Oldřich Nejedlý from Czechoslovakia suffered a broken right arm and right leg respectively in the mayhem. Their teammate Josef Košťálek was injured in the stomach.\nThe match was drawn 1–1 after 90 minutes of full-time, and a 30-minute extra time had to be played. Nejedlý had abandoned the game before the end of regulation time due to his injury, but Plánička stayed at the Czechoslovak goal in pain through the rest of the second half and the extra time. Three other Brazilians, including Leônidas and Perácio, also left the field with injuries.\nThe match eventually ended 1–1 after extra time, and had to be replayed 2 days later, with both teams having to field several reserves. Brazil won the replay 2–1, eliminating Czechoslovakia and advancing to semi-finals, where they faced eventual champions Italy.\nMatch\nOriginal match\nReplay\nSee also\n*Battle of Berne (1954 FIFA World Cup)\n*Brazil v Poland (1938 FIFA World Cup)\n*Brazil at the FIFA World Cup\n*Czech Republic at the FIFA World Cup\n*Slovakia at the FIFA World Cup\nNotes\nReferences"
