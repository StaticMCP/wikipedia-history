The timeline of the events of the riots spanned from 6–10 August.\nSaturday, 6 August\nProtest march\nOn 6 August, an initially peaceful protest was held, beginning at Broadwater Farm and finishing at Tottenham police station. The protest was organised by friends and relatives of Mark Duggan (who was killed by police on 4 August 2011), to assert a perceived unmet need for justice for the family. The rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from Broadwater Farm to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road. The group demanded that a senior local police officer speak to them. They stayed in front of the police station hours longer than originally planned because they were not satisfied with the seniority of the officers available at the time. A younger and more aggressive crowd arrived around dusk, some of whom were armed. Violence broke out following a rumour that police had attacked a 16-year-old girl.\nTottenham\nA series of disturbances by people in Tottenham followed the protest march on 6 August. The rioting occurred shortly after about 120 people marched from Broadwater to Tottenham Police Station via the High Road. Tottenham is in the London borough of Haringey, which has the fourth highest level of child poverty in London and 8.8% unemployment.\nAt 22:15, a gang of youths burned down Tottenham's post office. From around 22:30, attacks were carried out on police cars, a double-decker bus and local businesses and homes. Police vans and officers from the Territorial Support Group attended the disorder on Tottenham High Road. Shops windows were smashed and the shops looted by rioters. Fireworks, petrol bombs and other missiles were thrown at police. Twenty-six officers were injured, including one who sustained head injuries. Firefighters experienced difficulty reaching a burning building because of the disorder.\nA BBC News correspondent said his news crew and vehicle came under attack from youths throwing missiles. Some news crews left the scene due to the threat of violence. The police set up a cordon around Tottenham police station and a nearby group of BBC and Sky journalists. Some of the police were on horseback.\nTottenham Hale\nThe violent clashes were followed by the looting of Tottenham Hale retail park, which continued until dawn without police intervention.\nInjuries and arrests\nLondon Ambulance Service confirmed that ten people had been treated for injuries and that nine were in hospital.\nSunday, 7 August\n}}\nLondon incidents\nEnfield and Ponders End\nOn Sunday evening, 7 August, violent disturbances erupted in Enfield, to the north of Tottenham, among a heavy presence of riot police.\nEnfield Town centre, Enfield Town Park and alleyways between there and the Palace Garden shopping centre were guarded by police.
