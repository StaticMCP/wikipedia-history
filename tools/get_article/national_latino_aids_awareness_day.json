It is a national community mobilizing and social marketing campaign co-ordinated by the Latino Commission on AIDS and the Hispanic Federation in partnership with commercial sponsors, community and public health organisations.\nNational coordination, local ownership\nA National Planning Committee coordinates NLAAD, retains a national convenor and supplies participating organisations with materials such as campaign kits and with advice. Each local participating organisation organises its own activities tailored to their particular community. All aim to promote or sponsor prevention activities, including counselling and testing. Some also undertake to educate community leaders and public officials in reducing new infections and caring for Latinos living with HIV/AIDS. Some organise cultural events and celebrations. Each local group is largely responsible for raising funds for their organized activities.\nHistory\n2003\nThe first NLAAD was in 2003, initiated by the Latino Commission on AIDS under the leadership of Dennis deLeon joined by the Hispanic Federation and attracted support from various community groups. In a media release announcing the event, deLeon was quoted: \"AIDS has disproportionately affected Latinos whom represent 14% of the United States population (including Puerto Rico), but as a percentage of the national number of People Living with AIDS, Latinos represent a staggering 20%. ... There is no reason why Latinos should be disproportionately affected except for neglect by community leaders and government funders\". The day was observed in more than 100 cities around the United States including New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Chicago. Events around the theme Prevention Saves Lives included \"proclamation ceremonies\", press conferences, educational and cultural events, HIV testing and counselling.\n2004\nThe theme for NLAAD in 2004 was  - Open Your Eyes: HIV Has No Borders. The day was recognised with statements by Tommy Thompson as Secretary of Health and Human Services and Anthony Fauci as Director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Activities were organised in almost 250 cities in 45 states \"to increase HIV awareness among Latinos, and to address the stigma and discrimination associated with AIDS\" and attracted sponsors including American Airlines, Verizon Foundation, Abbott Laboratories, Boehringer Ingelheim, Terra, PR Newswire, Viacom, Univision and NBC/Telemundo.\n2005\nBy the third NLAAD in 2005, the number of community partner organisations had reached 1000 and the day was marked in more than 350 cities in 46 states and in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands around the message  - Open Your Eyes: Love Your Life, Protect Yourself, Get Tested. Activities included prevention education, free testing, press conferences, public service announcements on major television networks and a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., on 18 October 2005.\n2006\n- Knowledge is Power.
