It lies about 380&nbsp;km south-east of Perth and 250&nbsp;km north-east of Albany.\nDescription\nThe boundaries of the Important Bird Area (IBA) are defined by the remnant native vegetation associated with Pallarup, Dunn Rock, and Lake King Nature Reserves and adjacent unallocated Crown Land. It is surrounded by land cleared for farming. The site is one of the largest remaining mallee remnants within the wheatbelt, containing plant communities that have largely been cleared elsewhere. It consists mainly of mallee, mallee-heath, and salt pans and receives around 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually.\nBirds\nThe IBA contains the core habitat for the malleefowl and supports a significant species population. Other birds for which the IBA is an important site include the Carnaby's cockatoo, red-capped parrot, western rosella, regent parrot, blue-breasted fairywren, purple-gaped honeyeater, and western yellow robin.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*"
