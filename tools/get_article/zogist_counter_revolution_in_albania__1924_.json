After six months, Zogu along with his Mati tribesmen and White Russian troops with Yugoslav aid, would re-enter Albania to take control of Albania.\nBackground and June Revolution in Albania\nThe June Uprising was split into two fronts: The Northern Front organized by the Committee of Kosovo and led by Kachak leader Hasan Prishtina which had supported Noli due to the rivalry between them and the government of Zogu, and the southern front which was led by Riza Cerova. The Uprising was strongly supported by Albanian Peasants. The Albanian peasantry appeared diverse. Part of them dreamed of owning a piece of land or expanding the small amount of land they owned. The rest wanted to be freed from heavy and numerous state obligations, such as the tithe, the jalap tax, the slavery tax, and other wastes of the feudal system. The Southern Front was composed of the Përmet Garrison and Volunteers from Skrapar. Following several Skirmishes against the government forces, Riza Cerova leading an armed group of ~120 men would take over Berat and would make his way to Tirana. In Kozare he encountered Osman Gazep who was sent from Tirana with a battalion to suppress the uprising. Following the Battle of Kozare, Cerova would defeat the Government Forces and would occupy Lushnje where he was attacked by Osman's forces again but managed to defeat them. Around this time the Vlora volunteers would arrive to assist the Uprising. With all of the southern forces, the rebels would occupy Tirana as Ahmet Zogu would flee to Yugoslavia. According to US estimates, 20 people were killed and 35 were injured on the northern front, while 6 people were killed and 15 were injured on the southern front.\nZogist counter-coup\nIn order for Zogu to restore power in Albania again, the Zogist invasion of Albania, began on 13 December 1924, in which Ahmet Zogu led an army of over 1,000 Mati tribesmen and White Russian volunteers financed by Belgrade into Albania. The first confrontation of the Zogist Invasion occured in the Peshkopi area, where Noli’s reserve army was headquartered. It resulted in the capture of Peshkopi and Elez Isufi getting wounded, where he eventually died. After capturing Peshkopi and taking a short rest, the same Russian division, along with Ahmet Zogu‘s Mati tribesmen, launched an offensive on the country’s capital, Tirana. Noli’s demoralized troops were only able to put up minimal resistance. By December 24, Zogu’s forces and Russian volunteers had captured Tirana and Fan Noli had fled from Albania to Italy, along with some of his supporters. After Zogu had retaken Tirana, Zogu restored power in Albania.\nAftermath\nAfter the counter-coup, Ahmet Zogu and his supporters managed to overthrow Noli's government, making also use of the financials and military support from Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Greece. Most of the former democratic opposition fled to Italy, settling later in the western Europe, mainly in Vienna. Two organizations were formed there; KONARE and \"Bashkimi Kombëtar\" (National Union). The second consisted of patriotic-democratic anti-Zogist figures, while KONARE comprised also strong left-wing ideology. Beside being the main anti-Zogist opposition during 1925–30, it showed was anti-feudal, anti-imperialist, and pro-Soviet nuances. KONARE managed to retrieve financial support by the COMINTERN with the intermediation of Kosta Boshnjaku, one of the first Communist emissaries deployed by the soviets in Albania with the task of establishing communist cells, and possibly a Communist Party. In addition to young revolutionary activists, KONARE also attracted the members of the irredentist Committee of Kosovo, who were the sworn enemies of Ahmet Zogu and vice versa. Noli and Boshnjaku managed to procure some financial support for the Committee through Comintern, affiliating them with the Balkan Federation.\nAccording to Sejfi Vllamasi's memoirs, the founder of KONARE beside Fan Noli were: Qazim Koculi, Mustafa Kruja, Riza Dani, and Xhevat Korça from the former \"Krahu Kombëtar\" political fraction of the Albanian Parliament, other civilians and officers as Kol Tromara, Qazim Kokoshi, Llano Borshi, Major Shefqet Korça, captains Aziz Çami and Riza Cerova; and most of the youth members of \"Bashkimi\" (The Union) - a former political group founded by Avni Rustemi, such as Halim Xhelo, Sejfulla Malëshova, Llazar Fundo, Qamil Çela, Demir Godelli, Selim Shpuza, Haki Stërmilli, Reshat Këlliçi, etc.\nThe main press organ of KONARE was Liria Kombëtare (National Freedom). Early revolutionary figures like Halim Xhelo and Riza Cerova would crystallize their political persona through this newspaper. In April 1927, KONARE changed the name to Komiteti i Çlirimit Kombëtar (National Liberation Committee). By 1928, it came de facto under the control of Comintern; 24 young Albanians were sent to Moscow to follow their studies in high-end Soviet institutions. Despite the efforts, the committee did not pose any real threats to Zogu's regime, who from his side was elected President of Albania in 1925 (thus ending the era of the Principality of Albania), while on 1 September 1928 became Zog I, King of Albania, establishing a constitutional monarchy.\nDisappointed by the political overturns, Noli decided to retire from political life and move back to the US. This would start the end of the committee, which would practically cease by mid 1930s. Many of its political figures moved into the parallel \"National Union\" organization which would continue to oppose the Zogu's regime in Albania, culminating with the assassination attempt of 1931.\nReferences"
