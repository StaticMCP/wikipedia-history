When asked about their picks for the five worst movies of the 1990s, founders Mike Lancaster and Ray Wright both selected ''It's Pat for their lists. Lancaster also included Kids. While It's Pat received three nominations (one of which was a win), Kids got only a mere dishonourable mention for Worst Picture.\nListed below are the different categories, with their respective winners and nominees, including Worst Picture and its dishonourable mentions — films that were considered for Worst Picture but ultimately failed to make the final ballot (30 in total). The most notable change this year is swapping out Worst Resurrection of a TV Show temporarily for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy. Both categories would appear next year, along with all the other categories listed below. All winners are highlighted.\nWinners and Nominees\nWorst Picture\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Film\n!Production company(s)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|Showgirls\n|MGM, United Artists\n|-\n|Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\n|Warner Bros.\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n|Casper\n|Universal Pictures\n|-\n|It's Pat\n|Touchstone Pictures\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n|Waterworld\n|Universal Pictures\n|-\n|}\nDishonourable Mentions\n* Assassins (Warner Bros.)\n* Clueless (Paramount)\n* Congo (Paramount)\n* Cutthroat Island (MGM/UA)\n* Destiny Turns on the Radio (Savoy)\n* Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde (Savoy)\n* Fair Game (Warner Bros.)\n* First Knight (Sony)\n* Four Rooms (Miramax)\n* Jade (Paramount)\n* Jerky Boys: The Movie (Touchstone, Caravan)\n* Johnny Mnemonic (Sony)\n* Judge Dredd (Hollywood)\n* Jury Duty (Sony)\n* Kids (Shining Excalibur)\n* Mallrats (Gramercy)\n* Man of the House (Disney)\n* Mortal Kombat (New Line)\n* Operation Dumbo Drop (Disney)\n* Safe (Sony)\n* The Scarlet Letter (Hollywood)\n* Something to Talk About (Warner Bros.)\n* Species (MGM)\n* Stuart Saves His Family (Paramount)\n* Tank Girl (United Artists)\n* To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar (Universal)\n* Tommy Boy (Paramount)\n* Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (Warner Bros.)\n* Vampire in Brooklyn (Paramount)\n* Village of the Damned (Universal)\nOther Categories\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*'Sylvester Stallone for Assassins and Judge Dredd'\n**Jim Carrey for Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\n**Chevy Chase for Man of the House\n**Kevin Costner for Waterworld\n**Kyle MacLachlan for Showgirls\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*'Julia Sweeney for ''It's Pat'\n**Elizabeth Berkley for Showgirls\n**Cindy Crawford for Fair Game\n**Natasha Henstridge for Species\n**Demi Moore for The Scarlet Letter\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (Warner Bros.)\n**Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde (Savoy)\n**''It's Pat (Touchstone)\n**Jury Duty (Sony)\n**Stuart Saves His Family (Paramount)\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (Warner Bros.)\n**Batman Forever (Warner Bros.)\n**Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (Warner Bros.)\n**Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers (Dimension)\n**3 Ninjas Knuckle Up (Sony)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (Dimension)\n**Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (Warner Bros.)\n**Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home (Warner Bros.)\n**Grumpier Old Men (Warner Bros.)\n**3 Ninjas Knuckle Up (Sony)\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*'Johnny Mnemonic (Sony)'''\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
