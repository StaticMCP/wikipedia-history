A. Clark Mansion, is a 34-room residence of Romanesque Revival Victorian architecture that was built from 1884 to 1888 as the Butte, Montana, residence of William Andrews Clark, one of Montana's three famous Copper Kings.  The home features fresco painted ceilings, elegant parquets of rare imported wood, gas and electric chandeliers, ornate hand-carved fireplaces and stairways, and stained-glass windows.  The mansion was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\nThe Copper King Mansion has been privately owned, operated, and occupied by the Cote family since 1953. The home is operated as a bed and breakfast. Guided tours are available during the summer tourist season or by appointment during the winter months. The home underwent restoration in 2012.\nThe building of the Copper King Mansion is described in the bestselling biography of Clark's daughter, Huguette, Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune by Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell, Jr.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.copperkingmansion.com/ Copper King Mansion] - official site"
