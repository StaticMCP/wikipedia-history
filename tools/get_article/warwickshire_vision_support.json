A limited number of parishioners gave a figure of 250. The founding meeting of the Association was chaired by Lord Algernon Percy, High Sheriff of Warwickshire, and a former Conservative MP. He spoke of the difficulties blind people had in finding work, while other members called for greater support equal to that in other parts of the country.\nIn 1925, the charity entered into a partnership with Warwickshire County Council under which the first home teacher was recruited to visit and teach blind children throughout the county. With the introduction of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944, the Association began to encourage non-disabled blind people to register for employment, and by 1945 the charity was running centers throughout the county, which at that time included Leamington, Shirley, Sutton Coldfield and Tamworth. In 1950, the organization purchased Huntley Lodge in Leamington Spa and developed it into a home for twenty-two elderly blind people. The lodge was managed by Warwickshire County Council until 1980. It was then sold and the proceeds from the sale donated to the charity.\nA 1991 report by the Royal National Institute for the Blind indicated that the number of visually impaired people was far greater than previously thought. In response, the Association developed a new strategy to cover the increased number of people for whom it needed to provide services. It also formalized its partnership with Warwickshire Social Services and delegated the task of registering blind and partially sighted people to the charity.\nThe Association underwent a major restructuring program in 2004 due to changes in financial regulations and became a limited liability company in 2008. In 2011, the Warwickshire Association for the Blind had more than 4,000 people on its database, 2,800 of whom were registered with some form of visual impairment The organization celebrated its centenary in 2011 with a re-enactment of the first meeting at Leamington Town Hall. There was also an art exhibition at Leamington Art Gallery.\nIn 2014, the Warwickshire Association for the Blind changed its operational name to Warwickshire Vision Support.\nCurrent services\nHelp and advice\nWarwickshire Vision Support operates a general helpline for members and their carers and families. There is also a Vision Support Desk at Warwick Hospital.\nClubs and drop-in centres\nWVS maintains 14 clubs for its members throughout Warwickshire. The charity has also set up seven drop-in centres to make its facilities and services more accessible to the public.\nHome Visitor Service\nWVS provides a home visiting service where volunteers visit visually impaired members to help them read or help with correspondence.\nRehabilitation and Registration\nWVS has a team of rehabilitation officers who help people with visual impairments adapt to the challenges of having limited vision. This includes aspects such as the person's mobility, cooking, reading, writing or using the telephone. The rehabilitation service is provided by WVS on behalf of Warwickshire County Council, Adult Health & Community Services (formerly Social Services).\nInteractive Technology Service\nThe Interactive Technology Support Service provides an introduction to new digital technologies (computers, tablets, and smartphones).\nShopping Service\nSince February 2014, the Shoppa Hoppa service has provided sighted people with transportation and sighted companions to help them store. The program is operated in partnership with Back & 4th Community Transport.\nMy Guide Service\nSince 2014, the My Guide Service has been helping visually impaired people leave their homes and find their way around the local community by providing volunteer sighted guides.\nTalking books and newspapers\nThe De Montfort Talking Book Service is an independent charity providing books in cassette form to blind and partially sighted people in Warwickshire. The service has been run by volunteers since April 2010. Previously it was run by WVS in partnership with Warwickshire County Council, known as the Warwickshire Talking Book Service. The books are provided free of charge to members.\nFree talking newspapers are also available. These provide local news taken from sources such as newspapers and magazines. In addition, the Warwickshire Association for the Blind publishes a magazine for its members covering WVS and other topics of interest. WVS magazine (Warwickshire Vision) is published three times a year and is available in large print, Braille, and audio formats.\nVisual Impairment Awareness\nTo help businesses and organizations comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, WVS provides both formal training and informal presentations to organizations and community groups.\nFunding\nAlthough WVS has received funding from local authorities, the organization relies on donations from public, business and foundation sources to fund its work. Up to one-third of its income comes from these voluntary sources.\nAwards\nQueen's Award for Voluntary Service\nIn June 2020, WVS was one of the organizations honored with the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service, the highest award given to a volunteer group in the United Kingdom. It was one of two organizations in Warwickshire to receive the award that year.\nAwards given by WVS\nEach year, WVS presents awards to individuals and organizations that they believe have made a significant contribution to promoting a better understanding of visual impairment. These include the George Marshall Trophy, awarded to an organization or individual who has made a significant contribution to the lives of visually impaired people, and the Viv Bradford Rose Bowl, awarded to an individual who has distinguished themselves through their efforts and achievements in overcoming the barriers of visual impairment. Recipients of the Viv Bradford trophy include BBC Radio 4 presenter Peter White, who received the award in 2002. In 2019, Warwickshire Vision established the Volunteer Excellence Award to recognize the work of its volunteers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/corporate/communit.nsf/6b0fa4264509bf1e802569b9005944e4/3da210bb83d69e828025738e003dd56e?OpenDocument Warwickshire Association for the Blind] at Warwickshire.gov.uk\n*\n*[http://www.nalsvi.cswebsites.org/default.aspx?page=2050 National Association of Local Societies for Visually Impaired People]"
