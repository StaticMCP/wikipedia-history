Its original intent was to provide female mechanics in order to free up men for front line service in World War I. However, the organisation saw high enrolment, with women also serving in a number of other non-combatant roles, including drivers, caterers, clerks and tailors, as well as filling other wartime needs.\nIts last veteran was for a time thought to be Gladys Powers, who died in 2008, but Florence Green, who died in February 2012, was subsequently found to be the last-known surviving WRAF veteran.\nThe name was revived in 1949 for the regular women's branch of the RAF. The auxiliary organisation in the Second World War had been called the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.\nStrength\nThe target strength had been a force of around 90,000. Figures are unreliable until 1 August 1918, when the strength was 15,433, approximately 5,000 recruits and 10,000 transferred from the predecessor organisations, mainly the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps, but also the Women's Royal Naval Service. The organisation never exceeded 25,000.\nDepots\nDepots were opened in 1918 at Handsworth College, in Glasgow, at RAF Flowerdown and at York.\nList of Commandants\n*Gertrude Crawford, 1918\n*Violet Douglas-Pennant, May–September 1918\n*Helen Gwynne-Vaughan, September 1918 – 1920\nNotable members\n*Muriel Thompson\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/ww1airwomen.asp Search and download Service records of women who joined the WRAF, 1914–1919 from The National Archives.]"
