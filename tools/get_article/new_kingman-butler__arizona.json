The population was 12,907 as of the 2020 census.\nName and history\nNew Kingman-Butler was named for Leroy Butler, who was the original land developer of the unincorporated community. \"New Kingman\" was the name of the original real estate development, but it is seldom used by residents except in a historical sense. The area commonly is referred to simply as \"Butler\". Butler is a distinct locale among the neighborhoods of Kingman.\nButler makes up a substantial amount of the land area of the Kingman area as a whole, but is unincorporated, and is governed directly by Mohave County. There have been numerous plans and attempts to annex all or parts of Butler into the city of Kingman over the years, since it is an integral part of the Kingman community, but each has failed. One major problem with annexation into Kingman is the fact that Butler does not have a developed sanitary sewer system; all residences and buildings in Butler have individual septic tanks. The costs of developing and connecting a sewer system to all customers in Butler, if annexed into Kingman, is considerable. The fiscal assets required for such an investment by the City of Kingman likely could not be raised without assessment of a primary property tax on all landowners in the city; however, no such primary parcel tax has been approved by voters.\nGeography\nNew Kingman-Butler is located in central Mohave County and is bordered to the west by an extension of the city limits of Kingman, the county seat.
