Lord Lanerton and Charles Howard were his younger brothers. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, where he earned a reputation as a scholar and writer of graceful verse, obtaining in 1821 both the chancellor's and the Newdigate prizes for a Latin poem, Paestum,'''', leaflet for exhibition on George Howard, Castle Howard, 2010 and an English one. He maintained his interest in poetry throughout his life, exchanging sonnets with William Wordsworth. In 1826 he accompanied his maternal uncle, the Duke of Devonshire, to the Russian Empire, to attend the coronation of Tsar Nicholas I, and became a great favourite in society at St Petersburg.\nAt the general election in 1826 Carlisle was returned to parliament as member for the family borough of Morpeth (in Northumberland), a seat he held until 1830, and then represented Yorkshire until 1832 and the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1832 to 1841 and from 1846 to 1848. The latter year he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords.\nCarlisle served under Lord Melbourne as Chief Secretary for Ireland between 1835 and 1841, under Lord John Russell as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests from 1846 to 1850 and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1850 to 1852 and under Lord Palmerston as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1855 to 1858 and again from 1859 to 1864. In 1835 he was appointed to the Privy Councils of the United Kingdom and Ireland. He served as a Lord in Waiting to the Queen's mother, the Duchess of Kent at the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838.\nOn 2 April 1853, he was given the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh, and in 1855, he was made a Knight of the Garter.\nIn the six weeks after he stepped down as Chief Secretary of Ireland in 1841, the signatures of 160,000 men and women who appreciated his service were gathered on 652 sheets of paper and stuck together, creating the Morpeth Roll, a continuous roll measuring 420 metres.\nLord Carlisle died unmarried at Castle Howard in December 1864, aged 62, and was buried in the family mausoleum. He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, Reverend William George Howard.\nLegacy\nOn Bulmer Hill, about a mile from Bulmer village in North Yorkshire, is the Carlisle Memorial Column, erected by public subscription to his memory in 1869–70. It is inscribed:\nStatues of him by the Irish sculptor John Henry Foley were also erected in Phoenix Park, Dublin, and in Brampton, Carlisle in Cumbria, both in 1870. The statue in Brampton stands on Brampton motte and depicts him in the robes of a Knight of the Garter. The statue in Phoenix Park stood in the Peoples' Garden until 1956, when it was blown off its plinth in an explosion, and subsequently removed to Castle Howard in Yorkshire. The plinth it once stood on remains in place.\nFile:Carlisle Statue, Phoenix Park.jpg|The statue of Lord Carlisle, which stood in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, from 1870 to 1956\nFile:Plinth of former statue of George Howard.jpg|The plinth of the former statue today\nImage:Howard Monument the Motte, Brampton - geograph.org.uk - 101134.jpg|Statue of Lord Carlisle on Brampton Motte\nImage:Obelisk to the 7th Earl of Carlisle.jpg|Obelisk at top of Bulmer Hill\nImage:Obelisk to the 7th Earl of Carlisle (detail).jpg|Inscription on obelisk (see text)\nNotes\nReferences\n*  |page=110 }}\n*  |pages=340–341 }}\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://historyhome.co.uk/people/morpeth.htm Biography]\n* [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1302&dat=18650225&id=TrgQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QJMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7130,525887 Obituary in the Sidney Mail]\n* [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5yQIAAAAQAAJ&rdid=book-5yQIAAAAQAAJ&rdot=1 Extracts from journals kept by George Howard, earl of Carlisle: selected by his sister, Lady Caroline Lascelles]\n*"
