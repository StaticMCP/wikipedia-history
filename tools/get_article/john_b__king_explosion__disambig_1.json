King explosion' was a Canadian maritime disaster on June 26, 1930, when a drill boat containing dynamite was struck by lightning near Brockville, Ontario. Thirty people were killed.\nThe scow was off the point of Cockburn Island working on blasting a St Lawrence Seaway channel through Brockville narrows, and had drilled several holes of dynamite. At 4:30&nbsp;pm, while it was drilling another, a bolt of lightning struck the boat, travelling down the drill, and igniting the dynamite on the river floor.\nThe explosion was witnessed by United States Coast Guard Cutter 211, which then rescued 12 members of the crew of 42.\nA memorial plaque was erected on the north-west corner of Cockburn Island by the Department of Public Works Canada in 1930.\nThe wreck is now located west of Cockburn Island at a depth of 80&nbsp;feet. It is a popular dive site, and some divers have lost their lives while diving the wreck.\nSee also\n* RMS Empress of Ireland\nReferences"
