The bill would appropriate $20.9 billion.\nThe bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.\nBackground\nAn appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates (gives to, sets aside for) money to specific federal government departments, agencies, and programs. The money provides funding for operations, personnel, equipment, and activities. Regular appropriations bills are passed annually, with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year. The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 is an example of a regular appropriations bill.\nAppropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process. They are preceded in that process by the president's budget proposal, congressional budget resolutions, and the 302(b) allocation. The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...\" This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations. The President, however, still has the power to veto appropriations bills.\nThe Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 falls under the jurisdiction of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. The bill covers appropriations for the Department of Agriculture, as well as for a variety of related agencies. The House and Senate currently consider appropriations bills simultaneously, although originally the House went first. The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June. Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall.\nIn 2013, Congress was unable to pass all twelve appropriations bills (for fiscal year 2014) before October 1, 2013, when the new fiscal year. This led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. The shutdown lasted for 16 days. Finally, late in the evening of October 16, 2013, Congress passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, and the President signed it shortly after midnight on October 17, ending the government shutdown and suspending the debt limit until February 7, 2014. In reaction to this situation, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers has stated that his goal is to pass all twelve regular appropriations bills for 2015 before Congress has a recess in August because he wants to avoid a similar situation.\nCongressional Research Service report\nThis summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 - Title I: Agricultural Programs - Appropriates FY2015 funds for the following United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs and services: (1) Office of the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary);

Robert Aderholt (R-AL). The bill was reported by the United States House Committee on Appropriations. The accompanying committee report was [http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt468/CRPT-113hrpt468.pdf Report 113-468]. The bill was considered by the House on June 11, 2014, under an open rule which meant that House members were allowed to offer as many amendments to the bill as they wanted.\nDebate and discussion\nOne provision of the bill would waive the requirement that schools follow certain nutritional requirements in their school lunches, requirements that first lady Michelle Obama has been a strong supporter of.\nRep. Peter Welch (D-VT) announced his intention to add an amendment to the bill that would stop the FDA from interfering with artisan cheese-makers who use wooden boards and shelves to age their cheese. According to Welch, the FDA's crackdown is \"without evidence\" and an example of \"overreach.\"\nAn amendment offered by Rep Barbara Lee (D-CA) was accepted by voice vote. The amendment moves $8.1 million of funding from the Secretary of Agriculture's administrative budget to provide additional funding (now a total of $35 million) for a grant program to schools allowing them to buy equipment for making and serving breakfast to students. Lee argued that \"the bottom line is breakfasts are very, very important to the growth, health and welfare and the development of our children.\"\nSee also\n*List of bills in the 113th United States Congress\n*2015 United States federal appropriations\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.113hr4800 Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 4800]\n*[http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4800 beta.congress.gov H.R. 4800]\n*[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4800 GovTrack.us H.R. 4800]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140621105355/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/hr4800-113/show OpenCongress.org H.R. 4800]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140729162113/http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/113_HR_4800.html WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 4800]\n*[https://www.gop.gov/bill/h-r-4800-agriculture-rural-development-food-and-drug-administration-and-related-agencies-appropriations-act-2015/ House Republican Conference's legislative digest on H.R. 4800]\n*[http://beta.congress.gov/113/crpt/hrpt468/CRPT-113hrpt468.pdf Report 113-468 on H.R. 4800]"
