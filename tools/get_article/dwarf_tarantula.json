Dwarf tarantulas are one of several families of the suborder Mygalomorphae; this larger group also includes the true tarantulas.\nDescription\nDwarf tarantulas, as the name indicates, appear very similar to tarantulas, but are physically much smaller. Many specimens are smaller than 1&nbsp;cm in length, and the largest in the family are rarely bigger than 2&nbsp;cm. The spiders, like all Mygalomorphae, have downward pointing fangs; dwarf tarantulas also have long spinnerets.\nGenera\nThere is currently only one recognized genus in this family:\nMecicobothrium Holmberg, 1882\n* Mecicobothrium baccai Lucas et al., 2006 — Brazil\n* Mecicobothrium thorelli Holmberg, 1882 — Argentina, Uruguay\nGenera moved to other families include:\n*Hexura Simon, 1884 → Antrodiaetidae\n*Hexurella Gertsch & Platnick, 1979 → Hexurellidae\n*Megahexura Kaston, 1972 → Megahexuridae\nSee also\n* Spider families\nReferences\n* Costa, F.G. & Pérez-Miles, F.
