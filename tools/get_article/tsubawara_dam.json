It was constructed between 1952 and 1953. The dam has an associated 107 MW hydroelectric power station which was built in two parts. The first part of the power station (42 MW) was commissioned in 1954 and the second part of the power station (65 MW) was commissioned in 1975. Of the nine dams on the Shō River it is the seventh furthest downstream.\nSee also\n}}\n*Narude Dam – downstream\n*Hatogaya Dam – upstream\nReferences"
