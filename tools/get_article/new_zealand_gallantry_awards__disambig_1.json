Since the end of World War II there have been constant moves towards an independent New Zealand honours system.  This has resulted in a new system of New Zealand honours, military gallantry and civil bravery awards, and campaign medals.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Complete name\n! Ranks / Letters\n!
