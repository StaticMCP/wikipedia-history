It is one of three Constitutional Acts in the Croatian legal framework, the others being the Constitutional Act on the Implementation of the Constitution of Croatia and the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia. The current act was adopted on September 24, 1999, by the Croatian Parliament.\nThe law determines the conditions for the election of judges of the Constitutional Court and the termination of their duties, the conditions and deadlines for initiating proceedings to assess the conformity of laws with the Constitution and the conformity of other regulations with the Constitution and the law, the procedure and legal effect of its decisions and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.\nHistory\nOn March 21, 1991, the Croatian Parliament passed the first Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court.\nOn September 24, 1999, a new Act was passed, which replaced the previous one.

General Provisions\nThis section declares that the Court guarantees respect for and application of the Constitution of Croatia and that it bases its activities on the Constitution and this Act. The Court is independent of all state authorities, independently allocates its funds and its proceedings are public.\nThe judges of the court have the same immunity as members of the Croatian Parliament meaning they cannot be held criminally liable, detained or punished for expressing an opinion or voting in the Court. A judge may not be detained nor can criminal proceedings be initiated against him without the approval of the Court unless he has committed an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than five years.\nII.

The Croatian Parliament committee responsible for the Constitution publishes a call for nominations, reviews the candidates, compiles a list of the best candidates and submits it to Parliament. The Parliament then votes on each candidate individually and the candidates that get the majority of votes are elected to the Court. The elected judge takes office on the day the term of the judge he was elected to replace expires.\nJudges must take the following oath before the President: \"I swear on my honor that in performing my duties as a judge of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia, I will adhere to the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Croatia and that I will conscientiously perform my duties.\"\nThe judges of the Court may not hold any other public or professional office except if they are university professor in law but they must teach outside of their employment and to a reduced extent.\nA judge may be dismissed from office before his term expires if he requests it himself, if he is sentenced to prison or if he permanently loses the ability to perform his duty.\nThe President of the Constitutional Court is elected for a term of 4 years by a majority vote of all judges.\nA judge of the Court may not be a member of any political party nor may he publicly express personal favoritism towards any political party.\nIII.
