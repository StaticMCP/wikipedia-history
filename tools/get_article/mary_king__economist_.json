She is also an executive member of GOPAC, the Global Organisation of Parliamentarians Against Corruption, a former head of the Trinidad and Tobago chapter of Transparency International and is chairman of Mary King & Associates Ltd., a marketing research and business consulting company.\nMary King's appointment as Government Senator and Minister of Planning, Restructuring and Gender Affairs, was revoked by president Maxwell Richards on May 10, 2011, after a meeting with Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar. King was implicated in the inappropriate awarding of a $100,000 contract to a company, Ixanos, in which Mary King, and her husband, Dr St Clair King, have an interest. This is ironic, as King is involved in Transparency International. Mary King, the chairman of Mary King & Associates Ltd, established a market research firm six years ago to help businesses thrive in Trinidad and Tobago's changing culture and economy.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
