The campaign ended in an Allied victory.\nIt is one of the large-scale battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War, located in the border area between Yunnan Province, China and northern Myanmar, starting at the beginning of December 1943. The purpose of the battle is to open up the China-India Highway. At the end of March 1945, the Chinese Expeditionary Force, the British Army, and Merrill's Marauders joined forces in Muse, Burma (Myanmar), while the Japanese Army lost the North Burma Stronghold.\nThe Allied Forces were jointly formed by the troops of China, the United States and the United Kingdom. Among them, the Chinese participating forces included the Chinese Army in India and the Chinese Expeditionary Force. The commander-in-chief of the campaign was General Wei Lihuang of the Chinese National Army, and the deputy commander of the campaign was General Joseph Stilwell of the US Army. The main force of the Japanese army was the Japanese Burmese front. The commander of the battle was Masakazu Kawabe, then Heitaro Kimura, later Shinichi Tanaka and others. The total strength was 200,000-400,000 for Allied and 90,000-150,000 for Japan.\nThe Battle of Northern Myanmar and Western Yunnan lasted one and a half years. At the cost of more than 80,000 casualties, the Allies claimed to have killed more than 30,000 Japanese soldiers, reopened southwest China to the Burma Road, and recovered all the lost land on the west bank of the Salween River in western Yunnan.\nBackground\nAt the turn of spring and summer in 1942, the Japanese army captured Burma and immediately prepared to attack west Yunnan. They were expected to fight along Burma Road, conquer Yunnan and threaten Chongqing. On May 4, 1942, the Japanese army invaded Longling County, and at the same time dispatched 54 aircraft to carry out a violent bombing of Baoshan, Yunnan, the  Millennium Ancient City; on the 10th, the Japanese army invaded the border city of Tengchong. At this point, a large area west of the Salween River (Nu River) fell into the hands of the Japanese army. The 71st Army of the Chinese Expeditionary Force set up defenses on the east bank of the Nu River, repeatedly frustrated the Japanese army's attempt to move eastward, and thus stabilized the war situation, and confronted it across the river for two years.\nAt that time, after the Burma Road, which was once the only land international transportation artery, was cut off, a large amount of military supplies to China could only be transported by the US Air Force through \"The Hump\" with much difficulty and no security. In order to regain control of the Burma Road, the six divisions of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces in India and the British and Indian forces jointly launched a counterattack against the Japanese army in northern Myanmar in late October 1943, and achieved initial results. On April 17, the following year, the Chinese Expeditionary Force carried out a counter-attack plan for crossing the river.\nBattles in Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan\n* Battle of Yupang (October - December 1943)\n* Battle of the Hukawng Valley (October 1943)\n* Battle of Maingkwan (February - 5 March 1944)\n* Battle of Waluban (3 March 1944 - 9 March 1944)\n* Battle of Mogaung (4 June 1944 – 26 June 1944)\n* Siege of Myitkyina (17 May 1944 – 3 August 1944)\n* Battle of Tengchong (11 May 1944 - 13 September 1944)\n* Battle of Mount Song (4 June 1944 – 7 September 1944)\n* Battle of Longling (6 June 1944 - 3 November 1944)\n* Battle of Mangshi (3 November 1944 – 1 December 1944)\n* Battle of Mongyu (December 1944 - January 1945)\n* Battle of Wanding (27 December 1944 - 19 January 1945)\n* Battle of Lashio (March 1945)\n* Battle of Hsipaw (March 1945)\nAftermath\nIn June 1945, the Nationalist Government awarded the Flying Tiger Flag to eleven units.
