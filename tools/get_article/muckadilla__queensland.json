The Western railway line passes through the locality from east to west. The town is serviced by the Muckadilla railway station immediately to the north of the town. The Warrego Highway passes from east to west through the town, mostly being parallel immediately south of the railway line.\nMuckadilla Creek flows from Mount Bindango to the north down to the south-east of Muckadilla to Mount Abundance, passing just west of the town. The creek becomes Cogoon River and then is a tributary of the Balonne River. Colonial surveyor and explorer Thomas Mitchell followed this stream through this area in 1846, prior to european settlement.\nThe land is mostly 350-400m above sea level and used for grazing and cropping. Some of the slopes of the higher peaks (to 470m) in the south-west of the locality remain densely forested.\nHistory\nThe name Muckadilla was first used as the creek name, which in turn is believed to be an Aboriginal word (language and dialect unknown) to mean plenty of water.\nMuckadilla Provisional School opened on 25 January 1886. It was proclaimed Muckadilla State School on 1 January 1909. The school was mothballed on 31 December 2008, then closed on 31 December 2009. The school was on a  site at the southern end of Centenary Drive (). The school's website was archived.\nIn 1889, the Queensland Government drilled a bore at Muckadilla. Although the water supply found was quite small, it was believed that it had healing properties and people flocked to Muckadilla in search of a cure. Dr E.W. Kerr of Brisbane endorsed the water, claiming it had cured \"obstinate rheumatism\" in some of his patients. The baths were popular and, in 1939, John McEwan Hunter proposed that a sanitorium should be built there to better allow people to improve their \"rheumatism, arthritis, uritus, digestion, nerves and general health\".\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Muckadilla had a population of 58 people.\nIn the , the locality of Muckadilla had a population of 38 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Muckadilla following Muckadilla State School being mothballed on 31 December 2008 and closed in 2009.
