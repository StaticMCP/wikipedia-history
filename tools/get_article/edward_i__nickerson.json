Nickerson (1845–1908) was an American architect from Providence, Rhode Island, known for his work in the Queen Anne style in Providence.\nLife and career\nEdward Irving Nickerson was born September 13, 1845, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to Sparrow Howes Nickerson and Elizabeth Clarke (Darling) Nickerson. He was educated in the local schools until circa 1862, when he left to study architecture in the office of Clifton A. Hall. After several years working in Hall's office, in 1871 Nickerson opened an office of his own. After several years of practice, in 1877 Nickerson closed his practice and left for Europe with his wife, where they undertook a Grand Tour. They did not return to the United States until 1881, after which Nickerson reestablished his practice.\nDuring his career Nickerson was chiefly known as an architect of large suburban houses in and around Providence. Designing chiefly in an ornate Queen Anne style, in his lifetime his unique houses were locally referred to as \"Nickersonian.\" He practiced until his death, though he scaled back his practice significantly during the last decade of his life. Most of Nickerson's houses were designed for the city's manufacturers and merchants.\nNickerson joined the American Institute of Architects as a Fellow in 1875, and the same year was a founding member of the Rhode Island chapter. He served two terms as secretary and four terms as president of the chapter. In 1889 he was secretary of the AIA convention of that year, at which the Western Association of Architects was merged into the AIA. He was a long-time trustee of the Providence Public Library, sitting on the board from 1878 until his death.\nPersonal life\nIn 1873 Nickerson married Lyra Frances Brown, youngest daughter of Joseph Rogers Brown, who had cofounded Brown & Sharpe in 1833. The Brown family money allowed the Nickersons to travel abroad extensively and frequently. They had one daughter, Lyra Brown, in 1885. Lyra Frances died July 13, 1907, in Providence, followed by Edward Irving on March 15, 1908.\nNickerson's home, 71 Angell Street, is now Larned House of the Rhode Island School of Design.\nLegacy\nAfter the death of her parents Lyra B. Nickerson became noted as a philanthropist, both in executing her father's will and on her own account. She donated her father's his large architectural library to the Providence Public Library, where it now forms the core of the Nickerson Art and Architecture Collection. This was followed by financial gifts to both the library and the Rhode Island School of Design. Nickerson was interested in flying, and donated funds to the Aero Club of America and Rhode Island National Guard for the purchase of airplanes, and learned to fly herself. Upon her death, which occurred August 30, 1916 in Narragansett, her remaining estate was divided between the Providence Public Library and the Rhode Island School of Design. The latter bequest included several pieces of artwork, including two portraits of her father. The earlier of these was painted in 1885 by Gerald Sinclair Hayward. The latter is part of a pair of portraits posthumously commissioned in 1909 by Lyra Brown Nickerson of her parents from Albert Edward Jackson.\nAt least one of Nickerson's works has been listed independently on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and many others are contributing properties to listed historic districts.\nWorks\n* Miller Block and Spencer Block, Roosevelt Ave and Main St, Pawtucket, Rhode Island (1873 and 1874, demolished)\n* Cottage for Joseph U.
