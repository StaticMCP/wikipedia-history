These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners, including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, in addition to \"coaches' and managers' general impressions of a player's overall offensive value\". Managers and coaches are not permitted to vote for players on their own team. The Silver Slugger was first awarded in 1980 and is given by Hillerich & Bradsby, the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats. The award is a bat-shaped trophy, 3&nbsp;feet (91&nbsp;cm) tall, engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league and plated with sterling silver.\nIn , Major League Baseball began awarding a Silver Slugger Award to utility players (i.e. players who played multiple fielding positions in a given season).\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| Year\n| Links to the corresponding Major League Baseball season\n|-\n| AVG\n| Batting average\n|-\n| OBP\n| On-base percentage\n|-\n| SLG\n| Slugging percentage\n|-\n| HR\n| Home runs\n|-\n| RBI\n| Runs batted in\n|-\n| Ref\n| References\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#bbeeff\"| * or **\n| Winner of the most Silver Slugger Awards at his position (** indicates tie)\n|-\n| †\n| Member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n|}\nAmerican League winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
