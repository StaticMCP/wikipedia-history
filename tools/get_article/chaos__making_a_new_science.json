It was a finalist for the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1987, and was shortlisted for the Science Book Prize in 1989. The book was published on October 29, 1987 by Viking Books.\nOverview\nChaos: Making a New Science was the first popular book about chaos theory.  It describes the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and Lorenz attractors without using complicated mathematics. It portrays the efforts of dozens of scientists whose separate work contributed to the developing field. The text remains in print and is widely used as an introduction to the topic for the mathematical layperson. The book approaches the history of chaos theory chronologically, starting with Edward Norton Lorenz and the butterfly effect, through Mitchell Feigenbaum, and ending with more modern applications.\nThe book covers chaos theory under the lens of four themes: sensitive dependence on initial conditions, self-similarity, universality, and nonlinearity.\nAn enhanced ebook edition was released by Open Road Media in 2011, adding embedded video and hyperlinked notes.\nReception\nRobert Sapolsky said, \"Chaos is the first book since Baby Beluga where I've gotten to the last page and immediately started reading it over again from the front: I've found this to be the most influential book in my thinking about science since college.\"\nFreeman Dyson praised the book for its popular account but critiqued the omitting of the earlier work of Dame Mary L. Cartwright and J. E. Littlewood in forming the foundation of chaos theory.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mountainman.com.au/chaos_03.htm Excerpts]\n*[http://www.around.com/chaos.html Selection from the prologue]\n*[http://www.around.com/ Website of James Gleick]"
