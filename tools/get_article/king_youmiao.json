      "text": "# King Youmiao\n\nKing Youmiao of Zhao (; r. 235–228 BCE), personal name Zhao Qian, was a king of the Zhao state.\nThe younger son of King Daoxiang and Queen Daochang, King Youmiao was nevertheless able to succeed to the Zhao throne before his elder brother Zhao Jia due to his mother Chang Hou's intervention. He inherited a country that was in danger of being conquered by the Qin state, as it had been since a defeat at the Battle of Changping in 260 BCE.\nThe state of Zhao, however, was able to survive thanks to the services of General Li Mu, who successfully repelled Qin attempts at exploiting the situation. The Qin devised a scheme to get rid of him; through bribing a close confidante of King Youmiao, the courtier Guo Kai (郭開), Li Mu was arrested and executed on suspicion of treason.\nWithout Li Mu, Zhao's defenses were unable to resist the might of Qin. In 228 BCE, Qin forces under the leadership of Wang Jian captured the Zhao capital of Handan. King Youmiao surrendered and was then exiled to Fangling (modern-day northwestern Hubei). Zhao Jia then took the throne as King of Dai (代王) and reigned over a rump state in Zhao's far north.\nNotes and references\n* Zhao Guo Shi Gao (Draft History of the Zhao State), Shen Changyun, Zhonghua Book Company, China."
