The league is organised by England Netball but features teams based in England, Wales and previously Scotland. The Super League commenced at the 2005–06 season, replacing the Super Cup as the elite netball competition in England. From 2016-21 the league was sponsored by VitalityHealth and, as a result, known as the Vitality Netball Super League. Since 2022, it has been known as the Netball Super League.\nThe league's most successful teams are Team Bath, who have won five titles, Manchester Thunder who have won four titles and London Mavericks, who have played in seven grand finals. Surrey Storm won successive titles in 2015 and 2016 and Wasps played in three successive finals, winning two titles, between 2017 and 2019. Loughborough Lightning won their first title in 2021, beating Team Bath, following this with a second title in 2023 and third in 2024.\nUmpire Gary Burgess made history in 2018 by umpiring his 10th consecutive Netball Super League final between Manchester Thunder and Surrey Storm.\nTeams\nCurrent teams (2025 onwards)\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n!

In November 2016\nEngland Netball and Sky Sports signed a four-year deal which saw every live match made available to all Sky TV customers on Sky Sports Mix. A \"multi-year deal\" was reached in 2021, which expanded Sky's coverage to allow for all matches to be either televised on Sky Sports or streamed via YouTube.\nNXT Gen\nAs part of the 2025 relaunched Netball Super League, a new underpinning league was announced called NXT Gen, designed to develop the next generation of players and provide a pipeline of talent for the Super League. Players competing in the NXT Gen League can be called up as temporary replacement players in the NSL where a match fee will be paid to them along with remuneration for any additional NSL requirements. The league is primarily for U23s but allows four players over 23 to be included to enhance the quality of the competition, whilst protecting opportunities for developing athletes. This also enables the continuation of elite competition for NSL players who are returning from long term injury or pregnancy. It features the 8 NSL teams as well as Team Bath (who was not offered a NSL contract in the relaunched league).\nReferences"
