It is on the border with the Northern Territory. In the , Carrandotta had \"no people or a very low population\".\nGeography\nCarrandotta is in the Channel Country. The Georgina River enters the locality from the north (Piturie) and exits to the south-east (Georgina). All watercourses in this area are part of the Lake Eyre drainage basin, and most will dry up before their water reaches Lake Eyre.\nThe Donohue Highway passes through the south-west of the locality from Tobermoray in the Northern Territory to the west across to Toko in the south (ultimately terminating in Boulia). The Urandangi Border Road passes through the north-west of the locality from Urgandangi in Piturie to the north across to the Northern Territory to the north-west.\nThe locality contains three cattle pastoral leases: Carandotta Station (from which the locality presumably takes its name) in the east, Wolga Station in the north and Pituri Station to the south.\nThe predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nWaluwarra (also known as Warluwarra, Walugara, and Walukara) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Western Queensland. Its traditional language region is the local government area of Shire of Boulia, including Walgra Station and Wolga, from Roxborough Downs north to Carandotta Station and Urandangi on the Georgina River, on Moonah Creek to Rochedale, south-east of Pituri Creek.\nDemographics\nIn the , Carrandotta had \"no people or a very low population\".\nIn the , Carrandotta had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Carrandotta.
