The expedition began with the departure of Soyuz MS-24 on 6 April 2024 with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko continuing his ISS command from Expedition 70. It ended with his departure on Soyuz MS-25 with crewmates from MS-24 and MS-25 on 23 September 2024.\nBackground, Crew, and Events\nInitially, the expedition consisted of Kononenko, his Russian Soyuz MS-24 crewmate Nikolai Chub (both on a year long ISS mission since 15 September 2023), and his American Soyuz MS-25 crewmate, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson, who launched on 23 March 2024, as well as SpaceX Crew-8 crewmates, American astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt, and Jeanette Epps, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin, who launched on 4 March 2024 and were transferred from Expedition 70 after Soyuz MS-24 departure.\nNASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams arrived at the station on 6 June 2024 as part of the Boeing Crew Flight Test. Their visit was planned to be brief. However, due to technical issues with their spacecraft, their stay was extended, and they became de facto members of the ISS crew. They assisted with various tasks, including research, housekeeping, and maintenance. On 24 August 2024, NASA announced that the Boeing Starliner spacecraft would return to Earth uncrewed, with Wilmore and Williams being formally added to the Expedition 71/72 crew and returning aboard SpaceX Crew-9 on 18 March 2025.\nOn 11 September 2024, Soyuz MS-26 arrived at the station, transporting Roscosmos cosmonauts Aleksey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner, as well as NASA astronaut Donald Pettit.\nEvents manifest\nEvents involving crewed spacecraft are listed in bold.\nPrevious mission: Expedition 70\n6 April 2024 – Soyuz MS-24 undocking (includes Visiting Expedition 21), official switch from Expedition 70\n25 April 2024 – EVA-1 (VKD-62) Kononenko/Chub: 4 hrs, 36 mins\n28 April 2024 – CRS SpX-30 undocking\n2 May 2024 – SpaceX Crew-8 redocking\n28 May 2024 – Progress MS-25/86P undocking\n1 June 2024 – Progress MS-27/88P docking\n6 June 2024 – Boeing Crew Flight Test docking\n24 June 2024 – EVA-2 (US-90) Dyson/Barratt: 31 mins\n12 July 2024 – CRS NG-20 unberthing and release\n6 August 2024 – CRS NG-21 capture and berthing\n13 August 2024 – Progress MS-26/87P undocking\n17 August 2024 – Progress MS-28/89P docking\n4 September 2024 – Wilmore and Williams' seat liner moved from Boeing CFT swapped to SpaceX Crew-8 for CFT uncrewed landing\n6 September 2024 – Boeing Crew Flight Test uncrewed undocking\n11 September 2024 – Soyuz MS-26 docking\n22 September 2024 – ISS Expedition 71/72 change of command ceremony from Oleg Kononenko to Sunita Williams\n23 September 2024 – Soyuz MS-25 undocking, official switch to Expedition 72\nNext: Expedition 72\n}}\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Flight\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Astronaut\n!Increment 71a\n!Increment 71b\n!Increment 71c\n|-\n!6Apr – 6Jun 2024\n!6Jun – 11Sep 2024\n!11 – 23Sep 2024\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Soyuz MS-25\n| Oleg Kononenko, Roscosmos  Fifth spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Commander\n|-\n|  Nikolai Chub, Roscosmos  First spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Flight engineer\n|-\n| Tracy Caldwell-Dyson, NASA  Third spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Flight engineer\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" |SpaceX Crew-8\n| Matthew Dominick, NASA  First spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Flight engineer\n|-\n| Michael Barratt, NASA  Third spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Flight engineer\n|-\n| Jeanette Epps, NASA  Only spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Flight engineer\n|-\n| Alexander Grebenkin, Roscosmos  First spaceflight\n| colspan=\"3\" |Flight engineer\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Boeing Crew Flight Test\n| Barry E.

The spacecraft Calypso launched and docked to the station in June 2024. The flight marked the first crewed test flight of the Starliner. Crew members were scheduled to stay aboard the station for approximately 6 days, but the mission was extended due to issues with the spacecraft. Despite months of testing, NASA felt it was not able to understand why the thrusters malfunctioned and decided that it was too risky to return Wilmore and Williams to Earth aboard Starliner. Instead, they rode down on the SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon capsule, and the Boeing spacecraft returned uncrewed. Until Crew-9 arrived, they along with their seat liners moved to SpaceX Crew-8, their temporary emergency evacuation spacecraft, after which they and their seat liners transferred to Crew-9. It was the first launch of humans from Cape Canaveral since Apollo 7 in October 1968 and first launch of humans from SLC-41.\n|}\nVehicle manifest\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Vehicle\n!Purpose\n!Port\n!Docking/capture date\n!Undocking date\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Vehicles inherited from Expedition 70\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Progress MS-25\n|Cargo\n|Poisk zenith\n|3&nbsp;Dec 2023\n|28&nbsp;May 2024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| CRS NG-20\n|Cargo\n|Unity nadir\n|1&nbsp;Feb 2024\n|12&nbsp;Jul 2024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Progress MS-26\n|Cargo\n|Zvezda aft\n|17&nbsp;Feb 2024\n|13&nbsp;Aug 2024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| SpaceX Crew-8 \"Endeavour\"\n|Exp. 70/71/72 crew\n|Harmony forward\n|5&nbsp;Mar 2024\n|2&nbsp;May 2024 (redock)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| CRS SpX-30\n|Cargo\n|Harmony zenith\n|23&nbsp;Mar 2024\n|28&nbsp;Apr 2024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Soyuz MS-25 \"Kazbek\"\n|Exp. 70/71 crew, Visiting Expedition 21\n|Prichal nadir\n|25&nbsp;Mar 2024\n|23&nbsp;Sep 2024\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Vehicles docked during Expedition 71\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| SpaceX Crew-8 \"Endeavour\"\n|Exp. 70/71/72 crew\n|Harmony zenith\n|2&nbsp;May 2024 (redock)\n|23&nbsp;Oct 2024 (Exp.&nbsp;72)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Progress MS-27\n|Cargo\n|Poisk zenith\n|1&nbsp;Jun 2024\n|19&nbsp;Nov 2024 (Exp.&nbsp;72)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Boeing CFT \"Calypso\"\n| Visiting CCDev mission\n|Harmony forward\n|6&nbsp;Jun 2024\n|6&nbsp;Sep 2024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| CRS NG-21\n|Cargo\n|Unity nadir\n|6&nbsp;Aug 2024\n|28&nbsp;Mar 2025 (Exp.&nbsp;72)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Progress MS-28\n|Cargo\n|Zvezda aft\n|17&nbsp;Aug 2024\n|25&nbsp;Feb 2025 (Exp.&nbsp;72)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Soyuz MS-26 \"Burlak\"\n|Exp. 71/72 crew\n|Rassvet nadir\n|11&nbsp;Sep 2024\n|19&nbsp;Apr 2025 (Exp.&nbsp;72)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Segment\n! colspan=\"4\" | U.S. Orbital Segment\n! colspan=\"4\" | Russian Orbital Segment\n|-\n!Period\n!Harmony forward\n!Harmony zenith\n!Harmony nadir\n!Unity nadir\n!Rassvet nadir\n!Prichal nadir\n!Poisk zenith\n!Zvezda aft\n|-\n|6–28&nbsp;Apr 2024\n|rowspan=2|SpaceX Crew-8\n|CRS SpX-30\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\" rowspan=12| Vacant\n|rowspan=6|CRS NG-20\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\" rowspan=11| Vacant\n|rowspan=12|Soyuz MS-25\n|rowspan=3|Progress MS-25\n|rowspan=8|Progress MS-26\n|-\n|28&nbsp;Apr–2&nbsp;May 2024\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"| Vacant\n|-\n|2–28 May 2024\n|rowspan=3 style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"| Vacant\n|rowspan=10|SpaceX Crew-8\n|-\n|28&nbsp;May–1&nbsp;Jun 2024\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"| Vacant\n|-\n|1–6&nbsp;Jun 2024\n|rowspan=8| Progress MS-27\n|-\n|6&nbsp;Jun–12&nbsp;Jul 2024\n|rowspan=5|Boeing CFT\n|-\n|12&nbsp;Jul–6&nbsp;Aug 2024\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"| Vacant\n|-\n|6–13&nbsp;Aug 2024\n|rowspan=5|CRS NG-21\n|-\n|13–17&nbsp;Aug 2024\n|style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"| Vacant\n|-\n|17&nbsp;Aug–6&nbsp;Sep 2024\n|rowspan=3|Progress MS-28\n|-\n|6–11&nbsp;Sep 2024\n|rowspan=2 style=\"background:grey; color:white;\"| Vacant\n|-\n|11-23&nbsp;Sep 2024\n|Soyuz MS-26\n|}\nThe Prichal aft, forward, starboard, and aft ports all have yet to be used since the module originally docked to the station and are not included in the table.\nNotes\nReferences"
