Two influences during Burns's undergraduate years were the lecturer John Saltmarsh, whose specialism was in medieval economic and social history, and the scholar, Robert Ralph Bolgar, author of The Classical Heritage.\nBurns focused on Renaissance architects and their study of the antique for his postgraduate studies at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London.

Anthony Blunt, Director of the Courtauld Institute, came to hear of Burns's talent and encouraged him to teach at the Courtauld. By 1969 he was a lecturer there and this brought him into contact with a number of eminent art historians. such as John Shearman, Michael Hirst and Jennifer Fletcher.  In 1986 Burns moved to a professorship at Harvard University in the Graduate School of Design. Italy, long his passion, became Burns's next destination taking a professorial position at the University of Ferrara in 1994.  A year later he went over to the IUAV University of Venice. In 1993 Burns was appointed \"Presidente of the Consiglio Scientifico of CISAAP, the Palladio Centre in Vicenza.
