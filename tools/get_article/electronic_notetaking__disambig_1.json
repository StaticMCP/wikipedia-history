This method is most often used in educational or training sessions, but it is also used at health care appointments, meetings, or interviews.\nUsing a software program, an operator types a summary of the spoken information into a computer at a minimum typing speed of 60 words per minute. The text is then projected on a screen or transmitted to a second computer.\nThe text also provides a written record of sessions, which is particularly useful for deaf and hard of hearing attendees.\nElectronic notetaking began in the 1990s, when the disability legislation changed, such as the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) in the UK which provided more support.\nThe operators may work freelance either for an agency or as part of a professional team providing communication support.\nSee also\n* Note-taking (general information)\n* Comparison of notetaking software\n* Assistive technology\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051125134852/http://www.rnid.org.uk/information_resources/factsheets/communication/factsheets_leaflets/working_with_an_electronic_notetaker.htm Working with an Electronic Notetaker] from [http://www.rnid.org.uk The Royal National Institute for Deaf People] (RNID)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051220203925/http://tap.gallaudet.edu/remcan1.htm Computer-Assisted Notetaking] from [http://tap.gallaudet.edu/ Gallaudet University's Technology Access Program] (TAP)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040811024233/http://www.stereotypenotetakingsoftware.com/software.html Stereotype Electronic Notetaking Software]\n* [http://note-ed.org/ NoteED Electronic Notetaking Software]  from the [http://www.uclan.ac.uk University of Central Lancashire]\n* [http://www.anpnotetakers.co.uk The Association of Notetaking Professionals]"
