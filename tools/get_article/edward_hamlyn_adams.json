Adams died on 30 May 1842.\nHis granddaughter Violet Paget. who wrote as novelist Vernon Lee, later described him as \"extremely doctrinaire and moral, an ardent Voltairian, who spent much of his time disputing with the local parsons and refusing to pay tithes\".\nPersonal life and family\nAdams married in 1796 Amelia Sophia MacPherson, daughter of Captain John MacPherson of Philadelphia. They had two sons. Edward, the elder son, took as his surname a Welsh form, Ab-Adam (from Ap Adam, see Welsh patronym) or Abadam; he married Louisa Taylor. Adams also came to purchase an inn in Porthyrhyd, Carmarthenshire named the 'Lord Nelson', which is now named the 'Abadam Arms'. This inn was attacked in the Rebecca Riots.\nThere were three daughters of the marriage of Edward the elder and Amelia. They included Matilda Adams (1815–1896), who was the mother of Eugene Lee-Hamilton, by her first husband James Lee-Hamilton (died 1852), and Vernon Lee (real name Violet Paget), by her second husband Henry Ferguson Paget.\nEdward Abadam (1809–1875) quarrelled with his younger brother William (1814–1851). He had four daughters, the youngest being Alice Abadam, who became a leader in the suffragist and Catholic feminist movement. He left Middleton Hall to his eldest daughter, Lucy (1840–1902), who married the Rev. Richard Gwynne Lawrence (1835–1923).
