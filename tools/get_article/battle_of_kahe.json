It was the last action between German and Entente forces before the German retreat from the Kilimanjaro area. British and South African forces surrounded German positions at Kahe, south of Mount Kilimanjaro. Entente forces inflicted considerable casualties and captured large German artillery pieces but also suffered more casualties in return. German forces retreated from there, further into the interior of the colony.\nReferences\n*"
