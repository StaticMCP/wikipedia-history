It is serialized in Bushiroad Works' Comic Growl manga website and is licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. Wit Studio produced a three-part prequel original animation DVD (OAD) series which was bundled with volumes of the manga from September 2016 to September 2017 and an anime television series that aired from October 2017 to March 2018. Studio Kafka produced a second three-part OAD series which was bundled with the manga from September 2021 to September 2022, along with the second season of the anime, which aired in two parts from April to July 2023 and October to December of the same year.\nPlot\nHaving been ostracized by both her relatives and partially by society, orphaned Japanese high school student Chise Hatori decides to sell herself at an auction in order for somebody else to take her in and have a new place to call home. At the auction in London, she is sold for five million pounds to Elias Ainsworth, a seven-foot-tall humanoid with an animal skull for a head. The magus, who seems closer to a demon than human, either brings her the light she desperately seeks or drowns her in ever deeper shadows in her new country, Great Britain. The series deals with a romantic slice-of-life storyline in a surreal and supernatural light.\nCharacters\n;\n:|Dani Chambers}}\n:A teenage apprentice and future bride of Elias Ainsworth. Her father took her brother and abandoned the family when she was young, and her mother committed suicide in front of her causing her to feel unwanted by her relatives and bullied by her schoolmates. She sold herself to slavery, in order for someone to take her in. She is sold for five million Pounds to Elias. He tells her she is a Sleigh Beggy, a special magus who can draw magic from her surroundings and from within herself. However, this severely strains their bodies, making Sleigh Beggys very weak, and fated to die prematurely. Hence, Elias bought her with hopes of preventing her early death in about three years. Her small and fragile state has led others to give her the nicknames of Robin, and Little Bird Mage. She frequently receives gifts that suppress her magic to maintain her health. After being taken in by Elias she starts practicing magic, and finds she has a talent for sleep magic, but can also perform any type of magic at the cost of tremendous strain. She is also capable of seeing magical creatures which are normally invisible to people.\n;|エリアス・エインズワース|Eriasu Einzuwāsu}}\n:\n:Also known as \"Pilum Muralis\" (lit. \"Wall Spear\"), the Child of Thorns, and the Thorn Mage. He is Chise's master and fiancé, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. It is hinted that he was born from the shadows of the forest, but his humanlike traits imply he was a mage who dabbled in black magic, consequently losing his humanity and memories. The other faeries see him as an abomination, something he does not mind. Occasionally, he uses glamour spells to hide his animalistic appearance taking on a similar look to people he knows or sees, his true form being that of a tall man with the skull of a sharp-toothed horned beast with glowing red lights in the sockets. He also wears a red veil on the back of his head which he sometimes covers his face with when speaking to others. In the series he first resembles Simon, then Chise, and then an unknown woman. He can summon and control thorns, and transform into shadows. When angry enough, he adopts a more monstrous form consisting of various animal parts, such as a fish tail, wings or a snake body. Lindenbaum calls him a child in regards to Elias' limited understanding and sensations of human emotions. To this end, Elias purchases Chise partially because she is a rare Sleigh Beggy, but also with hope she can teach him about human feelings and behavior. He dislikes children, because they often see through his shadow magic and fear him. The ones that do not fear him ask many questions about him he cannot answer.\n;\n:\n:Chise's familiar and a Church grim. He was originally a graveyard guard dog, who chased away grave robbers and evil spirits. He was formerly called  and used to be owned by Isabel. He initially thinks of himself as a human, keeping a human form until he later recalls his true identity. He shares a mental link with Chise and considers her a sister. Ruth's dog form resembles an Irish Wolfdog, although this form can change much like Elias, and he sometimes travels in Chise's shadow.\n;\n:\n:A fairy landlady of the house where Elias and Chise reside. Originally a banshee, she is now a silent silkie and takes care of the housekeeping duties in the household. While protecting Chise, she dislikes Simon Kalm the village priest, glaring at him when he enters Elias' house and wrapping her arms around Chise.\n;\n:\n:An old acquaintance of Elias. She is a mage and a technician of the Magus Craft.\n:Her father was a technician of the Magus Craft. Even though her father was a magician, Angelica, who only had the quality of a sorcerer, could not directly learn the ways of her father. She worked hard to find her own method of performing magic. She later married, and had a daughter Althea.\n;\n:|Todd Haberkorn|Jessie James Grelle|Joel McDonald|Colleen Clinkenbeard}}\n:The Faerie Queen and Oberon's wife. She looks like a beautiful woman riding a donkey, but can temporarily possess other faeries. She is a proud and very kind motherly figure to Ainsworth and frequently requests he come to live with her in the faerie kingdom. She still considers Ainsworth her child as he is the shadow of nature even though he is mostly a beast. Despite repeated requests from Ainsworth not to, she feels sorry for him and wishes for his happiness because she knows he is not accepted by humans or fae and may very well never find a place in the world.\n;\n:\n:Titania and Oberon's bodyguard, who dislikes Elias. He gave Silver a new purpose and name after finding her weeping in the ruins of the house of the family she cried for as a banshee.\n;\n:\n:Introduced by Lindel as his master and teacher. She is older than Lindel and is the person that gave both Lindel and Elias their names. She lives on an island that drifts through time and space.\n;\n:\n:A friend of Chise and the older sister of Ethan. While visiting her grandparents over Christmas she got into an argument with Ethan, in which afterwards, he goes to the woods. Stella frantically went around town looking for him, but she couldn't find him and strangely everybody but her forgot he existed. Then she ran into Chise and Elias, telling them what happened and begging for their help. They agreed to help, then found out that it was Ashen Eye that took Stella's brother. Once they saved Ethan, Stella repays Chise and Elias by baking sweets for them when she makes her monthly visit to her grandparents.\n;\n:}}\n:At first, Chise is the only one who sees or hears Mariel at Seth's auction house. Mariel later appears before Elias and Chise, revealing she's a witch, and that she may have a solution to Chise's curse.\n;\n:\n:Chise's father. Back in Japan, he kept their neighbors from spying on them until he and his youngest son Fumiki ran away together, leaving Chise and her mother to fend for themselves.\n;\n:\n:Chise and Fumiki's late mother. Originally before her death, she was kind, loving and soft-spoken; she tried protecting her daughter from the creatures that were drawn to her--but after a while, she grew to hate her own daughter. The stress of having to care for Chise tore her apart and she decided to end her own life by killing herself in front of Chise. It is implied that in the past, Chise's mother had gone through similar things when she was younger but was able to persevere. The stress of dealing with it again alongside raising Chise was what made her susceptible to her manipulation and near strangulation of her daughter. It is through her that Chise inherited the red hair and green eyes.\n;\n:\n:Chise's younger brother who mysteriously disappeared with his father. Like the rest of his family, he has incredible magical energy that in the same vein as his father created a protective barrier at the family apartment to keep the neighbors away.\n;\n:\n:Chise's distant aunt through marriage, her husband Shouji forced her to take her in to avoid having a negative reputation and raised her along her two sons Daiki and Koki. However, Akiko was heavily negligent of Chise and was constantly complaining to her husband due to his business trips, leaving him to not deal with the young mage-to-be. Like most humans, Akiko could not see the \"neighbors\", and thus did not know the torment that Chise went through on a daily basis, instead seeing her as a problem child and a burden.\n;\n:\n:Akiko's husband, Daiki & Koki's father and Chise's uncle. He's often away on business trips.\n;\n:\n:Shouji and Akiko's first son, Koki's brother and one of Chise's cousins.\n;\n:\n:Shouji and Akiko's second son, Daiki's brother and one of Chise's cousins.\n;\n:|Sarah Roach}}\n:Chise’s roommate at the College. The heir to the Webster family, she seeks to discover why her family was murdered and their spiders stolen.\n;\n:\n:One of Chise’s classmates at the College. She is the companion of Veronica Rickenbacker, and has the ability to erase her physical presence.\n;\n:\n:One of Chise’s classmates at the College. A member of House Scrimgeour of the Seven Shields, he rejects his bloodline as a member of the House and seeks his own path in life.\n;\n:\n:One of Chise’s classmates at the College. A half-gorgon, half-human who has difficulty controlling his snake hair and evil eye.\n;\n:}}\n:One of the college students.\n;\n:}}, Bryson Baugus (Cour Two)}}\n:One of Chise’s classmates at the College.\n;\n:}}\n:Jasmine's brother.\n;\n:}}\n:Violet's sister.\n;\n: Kelsey Maher (Cour Two)}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n: Grant Paulsen (Cour Two)}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:}}\n;\n:\n;\n:\n:Philomela's abusive grandmother.\n;\n:}}\n;\n: Jessica Peterson}}\n;\n:\n:Philomela’s guardian and an artificial spirit. Created by her father to protect her.\nMedia\nManga\n''The Ancient Magus' Bride'' is written and illustrated by Kore Yamazaki.

The character designs are expressive and backgrounds ornate\". Commenting on the relationship between Chise and Elias, he wrote that \"having this story go in a legitimately romantic direction would likely raise thorny issues of power dynamics and consent\", but remarked that, as it was, the story \"does a commendable job of making both Chise and Elias understandable and likable characters\". He concluded his review by writing: \"What conflict all these lovely details might be leading towards is a mystery so far, but the execution is so strong that I'm ready to follow wherever it leads.\" In his review of the second volume, he admitted to coming to an appreciation of the main characters' relationship, writing that \"the ambiguities of their relationship actually seem like one more fitting piece of a world where every relationship is ambiguous\". He called the series' magic \"classic but still refreshing\". He also commented that the series' art \"remains gorgeous and well-suited to the story all throughout this volume ... the backgrounds are lush and faces expressive, and the whole style has an ornate looseness to it that works perfectly for this kind of fantasy storytelling\". He concluded by saying \"If you have any appreciation for this style of classic fantasy storytelling, ''Ancient Magus' Bride'' is a can't-miss production\".\nAccolades\n''The Ancient Magus' Bride'' ranked second on Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! list of best manga of 2014 for male readers.
