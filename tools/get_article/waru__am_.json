The station is licensed to Peru, Indiana, United States.  The station was last owned by Dream Weaver Marketing, LLC. Its license was deleted on September 30, 2021.\nTechnical\nAn Harris model SX-1A all solid state transmitter (featuring their patented \"Polyphase\" pulse duration modulator) fed a T-match network that provided impedance matching into a slant wire fed quarter wave monopole that was grounded at its base.  A slant wire feed is an old grand-fathered (now obsolete) method that made it easier to install additional antennas on the tower without the need for the costly base insulator or isocouplers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://enterpriseefiling.fcc.gov/dataentry/public/tv/publicFacilityDetails.html?facilityId=71276 Facility details for Facility ID 71276 (WARU)] in the FCC Licensing and Management System\n*[https://cdbs.recnet.com/corres/?doc=49205 FCC History Cards for WARU] (covering 1953–1979)"
