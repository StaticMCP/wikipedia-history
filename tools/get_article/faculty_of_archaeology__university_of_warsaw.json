The collections have been merged in 1877.\nAlthough there was no formal archaeological institute, a number of archaeologists and antiquarians who were important in the formation of Polish archaeology, were active in Warsaw or worked at the university: Erazm Majewski, Kazimierz Stołyhwo, Stefan Krukowski, Leon Kozłowski, Ludwik Sawicki or Marian Hinner.\n1918-1975\nThe first section, the Department of Prehistoric Archaeology, was created in 1919 in Staszic Palace, and  was headed by Erazm Majewski. After E. Majewski's death in 1920, his successor was Włodzimierz Antoniewicz – the dean of the Faculty of History in 1934/35 and Rector of the University of Warsaw in 1936/37. In 1931, the Section of Classical Archaeology was created, led by the Polish egyptologist Kazimierz Michałowski.\nOver the years, new chairs and departments were established, such as the Department of Slavic Archaeology, the Department of Archaeology of Antiquity, the Department of Ancient Archaeology (later transformed into the Department of Prehistoric and Early Medieval Archaeology), and a Department of Anthropology.  One of the largest ones was the Department of Prehistoric and Early Medieval Archaeology as it had 70 students in 1967/1968.\nAfter Włodzimierz Antoniewicz, the department was headed by Zofia Wartołowska and Witold Hensel. At the beginning of the 1960s, Kazimierz Michałowski, Zofia Podkowińska, Zbigniew Sochacki, Bronisława Chomentowska, Maria Miśkiewicz, Andrzej Kempisty, Jerzy Gąssowski, Andrzej Wierciński, Stefan Karol Kozłowski and Janina Rosen-Przeworska were among the most prominent members of the staff.\nArchaeology at University of Warsaw has been famous of existence of \"warsaw school\" in Slavic archaeology (Witold Hensel, Włodziemirz Antoniewicz), and Mediterranean Archaeology  (Kazimierz Michałowski)\n1975–2020 (Institute of Archaeology)\nIn 1975 the Departments of Prehistoric and Early Medieval Archaeology, Papyrology and Mediterranean Archaeology were merged to form the Institute of Archaeology, as a part of Faculty of History at the University of Warsaw, with Waldemar Chmielewski as its first director. The institute was appointed from three departments: Prehistoric and Early Medieval Archaeology, Papyrology, and Mediterranean Archaeology, and then divided into seven sections.\nAfterwards, former Anthropological Laboratory at the Chair  of the Prehistorical Archaeology (1960–1976) was changed to Department of Historical Anthropology\nThe institute contained the following structure: Department of Prehistoric Archaeology  (headed by Stefan Karol Kozłowski), Department of Archaeology of Ancient Europe (Jerzy Okulicz), Department of Early Medieval Archaeology (Zofia Wartołowska), Department of Archaeology of Ancient Greece and Rome (Anna Sadurska), Department of Near Eastern Archaeology (Michał Gawlikowski), Department of Papyrology (Anna Świderkówna) and Department of Historical Anthropology (Andrzej Wierciński). Alongside to the institute a Department of Archaeological Research on Polish Medieval times of Warsaw University of Technology and University of Warsaw, which was headed by Zofia Wartołowska. Later this entity was changed into Department of Archaeological Excavations of Institute of Archaeology headed by Ryszard Mazurowski.\nBy the end of the 1980s the University of Warsaw had trained more than 500 students in archaeology, which was the largest in Poland at that time, most of them studied in Institute of Archaeology. The huge majority of students were specialized in Stone Age, Neolithic, La Tene, and Roman Period, Medieval archaeology, Mediterranean Archaeology: Archaeology of Greece, Roman Archaeology, Egyptology In the early 1990s, Aleksander Bursche and Tomasz Mikocki contributed to further energetic development of the Institute by expanding the didactic programme and improving the management of the institute.\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, the Institute enrolled about 150 students for the first year of the Bachelor's programme and 240 for the first year of the Master's programme in archaeology.  Despite the observed decrease in the next decade, the Institute remains the leading institution teaching archaeology in Poland.
