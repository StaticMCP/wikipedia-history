The album's a tremendous meeting of the minds, as The Dells really transform Bacharach's brilliant compositions – giving them depth and feeling in ways that are quite different from any other renditions of the songs. The arrangements by Stepney are incredible too – on a par with his famous work for Minnie Riperton, Rotary Connection, and Ramsey Lewis – as majestic as Burt Bacharach might have wanted, but with a very different approach, and a slight undercurrent of funk. Instrumentation is by Stepney, Phil Upchurch, and members of The Pharaohs – plus a full string section as well. Another baroque soul classic from the glory days of the Chicago soul scene!\nTrack listing\n* All songs written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.\nPersonnel\n;The Dells\n*Marvin Junior (baritone)\n*Johnny Carter (tenor)\n*Verne Allison (tenor)\n*Mickey McGill (baritone)\n*Chuck Barksdale (bass)\n;Additional musicians\n*Charles Stepney – Fender Rhodes, piano, harpsichord, congas, percussion\n*Phil Upchurch & Roland Faulkner – guitar\n*Cash McCall – guitar (on I Just Don't Know)\n*Art Hoyle & Robert Lewis – trumpets\n*Ed Druzinsky – harp\n*Ether Merker & Paul Ondracek – horns\n*Morris Jennings & Donny Simmons – drums\n*Bobby Christian – percussion\n*Derf Reklaw, Ealee Satterfield, & Oye Bisi Nalls – bongos & congas\n;Technical personnel\n*Arrangements, supervision, & production – Charles Stepney\n*Engineers – Gary Starr, Roger Anfinsen, Brian Christian\n*Album Coordination – Mia Krinsky\n*Production Supervision – Bob Scerbo\nReferences"
