After Liu Bang became the first emperor of the Han, Ying Bu rose up against Liu Bang in 196 BC. He was defeated and killed by Liu Bang.\nAfter Liu Bang killed Ying Bu, he conferred the title of king of Huainan on his youngest son Liu Chang.\nIn 164 BC, Huainan was divided among Liu Chang's three sons. The eldest son Liu An kept the title King of Huainan, while his brothers became Kings of Hengshan (衡山王) and Lujiang (廬江王), respectively.\nLiu An, engaged in political and cosmological arguments with Dong Zhongshu, founded an academy which compiled the Huainanzi. The Huainanzi leaves room for multiple cultural traditions in China through the concept of the Tao. By contrast, Dong advocated cultural centralization, placing Heaven and its mandate before all other concepts. Wang Aihe views the defeat of the Prince of Huainan as symbolic of China's increasing cultural centralization during the Han dynasty.\nIn 122 BC, Liu An was involved in an alleged plot of rebellion, and committed suicide. The kingdom was converted to Jiujiang Commandery, while the title King of Huainan became extinct.\nKings of Huainan\n# Ying Bu (英布, 202–196BC)\n#  (劉長, 196–174BC)\n#  (劉喜, 169–165BC)\n# Liu An (劉安, 164–122BC)\nSee also\n* Prince of Wu\n* Timeline of the Chu–Han Contention\nNotes\nReferences"
