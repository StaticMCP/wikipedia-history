It was originally released in 1985, on the label A&M. It was his last solo album until 2001's Out of the Blue, as well as his last to be released on A&M, after Jerry Moss, the recording executive of A&M, rejected the release of his fifth album and terminated his recording career with the label in the same year.\nThe album featured some lyrical contributions from Ian Dury and musical contributions from two of the Blockheads, bass player Norman Watt-Roy and drummer Charlie Charles.\nThe track \"Number One\" was featured in the 1985 movie Real Genius starring Val Kilmer.\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 5:40\n| title2          = Tonight's Our Night\n| length2         = 4:11\n| title3          = Rhythm in My Life\n| length3         = 4:08\n| title4          = Little Eva\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 5:00\n| title5          = Eastern Light\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 4:15\n}}\n| length6         = 7:18\n| title7          = Tell Me, Tell Me\n| length7         = 4:14\n| title8          = Looking at You\n| length8         = 5:28\n| title9          = The Boy on the Bridge\n| writer9         =\n| length9         = 4:16\n| title10         = Love Rhythms\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 4:03\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n*Chaz Jankel&nbsp;– lead vocals; guitar; keyboards; drum machine programming; percussion\n*Robbie Taylor&nbsp;– keyboards; drum machine programming\n*Charlie Charles&nbsp;– drums; additional percussion\n*Norman Watt-Roy&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Zeus B.
