This committee includes Nobel prize winners and luminous personalities from Stanford University, MIT, Cambridge, University of Stuttgart, Florida State University, Università di Pisa - Pisa, Università del Texas - Austin, etc.\n}}\nThe Eni Award is a prize awarded by the Italian oil and gas company Eni with the aim of encouraging better use of energy sources and increased environmental research. The strict award guidelines and the notable names on the selection committee (including Nobel laureates) make Eni a coveted award. List of Eni award winners include Nobel laureates like Harry Kroto and Alan J. Heeger.\nSome websites and magazines (Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei) have called the Eni award the \"Nobel prize of energy research\".\nThe scientific committee of the Eni award includes representatives from Stanford University, MIT, Cambridge, University of Stuttgart, Florida State University, University of Pisa, University of Texas at Austin, and others. The annual Eni award was launched in July 2007, foreseen by the group's Technological Master Plan. The Eni award extends and replaces the Eni-Italgas Prize, previously known as the Italgas Prize, which in 2006 had reached its XIX edition.\nAward selection\nThe award's Scientific Committee – which has the role of evaluating the candidates and assigning the prizes, is of the highest level and comprises researchers and scientists from some of the world's most advanced research institutes, and includes Jean-Marie Lehn, Nobel Prize 1987 for Chemistry.\nIn subsequent years, 78 researchers from 20 countries have been awarded: Italy, Germany, the United States, Australia, France, Canada, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Israel, Sweden, South Korea, India, Egypt, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Included in the number are six Nobel Prize laureates. More than 7,559 researchers from around the world have submitted their research projects, to which should be added the numerous personalities who have guaranteed or been a part of the various evaluation commissions.\nThe distinguished representatives of the international scientific community who have received the Eni award in the past include Harry Kroto, 1996 Nobel Prize for Chemistry; Alan J. Heeger, 2000 Nobel Prize for Chemistry (unlike the others, he had won the Nobel Prize before receiving this award); Theodor W.
