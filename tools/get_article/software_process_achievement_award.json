      "text": "# Software Process Achievement Award\n\nThe Software Process Achievement Award is a non-competitive award offered by the IEEE Computer Society and Software Engineering Institute (SEI) and annually presented for outstanding and innovative contributions to the field of software quality.\nAward recipients receive an engraved commemorative plaque and make several presentations at appropriate practitioner and researcher community events. Award recipients also produce an SEI Technical Report describing their accomplishments, experiences, and lessons learned. The SEI helps produce this report and pays the authors an honorarium of $1500 to partially offset the expense of preparing their presentation and report.\nHistory\nIn 1994, the Software Process Achievement Award program was first established by the IEEE Computer Society. Since then, only nine companies have received this award, including renowned organizations such as Goddard Space Flight Center, Raytheon Company and Hughes Electronics.\nList of past recipients\nThe SPA, granted annually, has been declared null as often as it has been granted, due to the lack of candidates that meet the criteria of the recognition. So far, six North American companies, two Indian IT services providers, and one Colombian software development organization have received the accolade.\n* 2009,\tInfosys Technologies Limited\n* 2006,\tProductora de Software S.A (PSL)\n* 2004,\tIBM Global Services, Australia: Application Management Group.\n* 2002,\tWipro: Software Process Engineering Group.\n* 1999,\tOklahoma City Air Logistics Center: Aircraft Management Test Software & Industrial Automation Branches.\n* 1998,\tAdvanced Information Services, Inc: Development Group.\n* 1997,\tHughes Electronics: Software Process Improvement Team.\n* 1995,\tRaytheon Company: Software Engineering Process Group, Equip.
