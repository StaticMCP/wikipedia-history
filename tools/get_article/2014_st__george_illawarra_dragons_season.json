Coached by Steve Price until his mid-season replacement by Paul McGregor, and captained by Ben Creagh, they're competing in the NRL's 2014 Telstra Premiership season. The Dragons had a strong start to the premiership's regular season, being the last team to remain undefeated. Part-way through the season Benji Marshall, after his brief stint in New Zealand rugby union, returned to the NRL with the Dragons, partnering Gareth Widdop in the halves.\nTransfers\nNew Signings\n* Mike Cooper from Warrington Wolves\n* Dylan Farrell from South Sydney Rabbitohs\n* Gareth Widdop from Melbourne Storm\n* Joel Thompson from Canberra Raiders\n* Sam Williams from Canberra Raiders\n* Matt Groat from Wests Tigers\n* Josh Ailaomai from Sydney Roosters\n* Peter Mata'utia from Newcastle Knights\nTransfers / Leaving\n* Jamie Soward to Penrith Panthers\n* Matt Cooper Retired\n* Nathan Fien Retired\n* Michael Weyman to Hull Kingston Rovers\n* Matt Prior to Parramatta Eels\n* Bronx Goodwin Released\n* Chase Stanley to Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n* Cameron King to North Queensland Cowboys\n* Daniel Vidot to Brisbane Broncos\n* Kane Brennan to Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs\n* Jackson Hastings to Sydney Roosters\nRe-signed\n* Leeson Ah Mau til 2015\n* Ben Creagh til 2016\n* Josh Dugan til 2017\n* Craig Garvey til 2015\n* Wil Matthews til 2014\n* Adam Quinlan til 2015\n* Mitch Rein til 2016\nReferences"
