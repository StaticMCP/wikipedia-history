He shrugged off the first glimmers of that, after the election, because of the massive Watergate scandal.\nPolls showed that Nixon had a strong lead. He was challenged by two minor candidates, liberal Pete McCloskey of California and conservative John Ashbrook of Ohio. McCloskey ran as an anti-Vietnam war candidate dedicated to a much more clearly liberal position compared to Nixon's ambiguity approach within the party, while Ashbrook was dedicated to a much more clearly conservative position than Nixon and opposed Nixon's détente policies towards China and the Soviet Union. In the New Hampshire primary McCloskey's platform of peace garnered 19.7% of the vote to Nixon's 67.9%, with Ashbrook receiving 10.9% and comedian Pat Paulsen receiving 1.1%. Having previously stated that he would withdraw from the race had he not achieved 20% of the vote, McCloskey did so.\nNixon won 1,347 of the 1,348 delegates to the GOP convention, with McCloskey receiving the vote of one delegate from New Mexico.\nTimeline of the race\nMarch 7\n}}\nMarch 14\nMarch 21\nApril 4\nApril 25\nMay 2\nMay 4\nMay 6\nMay 9\nMay 16\nMay 23\nJune 6\nResults by popular vote\nSee also\n* 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
