Captain Roald Amundsen and his South Pole party ascended Axel Heiberg Glacier near the central part of this group in November 1911, naming these mountains for the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales.\nExploration and naming\nElevations bordering the Beardmore Glacier, at the western extremity of these mountains, were observed by the British expeditions led by Ernest Shackleton (1907–09) and Robert Falcon Scott (1910-13), but the mountains as a whole were mapped by several American expeditions led by Richard Evelyn Byrd (1930s and 1940s), and United States Antarctic Program (USARP) and New Zealand Antarctic Research Program (NZARP) expeditions from the 1950s through the 1970s.\nAppearance\nThe Sailing Directions for Antarctica (1960) describes the Queen Maud Range as follows: \"From the Beardmore Glacier the horst trends east-southeastward an undetermined distance. The Prince Olaf Mountains stretch from the Beardmore Glacier to the Liv Glacier.}} Near  a large glacier trends southward. Eastward of 175°E. the escarpment is fronted for about 50 miles by high gneissic foothills which are fronted by an expansive piedmont inundating the lower heights. In about  the Shackleton Glacier (Wade Glacier), a vast straight-walled glacier about 12 miles wide, extends southward to the polar plateau.\n\"At this point the scarp appears broken by a transverse fault which displaces the horst northward to Mount Wade (Mount Bush), a beacon sandstone massif rising to at least 14,000 feet above sea level, dominating the eastern flank of this remarkable valley glacier.\nEastward of Mount Wade stand the Fisher Mountains, which form the western flank of the Liv Glacier. Bush Mountains, lying just eastward of the mouth of Shackleton Glacier, are a group of ragged foothills rising to a height of 4,000 feet.\n\"Viewed from northward the Queen Maud Range presents a vast array of low-lying peaks which increase progressively in height to the southward where, about 15 miles from the shelf ice, stand great tabular mountain masses, 13,000 feet high, having a sharply defined fault-line scarp on the northern side. The northern foothills are dark-colored gneisses and schists with veins of granite and quartz. These foothills show marked glacierization with well-developed cirques and aretes. The high tabular mountains of the horst, are regular and even in outline, presenting broad domes with precipitous fronts to the north showing the granite structure capped by a series of horizontally bedded sandstone with intruded dolerite sills.\"\nGlaciers\nFile:C84180s1 Ant.Map The Cloudmaker.jpg|Beardmore Glacier to east\nFile:C84165s1 Ant.Map Shackleton Glacier.jpg|Shackleton to Liv\nFile:C85150s1 Mount Goodale.jpg|Amundsen in center\nFile:C85135s1 Ant.Map Leverett Glacier.jpg|Reedy Glacier in east\nThe Queen Maud Mountains are crossed by several major glaciers that flow from the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf, and divide the mountains.\n*The Beardmore Glacier is one of the largest valley glaciers in the world, being  long and having a width of . It descends about  from the Antarctic Plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf and is bordered by the Commonwealth Range on the eastern side and the Queen Alexandra Range on the western.\n*The Shackleton Glacier is a major glacier, over  long and from  wide, descending from the Antarctic Plateau from the vicinity of Roberts Massif and flowing north through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf between Mount Speed and Waldron Spurs.\n*The Liv Glacier is a steep valley glacier,  long, emerging from the Antarctic Plateau just southeast of Barnum Peak and draining north through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter Ross Ice Shelf between Mayer Crags and the Duncan Mountains.\n*The Amundsen Glacier is a major Antarctic glacier, about  wide and  long. It originates on the Antarctic Plateau where it drains the area to the south and west of Nilsen Plateau, then descends through the Queen Maud Mountains to enter the Ross Ice Shelf just west of the MacDonald Nunataks.\n*The Scott Glacier is a major glacier,  long, that drains the East Antarctic Ice Sheet through the Queen Maud Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf.\n*The Reedy Glacier is a major glacier, over  long and  wide, descending from the polar plateau to the Ross Ice Shelf between the Michigan Plateau and Wisconsin Range.

The range borders the eastern side of Beardmore Glacier from  Keltie Glacier to the Ross Ice Shelf.\n*Separation Range, the northeastern branch of the Commonwealth Range. The branch starts at about 84°20'S, and forms two chains of mountains separated by Hood Glacier. The Separation Range, about  long, terminates to the north at the Ross Ice Shelf.\n*Hughes Range, a high massive north–south trending mountain range in Antarctica, surmounted by six prominent summits, of which Mount Kaplan at  is the highest. The range is located east of Canyon Glacier and extends  from the confluence of Brandau Glacier and Keltie Glacier in the south, to the Giovinco Ice Piedmont in the north.\n*Supporters Range, a rugged range  long, bordering the eastern side of Mill Glacier, from Keltie Glacier in the north to Mill Stream Glacier in the south.\n*Dominion Range, a broad mountain range, about  long, forming a prominent salient at the juncture of the Beardmore and Mill glaciers.\n*Barton Mountains, a group of mountains located south of the Commonwealth Range and the Hughes Range and bounded by Keltie Glacier, Brandau Glacier, Leigh Hunt Glacier, and Snakeskin Glacier.\n*Grosvenor Mountains, a group of widely scattered mountains and nunataks rising above the polar plateau east of the head of Mill Glacier, extending from Mount Pratt in the north to the Mount Raymond area in the south, and from Otway Massif in the northwest to Larkman Nunatak in the southeast.\n*Bush Mountains, a series of rugged elevations at the heads of the Ramsey and Kosco glaciers.

When including Fram Mesa, the plateau is about  long and  wide, rising to  high between the upper reaches of the Amundsen and Scott glaciers.\n*Rawson Mountains, a crescent-shaped range of tabular, ice-covered mountains including Fuller Dome, Mount Wyatt and Mount Verlautz, standing southeast of Nilsen Plateau and extending southeast for  to the west side of Scott Glacier.\nScott–Reedy\nMountain groups or ranges between Scott Glacier and Reedy Glacier include:\n*Watson Escarpment, a major escarpment trending northward along the east margin of Scott Glacier, then eastward to Reedy Glacier where it turns southward along the glacier's west side. Somewhat arcuate, the escarpment is nearly  long, rises  above sea level, and  above the adjacent terrain.\n*Gothic Mountains, a group of mountains,  long, located west of Watson Escarpment and bounded by Scott Glacier, Albanus Glacier, and Griffith Glacier.\n*La Gorce Mountains, a group of mountains,  long, standing between the tributary Robison Glacier and Klein Glacier at the east side of the upper reaches of the Scott Glacier.\n*Tapley Mountains, a range of mountains fronting on the eastern side of the Scott Glacier, extending eastward for  between Leverett Glacier and Albanus Glacier.\n*Harold Byrd Mountains, a group of exposed mountains and nunataks which extend in an east–west direction between the lower part of Leverett Glacier and the head of the Ross Ice Shelf.\n*Bender Mountains, a small group of mountains  southwest of the Berry Peaks, between the southeast edge of the Ross Ice Shelf and the Watson Escarpment.\nOther features\n*The Quartz Hills is an arcuate cluster of largely ice-free hills and peaks found immediately south of Colorado Glacier along the west side of Reedy Glacier.\n*The Caloplaca Hills are a distinctive group of rock hills including Mount Carmer and Heathcock Peak, lying east of the Watson Escarpment on the west side of Reedy Glacier.\n*Titan Dome is a large ice dome on the polar plateau, trending east–west and rising to  between the Queen Maud Mountains and the South Pole. The dome was first crossed by the sledge parties of Shackleton, Amundsen, and Scott on their journeys toward the South Pole, and was described as a major snow ridge. It was delineated by the SPRI-NFS-TUD airborne radio echo sounding program, 1967–79, and named after the Cambridge University (U.K.) Titan computer, which was used to process all the early radio echo sounding data for this part of Antarctica.\nSee also\n* List of mountains of Queen Maud Land\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n|title=Beardmore Glacier |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=10 January 2014}}\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n* }}\n*"
