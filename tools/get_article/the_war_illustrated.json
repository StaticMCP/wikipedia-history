It was first released on 22 August 1914, eighteen days after the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, and regular issues continued throughout the First World War.\nThe magazine was discontinued after the 8 February 1919 issue, but returned 16 September 1939 following the start of the Second World War. 255 issues were published throughout the Second World War before the magazine permanently ceased production on 11 April 1947.\nBackground\nThe magazine offers a pictorial record of both World War I and World War II. It includes numerous maps, photographs and illustrations, and the work of war artists, weekly reporting, and editorials on the conduct, events, and consequences of global conflict.\nSubtitled \"A Pictorial Record of the Conflict of the Nations\", The War Illustrated was initially sensationalistic and patriotic. Although it contained articles, the main focus was on photographs and illustrations, most notably those of Stanley Wood dramatising (or in some cases fabricating) events involving German troops. The magazine became more diligent in properly verifying its reports from 1916 onwards.\nBoth versions of The War Illustrated were edited by John Hammerton, who also contributed articles throughout the magazine's run. The magazine contained personal accounts of the war by war correspondents such as Hamilton Fyfe and Luigi Barzini, Sr., descriptions and illustrations of Victoria Cross actions (for example those of John Lynn and John George Smyth) and articles by authors such as H. G. Wells (\"Why Britain Went To War\", \"Will The War Change England?\") and Winston Churchill (\"The Right View of Verdun\"). It was extremely popular: at its peak at the end of World War I, The War Illustrated had a circulation of 750,000.\nDigitized copies online\n:\n:\n*  |editor-last1=Hammerton |editor-first1=Sir John Alexander |editor-link1=John Alexander Hammerton |date=1915–1919 |title=The War Illustrated Album de Luxe; The Story of the Great European War Told by Camera, Pen and Pencil |url= |type= |location= |publisher=The Amalgamated Press, Limited |via=Internet Archive  }} , ; .\n|date=1915 |title=Vol. 1: \"The First Phase\" |url=https://archive.org/details/warillustratedal01hammuoft/page/n9/mode/2up |series=Chapters by H.G.
