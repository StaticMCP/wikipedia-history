      "text": "# Warwick Line\n\nThe Warwick Line (also known as the Warwick–Yorktown line) was a defensive works across the Virginia Peninsula maintained along the Warwick River by Confederate General John B. Magruder against much larger Union forces under General George B. McClellan during the American Civil War in 1861–62.\nThe main line extended 12 miles from Yorktown to the Warwick River and downstream to Lee's Mill, then westward to Skiffe's Creek, which flowed into the James River at Mulberry Island, where the line was anchored on the east by a four-gun battery at Mulberry Island Point. The south end of Mulberry Island (now part of Fort Eustis) is located at the confluence of the Warwick and James Rivers.\nNotes\nSee also\n*Dam No. One Battlefield Site\n*Fort Crafford\n*Lee's Mill Earthworks\n*Queen Hith Plantation Complex Site\n*Southern Terminal Redoubt"
