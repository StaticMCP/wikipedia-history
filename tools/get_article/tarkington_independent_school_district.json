The flat, wooded land was once open prairie where cattle grazed. Tarkington Prairie settlers wanted their children to have a good education, so they built several different schools with colorful names such as Box Island, Little Flock, and Pelican.\nThe many smaller schools soon became five school districts: Dolen, Hightower, East Tarkington, North Tarkington, and West Tarkington. There was a rivalry among the schools in academic and sporting competitions.\nThe five districts consolidated into the Tarkington Consolidated School District in 1931. In 1954, Tarkington became an Independent School District and dropped \"Consolidated\" from its name. The number of students has grown, and the number of facilities has grown.\nThe old school building destroyed by fire in 1937 still stands in east Tarkington on County Road 2296.\nOperations\nCirca 1995 the annual cost per student incurred by the district was $3,895; around that time the average per-student cost in Houston-area school districts was $4,000-$5,000.\nNotable alumni\nJason Grimsley - Retired Major League Baseball Player\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
