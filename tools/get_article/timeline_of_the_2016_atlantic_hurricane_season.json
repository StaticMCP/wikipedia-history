It was the costliest, as well as the first above-average, Atlantic hurricane season since the 2012 season.|group=\"nb\"}} It featured the highest number of deaths since the 2008 season and also yielded the highest number of named storm landfalls on the United States since that year. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1 and concluded on November&nbsp;30, dates which conventionally delimit the period during each year when a majority of tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The season's first cyclone, Alex, developed on January&nbsp;12, while the final storm of the season, Otto, closed-out the season by exiting into the Eastern Pacific on November 25, becoming the first Atlantic–Pacific crossover hurricane since Hurricane Cesar–Douglas in 1996.\nA total of 16 tropical depressions were recorded, of which 15 further intensified into tropical storms. Of those 15, a total of seven strengthened into hurricanes, while four attained their peaks as major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} Activity began with Alex which, upon making landfall in the Azores, became the first January landfalling tropical cyclone since Hurricane Alice in the 1954 season. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle became the earliest third and fourth named storms, respectively, on record. Hermine moved ashore the coastline of Florida as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane on September&nbsp;2, ending the record hurricane drought that began in the state after the 2005 season's Hurricane Wilma. In late September and early October, Hurricane Matthew wrought destruction throughout the Caribbean Sea and Southeastern United States, resulting in $15.09 billion (2016 USD) in damage and 603 deaths. In mid-October, Hurricane Nicole developed to Category&nbsp;4 intensity and remained a major hurricane while directly impacting Bermuda, the first storm of such strength to do so since Hurricane Fabian in the 2003 season. Following the 2016 season, the names Matthew and Otto were retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective regional time included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's products. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nJanuary\nJanuary 12\n* 18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST) at Subtropical Storm Alex develops from an area of low pressure about 1,150&nbsp;mi (1,850&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands.\nJanuary 14\n* 06:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. AST) at Subtropical Storm Alex attains fully tropical characteristics and intensifies into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane, roughly 630&nbsp;mi (1,015&nbsp;km) south of the Azores.\n* 12:00&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. AST) at Hurricane Alex attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 981&nbsp;mb (hPa;
