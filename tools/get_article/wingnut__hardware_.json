This collar mates with a fitting that receives the tube and secures it by means of a wingnut or wingbolt. When the stand is disassembled, only the wingnut or wingbolt needs to be loosened, and the collar remains in place, allowing the stand to be easily reassembled in exactly the same adjustment. When the stand needs to be adjusted, the collar is first loosened by means of a drum key.\nSeltzer bottle\nThe device that surrounds a CO2 cartridge in a seltzer bottle is also a wingnut.  Twisting the wingnut completes a seal around the cartridge neck; twisting a bit more causes a pin to pierce the cartridge and let the gas into the bottle.\nSee also\n* Mechanical joint\n* Thumbscrew (fastener)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
