The working group meets several times per year. Conceived in 1993, IMEWG's goal is to keep all parties informed and thereby avoid duplication of effort, and to discuss potential areas for collaboration/cooperation during the various phases of exploration.\nFounding participants included NASA, ESA, several European national agencies and those of Japan and Russia. IMEWG was initially chartered with the following goals:\n* Produce an international strategy for the exploration of Mars beyond the currently approved missions.\n* Provide a forum for the coordination of future Mars exploration programmes.\n* Examine the possibilities for an international Mars network mission as the next step beyond the 1996 opportunity.\nThe first IMEWG recommendations on an international strategy for Mars exploration, covering launch opportunities from 1996 to 2003, included an International Mars Network. The recommendations were presented at the COSPAR Symposium in Hamburg, 1994, and published.\nThe charter was updated in 1996 with the following goals:\n* Produce and maintain an international strategy for the exploration of Mars.\n* Provide a forum for the coordination of Mars exploration missions.\n* Examine the possibilities for the next steps beyond the currently defined missions.\nIMEWG meetings have also afforded an opportunity to reflect on the implications of mission losses for future programmes (e.g. in 2000).\nLater IMEWG initiatives have covered themes such as exobiology, planetary protection, Mars Sample Return, lower cost missions, common standards and interoperability (e.g. for data relay), radioisotope power systems, terrestrial Mars analogues, and preparations for future human exploration.\nThe international Mars Architecture for the Return of Samples (iMARS) Working Group was chartered by IMEWG in mid-2006 to develop a potential plan for an internationally sponsored and executed Mars sample return (MSR) mission. An iMARS Phase 2 Working Group was constituted in 2014 for drafting a Mission Architecture and Science Management Plan for the return of samples from Mars.\nIn 2024 the IMEWG Terms of Reference were updated once more, with the objectives reformulated as follows:\n# Share information and plans relating to the development of national and international Mars exploration programs.\n# Encourage international co-operation and co-ordination in the development of Mars exploration programs.\n# Facilitate the interoperability of Mars exploration systems and minimize duplication.\n# Explore opportunities for collaboration and coordinated missions.\nAgencies Represented\n* Australia:\tAustralian Space Agency (ASA)\n* Austria:\tAustrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) (previously Austrian Space Agency (ASA))\n* Belgium:\tBelgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO)\n* Brazil:\tBrazilian Space Agency (AEB)\n* Canada:\tCanadian Space Agency (CSA)\n* China:\tChina National Space Administration (CNSA)\n* Czech Republic:\tCzech Space Office (CSO)\n* Europe: European Space Agency (ESA)\n* Finland:\tFinnish Space Committee  FSC (previously Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI))\n* France:\tCentre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\n* Germany:\tGerman Aerospace Center (DLR) (previously Deutsche Agentur fiir Raumfahrtangelegenheiten (DARA))\n* Greece:\tHellenic Space Center (HSC)\n* Iceland:\tIceland Space Agency ISA\n* India:\tIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)\n* Italy:\tAgenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI)\n* Japan:\tJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) (previously Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS))\n* Mongolia:\tMars V\n* Netherlands:\tNetherlands Space Office (NSO)\n* Norway:\tNorwegian Space Agency (NOSA)\n* Poland:\tPolish Space Agency (POLSA)\n* Russia:\tRoscosmos (previously Russian Space Agency (RKA))\n* Saudi Arabia:\tSaudi Space Agency (SSA) (previously Saudi Space Commission (SSC))\n* South Korea:\tKorea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI)\n* Spain:\tAgencia Espacial Española (AEE) (previously Center for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI))\n* Sweden:\tSwedish National Space Agency (SNSA) (previously Swedish National Space Board (SNSB))\n* Switzerland:\tSwiss Space Office (SSO)\n* Thailand:\tGeo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA)\n* United Arab Emirates:\tUAE Space Agency (UAESA)\n* United Kingdom:\tUK Space Agency (UKSA) (previously British National Space Centre (BNSC))\n* United States:\tNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)\nSee also\n*International Lunar Exploration Working Group\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://imewg.org/ Official Website]"
