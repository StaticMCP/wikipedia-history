Huntingford has located Antukyah about  south of Lake Hayq, at the edge of the Ethiopian Highlands, in the modern district of Antsokiya and Gemza.\nDespite the care Eslamu took in deploying his men, and the number of them, the Ethiopian army panicked and fled when the Imam's cannons cut down thousands of them, during the pursuit Garad Hirabu pursued the Abyssinians with the Malassay and confronting the Abyssinian army three weeks later at the Battle of Zari. According to sixteenth century Adal writer of Futuh al-Habasha Arab Faqīh, the number of dead and wounded was comparable to the previous Battle of Shimbra Kure.\nNotes"
