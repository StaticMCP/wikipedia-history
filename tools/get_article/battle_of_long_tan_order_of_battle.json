In 1971 the VC MR1 was renamed MR 7.|group=Note}}\n** 275th Regiment (Senior Captain Nguyen Thoi Bung aka Ut Thoi) – 1,400 men (three battalions)\n** D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion (Bui Quang Chanh aka Sau Chanh) – 350 men (at least two companies, including C4 weapons company) Yet according to the D445 Battalion history published in 1991 Chanh was in fact the unit's first commander, while Kiem commanded the Chau Duc District Company during Long Tan and only took over the battalion in early 1968.|group=Note}}\n** One regular North Vietnamese Army battalion – suspected recent research suggests no such unit was present. The 275th Regiment was restructured in May 1966, incorporating the North Vietnamese D605 Battalion as its third battalion (which had been disbanded).|group=Note}}\n** Vo Thi Sau militia company – 80 personnel, mostly women (battlefield clearance and casualty evacuation)\nThe final evaluation of the forces confronting D Company, 6 RAR included those in depth and is based on post-battle estimates derived from battle analysis, intelligence reports, captured documents and the interrogation of captured Viet Cong personnel. Although initial estimates of the Viet Cong force ranged from several companies to a battalion, following the battle Australian intelligence assessed it as having totalled between 1,500 and 2,500 men, while 1,000 men were believed to have directly engaged D Company. These figures were given by Nguyen Van Kiem—who had commanded D445 Battalion after the fighting at Long Tan, but not during the battle—when questioned by McNeill in 1988; however, much of the information provided by him was later found to be misleading.|group=Note}} During the battle the division's second main force regiment, 274th Regiment had likely been occupying a position north of Binh Ba astride Route 2 to ambush a squadron from US 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment which they anticipated would attempt to relieve 1 ATF. Allied intelligence later confirmed it subsequently moved west into the Hat Dich after the failure at Long Tan.\nSee also\n* Assessment of the Battle of Long Tan\n* Long Tan Cross\nNotes\nFootnotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
