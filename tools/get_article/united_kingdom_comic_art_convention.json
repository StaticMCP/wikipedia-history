As a complement to UKCAC, from 1990 to 1995 the organizers put on the Glasgow-based Glasgow Comic Art Convention (GlasCAC), generally held in the spring.\nThe largest convention of its kind in the country during the period, the UKCAC and GlasCAC were the sites of annual comics award ceremonies from 1987 to 1998. The UKCAC was the site of the Eagle Awards presentation from 1987 to 1990; the UK Comic Art Awards were presented at one of the conventions — often GlasCAC — from 1991 to 1997; and the National Comics Awards were presented at the UKCAC in 1997–1998.\nMost editions of the UKCAC took place in September, over two days, usually on a Saturday and Sunday. The convention featured floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and collectibles merchants. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, one of the annual highlights (until 1989) was the Saturday all-night film show, as well as regular events like quizzes, a fancy dress contest, and a charity auction. The show included an autograph area, as well as a so-called \"Artists' Alley\" where comics artists signed autographs and sold or did free sketches.\nHistory\nUKCAC was a successor to the British Comic Art Convention (commonly known as \"Comicon,\") which ran, mostly in London, from 1968 to 1981. UKCAC was organised as a nonprofit convention \"by the fans for the fans\" starting in 1984. The original organizers were Frank Plowright, Hassan Yussuf, and Chris Savva (who actually organized the first convention). Many others contributed either for a few years or on the convention days themselves (most prominent was Richard Barker, between 1986 and 1990). The initial show, in September 1985, attracted more than 500 attendees.\nThe 1988 convention featured more than 30 comics professionals, and had panels on Harvey Kurtzman (in attendance), comic book printing, politics in comics, violence in comics, and technology. After four conventions, the annual UKCAC charity auction had raised over £15,000.\nIn 1989 organizers Plowright, Yusuf, and Barker converted the UKCAC to an event generating a salary (mostly as a way to keep the show running and fairly compensate them for the work of organizing it) under the name Rusty Staples. The 1989 UKCAC was co-sponsored by Marvel Comics, Neptune Comic Distributors, and 2000 AD Comics Group. It featured an exhibit on the work of the late Frank Bellamy (an exhibit which had originated in The Basement Gallery in Brixton).\nThe first Glasgow Comic Art Convention was held in Spring 1990 at Glasgow City Chambers and featured the first presentation of the UK Comic Art Awards, a comics award voted on by British creators, editors, and retailers. The award was created by Rusty Staples and sponsored by Penguin Books UK.\nThe 1990 London show was co-sponsored by DC Comics among others; attendance was around 5,000 people.\nAs the years went by, Plowright and Yusuf became the main organizers. London became an increasingly expensive location to host the convention, and they had difficulty keeping costs down and attracting top-level guests. As a result, attendance declined. The UKCAC was held in London until 1997, and in Manchester in its final iteration in 1998.\nLegacy\nUKCAC was succeeded by Comic Festival, run in Bristol from 1999 to 2004; and then by Comic Expo, also in Bristol, which ran from 2004 to 2014.\nLocations and dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" background: #efefef;\" style=\"width: 5%\" | Dates\n! scope=\"col\" background: #efefef;\" style=\"width: 10%\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" background: #efefef;\" style=\"width: 35%\" | Official guests\n! scope=\"col\" background: #efefef;\" style=\"width: 30%\" | Programme booklet contributors\n! scope=\"col\" background: #efefef;\" style=\"width: 20%\" | Notes\n|-\n| 21–22 Sept. 1985 || University of London Union, London || Steve Bissette, Bill Sienkiewicz, Dave Sim, Marv Wolfman, Brian Bolland, John Bolton, Eddie Campbell, Alan Davis, Hunt Emerson, Brett Ewins, Dave Gibbons, Ian Gibson, Denis Gifford, Alan Grant, Garry Leach, David Lloyd, Mike McMahon, Alan Moore, Steve Moore, Paul Neary, Kevin O'Neill, Ron Smith, Dez Skinn, Bryan Talbot, and John Wagner || Cover by Alan Davis and Paul Neary; interior art by Bryan Talbot, Ian Gibson, John Ridgway, Dave Gibbons, Kevin O'Neill, Hunt Emerson, Eddie Campbell, Garry Leach, Alan Davis, Paul Neary, John Wagner, Alan Grant, Robin Smith, Tom Frame, John Bolton, Dicky Howett, Bob Wakelin, John Higgins, Leigh Baulch, Brian Bolland, Phil Elliott, and Glenn Fabry || Admission price for both days: £7.50\n|-\n| 20-21 Sept. 1986 || University of London Union ||Bill Marks, Seth, Dean Motter, David Lloyd, Frank Miller, Lynn Varley, Steve Leialoha, Lew Stringer, Glen Fabry, Gil Kane, John Bolton, Karen Berger, Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Jenette Kahn, Dave Gibbons, Kevin O'Neill, Brett Ewins, Carl Potts, Alan Grant, Barry Windsor-Smith, Bryan Talbot, Bill Sienkiewicz, and Chris Claremont || Cover by Alan Davis & Dave Gibbons; interior art by Bryan Talbot,  Greg Theakston, Alan Davis, Paul Neary, Ron Smith, Angus McKie, Ian Gibson, Phil Elliott, Kevin O’Neill, Leigh Baulch, Lew Stringer, Mike Collins, Mark Farmer, Dicky Howett, John Bolton, Barry Windsor-Smith, Kev Hopgood, John Higgins, Brian Bolland, Brendan McCarthy, John Ridgway, Hunt Emerson, Graham Higgins, Cam Kennedy, Eddie Campbell, David Pugh, and Mike Matthews ||\n|-\n| 5–6 Sept. 1987 || UCL Institute of Education || Will Eisner, Gil Kane, John Byrne, John Totleben, Steve Bissette, Wendy Pini, Richard Pini, Ron Smith, John Totleben, Steve Bissette, Alan Grant, Dave Gibbons, Bill Sienkiewicz, Dave Sim, Paul Duncan, Martin Crocknell, Carlos Ezquerra, Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison || Cover by Jim Baikie; interior work by John Wagner, Alan Grant, Brian Bolland, Bryan Talbot, Kevin O'Neill, Eddie Campbell, Chris Donald, Simon Thorp, and Graham Dury || £10 admission in advance; Presentation of the Eagle Awards\n|-\n| 24-25 Sept. 1988 || Logan Hall, UCL Institute of Education, London || Cam Kennedy, Los Bros Hernandez, David Lloyd, Lovern Kinzierski, Richard Bruning, Garry Leach, Trina Robbins, Debbie Delano, Harvey Kurtzman, Gary Groth, Carl Potts, Melinda Gebbie, Jenette Kahn, John Byrne, Jerry Ordway, Dave Gibbons, Matt Wagner, Dave McKean, Ann Nocenti || Cover by Jerry Ordway; interior art by Phil Elliott, Lew Stringer, Graham Higgins, Glenn Fabry, Kev Hopgood, John Ridgway, John Higgins, Mike Collins, Ian Gibson, Dicky Howett, John Bolton, Hunt Emerson, Bryan Talbot, Alan Davis, Mark Farmer, Garry Leach, Cam Kennedy, Kevin O'Neill, Brian Bolland, and Dave Gibbons || Admission price for both days: £10; 2,500 attendees; presentation of the Eagle Awards\n|-\n| 8–10 Sept. 1989 || University of London || Jim Baikie, Grant Morrison, Jamie Delano, Kev F.
