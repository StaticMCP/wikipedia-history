It used to be an oasis. The settlement was an inland trading post and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site Land of Frankincense since 2000.\nSome considered it to be the legendary lost city of Ubar or Iram. This is not always accepted by scholars. There is a probability that it might have been in the land of Ubar which was a historical region rather than a city. The site might have inspired the legend of the lost city of Ubar when the spring dried up and the settlement was abandoned.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Archaeological Site of Shisr\n\n#REDIRECT Archaeological site of Shisr\n}}"
