It was well received by Nintendo Power, which called it a \"one-of-a-kind adventure\" due to its combination of driving challenges and \"RPG depth\". Before it was playable, Marc Nix of IGN was excited about its premise, as well as the developer attached to it. In his review, he called its gameplay \"hectic\" and its controls well-designed. He also enjoyed the Mode 7 graphics. However, he found the sound to be less desirable, calling it \"busy\" but also \"lacking punch\". It was the 87th most anticipated game for IGN's readers as of January 3, 2003.\nElectronic Gaming Monthly praised the car customization, commenting that without it, it would be both mediocre and not as deep. GameSpot's Frank Provo called it \"weird and unique\", and may not suit some people's tastes. However, he found an abundance of variety and personality to it. The publication later named it the best Game Boy Advance game of February 2003. In his preview of the game, GamePros Pong Sifu found the gameplay unique and the graphics \"delightful\". In his review, he commented that while the story was weak and the concept unoriginal, it was \"easily one of the most fun action RPGs on the portable system\". RPGFan's Neal Chandran found it fun and worth a shot, noting that even with its flaws, its \"charm and heart\" won him over. GameSpy's Zach Meston called it \"unexpectedly entertaining\", praising its customization and music and sound effects. However, he criticized the aiming system and storyline, the latter described as \"bare-minum\".\nRetrospectives on Car Battler Joe were also positive towards the game. Outlets such as GamesRadar and Den of Geek listed it as one of the best games for the Game Boy Advance.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
