Appointments are made from within the legal profession on the basis of merit rather than a particular level of experience. Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see court dress), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as taking silk, and hence QCs are often colloquially called silks.\nThe rank emerged in the sixteenth century, but came to prominence over the course of the nineteenth. Appointment was open to barristers only until 1995. The first women KCs had been appointed only in 1949.\n1953\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"20%\" |Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Inns of Court\n! width=\"20%\" |University\n!Notes\n!Ref\n|-\n| height=\"19\" |Elliot Marcet Gorst\n|Inner Temple (1912)\n|–\n|Born in 1885, Gorst was educated at Temple Grove School and Harrow School, and in Jena and Paris.
