      "text": "# The Artist and Journal of Home Culture\n\nThe Artist and Journal of Home Culture, also The Artist, was a monthly art and design journal published in London by Archibald Constable & Co. from 1880 to 1902. From 1881 to 1894 the full title was The Artist and Journal of Home Culture. From 1896 the full title became The Artist: An Illustrated Monthly Record of Arts, Crafts and Industries. An American edition was published in New York by Truslove, Hanson & Comba.\nUnder the editorship of Charles Kains Jackson, 1888&ndash;94, The Artist and Journal of Home Culture contained a notable undercurrent of homoeroticism and had some importance in the homosexual subculture without being so overt as to alienate its mainstream readership. Described by scholar Thomas Waugh as a \"closet pedophile\" publication, it featured Uranian poetry and photographs of boys by Wilhelm von Gloeden.\nEditors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Editor's name\n!Years\n|-\n|Wallace L.
