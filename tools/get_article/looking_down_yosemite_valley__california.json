It presents a view of one of America's most scenic spots. Based on sketches made during a visit in 1863, Bierstadt paints the valley from a vantage point just above the Merced River, looking due west with the prospect framed by El Capitan on the right, and Sentinel Rock on the left; the spire of Middle Cathedral Rock is visible in the distance.\nSee also\n* List of works by Albert Bierstadt\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/38038/rec/39 American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School], an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on this painting (see index)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090825000925/http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/downloads/pdfs/Resource_Guide_Chapters/PictAmer_Resource_Book_Chapter_8A.pdf Looking Down the Yosemite Valley, California] Picturing America : teachers resource book"
