This article will explore how stigma contributes to mental illness identity (\"The degree to which a chronic (mental) illness becomes integrated into a person's sense of self\") (Charmaz, 1995) and how this impacts recovery. We will also consider cultural variations in these topics. This area of research is vital to produce interventions to reduce stigma across cultures and suggest culturally sensitive interventions.\n__________________________________________________________\nIllness identity:\nIllness identity and personal identity\nSelf-identity is composed of personal and social factors (Drummond, 2020). Charmaz argued that illness identity occurs due to a disunity between the body and self, loss of value, and need for adaptation (Charmaz, 1995). According to Yanos' model of illness identity, illness identity can contribute to reduced self-esteem and poorer wellbeing through the internalisation of stigma and a loss of identity (Yanos et al., 2021).\nIllness identity and social identity\nSocial identity refers to the part of self-identity which is concerned with belonging to social groups (Tajfel, 1972).  Social Identity Theory (SIT) states that people develop social identity through categorising themselves and others into social groups and identifying with these groups (Tajfel & Turner, 1979).\nOne study on youths with type one diabetes found that individuals experienced a loss of social identity due to a deterioration of independence which impacted social relationships leading to a diminished social identity (Holden, 2019). Another study on individuals with arthritis found a decrease in psychological well-being due to a loss of identity in combination with the physical inability to fulfil social roles. This led to a loss of social identity (Abraído-Lanza & Revenson, 2006). These studies show how illness identity impacts not only personal identity, but also social identity.\nIllness identity in mental illness\nResearch suggests that mental illness identity leads to negative affect which can impact one's functioning. Philip Yanos (Yanos et al., 2010) produced a theoretical model to illustrate how it leads to an individual feeling a loss of worth. This increases the risk of suicide, symptom worsening, and has impact of social and vocational functioning. Additionally, Jennifer Wisdom (Wisdom et al., 2008) stated that societal stigma leads to the individual adopting a negative self-identity. Individuals then become focused on their illness which manifests illness identity further and makes recovery seem unattainable.\nMental illness identity and recovery\nWisdom provides insight regarding how mental illness identity affects recovery (Wisdom et al., 2008).  Wisdom conducted idiographic research (uses qualitative methods and focuses on the individual) on mentally ill individuals and their family. Key aspects of mental illness identity were identified including the duality of the ill and well self, parenting, and hope.\nWisdom reported while some individuals could differentiate the ill and well self, others believed it was easier to accept their whole identity as mentally ill \"Depression is who I am, not what I have\" (Wisdom et al., 2008, p.492). This may lead to the question of \"Who am I without this illness?\" thus preventing recovery as individuals may feel a loss of any identity without their mental illness.\nSome individuals Wisdom studied reported that being reminded of their roles in society increases their optimism towards recovery demonstrating the role of SIT (Tajfel & Turner, 1979).  Individuals expressed how their mental illness prevented them from fulfilling social roles. They struggled to fulfil their parenting duties due to the extent mental illness affected their lives. Many individuals also reported deciding not to have children for this reason. These individuals felt a loss of potential demonstrating how important social roles are to self-worth.\nWisdom's research is invaluable as it suggests that mental health interventions should highlight hope, recovery, and building a competent identity. However, her research may lack external validity as she only used 45 cases, future research should use larger samples to generate more generalisable findings. Despite this, nomothetic research (uses large samples to create universal theories) on mental illness identity has been found to be consistent with Wisdom's findings. One nomothetic study on individuals with mood disorders or schizophrenia found that greater self-stigma led to lower self-esteem leading to a lower recovery rate (Corrigan et al., 2006).\nThe difficulty of mental illness recovery due to illness identity has been studied by interviewing peer support workers (Kerr et al., 2019). Douglas Kerr said that the non-linear nature of recovery combined with identity issues can make it seem unattainable. Interviewees expressed the importance of narrative identity reconstruction (the process of redefining yourself). This involves self-mastery and The Life Story Model of Identity (LSMI) (McAdams, 2003). This states that individuals provide their own lives with unity to others, society, and purpose. This demonstrates how critical it is for mentally ill individuals to feel they have a strong personal and social identity.\n__________________________________________________________\nCulture\nCulture plays an important role in influencing whether individuals have an interdependent self-concept (defined by their relationships with others), or an independent self-concept (defined by personal traits and uniqueness) (Markus & Kitayama, 1991).  Individualist cultures promote an independent view of the self, collectivist cultures promote an interdependent view of the self. This has been shown through studies on how bilingual people's descriptions of self were affected by language (Ross et al., 2002).\nMental illness attitudes in collectivism vs individualist cultures\nA systematic review of studies across cultures found that collectivist and individualist cultures hold very different attitudes regarding mental illness (Ran et al., 2021). Mao-Sheng Ran found that collectivist cultures showed more stigma due to their values of social harmony, norms, conformism, and religious beliefs. Countries such as Japan saw mentally ill people as having weak morals and some Asian countries saw mental illness as a religious punishment. These factors lead to social isolation and low self-esteem.  Individualist cultures tend to be more tolerant of diversity since they place more emphasis on the individual.\nThese findings have been supported by a metanalysis which found that mentally ill people in collectivist cultures faced more social isolation and stigma than those in individualist cultures. This was due to collectivist cultures emphasising social cohesion, norms, unity and so forth, while individualist cultures emphasise self-expression and autonomy (Jacob et al., 2025).\nThese reviews are invaluable as they study a range of cultures and mental illnesses. This makes the findings generalisable in understanding different cultures and different mental illnesses regarding stigma and attitudes.\nMental illness identity and culture\nWhile there is no direct research regarding the interaction between illness identity and culture, there is indirect evidence providing insight into this relationship. As collectivist cultures exert many types of negative mental illness stigmata (Ran et al., 2021), using Yanos' theoretical model (Yanos et al., 2010), this negative stigma may lead to a negative self-concept. This may intensify illness identity, as individuals lose touch with their \"well\" self, making recovery seem unattainable. It may also be argued that the stigma in collectivist cultures impacts individual's social identity as they may be socially isolated. This leads to a lack of purpose in society which has been found to have negative impacts of one's wellbeing (Steffens et al., 2019). A study on mentally ill Asian Americans and their families in a collectivist community supports these notions (Park et al., 2023). The families often held negative views about mental health which hindered the individual from developing a positive self-identity. This shows the effect of public stigma.\nIndividualist cultures generally have less stigma around mental illness than collectivist cultures. A study on individualist and collectivist groups around the United Kingdom suggested this may be due to individualist cultures having more tolerance for diversity and deviation from social norms (Bhugra et al., 2022). However, there is still some stigma in individualist cultures. One study suggested that the internal locus on control (believing you are in control of your actions) (Rotter, 1966) associated with individualist cultures leads to individuals being more competitive and comparing themselves to others (Hornsey et al., 2018).  This may lead to self-stigma which would result in a negative affect and a loss of identity. This may result in illness identity, making it harder to recover.\nWhy this matters, cultural variations in recovery from mental illness\nAs previous research has shown (Wisdom et al., 2008), mental illness identity can negatively impact recovery rates. Therefore, it may be expected that there are different recovery rates in cultures with different attitudes towards mental illness.\nIn 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) Government reported statistics regarding recovery from anxiety and depression across people in the UK (UK GOV, 2020). It was found that those from individualist ethnicities had higher recovery rates than those from collectivist cultures. 67.3% of white British (individualist) were recovering while only 61.1% of Bangladesh (collectivist) were. Other collectivist groups such as Indian and Chinese, also showed lower recovery rates and higher deterioration rates. This supports the idea that more stigmatising cultures create an illness identity (Yanos et al., 2021) which prevents recovery (Wisdom et al., 2008). However, we cannot infer that individuals in the UK are surrounded by a collectivist/individualist culture from their ethnicity. For example, an Indian individual may live in an individualist area of the UK. Therefore, this study may not provide evidence into how culture impacts recovery. Future research could use a more accurate measure such as asking participants to report their cultural values.\nResearch on schizophrenia remission (symptom improvement) has also explored cultural variations. One study found that clinical remission (reduction of symptoms) was 60.1% in North Europe (individualist), and 84.4% in North Africa (collectivist) (Haro et al., 2011). This is contrary to the notion that stigma can lead to illness identity (preventing recovery) as stigma tends to be higher in collectivist cultures (Ran et al., 2021). However, functional remission (improvement in everyday functions) was 35% in North Europe and 17.8% in North Africa. Thus, illness identity may affect parts of recovery differently. Research is needed on how stigma and illness identity can impact different aspects of mental illness recovery.\nRecent studies have shown that recovery rates from mental illness are lower in collectivist cultures compared to individualist cultures. A study on patients in England (individualist) NHS talking therapies in 2022-23 found that 49.9% were considered recovered (Baker & Kirk-Wade, 2024). In contrast, a study at a similar time in India (collectivist) showed that only 1% of people diagnosed with depression were in remission that year (Teufel et al., 2024). This contrast shows significant cultural variation in recovery showing that more stigmatising cultures may create a barrier to recovery. However, only 62% of Indians diagnosed with depression received treatment (Teufel et al., 2024) whereas the study in England (Baker & Kirk-Wade, 2024) was conducted purely on individuals in treatment. Thus, the variation may be due to treatment availability.\nIt has been shown that collectivist and individualist cultures have different treatment methods. Individualist cultures use autonomous methods such as drug and psychological therapies. Collectivist cultures focus on family support and religion (Panadevo et al., 2024). Variation in recovery may be due to differences in treatment effectivity. We cannot be certain that the extent of illness identity in collectivist cultures (due to the stigma) does impact recovery rates as recovery rates may be influenced by extraneous variables.\n__________________________________________________________\nSummary\nTo conclude, research indicates that illness identity is influenced by factors such as stigma (Yanos et al., 2021). Mental illness identity makes recovery seem unattainable due to feeling a loss of identity and the idea of having to construct an identity without mental illness, (Wisdom et al., 2008).  Research shows that collectivist cultures show more mental illness stigma (Ran et al., 2021) and thus illness identity may be more prevalent. Using Wisdom's theory, we assume that recovery rates in collectivist cultures are poorer than that of individualist cultures. However, research shows mixed evidence and does not control extraneous variables. Thus, further research is required to further assess whether cultural attitudes towards mental illness have impacted recovery rates. This will be important to show that culturally sensitive interventions must be done to reduce stigma and consequentially assist recovery.\n__________________________________________________________\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Abraído-Lanza, A.
