The book was written in the context of Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign and aimed to explain some of its rationale.\nContents\nIn the book, Sanders sets out his position on climate change, free college tuition, income inequality, closing the gender wage gap and defeating Donald Trump while campaigning for Hillary Clinton during the last three months leading to the 2016 presidential election.\nSanders discusses how his presidential campaign was considered by the political establishment and the media to be a \"fringe\" campaign and something not to be taken seriously. He discusses his initial struggle as being an \"Independent senator from a small state with little name recognition\".\nReception\nUpon its release, it was on The New York Times Best Seller list at number 3.\nJohn R. Coyne Jr. gave the memoir a positive review for The Washington Times saying that \"For starters, it tells us who this man who energized so many young people really is—an enthusiastic young socialist trapped in an old curmudgeon's body, his ideas basically just as fresh to him today as when he left his native Brooklyn\".\nDavid Weigel of The Denver Post said that the memoir was \"like a sitcom character who gets beaned on the head and hallucinates an angel—or a talking dog, or a 75-year-old senator from Vermont—spinning lessons about what really matters in life\".\nSanders and Mark Ruffalo were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.\nSee also\n* Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign book\n* Crippled America, Donald Trump's 2016 campaign book published in 2015\n* Our Revolution, a PAC set up to support Sanders's policies and campaign for progressive candidates\nReferences"
