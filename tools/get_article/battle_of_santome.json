A detachment of Dominican troops forming part of the Army of the South, led by General José María Cabral, defeated an outnumbering force of the Haitian Army led by Antoine Pierrot. Almost 700 Haitian soldiers perished in the battle, and the rest, many of them wounded, were forced to retreat, being pushed back as far as the Fortress of Cachimán and subsequently beyond the border. The Haitians met defeat on the same day at the Battle of Cambronal.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
