Broadly, there are four types of tools that help create network maps and diagrams:\n* Hybrid tools\n* Network Mapping tools\n* Network Monitoring tools\n* Drawing tools\nNetwork mapping and drawing software support IT systems managers to understand the hardware and software services on a network and how they are interconnected. Network maps and diagrams are a component of network documentation. They are required artifacts to better manage IT systems' uptime, performance, security risks, plan network changes and upgrades.\nHybrid tools\nThese tools have capabilities in common with drawing tools and network monitoring tools. They are more specialized than general drawing tools and provide network engineers and IT systems administrators a higher level of automation and the ability to develop more detailed network topologies and diagrams. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:\n* Displaying port / interface information on connections between devices on the maps\n* Visualizing VLANs / subnets\n* Visualizing virtual servers and storage\n* Visualizing flow of network traffic across devices and networks\n* Displaying WAN and LAN maps by location\n* Importing network configuration files to generate topologies automatically\nNetwork mapping tools\nThese tools are specifically designed to generate automated network topology maps. These visual maps are automatically generated by  scanning the network using network discovery protocols. Some of these tools integrate into documentation and monitoring tools. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:\n* Automatically scanning the network using SNMP, SSH, WMI, etc.\n* Scanning Windows and Unix servers\n* Scanning virtual hosts\n* Scanning routing protocols\n* Performing scheduled scans\n* Tracking changes to the network\n* Notifying users of changes to the network\nNetwork monitoring tools\nSome network monitoring tools generate visual maps by automatically scanning the network using network discovery protocols. The maps are ideally suited for viewing network monitoring status and issues visually. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:\n* Automatically scanning the network using SNMP, WMI, etc.\n* Scanning Windows and Unix servers\n* Scanning virtual hosts\n* Scanning routing protocols\n* Scanning connection speeds\n* Performing scheduled scans\n* Tracking changes to the network\nDrawing tools\nThese tools help users to create network topology diagrams by adding icons to a canvas and using lines and connectors to draw linkages between nodes. This category of tools is similar to general drawing and paint tools. Typical capabilities include but not limited to:\n* Libraries of icons for devices\n* Ability to add shapes and annotations to maps\n* Ability to create free-form diagrams\nList of network monitoring tools that generate network maps\nSome notable tools (may not be an exhaustive list):\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Name\n!License\n!Deployment\n!Platforms\n|-\n|OpenNMS||AGPLv3||Desktop||Linux, macOS, others\n|-\n|PRTG||Proprietary||Desktop||Windows\n|-\n|SolarWinds||Proprietary||Desktop||Windows\n|-\n| Spiceworks||Proprietary||Desktop||Windows\n|}\nList of drawing tools\nSome notable tools (may not be an exhaustive list):\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!Name\n!License\n!Deployment\n!Platforms\n|-\n| Creately ||Proprietary||SaaS||Linux, macOS, Windows\n|-\n| Cacoo (Software)||Proprietary||SaaS||Windows, macOS\n|-\n| ConceptDraw PRO||Proprietary||Desktop||Windows, macOS\n|-\n| Dia||GPL-2.0-or-later||Desktop||Linux, macOS, Unix, Windows\n|-\n| Microsoft Visio||Proprietary||Desktop||Windows\n|-\n| SmartDraw||Proprietary||Desktop||Windows\n|-\n| Lucidchart||Proprietary||SaaS||Linux, macOS, Windows\n|-\n| Gliffy||Proprietary||SaaS||Linux, macOS, Windows\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Computer network diagram\nExternal links\n*\n*"
