He acquired the nickname \"Big Balls\" during a math class in his junior year of high school and added it to his LinkedIn profile. He enrolled at Northeastern University in 2024 as a mechanical engineering and physics major. School friends describe him as intelligent and driven, with Elon Musk being his hero. Coristine is a registered Republican.\nCareer\nEarly career\nA computer programmer and former engineering student, Coristine has founded a number of startups with companies registered in Connecticut, Delaware, and the United Kingdom. One of the startups offers an artificial intelligence Discord bot for the Russian market. Coristine owns a limited liability company named TESLA.SEXY.\nCoristine briefly worked for cybersecurity firm Path Network. Bloomberg News reported that Coristine was fired from his internship at Path Network in 2022 for allegedly leaking internal company information to a competitor. Following his dismissal, a large collection of internal Path documents and conversations was leaked online. Coristine wrote that he had retained access to Path Network's servers, but claimed he did not exploit it. Path Network confirmed that Coristine had been fired following a security incident.\nCoristine's online content delivery network, DiamondCDN, has reportedly facilitated the work of the cybercriminal group EGodly. In 2023, EGodly thanked DiamondCDN, saying, \"We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website.\" EGodly has claimed involvement in a number of crimes including email hacking, theft of cryptocurrency, and the harassment of a former FBI agent.\nAccording to investigative journalist Brian Krebs, Coristine has been active in online communities known as \"The Com\", a network of Discord and Telegram channels associated with cybercrime activities.\nFederal government\nCoristine worked briefly at Neuralink, an Elon Musk-run enterprise, before being appointed to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after President Donald Trump took office in January 2025. He was among a group of 19- to 25-year-olds without prior experience in government who were appointed to DOGE; Coristine was the youngest member of the group. He worked within the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), reporting directly to Amanda Scales, a former xAI employee appointed as OPM chief of staff. OPM records listed his role as \"expert\". According to Wired, Coristine sat in on calls using a non-government email address where workers were directed to \"go over code they had written and justify their jobs\". On one call with federal Small Business Administration staff, Coristine asserted that DOGE wanted access to human resources, contract, and payment systems at the agency.\nCoristine was discussed in a February 2, 2025 WIRED article entitled \"The Young, Inexperienced Engineers Aiding Elon Musk's Government Takeover\". Intelligencer published a February 2025 article on Coristine entitled \"'Big Balls' on Top of the World\". Saturday Night Live mentioned Coristine in a March 1, 2025, skit. A March 26, 2025 USA Today article reported that Coristine's nickname had become a \"pop culture punchline\". In a spring 2025 interview with Musk and with DOGE employees, Fox News host Jesse Watters asked, \"'Who is Big Balls?'\" \"'I am'\", Coristine replied. He added that he was working on rooting out fraud and abuse in regard to government spending.  The interview made Coristine \"well known online and among Musk's immense fanbase\".\nAlso in 2025, Coristine served as a senior advisor at the Bureau of Diplomatic Technology of the United States Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In addition, he held positions at the United States Agency for International Development and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. On May 31, 2025, Coristine became a full-time General Services Administration employee at a  General Schedule grade of 15 (the top civil service grade in the federal government). In June 2025, Coristine resigned from the General Services Administration. He was then hired by the Social Security Administration.\nIn August 2025, The Independent stated that Coristine's nickname was better known than his actual name.\nAn August 26, 2025, whistleblower disclosure by Social Security Administration chief data officer Charles Borges alleged that Coristine and others had uploaded the Social Security numbers and other personal information of 300 million Americans to a \"vulnerable\" cloud server. Borges said this action created a risk of widespread identity theft in the event of a leak or hack and that it \"potentially violated multiple federal statutes\" regarding the protection of government data.\nPersonal life\nAccording to police, Coristine was assaulted in an attempted carjacking in Washington, D.C. in the early morning hours of August 3, 2025. Two teenage suspects were arrested following the attack, while police indicated that \"multiple suspects remain outstanding\". Coristine suffered a broken nose and a concussion in the attack, and was later interviewed about it by Jesse Watters of Fox News. Trump cited the incident in a criticism of crime rates in the city, which he used as a rationale to federalize the city's police force and deploy the National Guard. The male suspect pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and assault in connection with the attack on Coristine, and the female suspect pleaded guilty to assault. Both defendants were sentenced to probation.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences"
