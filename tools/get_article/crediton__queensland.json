In the , Crediton had a population of 109 people.\nGeography\nThe ridge of the Denham Range forms the south-west boundary of the locality, while the Clarke Range (part of the Great Dividing Range) forms the north-west boundary and then extends from north to south through the locality. The terrain is mountainous and has number of named peaks:\n* Mount Bruce () at  above sea level\n* Mount St John () at  above sea level\n* Dingo Mountain () at  above sea level\n*Diamond Cliffs () at  above sea level\nMost of the locality is within protected areas with Eungella National Park in the north, Crediton Forest Reserve in the north-west and north-east and Crediton State Forest in the south.

The school closed in 1968.\nIn 1950, the residents of West Crediton began to lobby for a school in their area. Although  from the school in East Crediton, the road between the two areas was dangerous with steep drops on either side and impassable in wet weather. Local residents obtained a  for the school.
