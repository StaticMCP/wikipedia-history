The designation means that Bradford gains access to funding to improve its infrastructure and arts facilities, and will host a series of events celebrating local culture starting in 2025 for twelve months. Bradford won the designation on 31 May 2022, winning over bids from County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham County Borough to become the fourth UK City of Culture since the programme began in 2013, following Derry~Londonderry, Hull, and Coventry, as well as the second in Yorkshire.

Those long-listed have been awarded £40,000 to support their bid progressing to the next stage of the competition. The holder was set to be announced in December 2021, but was postponed due to the number of applicants, with a longlist released on 8 October 2021, a final shortlist of bidders was released on 18 March 2022. Bradford was announced as the 2025 holder by Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries on 31 May 2022, winning over the other shortlisted bids from County Durham, Southampton and Wrexham County Borough which all received £125,000 as runners-up.
