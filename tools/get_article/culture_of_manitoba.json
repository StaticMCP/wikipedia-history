Manitoba's culture has been influenced by both traditional (Aboriginal and Métis) and modern Canadian artistic values, as well as some aspects of the cultures of immigrant populations and its American neighbours. In Manitoba, the Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport is the cabinet minister responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoba culture. The Manitoba Arts Council is the agency that has been established to provide the processes for arts funding. The Canadian federal government also plays a role by instituting programs and laws regarding culture nationwide. Most of Manitoba's cultural activities take place in its capital and largest city, Winnipeg.\nArchitecture and sites\nAll of Manitoba's notable architectural sites and locations are recognized by the federal government as National Historic Sites.\nAmong the most notable of these is The Forks in Downtown Winnipeg, located at the confluence of the Red River and Assiniboine River. Other notable sites include Winnipeg's Exchange District, the original commercial centre of Winnipeg; and Lower Fort Garry, the oldest stone fur-trading post in North America that remains intact.\nMuseums\nand Planetarium]]\nThe Manitoba Museum is the largest museum in Manitoba and focuses on Manitoban heritage from prehistory to the 1920s. It also houses a planetarium and science centre. The full-size replica ship Nonsuch, whose voyage in 1668 led to the founding of the Hudson's Bay Company, is the museum's showcase piece. The Manitoba Children's Museum at The Forks, founded in 1983, presents exhibits for children that also reflect the history and economy of Manitoba. Also located at the Forks, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights has recently (2015) completed construction, and is the first Canadian national museum outside of the National Capital Region.\nat The Forks]]\nThere are two museums dedicated to the native flora and fauna of Manitoba: the Living Prairie Museum, a tall grass prairie preserve featuring 160 species of grasses and wildflowers, and FortWhyte Alive, a park encompassing prairie, lake, forest and wetland habitats, home to a large herd of bison. The Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in Morden, Manitoba houses the largest collection of marine reptile fossils in Canada, which represents the prehistoric fauna of the Manitoba Escarpment area.\nManitoba historically had an economic reliance on agriculture, which is documented in the Manitoba Agricultural Museum in Austin, which is home to Canada's largest collection of vintage farm equipment. Reflecting the importance of transportation in the development of the province, Manitoba has museums featuring the history of aviation, marine transport, and railways in the area. There are also museums devoted to specific immigrant groups. Le Musee de Saint-Boniface Museum reflects Franco-Manitoban and Métis culture and history, and is located in the oldest remaining building in Winnipeg. The Mennonite Heritage Village in Steinbach documents the history of Russian Mennonite immigrants.

Including the world's largest public collection of contemporary Inuit art, the WAG's permanent collection holds over 20,000 works, with a particular emphasis on Manitoban and Canadian art.\nMusic\nManitoba's traditional music has strong roots in Métis and Aboriginal culture.
