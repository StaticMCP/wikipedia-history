When completed, it will connect D1 highway to the Slovakia's D1 highway via the R6 expressway. It is supposed to replace the planned route of the D1 highway to Slovakia, which original direction to Púchov (Slovakia) was diverted and now leads to Ostrava.\nHistory\nConstruction began in 2008, but was suspended in 2010 at first due to a lack of funding, but ultimately due to objections and lawsuits from environmental activists. In the fall of 2019, ŘSD planned to resume construction of the Hulín to Fryšták section in 2020, with commissioning planned for 2024; other sections would follow later.\nConstruction of the first section resumed at the end of 2021. In 2024, a 9.8&nbsp;km long section between Hulín and Holešov was opened.\nFuture plans\nThe Holešov – Fryšták section is in construction, and planned for opening in 2025.\nFurther sections, between Fryšták and Vizovice (namely 4902 and 4903) are planned for 2032, 2033, 2034 and 2036. An additional  of motorway will be built.\nThe planned section of the D49 motorway between Vizovice and the state border, which was previously prepared as a three-lane directionally undivided road, was reclassified as an I/49 road in autumn 2023. In the future, that section will be a modernisation of the existing road. Construction is planned after 2030.\nRoute description\n|notes=Kilometrage starting point\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061207030103/http://www.ceskedalnice.cz/r49.htm Info on ceskedalnice.cz]\n*[http://www.dalnice-silnice.cz/R/R49.htm Info on dalnice-silnice.cz]\nReferences\nContent in this edit is translated from the existing Czech Wikipedia article at :cs:Dálnice D49; see its history for attribution."
