Yoko is able to defeat it and afterward, she and Sugimoto are picked up by Asano and the old man.

Rakushun, the rat, realizes that Yoko knows almost nothing about the Twelve Kingdoms and so shows her a crude map. He also explains how babies are plucked from trees and not grown inside the mother's stomachs as they are on Earth. He suggests that Yoko travel to En because kaikyaku and hanjyuu (creatures like himself) are held in higher regard there than in Kou. Sugimoto arrives at her lands and is told she must stay there even though she wants to go back to the castle since she is the \"chosen one\".

Yoko never shows to board the ship as she does not want to get the troop in trouble for harboring a wanted kaikyaku. She rides on a smaller boat which catches up to the ship later, that's when Sugimoto sees her. Sugimoto has second thought though when she sees how Yoko has changed. This does not stop King Kuo from summoning youma to kill her though. Sugimoto, not wanting to disappoint the king, fights Yoko during the youma attack.

She also calls for forces to be sent to her palace to arrest Seikyo who has been controlling things from there. Arriving back at the castle, all of the rebels are bowing to her.

Shouryuu is twenty years into his reign when his informants tell him about a rebellion brewing in Gen province by Atsuyu. Atsuyu usurped control of the province from his father. Gen has been prospering but the apparent lack of leadership from the king has caused Atsuyu to take more drastic measures, especially now that the flood season is upon them. The taiho Rokuta is taken prisoner to be held as a hostage in their bargaining. He is taken by a young man that Rokuta had met years ago who was raised by youma named Kouya.

Shoryuu begins massing the army to head to Gen province and at the same time he begins to shore up the river banks further up. Lady Ribi cuts the magical thread around the taiho's head killing herself so that he may go free.

Later Kouya, Shouryuu and Rokuta confront each other. Shouryuu shows mercy on Kouya telling him that he plans on making a place that would be fit for him and the youma to live in his kingdom.
