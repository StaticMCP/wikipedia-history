The forms used in the table are given first, followed by alternative acceptable abbreviations in parentheses. The punctuation of each abbreviation depends on the source. For example, the punctuation of \"The Rt Hon\" is not consistent throughout sources. The Gazette favours \"The Rt. Hon.\", while the government usually prefers \"The Rt Hon\" or \"The Rt Hon.\"\n*His/Her Majesty: HM ( TM)\n*His/Her Royal Highness: HRH ( TRH)\n*His/Her Grace: HG ( TG)\n*The Most Honourable: The Most Hon (The Most Honble)\n*The Right Honourable: The Rt Hon (The Rt Honble)\n*The Honourable: The Hon (The Honble)\n*The Much Honoured: The Much Hon (The Much Hon'd)\n*The Most Reverend: The Most Rev (The Most Revd or The Most Rev'd)\n*The Right Reverend: The Rt Rev (The Rt Revd or The Rt Rev'd)\n*The Very Reverend: The Very Rev (The Very Revd or The Very Rev'd)\n*The Reverend: The Rev (The Revd or The Rev'd)\n*The Venerable: The Ven (The Venble)\n\"The Most Noble\", which is an abbreviation of \"The Most High, Potent, and Noble\", is rarely used by Dukes and Duchesses; when used, the forenames of the peer or peeress can be used after \"His Grace\" but before \"The Duke of [...]\". This style is also sometimes used without \"His Grace\".\nNames and territorial designations\n*\"London\" represents the territorial designation of any peerage.\n**\"Edinburgh\" represents any territorial designation in Scotland.\n**\"Birmingham\" represents any manor in England or Wales.\n*\"John\" and \"William\" represent any male name\n*\"Jane\" and \"Mary\" represent any female name.\n*\"Smith\" and \"Brown\" represent any surname, regardless of gender.\nIn regards to the nobility, Mary Brown represents a woman who married John Brown, while Jane Smith represents an unmarried woman.\nRoyalty\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|King||HM The King|| rowspan=\"2\" |Your Majesty||Your Majesty, and thereafter as \"Sir\"(or the archaic \"Sire\")\n|-\n|Queen||HM The Queen||Your Majesty, and thereafter as \"Ma'am\"(to rhyme with \"jam\")\n|-\n|Prince of Wales||HRH The Prince of WalesHRH The Duke of Rothesay (in Scotland)|| rowspan=\"14\" |Your Royal Highness||rowspan=\"14\"|Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as\"Sir\" (for males) or \"Ma'am\" (for females)\n|-\n|Princess of Wales||HRH The Princess of WalesHRH The Duchess of Rothesay (in Scotland)\n|-\n|Princess Royal||HRH The Princess Royal\n|-\n|Royal peer||HRH The Duke/etc. of London, e.g. HRH The Duke of Edinburgh\n|-\n|Royal peeress||HRH The Duchess/etc. of London, e.g. HRH The Duchess of Edinburgh\n|-\n|Sovereign's son(unless a peer)\nSpouse to Queen suo jure(in the case of Prince Philip)\n|HRH The Prince John\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's wife(unless a peeress)||HRH The Princess John\n|-\n|Sovereign's daughter(unless a peeress)||HRH The Princess Mary\n|-\n|Sons of the Prince of Wales(unless a peer)||HRH Prince John of Wales, e.g. HRH Prince George of Wales\n|-\n|Daughters of the Prince of Wales(unless a peer)||HRH Princess Mary of Wales, e.g. HRH Princess Charlotte of Wales\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's sonPrince of Wales's eldest son's sons (unless a peer)||HRH Prince John of London, e.g. HRH Prince Michael of Kent\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's son's wife(unless a peeress)||HRH Princess John of London, e.g. HRH Princess Michael of Kent\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's daughterPrince of Wales's eldest son's daughtersif unmarried (unless a peeress)||HRH Princess Mary of London, e.g. HRH Princess Lilibet of Sussex\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's daughterPrince of Wales's eldest son's daughtersif married (unless a peeress)||HRH Princess Mary, Mrs John Brown, e.g. HRH Princess Beatrice, Mrs Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's son's son(unless a peer)(except sons of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales)||The Lord John Windsor, e.g. The Lord Nicholas Windsor||Dear Lord John||Lord John\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's son's son's wife(unless a peeress)||The Lady John Windsor, e.g. The Lady Nicholas Windsor||Dear Lady John||Lady John\n|-\n|Sovereign's son's son's daughter(unless a peeress)(except daughters of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales)||The Lady Mary Windsor, e.g. The Lady Helen Taylor||Dear Lady Mary||Lady Mary\n|}\nNobility\nThe preposition of may be omitted in the form of Marquessates and Earldoms and included in the form of Scottish Viscountcies. It is not often present in peerage Baronies and Lordships of Parliament, though always present in Dukedoms and Scottish feudal Baronies.\nThe definite article the in the middle of two or more titles is sometimes capitalized, as in these tables. However this is controversial: traditional British guides use the lower-case the. As a single example, Debrett's gives \"Major-General the Lord ...\", and Pears' Cyclopaedia in the section on Modes of Address gives several examples where the definite article interior to a list of honours is lower case.\nPeers and peeresses\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Duke||(The Most Noble) (His Grace) The Duke of London\n||My Lord Duke orDear Duke (of London)||Your Grace orDuke\n|-\n|Duchess||(The Most Noble) (Her Grace) The Duchess of London||Madam orDear Duchess (of London)||Your Grace orDuchess\n|-\n|Marquess||(The Most Hon) The Marquess (of) London||My Lord Marquess orDear Lord London||My Lord orYour Lordship orLord London\n|-\n|Marchioness||(The Most Hon) The Marchioness (of) London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orYour Ladyship orLady London\n|-\n|Earl||(The Rt Hon) The Earl (of) London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orYour Lordship orLord London\n|-\n|Countess||(The Rt Hon) The Countess (of) London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orYour Ladyship orLady London\n|-\n|Viscount||(The Rt Hon) The Viscount (of) London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orYour Lordship orLord London\n|-\n|Viscountess||(The Rt Hon) The Viscountess (of) London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orYour Ladyship orLady London\n|-\n|BaronLord of Parliament||(The Rt Hon) The Lord London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orYour Lordship orLord London\n|-\n|Baroness (in her own right)||(The Rt Hon) The Baroness London or(The Rt Hon) The Lady London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orYour Ladyship orLady London\n|-\n|Baroness (in her husband's right)Lady of Parliament (in her or her husband's right)||(The Rt Hon) The Lady London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orYour Ladyship orLady London\n|}\nEldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls\nEldest sons of dukes, marquesses and earls use their father's most senior subsidiary title as courtesy titles, without \"The\" before the title. If applicable, eldest sons of courtesy marquesses or courtesy earls also use a subsidiary title from their (great) grandfather, which is lower ranking than the one used by their father. Eldest daughters do not have courtesy titles; all courtesy peeresses are wives of courtesy peers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Courtesy marquess||Marquess (of) London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orLord London\n|-\n|Courtesy marquess's wife||Marchioness (of) London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orLady London\n|-\n|Courtesy earl||Earl (of) London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orLord London\n|-\n|Courtesy earl's wife||Countess (of) London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orLady London\n|-\n|Courtesy viscount||Viscount (of) London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orLord London\n|-\n|Courtesy viscount's wife||Viscountess (of) London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orLady London\n|-\n|Courtesy baronCourtesy Lord of Parliament||Lord London||My Lord orDear Lord London||My Lord orLord London\n|-\n|Courtesy baron's wifeWife of courtesy Lord of Parliament||Lady London||Madam orDear Lady London||My Lady orLady London\n|}\nHeirs of Scottish peers\nHeirs-apparent and heirs-presumptive of Scottish peers use the titles \"Master\" and \"Mistress\"; these are substantive, not courtesy titles. If, however, the individual is the eldest son of a Duke, Marquess or Earl, then he uses the appropriate courtesy title, as noted above.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Scottish peer's heir-apparentor heir-presumptive||The Master of Edinburgh||Sir orDear Master of Edinburgh||Sir orMaster\n|-\n|Scottish peer's heiress-apparentor heiress-presumptive||The Mistress of Edinburgh||Madam orDear Mistress of Edinburgh||Madam orMistress\n|}\nMale descendants of peers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Duke's younger son(Courtesy) Marquess's younger son||The Lord John Smith||My Lord orDear Lord John (Smith)||My Lord orLord John\n|-\n|Duke's younger son's wife(Courtesy) Marquess's younger son's wife||The Lady John Smith||Madam orDear Lady John||My Lady orLady John\n|-\n|(Courtesy) Earl's younger son(Courtesy) Viscount's son(Courtesy) Baron's son(Courtesy) Lord of Parliament's son||The Hon John Smith||Sir orDear Mr Smith||Sir orMr Smith\n|-\n|(Courtesy) Earl's younger son's wife(Courtesy) Viscount's son's wife(Courtesy) Baron's son's wife(Courtesy) Lord of Parliament's son's wife||The Hon Mrs John Smith||Madam orDear Mrs Smith||Madam orMrs Smith\n|}\nFemale descendants of peers\nIf a daughter of a peer or courtesy peer marries another peer or courtesy peer, she takes her husband's rank.

Esquires are distinguished by the use of \"Esq\" except in the case of a Scottish laird, whose territorial designation implies the rank of esquire.\nBaronets\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=27.5%|Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Baronet||Sir John Smith, Bt (or Bart)||Sir orDear Sir John (Smith)||Sir orSir John\n|-\n|Baronetess in her own right||Dame Mary Smith, Btss||Madam orDear Dame Mary (Smith)||Madam orDame Mary\n|-\n|Baronet's wife||Lady Brown||rowspan=\"3\"|Madam orDear Lady Brown||rowspan=\"3\"|My Lady orLady Brown\n|-\n|Baronet's divorced wife||Mary, Lady Brown\n|-\n|Baronet's widow||Mary, Lady BrownDowager Lady Brown, or Lady Brown (if the heir incumbent is unmarried)\n|}\nScottish barons\nBarons in Scotland are non-peerage nobles in the Baronage of Scotland.

The words clergy and cleric/clerk are derived from the proper term for bishops, priests and deacons still used in legal documents:  (e.g.  }}. Clergy in the Church of England are never addressed as \"Revd (Surname)\".\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=27.5%|Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Archbishop||The Most Revd and Rt Hon The Lord Archbishop of Canterbury/York||Dear Archbishop||Your Grace orArchbishop\n|-\n|Diocesan bishop in Privy Council||The Rt Revd and Rt Hon The Lord Bishop of London||Dear Bishop||My Lord or Bishop\n|-\n|Bishop, diocesan or suffragan||The Rt Revd The Lord Bishop of Durham||Dear Bishop||My Lord orBishop\n|-\n|Dean||The Very Revd The Dean of York||Dear Mr/Madam Dean||Dean orMr/Madam Dean\n|-\n|Archdeacon||The Ven The Archdeacon of London||Dear Archdeacon||Archdeacon\n|-\n|Prebendary||The Revd Prebendary Smith||Dear Prebendary Smith||Prebend\n|-\n|Canon||The Revd Canon John Smith||Dear Canon||Canon\n|-\n|Priest||The Revd John Smith or  The Revd Mr John Smith or  The Revd Dr John Smith (if applicable)||Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms/Dr Smith ||Mr/Mrs/Ms Smith orVicar/Rector/Prebendary/Curate/Chaplain etc. as applicable\n|-\n|Deacon||The Revd Deacon John Smith or The Revd John Smith||Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms Smith orDear Deacon Smith||Deacon Smith or Mr/Mrs/Ms Smith\n|}\nChurch of Scotland\nThe Church of Scotland, as a Presbyterian church, recognizes state-awarded titles only as courtesy. In court (assembly, presbytery and session) a person may only be addressed as Mr, Mrs, Miss, Dr, Prof, etc. depending on academic achievement. Thus ministers are correctly addressed as, for example, Mr Smith or Mrs Smith unless they have a higher degree  or academic appointment e.g. Dr Smith or Prof. Smith. It is 'infra dig' to use the style 'Rev' and even the use of 'the Rev Mr' requires sensitivity to official style.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=27.5%|Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address\n|-\n|Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly||His Grace The Lord High Commissioner||Your Grace||Your Grace or Sir/Ma'am\n|-\n|Clergy||The Rev John Smith||Dear Mr Smith ||Mr Smith/Dr Smith etc.\n|-\n|Current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland||The Right Rev John Smith||Dear Mr Smith ||Mr Smith/Dr Smith etc.\n|-\n|Former Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland||The Very Rev John Smith||Dear Mr Smith ||Mr Smith/Dr Smith etc.\n|}\nJudiciary\nUnited Kingdom\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=27.5%|Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address!!In court\n|-\n|Male Justice of the Supreme Court holding a peerage\n|The Right Honourable The Lord Smith\n|Lord Smith\n|Lord Smith\n|My Lord\n|-\n|Male Justice of the Supreme Court||The Right Honourable Lord Smith||Lord Smith||Lord Smith||My Lord\n|-\n|Female Justice of the Supreme Court holding a peerage\n|The Right Honourable The Lady Smith\n|Lady Smith\n|Lady Smith\n|My Lady\n|-\n|Female Justice of the Supreme Court||The Right Honourable Lady Smith||Lady Smith||Lady Smith||My Lady\n|}\nEngland and Wales\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=27.5%|Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address!!In court\n|-\n|Lord Chief Justice||The Rt Hon the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales||Lord Chief Justice||Lord Chief Justice||My Lord\n|-\n|Male Lord Justice of Appeal||The Rt Hon Lord Justice (John) Smith||Lord Justice||Lord Justice||My Lord\n|-\n|Retired male Lord Justice of Appeal||The Rt Hon Sir John Smith||Judge or Sir John||Sir John||My Lord\n|-\n|Female Lord Justice of Appeal||The Rt Hon Lady Justice (Mary) Smith, DBE||Lady Justice||Lady Justice||My Lady\n|-\n|Retired female Lord Justice of Appeal||The Rt Hon Dame Mary Smith, DBE||Judge or Dame Mary||Dame Mary||My Lady\n|-\n|Male High Court judge||The Hon.

Thus, if there is a \"Mr Justice Smith\", subsequent judges will be \"Mr Justice John Smith\", \"Mrs Justice Mary Smith\", etc. High Court Judges and above who are King's Counsel do not use the post-nominal letters following appointment or after retirement.\nA member of the Bar (but not a solicitor) addresses a circuit judge or higher, out of court, as \"Judge\".\nScotland\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=27.5%|Position!!On envelopes!!Salutation in letter!!Oral address!!In court\n|-\n|Lord President of the Court of Session/Lord Justice General of Scotland||The Rt Hon (the) Lord/Lady Smith Lord President of the Court of Session/Lord Justice General of Scotland||Lord President/Lord Justice General||Lord President/Lord Justice General||My Lord/Lady\n|-\n|Lord Justice Clerk||The Rt Hon (the) Lord/Lady Smith Lord Justice Clerk||Lord Justice Clerk||Lord Justice Clerk||My Lord/Lady\n|-\n|Senator of the College of Justice and the Chairman of the Scottish Land Court||The Hon./Rt Hon.
