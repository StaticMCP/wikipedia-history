Based on the artwork by FriendsWithYou, it aired on CBC Television in Canada and streamed exclusively on Netflix everywhere else.\nThe 10-episode first season of the series was released on Netflix on August 11, 2017, which led to two five-episode spin-off series, Season 2, titled True: Magical Friends and True: Wonderful Wishes, both of which debuted on June 15, 2018. The series was renewed for a 4-episode second season of the series, titled Mushroom Town, which was released on Netflix on May 3, 2019. True Tunes was released on July 12 on Netflix, with 8 new tracks. The series finale, titled Wild Yetis, was released on August 30, 2019.\nThe series was broadcast in the UK as a TV show on Tiny Pop from 4 April 2020 until March 2023.\nPlot\nTrue and the Rainbow Kingdom follows True and her best friend Bartleby the Cat, as they help the whimsical citizens of the Rainbow Kingdom, a wondrous, colorful universe filled with delightful and fantastical citizens. True is the only one with the ability to activate the magical powers of The Wishes of the Wishing Tree, solve problems in the Rainbow Kingdom, and empower viewers with her imagination, mindfulness, and empathy.\nDevelopment and production\nThe series was originally announced in March 2013. Titled Wish Come True at that time after the eponymous designer toys by FriendsWithYou, it was planned to have 10 half-hour episodes in a season, as produced by Home Plate Entertainment.\nIn June 2015, TVO has announced 5 new titles for their line-up of preschool series. Among them was True and the Rainbow Kingdom, and this time, it was announced to have ten 22-24-minute episodes in a season and slated to be released in 2017. In the announcement, Pharrell Williams' I Am Other was also included in the list of companies.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n* True (voiced by Michela Luci) is a strong heroine who possesses a warm heart, a clever mind and boundless energy. She accepts every challenge head-on with a beaming smile; what makes True \"truly\" extraordinary is that she is the only one in the Rainbow Kingdom to activate the Wishes’ special powers that unleash magical energy. She is eight years old at the beginning of the series.\n* Bartleby (Voiced by Jamie Watson) is True's funny black cat sidekick with a lot of bravado and the gift of gab. However, only his best friend True knows he is actually a bit of a scaredy-cat. As replied by True, he is an opinionated cat and provides a lot of commentary, which helps trigger True's creative problem-solving skills.\n* Rainbow King (voiced by Eric Peterson) is the lovable ruler of the Rainbow Kingdom. He is a kind, sympathetic and humble king. Though he possesses a wealth of knowledge, he shares his wisdom in riddles by adding fun complexity to True's adventures. He does anything to help True on her journey, but he knows that \"true\" success is achieved when True solves all of the problems with him.\n* Zee (Voiced by Dante Zee and Nicolas Aqui) is True's buddy, an apprentice to the Rainbow King, and the wish keeper. He is one or two years older than True. Being a trained Wishologist, he takes care of the Wishes and knows all about their strengths and powers. Meanwhile, when a problem arises in the kingdom, True seeks out Zee's advice and wish help in the Wishing Tree.\n* Grizelda (voiced by Anna Bartlam) is a self-centered young princess. Deep down, she realizes she needs a friend like True. Although True tries to reach out to the Princess, Grizelda's self-absorbed ways can make that challenging; however, love in the Rainbow Kingdom is unconditional, so True never stops trying. The best reason for Grizelda is that someone who is a little selfish means she needs a little more love, for some reason.\n* Frookie (voiced by Frank Welker) is a dog and Grizelda's sidekick. He looks out for the difficult princess because he knows the inner Grizelda is not so bad.\n* The Wishes are various non-verbal but highly expressive wishes which communicate with goofy gestures and sweet sounds. Each one has a unique, big personality that complements or contrasts their power. The Wishes share a special bond with True but until they are called to action, they stay busy training with Zee. Each Wish is imbued with a special power that only True can \"spark\".\nOther characters\n* Yetis are creatures that live in The Rainbow Kingdom and communicate in \"Yeti-ish\". There is, however, one word known to all Yetis that they'll greet you with accompanied by a big wave, which is a loud and friendly \"hi\" to everyone in the Rainbow Kingdom country.\n*Urg and Snick is a Yeti couple who live in Yeti Village located in The Never Ending Forest. The only couple to speak “Yeti-ish” (aside from the Rainbow King), True is usually a translator for their Yeti friends.\n*Grock, Yerk and Floof are Urg and Snick's baby Yeti triplets. Grock and Yerk are girls and Floof is a boy. They are close friends to True and Bartelby.\nRainbow citizens\n* The Grizmos are Grizelda’s sidekicks who act as her servants and live in a cave beneath her castle.\n* Cumulo is a cumulus cloud whom True and Bartleby ride on to get around the Rainbow Kingdom.\n* Glummy Glooma is the Rainbow King's gloomy cousin who prefers everything be gloomy, whether anyone likes it or not. He also acts as the Grand Marshal of Grabbleapple Fest, as it is his yearly duty to bring the grey clouds of Autumn and change the seasons.\n* Little Helpers are little four-armed critters found all around The Rainbow Kingdom, keeping it running with their helpful duties.\n* Mila is a little girl who is a citizen of Rainbow City. She has a giant pet stink critter named \"Stinko\", no longer stinky thanks to True, Bartleby, and the wishes. She is also friends with Rocky the Rock Critter.\n*Rocky is a Rock Critter who befriends Mila and The Rainbow King, in addition to True and Bartleby. However, True is the only character not to speak \"Rock-ish\".\n* Bingo Bango is a boombox shaped DJ which is a bit shy and soft-spoken. It rocks the house of any party with his music.\n* The Wishing Tree is a very important tree standing atop the Rainbow Castle where Zee, the Wish Keeper/Wishologist studies the Wishes that live there. Wee wishes are brought to the tree by the Rainbow King who collects them from Wishing Heart Hollow in the Never Ending Forest. True and Bartleby go here to ask Zee for advice to solve a problem with the help of Wishes.\n* Shadow and Silverclaw are masters of The Kittynati, an ancient tribe of cat ninjas. After being invited to train with the duo at The Black Tabby Dojo, Bartleby eventually trades in his Yellow Tabby Belt for his Red Tabby Belt, making him a true Ninja Cat and Kittynati.\nEpisodes\n| end1        =\n| color2      = #800080\n| link2       = #Season 2 (2018)\n| episodes2   = 10\n| start2      =\n| end2        =\n| color3      = #120A8F\n| link3       = #Season 3 (2019)\n| episodes3   = 9\n| start3      =\n| end3        =\n}}\nSeason 1 (2017)\nThe first season of the series, entitled The Rainbow Kingdom, was released on Netflix on August 11, 2017.\n| ShortSummary    = True and Bartleby team up to get a dejected DJ back in the groove after Grizelda shakes his confidence on the day of the Rainbow King's dance party.
