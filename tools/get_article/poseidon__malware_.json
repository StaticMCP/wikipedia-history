The credit card data is then encrypted and sent (exfiltrated) to a number of predefined Russian servers.\nIf the commercial remote administration software LogMeIn is installed, the LogMeIn settings are modified, forcing the next remote user to enter a username and password. This allows the username and password to be read into the keylogger and exfiltrated.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## PoSeidon (Malware)\n\n#REDIRECT PoSeidon (malware)"
