It was one of the very few major counter-offensive the Formosan initiated on the Japanese, and possibly the only successful one. Although the Formosan succeeded in recapturing Yunlin, they were eventually driven out in a subsequent series of Japanese assaults on the city.\nSee also\n* History of Taiwan\n* Republic of Formosa\nNotes\nReferences\n* Davidson, James W.
