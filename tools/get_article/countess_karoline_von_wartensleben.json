The monarchs, courts and legislatures of Germany accepted the decision and her eldest son was immediately recognised as Leopold IV, sovereign Prince of Lippe, reigning until compelled to abdicate in 1918 when the German Empire collapsed following the loss of World War I.\nIssue\nErnest and Karoline had six children; they were all titular counts and countesses of Lippe-Biesterfeld at birth; the ruling in 1905 made them princes and princesses of Lippe.\n* Adelaide (22 June 1870 &ndash; 3 September 1948) married Prince Frederick Johann of Saxe-Meiningen; they were the grandparents of Princess Regina of Saxe-Meiningen, wife of Crown Prince Otto of Austria\n* Leopold IV (30 May 1871 &ndash; 30 December 1949)\n* Bernhard (26 August 1872 &ndash; 19 June 1934), married morganatically to Baroness Armgard von Sierstorpff-Cramm (1883-1971) and was the father of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1911-2004), the husband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands\n*Julius Ernst (2 September 1873 &ndash; 15 September 1952) married Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n* Karola (2 September 1873 &ndash; 23 April 1958)\n* Mathilde (27 March 1875 &ndash; 12 February 1907)\nReferences and notes"
