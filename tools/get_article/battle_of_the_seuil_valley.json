The battle had the French army facing the Italian army in the Seuil valley, named after a hamlet located in Maurienne near the town of Modane in Savoy. During the battle, the Italians occupied the heights from June 10, 1940 to June 20, 1940. The battle ended with French surrender following the armistice of 24th of June 1940.\nHistory\nBackground\nItaly, governed by Benito Mussolini, declared war on France on the 10th of June 1940. The dictator planned to retake Savoy and the County of Nice, which were annexed on March 24, 1860, by the French Emperor, Napoleon III. The Italian troops, composed of the 3rd Alpini Regiment (Val Dora), and the 91st and 92nd Infantry Regiments, came from Bardonecchia, a small Italian town located on the Franco-Italian border. They followed Pelouse Pass and the Belle Plinier Pass, and took up positions above the Seuil valley, near Charmaix.\nBattle Commences\nOn the 10th June, the weather was atrocious: snow was falling, a thick fog blanketed the mountain peaks, and temperatures were below freezing. The bad weather persisted for several days. Despite everything, the Italians decided to begin their descent towards the Seuil valley (the north-facing slope). On the opposite slope (the south-facing slope), at Fort du Replaton and above it, Fort Sapey, French artillerymen opened fire and halted the Italian advance. The French forces, based in the forts above Modane, prevented the Italians from invading France. The belligerents were pinned down on the Alpine peaks separating France from Italy, unable to retreat, as the Italians forbade any withdrawal. The 91st and 92nd Infantry Regiments, lacking mountain equipment, faced a severe ordeal. For ten days, the Italians lived without warm clothing or shoes suitable for the harsh climatic conditions of the mountains. Without food and without ammunition. A number of these soldiers suffered frostbite.\nAfter the signing of the Armistice with Italy on June 24, 1940, Italian officers descended towards the command post at the hamlet of Le Seuil to begin negotiations with a group of French soldiers under the command of Captain Bullard, belonging to the 71st Alpine Fortress Battalion based in Loutraz (Modane district). The Italian soldiers requested to allow the soldiers stationed on the mountain peaks to descend into the French valley. However, citing the Armistice treaty, the French refused this request as one of the treaty's clauses stipulated that the enemy was obligated to remain in the positions they held at the time of the armistice signing. The only soldiers who were evacuated were those suffering from frostbite, who were evacuated to France via the aid stations at Le Seuil. To ensure the transport of wounded Italians to Savoyard hospitals, a constant stream of ambulances shuttled between Modane, Chambéry, and Aix-les-Bains. As for the Italian soldiers in good physical condition, they returned to Italy via the Fréjus Pass.\nDuring the Italian occupation of the heights, French troops occupied the hamlet of Le Seuil. At the end of the battle the Italians had three dead.\nNotes and References\nSources\n* Témoignage de S. Chinal pour le mensuel Terra Modana , avril 2009\nBibliography\n* , 58 p.
