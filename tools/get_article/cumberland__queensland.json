It is located approximately  west of the town of Georgetown on the Gulf Developmental Road.\nHistory\nBoom\nCumberland was born when gold was discovered there in 1872 and the first prospecting claim was registered in that same year.  By 1878, it was one of the major producers of gold in the Etheridge goldfield. The Cumberland Company dammed nearby Cumberland Creek to create a permanent water supply for the township. A battery and cyanide plant was built by the creek in 1880.\nThe town site was surveyed in June 1882 by T.R. Geraghty.\nHigh levels of gold production continued through the 1880s peaking in 1886, and the town grew to a population of about 400 people. In 1885 a police station and telegraph station were established. Cumberland Post Office opened on 3 April 1885 and closed in 1929. Both the Queensland Government Savings Bank and the Bank of New South Wales opened branch offices in 1887. The township was officially declared in 1889. The school opened in 1891. In 1894 there were four hotels.\nIn 1891 a tramway 800 metres long was built to transport the ore from the mine to the battery. To ensure a steady gradient for the heavy ore trucks, the tramway required cutting, embanking and bridges, which made it very expensive to build.\nBust\nBy the 1890s, the easily obtained gold had been removed and a cyanide treatment plant was built to extract gold from the tailings.\nThe mine and tramway closed in 1897 and the population decreased from that time. In 1899 the telegraph station closed and only one hotel remained. By 1900 the mine had produced 2,474 kg of gold at an average of 72 grams per tonne. In 1901 only 106 people remained in the town.\nIn 1901, Cumberland made the headline for the \"Cumberland Poisoning Case\". On 20 November 1901, two men, John \"Scotty\" Wilson and Edward Hollywood, were drinking at the hotel and then entered one of the bedrooms where they found a beer bottle and drank from it. Unfortunately it contained muriatic acid. Both men were taken to Georgetown Hospital, where Hollywood died on 22 November and Wilson on 24 November. The police found there were no suspicious circumstances.\nThe school closed in 1915, while the post office and the last remaining hotel closed in 1930.\nJohn Williamson was one of the last remaining residents, continuing cyanide extraction into the 1940s.\nPresent day\nOnly the square brick chimney from the Cumberland Battery remains as a memory of this town.\nToday there is a rest area which can be used by overnight campers. A popular activity is bird-watching on the lagoon created by the dam.\nSee also\n* List of tramways in Queensland\nReferences"
