In the , Peak Vale had a population of 39 people, but its boundaries were altered subsequently and its population was not separately reported in the 2021 census.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the west by the Drummond Range.\nThere are a number of named peaks in the locality (from north to south):\n* Chinaman Peak ()\n* Mount Zig Zag ()\n* Mount Tabletop ()\nThe Carbine State Forest is in the north of the locality. Apart from that protected area, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation in most of the locality, but in the southern more mountainous part of the locality, there is no active land use.\nHistory\nOn 17 May 2019, it was decided to discontinue the locality of Mistake Creek and absorb its land into the neighbouring localities of Clermont, Laglan, Frankfield and Peak Vale and to extend Peak Vale into the Central Highlands Region by altering the boundaries of Argyll.\nDemographics\nIn the , Peak Vale had a population of 39 people.\nIn the , the population of Peak Vale was not separately reported, but included within the reporting of the population of neighbouring Clermont and Alpha.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Peak Vale. Students living in the north of Peak Vale would be able to attend Clermont State School and Clermont State High School in neighbouring Clermont to the north. However, those schools would be too distant for a daily commute for students living in the southern parts of the locality. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
