The two-month tour started on May 16, 2014, spanning 20 shows in North America.\nBackground\nFollowing the release of her album, Braxton announced she would start a tour in the spring. Dates were officially released on March 28, 2014, with the tour beginning May 16, in Miami Beach.\nBefore the tour commenced, Braxton supported John Legend on his fall 2013 tour. From that experience, she stated: \"When it comes to touring, you have to be very professional. People pay to come see you. You can't keep them waiting. That's very rude. And another thing John taught me the most is to be more organized. If not, you're a mess. And trust me, ain't nobody got time for that.\" Braxton would later tour with R. Kelly in 2014.\nSetlist\nThe following setlist was obtained from the concert held on May 16, 2014; at The Fillmore Miami Beach in Miami Beach, Florida.
