The party took part in the 2021 House of Representatives elections in two electoral districts; they did not win a seat in the election.\nHistory\nThe Party for the Republic was founded in 2020 by lawyer and Rotterdam politician Manuel Kneepkens, emeritus professor of urban sociology Lodewijk Brunt, media entrepreneur Teun Gautier and journalist René Zwaap. That year, on Prinsjesdag, the party presented its draft party program , a 10-step plan to transform the Dutch monarchy into a modern republic. For the party, the abolition of the monarchy is not an end in itself. The party wants to transform the European Union into a European Republic with a lot of autonomy for the member republics. The party ultimately wants to become a transnational European party.\nThe party took part in the 2021 House of Representatives elections in two electoral districts with party leader Bruno Braakhuis and obtained a total of 255 votes, insufficient for a seat.\nIdeology\nThe party program for the House of Representatives elections of 2021 listed several key points, such as the abolition of the King of the Netherlands as head of state, the implementation of an elected president following the Swiss model, and strengthening of direct democracy. With regard to the Europe, the party wanted to establish a European republic, and abolish the Council of Europe and introduce a transnational democratic system with a European constitution.\nElection results\nHouse of Representatives\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
