However, as incumbent president Makarios III was the only candidate, the elections were not held and Makarios III was automatically declared the winner.\nA separate election for the vice presidency took place. Rauf Denktaş stood unopposed and was elected.\nElectoral system\nThe elections were held using a two-round system; if no candidate received over 50% of the vote in the first round, a second round was to be held between the top two candidates. The constitution required the president to be a Greek Cypriot and the vice president to be a Turkish Cypriot. Greek Cypriots elected the president and Turkish Cypriots elected the vice president.\nReferences"
