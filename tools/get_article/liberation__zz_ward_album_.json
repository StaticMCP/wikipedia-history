The record includes both original songs, and some covers.\nIn an interview with Darryl Sterdan of Tinnitist, Ward said: “This is who I’ve always wanted to be — a blues artist, on my terms,” she continued. “It just took me a long time to get here.” Sterdan went to describe the record as a \"fearless exploration of empowerment, authenticity, and self-discovery.\" he went further teasing some details about the album content, saying it was: \"written during her journey through motherhood, the album finds Ward returning to her blues roots, reflecting the raw, unfiltered emotions of life’s trials and triumphs.\"\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = B-Sides & Badlands\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Cryptic Rock\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = The Wall Eye\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Mystic Sons\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = Rock and Blues Muse\n| rev6score = Positive\n| rev7 = Return of Rock\n| rev7score = Positive\n}}\nLiberation was met with critical acclaim from blues rock media outlets and music critics alike, who deemed it as a triumphant rebirth from the singer to her blues roots.\nBlues Rock Magazine awarded the album with a 9 out of an average rating of 10, with music critic Allan Claudio calling it \"an amazing soundtrack to her life experiences\". He also praised Ward's vocal performance, which Claudio described it as \"filled with power and determination\".\nShawn Donohue of Glide Magazine similarly praised the album and described it as \"[it] finds the songstress rediscovering her love of the blues and delivering a stirring effort\", and concluding that \"While Ward is a music industry veteran, Liberation finds her re-energized, fully embracing her blues love while carving her own path forward.\"\nDarryl Sterdan of the Tinnist selected the record as one of the \"Albums Of The Week\", applauding the album for its \"aunthenticity and its sense of intrepid creativity\" which results on \"her truest and most blues-infused to date.\" He concluded that Liberation is \"both a reclamation and a rebirth\" of Ward's blues jorney.\nYork Calling critic Graeme Smith opined that Liberation is an \"accomplished example of the [Blues] genre\", dubbing it a \"fiercely authentic\" album.
