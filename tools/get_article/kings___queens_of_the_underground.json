It was Idol's first album of new material since ''Devil's Playground (2005). It debuted at number 34 on the Billboard'' 200, becoming Idol's highest-debuting album to date, and number 9 on the Billboard Top Rock Albums chart for the week of 8 November 2014. Videos were released for the songs \"Can't Break Me Down\" and \"Save Me Now\".\nBackground\nThe album features new-wave synthesizers and keyboards, reflecting a new creative direction for Idol, and includes autobiographical lyrical themes from his co-written autobiography, Dancing With Myself. The title track was a collaborative effort, with Idol conceiving the concept and then, with his band, paying homage to fallen New York rock and roll heroes.The initial recording sessions were completed, but Idol felt the album was still incomplete. To finish the record, Idol reached out to Greg Kurstin, who wrote and produced the songs that would become the album's single.\nTour\nThe Kings & Queens of the Underground Tour started on 5 November 2014 and ended 4 April 2015. Over the 40-date tour, Idol with his band performed in Europe, North America and Australia. The setlist included five songs from the album, \"Postcards from the Past\", \"Can't Break Me Down\", \"Save Me Now\", \"Kings & Queens of the Underground\" and \"Whiskey and Pills\", as well as 13 older songs and two guitar solos by Steve Stevens.\nCritical reception\nThe album was met with mixed to positive reception with the album receiving a combined score of 64/100 on Meatcritic. Classic Rock game the album a positive review stating “The plastic punk with the cartoon sneer has made his grown-up masterpiece.”\nTrack listing\n| extra1            = Trevor Horn\n| length1           = 3:57\n| title2            = Can't Break Me Down\n| writer2           =\n| extra2            = Greg Kurstin\n| length2           = 3:42\n| title3            = Save Me Now\n| writer3           =\n| extra3            = Kurstin\n| length3           = 4:31\n| title4            = One Breath Away\n| writer4           =\n| extra4            = Horn\n| length4           = 4:10\n| title5            = Postcards from the Past\n| writer5           =\n| extra5            = Horn\n| length5           = 4:20\n| title6            = Kings & Queens of the Underground\n| writer6           =\n| extra6            = Horn\n| length6           = 4:53\n| title7            = Eyes Wide Shut\n| writer7           =\n| extra7            = Horn\n| length7           = 4:29\n| title8            = Ghosts in My Guitar\n| writer8           =\n| extra8            = Horn\n| length8           = 4:47\n| title9            = Nothing to Fear\n| writer9           =\n| extra9            = Horn\n| length9           = 4:39\n| title10           = Love and Glory\n| writer10          =\n| extra10           = Horn\n| length10          = 4:28\n| title11           = Whiskey and Pills\n| writer11          =\n| extra11           = Horn\n| length11          = 3:43\n}}\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title12           = Hollywood Promises\n| writer12          =\n| extra12           =\n| length12          = 4:11\n}}\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title12           = Hollywood Promises\n| writer12          =\n| extra12           =\n| length12          = 4:11\n| title13 = Cradle of Love\n| note13 = live from Vienna\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 = Keith Forsey\n| length13 = 4:42\n| title14 = Dancing with Myself\n| note14 = live from Vienna\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = Forsey\n| length14 = 5:39\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Billy Idol – vocals (all tracks)\n*Steve Stevens – lead, rhythm guitar (all tracks), acoustic guitar (tracks 1, 6–8, 11)\n*Billy Morrison – rhythm guitar (tracks 4, 9)\n*Trevor Horn – bass guitar (tracks 1, 4–11), programming (tracks 5, 7, 8), keyboards (tracks 6, 8, 11)\n*Ash Soan – drums (tracks 1, 4, 6–10), percussion (tracks 1, 8)\n*Matt Chamberlain – drums (track 3)\n*Joel M Peters – drums (track 11)\n*Tim Weidner – percussion (tracks 4, 9, 11), programming (track 7)\n*Julian Hinton – orchestral arrangement and programming (tracks 4, 6, 8, 10)\n*Pete Murray – orchestral arrangement and programming (track 7)\n*Geoff Downes – keyboards (tracks 1, 4–10)\n*Cameron Gower Poole – programming (tracks 1, 4, 9), keyboards (tracks 7, 9, 11), guitar (track 9)\n*Greg Kurstin – guitar (track 2), bass guitar (tracks 2, 3), keyboards (tracks 2, 3), drums (track 2), programming (track 3)\n*Josh Campbell – programming (tracks 1, 5), guitar (track 5), bass guitar (track 11)\n*Renate Sokolovska – flute (track 6)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Kings & Queens of the Underground\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 81\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release history and formats for Kings & Queens of the Underground\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n| rowspan=\"2\"|17 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"5\"|\n|rowspan=\"5\"|BFI\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n| 20 October 2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada\n| rowspan=\"2\"|21 October 2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
