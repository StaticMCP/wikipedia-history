In 2020, the British Construction Industry Awards will be held on the evening of Wednesday 28 October at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane in London.\nAward winners\n2019\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"\n!
