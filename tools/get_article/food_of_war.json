      "text": "# Food of War\n\nFood of war is a multidisciplinary art collective founded in December 2010.  The founding members include Omar Castaneda, a visual artist from Colombia and the United Kingdom; Hernán Barros, a special effects artist also from Colombia and the United Kingdom; and Andreina Fuentes, an artist, collector, and entrepreneur from Caracas, Venezuela.\nHistory\nEarly Years and Inaugural Exhibition\nFood of War's journey began with the exhibition \"Clouded Lands,\" launched in September 2015 at BMSP London. This itinerant showcase focused on the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, touring international venues such as the National Arsenal Museum in Kiev, the International Peace Congress in Berlin, the Foundation Caja de Burgos in Spain, and The London Rich Mix. Featuring contributions from over 25 artists from various backgrounds, \"Clouded Lands\" was a poignant tribute to the nuclear disaster's impact.\nExpansion and Recognition\nOver the years, Food of War has participated in prominent art fairs including ARCO Madrid, JustMad, Art Lima, Zona Maco, and SP-Arte. Significant projects such as \"Peace at the Tables\" at the Museum of Contemporary Arts in Bogotá highlight the collective's dedication to exploring complex sociopolitical issues through art.\nAdaptation and Innovation\nDespite global challenges like the 2020 quarantine, Food of War continued to innovate, collaborating with curator Gabriella Sonabend on the immersive exhibition \"Terra Nexus\" at Proposition Studios and Southbank Centre, which explored Human Ecology.\nThe following year, the collective introduced \"Forbidden Fruit\" an exploration of Immersive Gastronomy, further showcasing their commitment to pushing artistic boundaries.\nRecent Activities\nIn late 2022, a retrospective of Food of War's work spanning 12 years was displayed at the prestigious Saatchi Gallery in the United Kingdom. The collective continued to expand its influence with exhibitions such as \"Uitmelken: Harvesting Money\" in Amsterdam and participation in international art festivals including the 60th Venice Biennale, Bienal de la Havana, MMMad Festival, and 48h Neukölln Festival in 2024.\nExhibitions\nThe first massive exhibition of Food of War was the \"Clouded Lands\", held in the National Art and Culture Museum Complex \"Mystetskyi Arsenal\" of Kyiv in Ukraine in 2016. Then, the exhibition was moved to Berlin to participate in the Congress Disarm! For a Climate of Peace, and the Centro de Arte Caja de Burgos in Spain, and finally in London. In each country, the artist collective worked closely with local artists to address the Chernobyl disaster and how this event changed the way Europeans eat.\nExhibitions by date\n* November 8, 2014, Aguapanela is my cup of tea, The Container, London\n* August 26, 2015, Panela: The New Gold of Colombia, Chalton Gallery, London\n* September 24–30, 2015, BSMT SPACE, Dalston, London\n* February 23–28, 2016, Justmad 7 Emerging Art Fair, COAM Sede del Arte,  Madrid, Spain\n* March 9 – April 16, 2016, Panela: The New Gold of Colombia, Museum of Contemporary Art (MAC) Bogota, Colombia\n* April 5–28, 2017, Clouded Lands, Rich Mix, Mezzanine Gallery, London\n* May 27 – 9, Clouded Lands, Arsenal de Mystetskyi, Kyiv Ukraine\n* February 21–26, 2017, Justmad 8, COAM La Sede del Arte Madrid, Spain\n* February 19, 2018, Insect Flesh, Art week in Mexico City, Mexico\n* April 18–4, 2018, Contamination, Art Fair Art Lima, Lima, Peru\n* April 4, 2017, Ópera dos Porcos, Rabieh Gallery, São Paulo, Brazil\n* November 15, 2019 – February 20, 2020. ¿Paz en las Mesas?.
