It is the second direct-to-video prequel of the 1996 film Dragonheart, and it takes place about 50 years after ''Dragonheart 3: The Sorcerer's Curse''. It was released on Netflix, DVD, and Blu-ray on June 13, 2017.\nPlot\nGareth and Rhonu had a son named Walter years after becoming rulers. After Gareth spent most of his time helping Drago and Rhonu died after her bonded dragon's death, Walter became disillusioned with dragons and ran away. Years later, Walter's wife gives birth to fraternal twins with strange patches of scales on their bodies and dies; Walter raises them despite their appearances.\nTwenty years later, King Gareth nears death, and succession is in doubt with Walter still missing. Gareth passes, but Drago survives, learning he is now bonded to someone else. Drago finds his heart now bound to Edric, the male twin who possesses enhanced strength and uses it as a sheriff for Earl Robert Cole's shire. Learning that Walter was Edric's father, Drago convinces Edric to take Gareth's throne in Lundenwic; despite the people loving Edric, his arrogance and inexperience with royal duties bother Drago. Realizing their bond is partial, Drago confronts Edric, who shares his twin sister Mehgan's existence. Mehgan grew up prejudiced because of her more visible scales and power to manipulate fire. After she accidentally burned down their home with Walter inside, Edric bargained to send her away by boat to protect her from the villagers. Unwilling to forsake the chance to be Robert's sheriff, he did not go with Mehgan.\nEdric later learns that Vikings have invaded, and he rides out with his army to meet them. Still refusing to trust Drago, he ignores advice to let Drago fight and instead challenges the Norsemen's leader to a duel, only to find that it is Mehgan. The twins have a meeting where Drago teaches them about the Heartfire, the source of his fire breath. Mehgan demands the throne as she is the firstborn twin, but Edric refuses and ends the negotiations. Mehgan and her army sneak into the camp overnight, and she drains the Heartfire from Drago while he sleeps. The Norsemen start their attack, and Mehgan reveals her control of the Heartfire. Overwhelmed by Mehgan's power, Edric surrenders. Once Mehgan and the Vikings secure control, she banishes Edric, unaware that Thorgrim sent men after him. Edric flees to Robert's shire and requests aid in opposing Mehgan, but Robert betrays him to the Vikings, who take him aboard a boat to sell him into slavery. While Mehgan improves women's rights in the kingdom, she tells a captive Drago what happened after Edric sent her away. After emerging the sole survivor of a storm, she drifted until running aground in Daneland, where her powers caught Thorgrim's attention. Edric tries escaping his captors but nearly sinks the boat. After locals free him from captivity, Drago rescues Edric, and they later receive aid from a theatre troupe. They reconcile as Edric reveals his guilt over his hateful last words to his father and sending Mehgan away alone. Edric learns Drago is dying without the Heartfire, so they sneak into the castle with the troupe's help. When Edric attempts to take the Heartfire from Mehgan, he sees Thorgrim's right-hand woman Sable trying to kill her. Edric's warning saves Mehgan, but their refusal to cooperate allows Sable to give Thorgrim the Heartfire, and he promptly targets the twins.\nDrago saves the twins from getting captured and forces them to fight to the death for the throne; they fight and argue until Mehgan reveals what really happened when Walter died: Edric accidentally killed their father during a fight over him becoming sheriff, and she took the blame to protect his chance at a good life; the truth compels them to reconcile. Returning to the castle, Edric challenges Thorgrim to get the Heartfire while Mehgan rallies the castle's women to help her fight. Mehgan finds an open flame, but Sable and an archer mortally wound her, also affecting Drago. Thorgrim absorbs the Heartfire to control its power but gets overwhelmed. Edric kills him, scaring off the Vikings, and Mehgan recovers the remaining Heartfire. Instead of taking it back, Drago has Edric use it to heal Mehgan. Then the twins share the bond of their dragonhearts, removing their scales and powers. With Gareth's family whole again, Drago dies peacefully and becomes a new star in the Draco's tail, telling the twins to rule their kingdom together.\nCast\n* Patrick Stewart as Drago (voice)\n* Tom Rhys Harries as Edric\n* Jessamine-Bliss Bell as Mehgan\n* Tamzin Merchant as Queen Rhonu\n* André Eriksen as Thorgrim\n* Turlough Convery as Walter\n* Richard Cordery as Earl Robert Cole\n* Martin Hutson as Osmund\n* Delroy Brown as Councilor Marraka\n* Valeriu Bazu as King Gareth\n* Lewis Mackinnon as Player\n* Marte Germaine Christensen as Sable\n* Ørjan Gamst as Krokr\n* Daniel Berge Halvorsen as Hakon\n* Stig Frode Henriksen as Leiknarr\n* Dina De Laurentiis as Kendra\n* Edouard Philipponnat as Tomi\n* Mihai Hurduc as Juggler\n* Elijah Ungvary as Spaki\n* Minhea Trusca as Woodsman\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAfter the video release of the series' third film in 2015, a sequel was later confirmed to be in development.

A source of inspiration was the musical form called Chaconne, which he used throughout the score, which McKenzie completed in six weeks. Like the previous films, it contains the original main theme from the first film by Randy Edelman. McKenzie consulted with each film's director and producer to determine where the theme should and should not play; they decided it should be used for \"moments when hope and chivalry come alive through the great dragon\".\nReception\nCommon Sense Media gave it 3 out of 5.\nSequel\nA direct-to-video sequel directed by Ivan Silvestrini, Dragonheart: Vengeance, was released in February 2020.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
