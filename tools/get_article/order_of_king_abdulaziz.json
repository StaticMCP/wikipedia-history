The order was named after Abdulaziz Al Saud, founder of the modern Saudi state.\nHistory\nIn 1971, the introduction of orders was announced in a decree. It was instituted by King Faisal on 20 March 1971. However, the order had been awarded before that date unsystematically. These earliest versions were produced by Bichay in Cairo, Egypt. The early version of the order was called Great Chain of Badr. The Saudi king, Fons honorum of the orders, confirmed the decree in his Royal decree.\nCollar of the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud\nThe collar is regarded as a separate order. It also confers the highest rank in the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud and, unlike the Great Chain of Badr, is awarded to non-Muslim heads of state.\nThe Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud\nThe order is awarded to citizens of Saudi Arabia and foreigners for meritorious service to the Kingdom. The Council of Ministers makes the nominations but the King confers awards to foreigners himself when he determines it to be appropriate. Awardees enter in the 4th class of the order, with the exception of ministers and appointees for bravery, who can enter the order in a higher class. Members of the order can advance to the next higher class every five years.\nThe number of Saudi conferments is limited annually. The statutes of the order stipulate no more than 20 grand sashes of the distinguished class. Up to 40, 60, 80 and 100 awards can be granted to members of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th classes, respectively.\nClasses\nThe Classes include:\n*Special Class (comparable with \"Grand Cordon\"). A sash with pendant is worn on the right shoulder, plus a star on the left chest;\n*Distinguished First Class (comparable with \"Grand Officer\"). The insignia is worn on a necklet, plus a golden star on the left chest;\n*First Class (comparable with \"Commander 1st Class\"). The insignia is worn on a necklet, plus a silver star on the left chest;\n*Second Class (comparable with \"Commander\"). The insignia is worn on a necklet;\n*Third Class (comparable with \"Officer\"). A badge is worn on a ribbon with a rosette on the left chest;\n*Fourth Class (comparable with \"Knight\").
