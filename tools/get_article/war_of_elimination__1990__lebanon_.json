It was fought between the Lebanese Army, led by General Michel Aoun, and the Lebanese Forces, led by Samir Geagea. The confrontation led to the total devastation of the Eastern Canton and ended with the Syrian army invading the Christian areas, Aoun's exile to France and subsequently the end of the civil war.\nBackground\nOn 22 September 1988, Michel Aoun, the commander of the Army at the time, was appointed by president Amine Gemayel as the head of the Lebanese government.\nOn 14 March 1989, Aoun declared the War of Liberation against the Syrian occupation army in Lebanon.\nOn 31 January 1990, Aoun launched an offensive against the Lebanese Forces in East Beirut. In the months that followed, over 1000 people were killed.\nA month later in March, Aoun declared a halt to the fighting and announced his willingness to accept the Taif Agreement with some amendments.\nThis confrontation ended with the Syrian army invading the Christian areas, the exile of Aoun to France, and Geagea's imprisonment after three years, due to a disagreement with the Syrians.\nEtymology\nThe conflict came to be known as the war of elimination (حرب الإلغاء), the term which was used by the LF to denote the attempt by Aoun to eliminate it. However, Aoun used the term Weapon Unification Battle (معركة توحيد البندقية) since he claimed his purpose was to submit all weapons in the country to the Lebanese Army. Nonetheless, the weapons are still possessed today by parties other than the government, like Hezbollah.\nAllegations\nSome believe that the war was agreed between Aoun and the Syrians, in order to eliminate the Lebanese Forces and allow the Syrian army to enter the Christian Area, in return for Aoun's presidency. However, when the Syrians did not keep the promise, he declared the War of Liberation on the Syrians. However, 26 years later, in 2016 Aoun became the president of Lebanon.\nSee also\n* Lebanese Civil War\n* Lebanese Armed Forces\n* Lebanese Forces\n* Weapons of the Lebanese Civil War\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Barry Rubin (editor), Lebanon: Liberation, Conflict, and Crisis, Middle East in Focus, Palgrave Macmillan, London 2009.  – [https://books.google.com/books?id=9V_JAAAAQBAJ&dq=maronite+league&pg=PA40]\n* Edgar O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon, 1975-92, Palgrave Macmillan, London 1998.\n* Hassan Krayem, The Lebanese Civil War and the Taif Agreement, American University of Beirut, in collaboration with Al Mashriq of Høgskolen i Østfold, Norway, 981125 PN (no date) – [http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/conflict-resolution.html]\n* Paul E.
