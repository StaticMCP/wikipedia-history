Originally called the War School, it was renamed the War College in 1934. It occupied the third floor of Tychonova 1 in Prague - as of 2017 the headquarters of the Czech Ministry of Defense.\nNotable alumni of the War College included Emanuel Moravec. The War College ceased operations in 1938.\nReferences"
