Instead of viewing some sources of ideas – such as parents’ ideas – as having authority, Taking Children Seriously takes the growth of knowledge seriously, which means free competition of the ideas irrespective of source.\nThe TCS model of parenting and education views coercion as infringing on the will of the child, and also rejects parental or educator \"self-sacrifice\" as infringing on the will of the adult. TCS defines coercion as: \"double-binding – putting others in no-win situations – using your ingenuity to actively prevent problems being solved. Authority. Interacting hierarchically. Looking down on.\" TCS advocates that parents and children act creatively to find solutions without force or compromise.\nThe TCS philosophy is informed by the epistemology of Karl Popper and David Deutsch, a theoretical physicist at Oxford University.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.takingchildrenseriously.com Taking Children Seriously Website]\n*  [http://www.utne.com/2003-11-01/Free-to-Be-Me.aspx Reprinted] in the Utne Reader\n*\n* *"
