He probably believed it was too difficult to pick a side. In the summer of 1468, both him and Karl Knutsson agreed to hold a meeting, in which they agree to a year-long truce between Sweden and Denmark. During the meeting, demands are issued from both sides. Karl Knutsson demanded that the Danes hand over the fortresses in Sweden loyal to Christian I, and Christian demanded that Knutsson renounce the Swedish throne.\nWar\nIn late 1468, Karl Knutsson began a campaign to reconquer the fortresses loyal to Denmark. Axevall, commanded by Ivar Gren, is soon confronted by a Swedish force. Gren also failed in his attempts to negotiate with Karl Knutsson not to invade Västergötland. With this failure, Gren fled to Denmark, leaving the defense of Axevall to the garrison. The Swedes immediately besieged the fortress with some 1,000 men on new years in 1469 and Karl Knutsson made his way north.\nIn January of 1469, Karl Knutsson reinforced the besieging army outside Axevall and also besieged Älvsborg, where he established a sconce infront of Gullberg fortress. Soon after, Christian I marcched through Scania and Halland before invading Västergötland in order to relieve Axevall. He made it to Skara without meeting any resistance. The Swedish besiegers of Axevall, hearing of Christian's advance, retreated into Tiveden. This was probably because they believed to be weaker than the Danish force.\nBattle of Bjerkelunda/Herrljunga\nHearing of the Swedish retreat, Christian marched into Småland. After being dispatched to meet the Danish force, Ivar Axelsson Tott won a small victory against them. Despite the small defeat, the Danes continued deeper into Småland and soon Ivar Axelsson's force was being chased by the Danes. At Bjerkelunda/Herrljunga, Ivar Axelsson ended his retreat and accept battle on 27 March. This ended in a Danish victory and Christian withdrew into Denmark after it. Christian claimed that the Danes suffered 45 wounded and 1 dead, while the Swedes lost 600 men and 450 horses.\nAftermath\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
