The 136 pages book was published by Beacon Press on February 7, 2023. The book is written by David Lester and edited by Paul Buhle. The story opens with a character named John Brown being hung for piracy. The protagonists are John Gwin, Ruben Dekker, and Mary Read who are all aboard a ship called The Night Rambler. Laboring as a sailor was dangerous and the leadership oppressive and violent, which often led to sailors mutinying and turning to piracy. The pirates would then elect their leaders.\nReception\nPublishers Weekly reviewed the book saying \"It’s wild, often inspiring material, if a bit shallow in its attempts at mythmaking.\"\n}}\nExternal links\n*  in Yes!
