The party's launch was announced after a week of meetings on 15 January 2012. In December, Ruto and the leaders of several other political parties signed a pre-election coalition deal, in which he became a running mate for Uhuru Kenyatta and URP received half the spoils of an election victory. The party subsequently joined the Jubilee Alliance, which nominated Kenyatta for the presidency. In the elections Kenyatta was elected president, whilst the URP emerged as the third-largest party in Parliament, winning 12 seats in the Senate and 76 in the National Assembly.\nIn 2016, the party was dissolved by Secretary-General Fred Muteti and William Ruto merging into the Jubilee Party.\nReferences"
