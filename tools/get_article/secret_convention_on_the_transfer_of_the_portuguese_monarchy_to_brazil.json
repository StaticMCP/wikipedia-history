More specifically, it was agreed upon just a few days before the first invasion of Portugal in the Peninsular War, when French troops were already approaching the Portuguese borders through Spanish territory. Later, Portuguese aspirations became reality with the support of the British Royal Navy during the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil, and Portugal complied with British requirements by opening the Brazilian ports to their goods and allowing the occupation of Madeira by Britain.\nReferences"
