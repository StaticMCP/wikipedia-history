      "text": "# Warren Range\n\nWarren Range () is an Antarctic mountain range about 15&nbsp;nautical miles (28&nbsp;km) long just west of Boomerang Range, with which it lies parallel, in Oates Land. Discovered by the Northern Survey Party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1956–58), which called the highest summit \"Mount Warren\" after Guyon Warren, a member of the party in 1957–58. To avoid confusion with another mountain of the same name, the name Warren has instead been applied to the whole range.[https://adam.antarcticanz.govt.nz/nodes/view/20296]\nFeatures\nGeographical features include:\n* Deception Glacier\n* Mount Guyon\n* Mount Ritchie\n* Skelton Icefalls\n* Wise Peak\nNearby features are:\n* Hamner Nunatak\n* Mount Darbyshire"
