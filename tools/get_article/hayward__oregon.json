Settled in the late 1880s and named in 1891 by Binger Hermann, it is located off U.S. 26 near Manning. It had a public school from 1891-1945. The school was a 20'x30' frame building that cost $184.44 to build, which included $60 for the carpenter, William Clapshaw. In 1946 it was sold at auction, dismantled, and moved to Banks.\nIt has a cemetery, opened in 1894. It had a post office from December 1891 until November 1904.
