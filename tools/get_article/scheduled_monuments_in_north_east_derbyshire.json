Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are about 20,000 scheduled monument entries on the list, which is maintained by English Heritage; more than one site can be included in a single entry.\nWhile a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, English Heritage considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by English Heritage to \"no longer merit scheduling\" it can be descheduled.\nDerbyshire has over 500 scheduled monuments including many stone cairns, stone circles, barrow burial mounds, lead mining relics, ancient settlements, and over 20 bridges.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Image\n!Name and reference\n!Feature\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Bowl barrow on Longside Moor\n|Barrow\n|Holymoorside and Walton\n|450m north of Harewood Grange\n|-\n|\n|Cairn complex near Dalebrook House\n|Cairns\n|Brampton\n|780m south of Dalebrook House\n|-\n|\n|3 Cairnfields near Ramsley Lodge\n|Cairns\n|Holmesfield\n|180m NE, 400m NE and 860m NE  of Ramsley Lodge\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield near Saltersitch Bridge\n|Cairns\n|Holmesfield\n|320m North of Saltersitch Bridge, Eastern Moors\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield near Syda Farm\n|Cairns\n|Holymoorside and Walton\n|390m South of Syda Farm\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield near Moor Edge Farm\n|Cairns\n|Holmesfield\n|615m West of Moor Edge Farm\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield near Nether Rodknoll Farm\n|Cairns\n|Brampton\n|800m West of Nether Rodknoll Farm\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield and embanked stone circle\n|Cairns\n|Holmesfield\n|550m East of Barbrook Reservoir\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield and field system\n|Cairns\n|Brampton\n|530m South of Dalebrook House\n|-\n|\n|Cairnfield, linear clearance and ring cairn\n|Cairns\n|Holmesfield\n|720m NW of Moor Edge Farm\n|-\n|\n|Castle Hill motte and bailey castle\n|Castle\n|Holmesfield\n|\n|-\n|\n|Coke ovens\n|Metalworks\n|Dronfield\n|120m NE of Summerley House\n|-\n|\n|Holmesfield moated site and headland\n|Moated site\n|Holmesfield\n|\n|-\n|\n|Lead smelt mill in Linacre Wood\n|Metalworks\n|Brampton\n|160m East of Lower Linacre Reservoir dam\n|-\n|\n|Lead smelting site on Ramsley Moor\n|Metalworks\n|Holmesfield\n|600m SW of Foxlane Farm\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Seldom Seen Engine House\n|Plumbley Colliery including Seldom Seen engine house\n|Mining\n|Eckington\n|600m NE of Roundhill Cottages\n|-\n|\n|Red lead mill, lead smelt mill, and corn mill\n|Metalworks\n|Holymoorside and Walton\n|East of Nether Loads Farm\n|-\n|\n|Ring cairn and cairn on Ramsley Moor\n|Cairns\n|Holmesfield\n|850m NE of Ramsley Lodge\n|-\n|\n|Rodknoll fancy barrow\n|Barrow\n|Brampton\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ruins of Trinity Chapel\n|Chapel\n|Brackenfield\n|Also a Grade II listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Section of Rykneld Street Roman road\n|Road\n|Wingerworth\n|70m long, North of Redleadmill Brook\n|-\n|\n|Section of Rykneld Street Roman road\n|Road\n|Tupton\n|220m NE of Pear Tree Farm\n|-\n|\n|Stone Edge smelt mill at Moss Farm\n|Metalworks\n|Ashover\n|\n|-\n|\n|Sutton Scarsdale Hall\n|House\n|Sutton cum Duckmanton\n|A Georgian ruined stately home in Sutton Scarsdale, just outside Chesterfield.
