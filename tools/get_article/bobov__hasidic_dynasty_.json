After the death of his son Naftali, a succession crisis ensued, leading to the ascension of Naftali's half-brother Benzion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam as Grand Rebbe, and his son-in-law Mordechai Dovid Unger as leader of , a breakaway faction.\nBobov communities are found in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn; in Monsey, New York; Los Angeles; Lakewood, New Jersey;  Linden NJ; Montreal; Toronto; Antwerp; and London. In Israel, Bobov has large branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Ashdod, Elad, Beitar Illit, and an enclave, \"Kiryas Bobov\", in Bat Yam.\nOutline of Bobov's Hasidic rabbinical lineage\nGrand RabbiShlomo Halberstam(1907–2000)author of Divrei Shlomo|NTH= Grand RabbiHrh\"k R Naftali Tzvi Halberstam(1931–2005)|FMH=Female Halberstam}}\nGrand RabbiShlomo Halberstam(1847–1905)author of Ateres&nbsp;Shlomoeldest grandson of the Divrei Chaim|BH1= Grand RabbiBen Zion Halberstam(1874–1941)author of Kedushas&nbsp;Tzion|BH2= Grand RabbiBen Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam(b. 1955)|MDU= Grand RabbiRabbi Mordechai Dovid Unger Shlita(b. 1954)|RSU=Rabbi Yosef UngerRuv of Beth Midrash Apirion Shel Shlome and R\"Y of Yeshiva Ketane of Bobov 45 |RYU=Rabbi Shulim Unger bobov-45 ruv london}}\nRabbi Yehoshua Rubin (born 1952)Bobov-45 Ruv |ZHR=Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Rabinovichpresent Ruv of Bobov-45 in Monsey}}\nHistory\nFirst Rebbe of Bobov, Shlomo Halberstam (1847 – 1905)\n, the first Bobover Rebbe]]\nBobov originated with Shlomo Halberstam, who was the grandson of Grand Rabbi Chaim Halberstam of Sanz, in the Galician village of Bobowa.\nWhile most of the early yeshivos (Talmudical academies) originated in Lithuania, the 19th century saw the opening of similar institutions in Poland. The first yeshiva in Poland was established by the first Bobover Rebbe in 1881 in Vishnitsa, where he was rabbi then; and it later moved with him to Bobov.\nSecond Bobover Rebbe, Benzion Halberstam (1874 – 1941)\nHis work was continued by his son, Grand Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam, author of Kedushas Tzion. The Bobov Yeshiva was originally situated only in the town of Bobov itself. However, under his guidance, the court grew in numbers, with Hasidic youth flocking to Bobov. Subsequently, as many as sixty branches of the yeshiva under the name Etz Chaim were established throughout Galicia.\nDuring World War II, the Bobov Hasidic movement was destroyed. The second Rebbe himself was murdered in the Holocaust, together with family members and thousands of his followers.\nThird Bobover Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam (1908 – 2000)\nBarely 300 Hasidim survived, and the Rebbe's son, Shlomo Halberstam, took it upon himself to rebuild Bobov. He first settled in the West Side of Manhattan, later moving to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. The yeshiva, which was originally located at 184 Brooklyn Avenue, later moved to the nearby Borough Park neighborhood. Shlomo Halberstam was known for his wisdom, his caring for others, and his steadfastness in not taking sides in disputes.\nOver the more than fifty years that Shlomo Halberstam was Rebbe of Bobov, he founded and built a worldwide network of synagogues, Hasidic schools for boys and girls, mesivtas (high schools), and post-high school houses of learning. Besides schools, a summer camp for boys was founded in 1957 in Ferndale, New York, and a girls camp, Camp Gila, was founded a few years later. At the time of his death in August 2000, he was mourned by more followers than his father had in pre-war Poland. At his funeral it was publicly announced that his oldest son Naftali would succeed him as Rebbe, and his younger brother  Ben Zion would serve as Rav Hatzair (assistant rabbi).\nFourth Bobover Rebbe, Naftali Halberstam (1931 – 2005)\nWith Shlomo Halberstam's death, his older son, Naftali Zvi Halberstam, succeeded him. Naftali Zvi died on March 23, 2005 (12th of Adar II, 5765), at age 74, leaving a wife, two daughters, and two sons-in-law:  Yehoshua Rubin, Rav of Bobov-45; and Mordechai Dovid Unger, Rebbe of Bobov-45.\nFifth and current Rebbe of Bobov, Ben Zion Halberstam (1955 –)\nAfter Naftali Tzvi Halberstam died in 2005, a dispute arose among Bobover Hasidim as to who should attain the dynasty leadership. Some began to follow Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, the younger half brother of the late Rebbe, while others followed his son-in-law Unger, who was older by one year. Unger had already ensconced himself firmly within the community by then, and could not challenge his own father's leadership of Dombrov, which anyway was not as substantial a dynasty. The matter of succession was brought before a beth din (religious court) in 2007, which ruled that Halberstam would be declared the fifth Rebbe of Bobov () with its headquarters on 48th Street in Borough Park, while Unger would be Rebbe of Bobov-45 (), located on 45th Street. While the former community retained the rights to the name \"Bobov\", Unger's faction was permitted to use the name, provided that the qualifier be added to it.\nBobov-45\nAn offshoot of the Bobov dynasty, Bobov-45 is headquartered in Borough Park. It has branches in Williamsburg and Monsey, New York; Lakewood, New Jersey; Los Angeles; Montreal; London; Manchester; Antwerp; and an enclave \"Yishuv of Chasidei Bobov-45\" in Union, New Jersey. In Israel, Bobov-45 has branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Beit Shemesh, Ashdod, Elad, and Beitar Illit.\nHistory of Bobov-45\nThe third Bobover Rebbe, Shlomo Halberstam, rebuilt the Bobov Hasidic dynasty in the United States after losing his wife and most of his children in the Holocaust. His son Naftali, who survived, became the fourth Rebbe upon his father's death. He had no sons but left two daughters, one of whom married Yehoshua Rubin, and the other Mordechai Dovid Unger. In 2005, after Naftali's death, a group of Bobover Hasidim loyal to his son-in-law, Mordechai Dovid Unger, preferred him to take over the position of Rebbe of Bobov.\nThe dispute was taken to a beth din (arbitration panel), which ruled that Halberstam held the rights to the name \"Bobov\", and to all Bobov institutions.\nUnger was allowed to use the name Bobov, provided that a qualifier be added to it. The suffix \"-45\" was henceforth adopted in tribute to the street on which the community center of the sect was located at the time. In addition, the beth din ordered Bobov to pay $6,200,000 to Bobov-45's Rebbe and dayan in twenty-five quarterly installments, as an allotment of their faction's share of the inheritance of the Bobov enterprise's assets, it is unknown what the value of the assets were at the time.\nFirst and current Grand rabbi of Bobov-45 Mordechai Dovid Unger (1954 –)\nUnger, the first Grand Rabbi of Bobov-45, is the younger son-in-law of the fourth Bobover Rebbe, Naftali Halberstam. Unger has been active in the wider Jewish community. Yehoshua Rubin, the older son-in-law of Halberstam, is the current dayan and rabbinical leader of the sect.\nInstitutions\nCommunity institutions, such as a synagogue, have been built within Bobov-45.\nOther Bobov infrastructure includes\na Yeshiva,\nbeth midrash (study hall),\ncheder (elementary school),\nyeshiva ketana (secondary school),\nmesivta,\ngirls school,\nday camp,\nand wedding halls.\nNotable people\n* Shlomo Halberstam (first Bobover Rebbe)\n* Ben Zion Halberstam\n* Shlomo Halberstam (third Bobover rebbe)\n* Naftali Halberstam\n* Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam\n* Mordechai Dovid Unger\n* Simcha Eichenstein\n* Benzion Miller\nSee also\n* Hasidic Judaism in Poland\nReferences\nSources\n* |url-access=subscription }}"
