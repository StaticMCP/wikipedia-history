It is a tributary of the Warner River, part of the Contoocook River (and ultimately Merrimack River) watershed.\nThe West Branch rises in the southwest corner of Newbury, New Hampshire, on the eastern slopes of Mount Sunapee. Flowing east, it quickly enters the town of Bradford, reaching the Warner River at the town center.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of New Hampshire\nReferences"
