Its role is to foster science leadership, to coordinate among scientific organizations, and to influence science policy, education, and communication at national and international levels.\nHistory\nCSSP was founded in 1973..\nOver its history it has evolved from a relatively quiet forum into a more active voice in science policy and leadership development.\nOne of its long-serving leaders is Martin A. Apple, who served as President & CEO (a part-time role) from about 1993 until 2012.\nIn 2015, Madeleine Jacobs, formerly CEO of the American Chemical Society (ACS), was named President & CEO of CSSP, following her retirement from ACS.\nMembership\nThe membership comprises presidents, past presidents, and presidents-elect of approximately 60 scientific societies and federations.\nAt peak membership, these societies together represented over 1.4 million scientists and science educators.\nMission, Goals, and Activities\nCSSP carries out a number of functions:\nLeadership Development: Helping society heads strengthen their skills, share experiences, and lead their societies effectively.\nPolicy and Advocacy: Deliberating and adopting public-policy positions on issues such as science education, research funding, communication, ethics, and emerging scientific challenges.\nPublic Understanding of Science: Promoting better communication between scientists and the public, raising awareness of scientific issues and the importance of science in society.\nNetworking & Coordination: Serving as a forum for scientific societies’ leadership to share best practices, collaborate, and coordinate responses to national/international scientific issues\nAccording to one past member \"The meetings are jam-packed — a Saturday of leadership training, followed by a couple of days of rapid-fire, top-level briefings on national and world affairs in science, a penultimate lesson on how to lobby and an ultimate congressional breakfast (in situ), with lobbying then and afterward. Evenings and coffee breaks are filled by sessions of networking with the movers and shakers in Washington science policy, and with the movers and shakers who are presidents of other scientific societies.\"\nLeadership\nMartin A. Apple was CSSP President & CEO from 1993 to 2012 and then President Emeritus and Research and Development Director until 2024.\nMadeleine Jacobs took over as President & CEO in 2015, succeeding interim president Gordon L. Nelson.\nMembership Societies & Federations\nCSSP’s membership includes presidents of ~60 societies and federations across scientific disciplines (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, engineering). These are U.S. (and sometimes international) scientific societies whose presidents or leadership are engaged in science education, research, policy, etc. Some members have included such societies as the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, American institute of Biological Sciences, American Institute of Physics, American Mathematical Society, American Society for lnformation Science and Technology, American Chemical Society, Association for Computing Machinery, Association for Women in Science, Computing Research Association, Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography SPIE, International Society for Optical Engineering, Society for lndustrial and Applied Mathematics, Linguistic Society of America, Institute of Food Technologists, Soil Science Society of America, Crop Science Society of America, Sigma Xi, Association for the Education of Teachers in Science and Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences., among many others.\nNotable Events & Programs\nCSSP provides awards/honors; for example, the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science is associated with CSSP.\nIt often serves as a coordinating body when scientific societies need to respond jointly to policy proposals or funding changes. (E.g., communicating to Congress, engaging with federal agencies.)\nSignificance\nCSSP plays a unique role:\nBy focusing on the society presidents and leadership, it helps align priorities across many fields of science.\nIt can speak with clout, because the member societies represent very large numbers of individual scientists and educators.\nIt acts as a bridge between scientific societies (which often focus on discipline‐specific issues) and broader science policy, education, and public engagement issues.\nReferences"
