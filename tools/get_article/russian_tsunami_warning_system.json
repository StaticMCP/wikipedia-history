It is subordinated to the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring. The Russian tsunami warning system is known under the Russian acronym FP RSCHS-Tsunami ().\nHistory\nThe Russian tsunami warning system development began in 1956 to 1959.  This followed the tsunami and damage which occurred during the 1952 Severo-Kurilsk earthquake. After this, a government decree was issued for the organization of a tsunami warning service. Since 1956, the seismic part of the work was carried out by the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk seismic station.\nIn 2003, following the creation of the Unified State System for the Prevention and Elimination of Emergency Situations (RSChS; (), the tsunami warning service received the status of a functional subsystem of the unified system with the acronym FP RSChS-Tsunami ().\nIn the second half of 2000, the system began a modernization process which included the deployment of new buoys.\nOperations\nThe Russian tsunami warning system includes a network of seismological stations, a hydrophysical (level) network, tsunami warning centers, and a communication system for tsunami warnings. System components are located in Sovetskaya Gavan, Nevelsk, Rudnaya Pristan, Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Preobrazhenye, Uglegorsk, Poronaysk, Starodubskoye, Kholmsk, Korsakov, Cape Crillon, Yuzhno Kurilsk and Vodopadnaya.\nSee also\n* Search and rescue in Russia\n* Civil defense in Russia\n* Russian System of Disaster Management\nReferences\nExternal links\n- Russian tsunami warning system"
