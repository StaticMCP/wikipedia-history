The statue was unveiled on October 1, 1914, by Edward's brother, Governor General Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, with a huge crowd in attendance. Edward had visited Montreal in 1860, when he was the Prince of Wales, to open the Victoria Bridge.\nFour allegorical figures sit at the base of the monument: Peace is the woman at front, holding an olive branch but keeping a sword hidden in the folds of her skirt. The western group is Four Nations, representing Montreal’s four founding nationalities—French, Scots, Irish, and English—living together in harmony. At the back of the monument, Winged Genius represents liberty; the angel has broken the shackles of religious prejudice and persecution and is intended as a reminder of the King's extended respect and dignity to all his subjects, regardless of race, colour, or creed. Abundance is on the eastern face, representing Canada's material prosperity.\nGallery\nImage:Monument au roi Edouard Square Phillips 1914.jpg|1914\nImage:Square Phillip Montreal.jpg|1922\nImage:Phillips Square Montreal Conrad Poirier.JPG|1937\nImage:Phillips Square, Montreal, Sep 06 2022.jpg|2022\nFile:Peace, Edward VII Monument, Montreal, Sep 17 2022.jpg|Peace\nFile:Four Nations, Edward VII Monument, Montreal, Sep 17 2022 (cropped).jpg|Four Nations\nFile:Winged Genius, Edward VII Monument, Montreal, Sep 17 2022.jpg|Winged Genius\nFile:Abundance, Edward VII Monument, Montreal, Sep 17 2022 (cropped).jpg|Abundance\nSee also\n* Royal monuments in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [http://www.toutmontreal.com/guide/php/fiche.php?e=34&s=Edifices&m=categories&l=F Fiche sur le Square Phillips]\n* [http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=678,1154690&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&id=130 Monument Edouard VII]"
