This is a compilation of some of the most important leaders among the many participants in the war, including Native Americans. The British counted on the colonists Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution to aid the king's cause, but the numbers were below what they had expected.\nIn order to be listed here an individual must satisfy one of the following criteria:\n* Was a nation's top civilian responsible for directing military affairs\n* Held a commission of at least brigadier general or rear admiral in an organized military during the conflict\n* Was the highest-ranking member of a given nation's force that participated in the conflict (if that rank was not at least major general)\n* Was the highest-ranking member of a given state/colonial militia\n* Was a provincial or territorial governor who is documented to have directed a military action\n* Was a Native American tribal leader who had a documented leadership position in military action\nSome individuals held concurrent positions in more than one organization, and a number of Continental Army generals also held high-ranking positions in their state militia organizations. Many U.S. combatants were militiamen, not regular troops. Militia are defined as being a part of the organized armed forces of a country liable to call only in emergency or a body of citizens organized for military service.\nUnited States\nappoints George Washington commander-in-chief of the newly established Continental Army]]\n, the administrative entity appointed by the Continental Congress to oversee the Continental Army]]\nWhen armed hostilities began between colonial insurgents and the British Army began outside of Boston, Massachusetts in April 1775, there was no unified colonial army, but rather local militias in each colony. The Second Continental Congress, the elective body from each of the Thirteen Colonies, established the Continental Army in June 1775. It appointed Virginian George Washington as commander-in-chief. The Continental Congress established a standing committee, the Board of War and Ordnance, to function like the British Ministry of War. The board's official seal has military symbolism but also the Phrygian cap of freedom.  The Continental Army was established as a regular standing army, with regiments recruited from each state (former colonies), with artillery and cavalry regiments with men from different states.\nGeneral and Commander-in-chief\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" width=\"100\" |\n! align=\"left\" width=\"100\" |Name\n! align=\"left\" width=\"300\" |Period of service in the rank, promotions and previous military experience.
