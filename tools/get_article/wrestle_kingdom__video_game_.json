      "text": "# Wrestle Kingdom (video game)\n\nPlayStation 2\n| genre = Fighting\n| modes = Single-player, multiplayer\n}}\nis a licensed professional wrestling video game by Yuke's, released in Japan for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2. The game combines the top stars of New Japan Pro-Wrestling, All Japan Pro Wrestling, Pro Wrestling Noah, and freelancers.\nThe Xbox 360 version of the game was temporarily recalled in Japan due to it not saving properly to the system's hard drive. A release event planned for the following two days after its release was cancelled.\nA sequel, Wrestle Kingdom 2, was released in May 2007.\nGameplay\nWrestle Kingdom uses a modified engine seen in previous Yuke's games, the WWE Day of Reckoning series. While not as simulation-based as its Japanese contemporaries, it is also not as frantic and arcade-like as its American counterparts.\nWrestle Kingdom has the basic wrestling video game matches, including singles, tag teams, triple threats, fatal four ways, and battle royals. No specialty matches are featured.\nThe defining mode in Wrestle Kingdom is the Drama mode. In this mode, players must create a wrestler and train under one of the top stars from each promotion. As they go, they must train to improve their stats. This is the only way to unlock more moves.\nTowards the end, the player will pick from a list of promotional titles or tournaments, such as the G1 Climax. Depending on which the player selects, they can unlock certain wrestlers and unlock their trainer's move set.\nRoster\nThe game's roster features wrestlers from the top three Japanese promotions - New Japan Pro-Wrestling, All Japan Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Noah - as well as freelancers and legends. Brock Lesnar and Giant Bernard are exclusive to the PlayStation 2 version of the game. Conversely, Kazuyuki Fujita is an exclusive to the Xbox 360 version.\nReception\nWrestle Kingdom received generally positive reviews. Alfred Alfonso, writing for American website IGN, enjoyed the PS2 version of the game, praising the Drama mode and graphics, but criticized the length of the loading times.\nSee also\n* Wrestle Kingdom 2\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090702234644/http://www.yukes.co.jp/r_kingdom/ Official Xbox 360 website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090806073221/http://www.yukes.co.jp/r_kingdom_ps2/ Official PlayStation 2 website]"
