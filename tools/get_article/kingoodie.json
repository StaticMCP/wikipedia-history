The shore is easily accessible and close to the Firth of Tay.\nQuarries close to Kingoodie supplied the town with building stone for a number of centuries. This stone was important for the building of sea walls to protect the town from the tide and the harbour works. Stone for the tennis court at Falkland Palace was quarried near Kingoodie in 1540 and shipped to Lindores, north of the palace on the River Tay.\nThere is a headland jutting out to sea in front of the village. This is mentioned in Groome's Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland (1882–4) in the Drimmie entry.\nReferences"
