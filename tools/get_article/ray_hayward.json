He is currently the pitching coach for the collegiate Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball team.\nCareer\nCollege career\nPrior to playing professional baseball, Hayward attended the University of Oklahoma. In 1980, he went 9–2 with a 3.19 ERA and 78 strikeouts in 93 innings of work. The following year, he went 9–2 with a 1.70 ERA, striking out 75 batters in 69 innings. He appeared in only three games in 1982, going 1–1 with a 2.40 ERA. In his final college season – 1983 – he went 7–6 with a 3.40 ERA and 125 strikeouts in 98 innings of work.\nMLB draft\nOriginally, he was drafted in the 12th round of the 1982 amateur draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Choosing not to sign that time, he was drafted 10th overall in the 1983 amateur draft by the Padres, at which time he did choose to sign.\nProfessional baseball\n1983\nHayward began his professional career with the Beaumont Golden Gators, going 5–1 with a 1.76 ERA and 71 strikeouts in 66 innings of work. He completed five and shutout two of the 10 games he started.\n1984\nIn 1984, Hayward pitched for the Las Vegas Stars, going 9–6 with a 4.87 ERA. In 26 games (24 starts), he had one complete game and one shutout.

He earned a late September call up, and on September 20 he made his big league debut. Making the start against Houston Astros ace Mike Scott, Hayward lasted only 1 innings, allowing seven hits and six earned runs. He'd start in two more games that year, going 0–2 with a 9.00 ERA overall.\n1987\n1987 was Hayward's best minor league season since his professional rookie year. In 23 games (22 starts), he went 8–5 with a 3.10 ERA. In 142 innings, he struck out 115 batters. So impressive it was in fact that the Padres recalled him, and on June 10 he made his first big league appearance of the 1987 season. Over the span of a couple of weeks, he'd make four relief appearances, going 0–0 with a 16.50 ERA. In his first game back, he allowed six runs in an inning of work.\n1988\nHayward was traded along with Goose Gossage from the Padres to the Chicago Cubs for Keith Moreland and Mike Brumley on February 12, 1988.

Hayward pitched in his final big league game on July 5, 1988.\n1989\nAlthough he would not play in the majors after 1988, he did continue to pitch in the minor leagues. Hayward did not play in 1989, however.\n1990\nHe pitched for the 89ers in 1990, Hayward went 5–9 with a 5.16 ERA in 89 innings.\n1991\n1991 was Hayward's final professional season.

In 78 innings of work, he allowed 10 home runs and 42 walks, and he struck out 45 batters.\nNon-playing career\nFollowing the conclusion of his playing career, Hayward would serve as an area scout for the Detroit Tigers from 1994 to 1999. In 2000, Hayward received his first coaching job with his alma mater, the Oklahoma Sooners. Hayward held the pitching coach and recruiting coordinator positions at OU until 2004, when he accepted the position as the Midwest scouting supervisor for the Miami Marlins.\nHayward would serve as the scouting supervisor for the Marlins from 2005 to 2012 before accepting the pitching coach position at Texas Tech under coach Tim Tadlock. In his second season in 2013–14, Hayward helped guide the Red Raiders to their first NCAA Division I Baseball Championship appearance since 2004 as well as the program's first super regional victory and College World Series appearance. Texas Tech's pitchers would accumulate a season long Earned run average of 3.17 which was the lowest for the team since 1971.
