It stars Edna Murphy, Rex the wonder horse, and Charley Chase. It was written and produced by Hal Roach and released through Pathé Exchange.\nPlot\nAs described in a film magazine review, the Black, by right of might, is undisputed leader of a band of wild horses. By his intelligence and agility, he protects the herd and eludes various pursuers. The Fielding ranch is under the charge of Wade Galvin, a villainous foreman, who has involved Fielding's weakling son in a cattle stealing escapade. Billy Blair, a cowpuncher, has two consuming passions. One is his love for Mary Fielding and the other is his desire to capture The Black. His perseverance is rewarded, for he wins both the young woman and horse. All three cooperate in frustrating further villainy on the part of Galvin, the foreman, and in bringing him to justice.\nCast\nPreservation\nA copy of The King of Wild Horses is preserved in the Library of Congress film collection and the George Eastman Museum Motion Picture Collection.
