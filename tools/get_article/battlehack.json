Competitors were required to solve a local problem by coding. Winners of the first prize of each contest got an axe as the trophy, and admission to the world finals where competitors competed for the $100,000 grand prize. Competitors retain the ownership of their applications made in the contests.\nIn 2016 PayPal/Braintree shut down the developer relations program along with all related programs such as BattleHack.\nIt was announced that BattleHack would be returning  however as of Jan 16, 2018 the domain name lapsed and has since moved into new ownership.\nSee also\n* Hackathon\nReferences\nExternal links gsh\n*"
