Its women's team won the 2000 National Women's Cup then played in the Hoofdklasse. Its men's team won the National Amateur Championship in 1971, then played in the Hoofdklasse.\nHistory\nInitial years (1928-1939)\nZwart-Wit was established on 1 May 1928. The men's first squad played in the 1920s and 1930 in the second division of the CNVB Rotterdam.\nRise and National Amateur Championship (1940–1999)\nIn 1942 the club promoted to the first division of the CNVB Rotterdam and in 1946 to the Vierde Klasse of the KNVB. In 1956 Zwart-Wit ascended to the Derde Klasse and 1958 to the Tweede Klasse.\nIn 1971 the men promoted to Eerste Klasse where they played until 1996, except for three seasons back in the Tweede Klasse. In 1971 Zwart-Wit also won the National Amateur Championship, beating Huizen, the Sunday Champion, 2–1. It has previously secured the National Saturday Football Championship of the Netherlands. Zwart-Wit repeated the National Saturday Championship in 1972.\nThe women's section was started in 1971.\nIn 1996 the Zwart-Wit '28 male squad became a Hoofdklasse team.\nNational Women's Cup and collapse (2000–2004)\nIn 2000 the women's first squad won the national KNVB Women's Cup, beating Saestum in the national finals, 4–2. For Zwart Wit scored Sandra Roos (3) and Sandra Muller (1).\nIn 2001 the men won the District Cup West IV. In 2002 they lost against HFC Haarlem in the KNVB Cup, 5–2.\nZwart-Wit 28 went bankrupt on 24 February 2004 due to high (amateur) player salaries, dwindling interest in games, and mismanagement. While rumors on a possible merger still circulated in its final year, the situation deteriorated such that it had to pull its teams from their divisions. Next the club house burned down and nothing was left but to declare bankruptcy. The rise and downfall of the once successful club, dubbed \"Feyenoord of Saturday soccer\", continued to draw media attention for many years after.\nPlayers\nMen first squad\nThe footballers that played most games in the first squad were:\n# Cees Wander\n# Ed Molsbergen\n# Adrie Wander\n# Cees Boon\n# Jan Nieuwstraten – played most (30) international games, then coached\nWomen first squad\n* Sandra Muller – scored most (9) international goals\n* Sandra Roos – scored three goals in the national cup victory\n* Shirley Smith – runner up international games (60) and goals (5)\n* Sandra van Tol – played most (82) international games\nOther players of note include:\n* Jack van den Berg (#17 in play frequency) – in 2018 a Tweede Divisie coach\n* Leo Beenhakker (#228) – later national coach of the Netherlands, Poland, Saudi&nbsp;Arabia and Trinidad and coach of Ajax, Feyenoord and Real Madrid\n*Dwight Eli (#242) – youth and 1st squad player, briefly professional at Sparta\n* John de Wolf (#331) – ex-professional, briefly coach–player in 2000\n*Dennis van der Ree – youth player at Zwart-Wit '28, later turned professional\n* Erik Tammer\nStaff\nHead Coach\nCoached three years and more:\n* Chris Bernaards (1948–1951)\n* Loë van der Hoeven (1954–1964)\n* Piet Boekee (1964–1968)\n* Wim van der Gijp (1969–1973)\n* Jan Nieuwstraten (1974–1977)\n* Coen Nieuwstraten (1979–1983)\n* Jan van Baaren (1983–1986)\n* Wim van der Gijp (1987–1988)\n* Frank Franken (1989–1993)\n* Berry Janse (1993–1996)\n* Jack van den Berg (1996–2000)\nLast coaches were:\n* Hans Helleman and John de Wolf (2000)\n* Philip den Haan (2000–2002)\n* Louis Olofsen (2002)\n* Gijs Zwaan (2002)\n* Jan Everse (2002–2003)\n* Wim Schouten (2003–2004)\nChairperson\nChaired three years and more:\n* Izak Groenewegen (1928–1934)\n* Wim van den Heuvel (1934–1935; 1937–1946)\n* Wim Kool (1950–1958)\n* Koen Zonnevylle (1958–1962)\n* Cor Vaandrager (1962–1972)\n* Dick Marseille (1972–1976)\n* Henny Troost (1976–1980)\n* Henk van den Berg (1980–1985)\n* Joop Dekkers (1988–1992)\n* Wim Nuis (1994–1998)\n* Rick Bergen (1999–2003)\nLast chairman was:\n* Jan Oorebeek (2003–2004)\nHonorary Chairperson\n* Izak Groenewegen (1937)\n* Wim van den Heuvel (1953)\n* Henny Troost (1980)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.zwartwit28.nl/rdam/ Archive Zwart-Wit '28]"
