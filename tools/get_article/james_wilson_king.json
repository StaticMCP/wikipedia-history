He served as Chief Engineer of the United States Navy. During his career, he held every position in the Navy to which an engineering officer could be called. Today, he is best known for his 1880 book, The Warships and Navies of the World, which has been called \"an important book to establish reliable contemporary information.\" It was republished by the U.S. Naval Institute in 1982.\nEarly life and education\nKing was born in Baltimore and raised on his grandfather's farm in Maryland. He studied at St. James's Academy and, having become fascinated by steam engines at the age of sixteen, learned mechanical engineering while working at a machine shop in Baltimore.\nCareer\nKing was appointed to the Navy from Maryland as a Third Assistant Engineer on September&nbsp;2, 1844. During the Mexican–American War, he was attached to the paddle-frigate  and participated in the capture of all but one of the towns on the Mexican coast taken by the Navy. On July&nbsp;10, 1847, he was promoted to Second Assistant Engineer. King served on all the first steamers that belonged to the U.S. Navy, except the first Fulton.\nKing was promoted to First Assistant Engineer on September&nbsp;13, 1849 and to Chief Engineer on November&nbsp;12, 1852. He was appointed Government Inspector of Ocean Mail Steamers at New York in 1853. In 1858, he was appointed Chief Engineer at the New York Navy Yard.\nKing was Chief Engineer of the North Atlantic Fleet in the early part of the American Civil War. \"Subsequently he was the superintendent of the construction of all the armour-clads built west of the Alleghenies, involving an expenditure in the aggregate of seven millions of dollars\".\nKing was promoted to Engineer in Chief on March&nbsp;15, 1869. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering. In this post, King introduced double-expansion engines into the U.S. Navy. He held this post until March&nbsp;20, 1873.\nDuring the mid-1870s, King—as chief engineer of the Navy—made many visits, official and private, to Europe, to collect information relating to shipbuilding, machinery, and other aspects of naval warfare. In 1877, he produced a report to Congress entitled, European Ships of War and Their Armament, Naval Administration and Economy, Marine Constructions and Appliances, Dockyards, etc., etc. King's critical evaluations of naval architecture assumed that Congress might soon fund new designs for a re-equipped American Navy. A second edition was published in 1878. King then produced an expanded version of these reports in his 1880 book, The Warships and Navies of the World.\nRetirement and death\nKing was placed on the retired list on August&nbsp;26, 1881, having reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty-two. He died at his home at 3221 Powelton Avenue, Philadelphia, on June 6, 1905.\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links"
