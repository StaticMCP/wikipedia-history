Manuel also prepared ships to help evacuate Süleyman's army in case of a defeat, but Musa managed to set them on fire before the battle began.\nThe battle was a victory for Süleyman Çelebi, chiefly due to the defection of many of Musa's vassals, who had previously served Süleyman. Among the defectors was Vuk Lazarević, the brothers' half-uncle. Laonikos Chalkokondyles claims that Vuk's brother Stefan also defected due to the pressure of Süleyman's ally, the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, but the chronicler Constantine of Kostenets reports that he fought alongside Musa in the battle, only to seek refuge with Palaiologos after the battle was lost. The battle initially went well for Musa, with Süleyman's army suffering heavy losses, until Süleyman with a few hundred men attacked Musa's camp. Both sides suffered heavy losses in the fighting.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Musa retreated to the area around Yambol and Chernomen in Bulgaria, while Süleyman recaptured the Ottoman capital of Edirne. One of his lieutenants, Aliaz, was able to capture Vuk Lazarević at Plovdiv. Musa had Vuk executed for his betrayal.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
