Ottoman Turks headed to the city of Samokov after the conquest of Ihtiman.\nThey encountered the armies of the Serbian and Bulgarian kings. Although the Serbian and Bulgarian armies were far superior to him in numbers, Lala Şahin Pasha did not hesitate to fight and achieved victory with a strong attack. The victory was so complete that the soldiers of the Serbian and Bulgarian armies fled without taking any of their provisions, leaving everything behind.\nReferences"
