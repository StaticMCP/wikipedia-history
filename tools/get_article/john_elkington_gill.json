      "text": "# John Elkington Gill\n\nJohn Elkington Gill (1821–1874) was a 19th-century architect in Bath, Somerset, England.\nLife\nin Bath is credited to Gill and Manners.]]\nGill was born in 1821. He was partnered in the firm Manners and Gill with the more famous George Phillips Manners. Gill continued the latter's practice upon Manners' retirement in 1862. On Manners' death in 1866, he changed the name of the practice to his name alone. He set up the practice of Gill & Browne in 1874 before he died, but he was then mostly retired and the work of Gill & Brown is almost entirely the work of Thomas Browne alone.\nGill lived at 7, Mount Beacon, Bath, from the 1860s.\nJohn Elkington Gill's son was Wallace Gill, who in 1879 had his name added to the practice and in 1899 renamed the practice Gill & Morris. Wallace Gill went by his own name from 1903 and retired in 1909, transferring the practice to Mowbray A. Green.\nArchitectural practice\nThe architectural practice of George Phillips Manners from the early 19th century into the mid 20th century (compiled by Michael Forsyth):\n*George Phillips Manners: 1820–1845\n*Manners & Gill: 1845–1866\n*John Elkington Gill: 1866–1874\n*Gill & Browne 1874–1879\n*Browne & Gill: 1879–1899\n*Gill & Morris: 1899–1903\n*Wallace Gill: 1903–1909\n*Mowbray A.
