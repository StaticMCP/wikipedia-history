This territory, comprising parts of modern-day Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, had previously been under Hellenistic influence after Alexander the Great’s conquests and later the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Kanishka’s campaigns helped consolidate Kushan control over key trade routes, enhancing their influence in the Silk Road network and spreading Buddhist culture across Central Asia.\nAftermath\nFollowing Kanishka’s conquest, the region was integrated into the Kushan Empire, strengthening the empire’s control over vital trade routes, including the Silk Road. The Kushan influence in Bactria also helped bridge Greco-Roman, Persian, and Indian cultural elements, fostering a rich fusion of art, architecture, and religious traditions.\nReferences"
