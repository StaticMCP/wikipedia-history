Each is listed below. Where two dates are shown, the first indicates the date of receiving the award or title and the second indicates the date of its loss, renunciation or when its use was discontinued.\nRoyal titles and styles\nBorn as Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, she was the eldest daughter of King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederica, and a member of both the Greek and Danish royal families by descent. Her marriage to then-Prince Juan Carlos of Spain in 1962 marked her entry into the Spanish royal family. As the wife of the heir-designate to General Franco's regime, she assumed the title Princess of Spain—a title created specifically for her husband as designated successor to Franco. When Juan Carlos became King of Spain in 1975, following Franco's death, Sophia became queen consort of Spain.\nFollowing her husband's abdication in 2014, she retained the style Her Majesty and continues to be known as Queen Sofía in honorific and official contexts.\n* 2 November 1938 – 14 May 1962: Her Royal Highness Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark\n* 14 May 1962 - 21 July 1969: Her
