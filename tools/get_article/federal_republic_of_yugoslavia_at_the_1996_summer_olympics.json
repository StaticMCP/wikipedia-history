The nation was not allowed to participate at the 1992 Summer Olympics because of international sanctions.  Several Yugoslav athletes competed as Independent Olympic Participants at those Games.

wrestling.\nMedalists\nGold\n* Aleksandra Ivošev – Shooting — Women's 50 metre rifle three positions\nSilver\n*Dejan Tomašević, Miroslav Berić, Dejan Bodiroga, Željko Rebrača, Predrag Danilović, Vlade
