When they were introduced in 1867 there were 74 of these administrative counties; in 1900 there were 78 counties. The administrative counties were responsible for storing vital records. These counties were introduced following the 1867 December Constitution.\nPrior to 1867, while a crown land of the Austrian Empire and before that as part of the Habsburg monarchy, the kingdom had instead been divided into  since the late 18th century, which from 1854 were subdivided into  (referred to as }} ('office districts'), to distinguish them from other types of ).\nThe Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria was the largest and most populous crown land of Cisleithania (i.e. the non-Hungarian parts of the Habsburg realms) between 1772 and 1918. More widely, the central European region of Galicia is today split between the modern states of Poland and Ukraine. Despite having passed through several intermediate states during the great wars of the 20th century, the regions have mainly preserved their territorial integrity and continue to demarcate the jurisdiction of local government authorities in their successor states.\n(until 1865)\nThe  (;  ; ,  ;  ,   ) of Galicia and Lodomeria go back in some form to the aftermath of the First Partition of Poland in 1772 which led to the Kingdom's creation, but did not take something resembling their final form until 1782. They were (generally) named after their capital/seat; usually this would take the form [genitival adjectival form of the name]&nbsp; (usually simply [Name]er  e.g.  from , the German name for Lviv), but &nbsp;[standard form of the name] (e.g. ) was also used, especially later, and the two forms were interchangeable.\nAt first, Galicia and Lodomeria was divided into 6 large , which were subdivided into 59  ('circle districts') in 1773. In 1775 the number of  was reduced to 19.\nIn 1782 the two-level system was abolished and Galicia and Lodomeria was divided into 18  of the type used in the other non-Hungarian Habsburg realms (what would later be called Cisleithania). Over the next decade these would mostly take the forms which would persist until the mid-19th century.\nAs the border of Galicia and Lodomeria itself, the Vistula formed the northern borders of the , ,  and (partially) .\nThe  (an exception where the name derives from the region, although it was also known as ) was added to Galicia and Lodomeria in 1786, having previously been a separate military district.\nBy the 1790s the  were:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\nIn 1791 the  had become the  when its capital moved there.\nThe lands gained by the Habsburgs in the 1795 Third Partition of Poland became West (or New) Galicia, a separate part of the kingdom. It too was divided into . The area around  on the right (southern) bank of the Vistula was transferred to the . West Galicia was incorporated into Galicia-proper in 1803 as a semi-autonomous region.\nWest Galicia was largely bounded by the Vistula, Bug and Pilica rivers.

It also ceded the  and most of the  to the Russian Empire, where they became the }}. Most of the rump of  was merged with a part of the  to become the  with the rest going to the  itself.\nThe  was returned to Austria in 1815 (Congress of Vienna); the former  became the . The area adjacent to  on the right bank of the Vistula, which had been part of the Duchy of Warsaw, went to the  and , re-establishing the Vistula as the border. (The other territories which had been ceded to the Duchy of Warsaw on the other hand went to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, other than the city of Kraków and its environs, which became the Free City of Cracow.)\nIn 1819 the  became the .\nThe Free City of Cracow was annexed by Austria in 1846, nominally becoming the Grand Duchy of Kraków but administratively added to Galicia as the . The extent of this , which matched that of the former free city, was similar but not identical to the earlier  of West Galicia.\nThe  was detached as the Duchy of Bukovina in 1849.\nIn 1850, following the Revolutions of 1848 the  were abolished and replaced with a system of political districts (see ) but these changes were reversed in Bach's reforms from 1853. The changes to Galicia and Lodomeria were specifically laid out in 1854: they divided the crown land into two  (administrative regions/territories) based in Lemberg (Lviv/Lwów) and Krakau (Krawów), which each oversaw some of the land's ; the two cities themselves were directly subordinate to the crown land. The  were also subdivided into  ('districts'; also referred to as }} ('office districts')).\nIn 1860  and Bukovina were dissolved and re-subordinated to ; the  was partitioned between the  and ; the  and  were merged into . Bukovina was detached again in the 1861 February Patent.\nBelow is a list of the divisions (,  and ) as of 1854, with changes after that noted.

The  were abolished and replaced with political districts (). While political districts where also introduced in many other crown lands, they generally either retained their  (often with a reduced number) or were not divided other than into political districts; the  were specific to Galicia and Lodomeria.

This therefore slightly expanded Neumarkt/Nowy Targ district.\nLater History\nInterwar period\nDuring the Interwar period what had been Galicia and Lodomeria became part of the Second Polish Republic. Its territory became the Kraków, Lwów, Tarnopol and Stanisławów Voivodeships. For the most part the former political districts were transitioned directly into Polish powiats (counties or districts). Kraków Voivodeship (specifically Nowy Targ powiat, which corresponds to the modern Nowy Targ and Tatra powiats) also contained a small amount of territory annexed from Hungary (Jabłonka and Nowa Biała), which would become a border conflict with Czechoslovakia.\nIn 1938 some additional territories along what was by this time the Polish-Czechoslovak border were ceded to Kraków Voivodeship: Javorina and Lesnica.\nWorld War II\nIn 1939 at the beginning of World War II Poland was jointly occupied and annexed by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Most of the western parts of the former Galicia and Lodomeria became part of the Nazi General Government, largely forming the Kraków District (), although some additional areas north of Kraków (most of which had incidentally been part of West Galicia) were also included; the northeastern border lay along the San, placing a small part of it in the Lublin District (). The parts furthest to the west became part of Germany-proper within the East Upper Silesia area of Upper Silesia Province. The border between the General Government and what was by this time the Slovak State was restored to that of the pre-1918 Galicia-Hungary border.\nThe Soviet-annexed formerly Galician territories became the Drohobych, Lviv, Stanislav (now Ivano-Frankivsk) and Tarnopil Oblasts of the Ukrainian SSR, which broadly correspond with the modern Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Ternopil Oblasts (see below).\nIn July 1941 as part of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union the rest of the former Galicia and Lodomeria was annexed by Germany. Some western parts of this territory became part of the Kraków District while the rest formed the District of Galicia (), which also gained a small amount of formerly Galician territory from the Lublin District which had been on the German-side of the 1939 border. The external borders of the District of Galicia (other than with the Kraków District) matched those of the former kingdom.\nModern divisions\nand Ukrainian Oblasts that include the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]\nAdministrative divisions in present-day Poland\nIn Poland today, there are parts of three voivodeships (provinces) that collectively formed the western part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.\nOnly Podkarpackie Voivodeship (\"Subcarpathia\") was entirely contained in the Kingdom. The majority of the territory of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship was contained in the Kingdom. From 1795 to 1815, three counties (powiats) that are situated north of the river Vistula were briefly part of the Kingdom: Olkusz County, Miechów County and Proszowice County. By the terms of the treaties of the Congress of Vienna they were annexed to Russian Poland (\"Congress Poland\") where they remained until the end of World War I. Additionally, the northernmost part of the land-county of Kraków around the villages of Sułoszowa, Skała and Słomniki were similarly allocated to Congress Russia; the remaining parts of the county were located in the Kingdom. The third voivodeship of Silesia contained only a small part of the Kingdom. The Silesian city-county of Jaworzno was originally part of the Kingdom's Chrzanowski county. The majority of the territory of the latter county is still an extant county in modern Poland – Chrzanów County – which is today located in the Lesser Poland voivodeship. The south-eastern Silesian land-counties of Żywiec County and Bielsko County along with the city-county of Bielsko-Biała formed the most westerly part of the Kingdom. The remaining 32 counties of Silesia were never part of the Kingdom.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:175px\" | Modern Provincial Entity\n! style=\"width:175px\" | Modern Counties of the Province\n! style=\"width:175px\" | Equivalent Countiesof Galicia\n|-\n|rowspan=\"20\" |Lesser Poland Voivodeship\n|-\n| Kraków (city-county)\n|Kraków\n|-\n|Tarnów (city-county)\n|Tarnów\n|-\n|Nowy Sącz (city-county)\n|Nowy Sącz\n|-\n|Kraków County\n|Partly in Kraków and partly in Wadowice\n|-\n|Nowy Sącz County\n|Partly in Nowy Sącz, Grybów and Muszyna\n|-\n|Tarnów County\n|Partly in Tarnów and Pilzno\n|-\n|Nowy Targ County\n|Nowy Targ (northern part)\n|-\n|Wadowice County\n|Wadowice\n|-\n|Oświęcim County\n|Partly in Biala and partly in Wadowice\n|-\n|Chrzanów County\n|Chrzanów\n|-\n|Limanowa County\n|Limanowa\n|-\n|Myślenice County\n|Myślenice eastern part)\n|-\n|Gorlice County\n|Gorlice\n|-\n|Wieliczka County\n|Wieliczka\n|-\n|Bochnia County\n|Bochnia\n|-\n|Brzesko County\n|Brzesko\n|-\n|Sucha County\n|Myślenice western part)\n|-\n|Tatra County\n|Nowy Targ (southern part)\n|-\n|Dąbrowa County\n|Dąbrowa\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\" |Silesian Voivodeship\n|-\n| Jaworzno (city-county)\n| Chrzanów (western part)\n|-\n| Bielsko-Biała (city-county)\n| Biala\n|-\n| Bielsko County\n| Biala\n|-\n| Żywiec County\n| Żywiec\n|-\n|rowspan=\"26\" |Subcarpathia voivodeship\n|-\n|Rzeszów city-county\n|Rzeszów (partly)\n|-\n|Przemyśl city-county\n|Przemyśl\n|-\n|Tarnobrzeg city-county\n|Tarnobrzeg (part of)\n|-\n|Krosno city-county\n|Krosno\n|-\n|Rzeszów County\n|Rzeszów (partly)\n|-\n|Mielec County\n|Mielec\n|-\n|Dębica County\n|Pilzo (partly)\n|-\n|Jarosław County\n|Jarosław (eastern part)\n|-\n|Jasło County\n|Jasło\n|-\n|Krosno County\n|Krosno\n|-\n|Lubaczów County\n|Lubaczów\n|-\n|Stalowa Wola County\n|Northern part in Tarnobrzegand southern part in Nisko\n|-\n|Sanok County\n|Sanok\n|-\n|Przeworsk County\n|Jarosław (western part)\n|-\n|Łańcut County\n|Łańcut (south of the river Wisłoka)\n|-\n|Ropczyce-Sędziszów County\n|Ropczyce\n|-\n|Przemyśl County\n|Przemyśl (To the north) andDobromil (To the south)\n|-\n|Leżajsk County\n|Łańcut (north of the river Wisłoka)\n|-\n|Nisko County\n|Nisko\n|-\n|Brzozów County\n|Brzozów\n|-\n|Strzyżów County\n|Strzyżów\n|-\n|Kolbuszowa County\n|Kolbuszowa\n|-\n|Tarnobrzeg County\n|Tarnobrzeg (western part)\n|-\n|Lesko County\n|Lesko (western part)\n|-\n|Bieszczady County\n|Lesko (eastern part)(Ceded by the USSR)\n|-\n|}\nAdministrative raions in present-day Ukraine\nIn Ukraine today, there are three provinces (oblasts) that formed the eastern part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Two of these – Lviv Oblast and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast – were entirely contained in the kingdom. The third – Ternopil Oblast – was mainly in the kingdom apart from four of its most northerly raions. These four raions – Kremenets Raion, Shumsk Raion, Lanivtsi and the northern half of Zbarazh Raion – were formerly part of the county of Krzemieniec in the Wolyn Voivodeship (province) of the Second Polish Republic during the interwar period. Prior to World War I, they were part of Congress Poland. They never formed part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.
