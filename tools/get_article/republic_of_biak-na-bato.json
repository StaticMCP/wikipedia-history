The current designation was adopted by historians to avoid confusion with the name of the current Philippine government, which also refers to itself as the Republic of the Philippines, and with other past Philippine governments using the same designation.\nThe Biak-na-Bato republic lasted just over a month. It was disestablished by a peace treaty signed by Aguinaldo and the Spanish Governor-General, Fernando Primo de Rivera, which included provisions for the exile of Aguinaldo and key associates to Hong Kong.\nBackground\nThe Republic of Biak-na-Bato was one of a number of Filipino revolutionary states that were formed to expel the Spanish colonial regime in the Philippines but were not able to receive international recognition. It was preceded and succeeded by two similarly unrecognized states: the Tejeros government and the Central Executive Committee.\nGovernment\nThe constitution of the Republic of Biak-na-Bato was written by Felix Ferrer and Isabelo Artacho, who copied the Cuban Constitution of Jimaguayú nearly word-for-word. It provided for the creation of a Supreme Council, which was created on November 1, 1897, with the following officers having been elected:\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Position !!

Aguinaldo slipped through the Spanish cordon and, with 500 picked men, proceeded to Biak-na-Bató (\"Cleft Rock\"; in modern ), a wilderness area at the town of San Miguel (now parts of San Miguel, San Ildefonso, and Doña Remedios Trinidad in Bulacan). When news of Aguinaldo's arrival there reached the towns of central Luzon, men from the Ilocos provinces, Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, Tarlac, and Zambales renewed their armed resistance against the Spanish.\nUnable to persuade the revolutionaries to give up their arms, Governor-General Primo de Rivera issued a decree on July 2, 1897, which prohibited inhabitants from leaving their villages and towns. Contrary to his expectations, they continued fighting. Within days, Aguinaldo and his men planned the establishment of a republic. Aguinaldo issued a proclamation from his hideout in Biak-na-Bato entitled \"To the Brave Sons of the Philippines\", in which he listed his revolutionary demands as:\n#the expulsion of the Friars and the return to the Filipinos of the lands which they had appropriated for themselves;\n#representation in the Spanish Cortes;\n#freedom of the press and tolerance of all religious sects;\n#equal treatment and pay for Peninsular and Insular civil servants;\n#abolition of the power of the government to banish civil citizens;\n#legal equality of all persons.\nOn November 1, 1897, the provisional constitution for the Biak-na-Bato Republic was signed. The preamble of the constitution included the statement that:\nBy the end of 1897, Governor-General Primo de Rivera had accepted the impossibility of quelling the revolution by force of arms. In a statement to the Cortes Generales, he said, \"I can take Biak-na-Bato, any military man can take it, but I can not answer that I could crush the rebellion.\" Desiring to make peace with Aguinaldo, he sent emissaries to Aguinaldo seeking a peaceful settlement. Nothing was accomplished until Pedro Paterno, a lawyer from Manila, volunteered to act as a negotiator.\nOn August 9, 1897, Paterno proposed a peace based on reforms and amnesty to Aguinaldo. In succeeding months, practicing shuttle diplomacy, Paterno traveled back and forth between Manila and Biak-na-Bato, carrying proposals and counterproposals. Paterno's efforts led to a peace agreement called the Pact of Biak-na-Bato. This consisted of three documents, the first two being signed on December 14, 1897, and the third being signed on December 15, effectively ending the Republic of Biak-na-Bato.\nIn 1899, Aguinaldo wrote in retrospect that the principal conditions of the pact were:\n}} today.}}\nshould be made in three installments, namely, $MXN400,000\nwhen all the arms in Biak-na-Bató were delivered to the Spanish authorities; $MXN200,000 when the arms surrendered amounted to eight hundred stand; the final payment to be made when one thousand stand of arms shall have been handed over to the authorities and the Te Deum sung in the Cathedral in Manila as thanksgiving for the restoration of peace. The latter part of February was fixed as the limit of time wherein the surrender of arms should be completed.\n(2) The whole of the money was to be paid to me personally, leaving the disposal of the money to my discretion and knowledge of the understanding with my associates and other insurgents.\n(3) Prior to evacuating Biak-na-Bató the remainder of the insurgent forces under Captain-General Primo de Rivera should send to Biak-na-Bató two General of the Spanish Army to be held as hostages by my associates who remained there until I and a few of my compatriots arrived in Hongkong and the first installment of the money payment (namely, four hundred thousand dollars) was paid to me.\n(4) It was also agreed that the religious corporations in the Philippines be expelled and an autonomous system of government, political and administrative, be established, though by special request of General Primo de Rivera these conditions were not insisted on in the drawing up of the Treaty, the General contending that such concessions would subject the Government to severe criticism and even ridicule.

Quezon in honor of the republic. In the 1970s, Ferdinand Marcos issued orders guiding mineral prospecting and exploitation on government reservations, impacting the park's boundaries. On April 11, 1989, Corazon Aquino issued Proclamation No. 401, which re-defined the boundaries of the Biak-na-Bato National Park. The proclamation set aside  as a mineral reservation,  as a watershed reservation, and  as a forest reserve.\nSee also\n*List of unofficial presidents of the Philippines\n*Political history of the Philippines\nNotes and references\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/8-philippineconstitutions.html A complete collection of Philippine Constitutions]\n* [https://thecorpusjuris.com/constitutions/1897-constitution.php Biak-na-Bato Constitution]\n* [http://www.philippinesinsider.com/luzon/natural-springs-and-caves-of-biak-na-bato/ Natural Springs and Caves of Biak Na Bato], philippinesinsider.com\n* [http://www.waypoints.ph/detail_gen.html?wpt=biakna Biak na Bato], waypoints.ph\n* [http://www.txtmania.com/articles/biaknabato.php Biak na Bato] , txtmania.com"
