Some other myths were added outside this initial timespan, such as the myths from the Ba Xian, or the Eight Immortals (most of them are said to be born in the Tang or Song dynasty).\nTimeline\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|width=\"60pt\" bgcolor=\"#99CC99\" | Date\n|width=\"100pt\" bgcolor=\"#99CC99\" | Ruler\n|width=\"240pt\" bgcolor=\"#99CC99\" | Events\n|width=\"240pt\" bgcolor=\"#99CC99\" | Other people/events\n|-\n|36,000 yrs before Creation of the Earth || P'an-Ku || rowspan=\"12\" | Chinese mythology ||\n|-\n|2852 BC || Fuxi ||\n|-\n|2737 BC || Yan Emperor ||\n|-\n|2698 BC ||rowspan=\"2\"| Yellow Emperor || The Battle of Banquan, the first battle in Chinese history and the Battle of Zhuolu, the second battle in Chinese history, fought by the Yellow Emperor.\n|-\n|2650 BC || Legend of Cangjie, inventor of the Chinese character\n|-\n|2597 BC || Emperor Shaohao ||\n|-\n|2514 BC || Emperor Zhuanxu ||\n|-\n|2436 BC || Emperor Ku ||\n|-\n|2366 BC || Emperor Zhi ||\n|-\n|2358 BC || Emperor Yao || Yao ordered Gun to tame the flooding of the rivers.\n|-\n|2255 BC ||rowspan=\"2\"| Emperor Shun || Gun failed in taming the flood and was executed on Shun's orders.\n|-\n|2205 BC || Yu the Great conquers the flood (est.)\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
