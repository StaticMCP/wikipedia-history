Inter-tribal warfare was disrupting the fur trade, and the influx of miners and increasing numbers of squatters into Indian territories was causing rising tensions between the tribes and settlers.\nTo resolve these difficulties, the U.S. government invited thousands of Indian representatives from all of the affected tribes in the Upper Mississippi region to come gather at Prairie du Chien during August 1825. Territorial governors, William Clark of Missouri and Lewis Cass of Michigan, facilitated discussions. The product of these talks was a general treaty of peace among all of the tribes in attendance, which established boundaries between tribal nations, white settlers and Native Americans’ lands. Signed by U.S. officials and representatives of the Sioux, Ojibwe (Ojibwa/Ojibway/Chippewa), Sauk (Sac/Sak), Fox (Meskwaki), Illinois, Menominee, Iowa (Ioway/Iowan), Winnebago (Ho-chunk), Ottawa (Ottowa/Odawa), and Potawatomi (Potawattomie) tribes, the 1825 Treaty of Prairie du Chien ultimately was created in efforts to eliminate hostilities between Native American neighbouring nations until separate treaties could be negotiated with each respective tribe (for example, see a subsequent single tribe-based Treaty that specifically followed as a result of this one - the 1826 Treaty of Fond du Lac. This Treaty was signed in Duluth, Minnesota with the Chippewas of Lake Superior and the Mississippi Chippewa Nations).\nDue to the overall tribal movements toward the western direction under pressure of encroaching settlers, the Sioux Nation resisted and came into conflict with other tribes moving west into their traditional territory. Ongoing wars between neighbouring tribes have, for many years, been carried on between the Sioux and the Chippewas, and between the Confederated Tribes of Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux; and also between the Iowa Tribe and Sioux.\nThe United States negotiated the treaty in attempts to remove all causes of future conflicts between nearby tribes. The aim of trying to reduce inter-tribal warfare was essentially to promote peace among all of the tribes involved, and to establish boundaries among their lands as they all lived and/or hunted within close vicinity of one another. It was with great fear that if not terminated, the ongoing warfare would extend to other tribes beyond those who were already affected; thus, leading to further hostilities involving other Indian nations who resided along the Missouri, the Mississippi, and the Lakes.\nThe treaty begins by establishing peace between the Sioux and their neighbors: Chippewa, Sac and Fox, and Ioway peoples. The treaty continues by demarcating formal boundaries among each of the tribal groups, often called the \"Prairie du Chien Line\". The treaty claimed American sovereignty over the territories. For peoples accustomed to ranging over a wide area, the Prairie du Chien Line served as a hindrance, as it provided that tribes were to hunt only within their acknowledged limits. Due to the vast scope of the Treaty of Prairie du Chien and the fact that not all of the necessary tribal (mostly Ojibway/Chippewa) Chiefs or their respective representatives were present at its negotiating and signing stages. Therefore, the Treaty of Prairie du Chien provided for additional councils to be held the following year. Along with these additional councils, the Chippewa (Ojibwe) agreed to additional negotiation meetings. (See the 1826 Treaty of Fond du Lac).\nSuch additional councils and negotiation meetings between with the Chippewa (Ojibwe) in 1826 can be considered somewhat successful. In August 1826, the U.S. and representatives of the Ojibwe (Chippewa) of Lake Superior and the Mississippi Ojibwe (Chippewa) Nations gave in to governmental greed by way of disguised promises and deceiving language, authoritative pressures and tactics of manipulation in order for the federal government to successfully obtain sovereignty over the Chippewas traditional lands for the sole purpose of stealing their natural resources - mainly minerals. By agreeing to and signing the 1826 Treaty of Fond du Lac, the U.S. government was given the rights to minerals, exploration and mining upon the Chippewas traditional tribal lands that were located north of the Prairie du Chien Line. Provisions were also made at that time for Ojibwe living on and around Saint Mary's River. Included as addenda to this Treaty were arrest warrants for specific individuals living outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. were issued. Land grants to the Métis were also made under this addenda).\nThe US used the series of Prairie du Chien Lines to serve as the land cession boundaries in later treaties.\nTreaty Outline and Numbered Articles\nThe government, who began their campaign to control the Indians west of the Mississippi, proposed the first peace-based friendship treaty that included numerous tribes in the vast encompassing region at that time. The 1825 Treaty of Prairie du Chien was signed at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin and over a thousand Sioux, Winnebago, Chippewa, Menominee, Illinois, Sac, Fox (Meskwaki), and Iowa were included in the negotiations and final agreement which was ultimately signed and codified.\nThe main issue, and prime reason, that the U.S. government stepped-in was in hopes to establish peace amongst the neighbouring tribes who were often fighting over lands and tribal boundaries. By fixing the established tribal boundaries the aim was to stop the ongoing war between the tribes. In doing so, a “No-Man's Land,\" known as the “Neutral Zone,” was created for the purpose of separating the 3 enemy tribes - the Sioux, Sac and Fox. The Iowa were to share the lands south of the Line with the Sac and Fox. Since the Sioux were not yet there but were acknowledged by all parties to have a vested interest, a final decision could not be made, particularly regarding the western boundaries. This was primarily due to the fact that there were several other existing tribes, including the Omaha and Otoe, who were in disagreement and strongly contested the proposed western boundaries.\nLands ceded\nAs a result of the 1825 Treaty of Prairie du Chien, surprisingly there were no lands ceded by the Iowa. The Ioway were to remain south of the newly established boundary between the Sioux to the north, and Sac and Fox to south; the land of which was all within the geographical area of Iowa-Minnesota.\nTreaty Outline\nArticle 1 - Firm and perpetual peace between the Sioux and the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes; and between the Ioways and the Sioux.\nArticle 2 - the Line between the respective countries.\nArticle 3 - Relinquishment of Sacs and Foxes. Iowas accede to the arrangement.\nArticle 4 - Claim of the Ottoes not to be affected by this treaty.\nArticle 5 - Agreement between the Sioux and Chippewas.\nArticle 6 - Agreement between the Chippewas and the Winnebagoes.\nArticle 7 - Agreement between the Winnebagoes and the Sioux, Sacs and Foxes, Chippewas, Ottawas and Potawatomies of the Illinois.\nArticle 8 - Agreement between the Menominees and the Sioux, Chippewas, Winnebagoes, Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomie Indians of the Illinois.\nArticle 9 - Boundary of the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Potawatomies.\nArticle 10 - Said tribes acknowledge the supremacy of the United States.\nArticle 11 - A council to be held in 1826.\nArticle 12 - An assembly of the Chippewas to be convened.\nArticle 13 - No tribe to hunt within the acknowledged limits of any other without their assent.\nArticle 14 - In case of difficulty between the tribes.\nArticle 15 - When to take effect.\nSignatories\nThe first Treaty du Prairie des Chiens was signed and sealed on location in Prairie des Chiens, Territory of Michigan, on August 19, 1825. This was done while under the Presidential Administration of John Quincy Adams.\nPlease take note that the small letter “x” marked beside each individuals native name represents their actual signatures on the original paper Treaty of 1825. The letters “L. S.” that appear at the end of every signature line represent the abbreviation for the Latin phrase, “logus sigilli,” which means “place of the seal”.\nSioux:\nWa-ba-sha, x or the leaf, [L.
