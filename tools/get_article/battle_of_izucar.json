The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire.\nThe Mexican insurgents, who were commended by General Mariano Matamoros y Guridi managed to force the Spanish loyalist forces, commanded by the Brigadier General, Ciriaco del Llano to retreat. It was during this battle that a young Vicente Guerrero, later the president of Mexico, first distinguished himself in battle.\nSee also\n* Mexican War of Independence\n* Mariano Matamoros y Guridi\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Izucar\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Izúcar"
