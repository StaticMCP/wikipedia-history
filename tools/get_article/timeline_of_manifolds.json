For further background see history of manifolds and varieties.\nBackground\nManifolds in contemporary mathematics come in a number of types. These include:\n* smooth manifolds, which are basic in calculus in several variables, mathematical analysis and differential geometry;\n* piecewise-linear manifolds;\n* topological manifolds.\nThere are also related classes, such as homology manifolds and orbifolds, that resemble manifolds. It took a generation for clarity to emerge, after the initial work of Henri Poincaré, on the fundamental definitions; and a further generation to discriminate more exactly between the three major classes. Low-dimensional topology (i.e., dimensions 3 and 4, in practice) turned out to be more resistant than the higher dimension, in clearing up Poincaré's legacy. Further developments brought in fresh geometric ideas, concepts from quantum field theory, and heavy use of category theory.\nParticipants in the first phase of axiomatization were influenced by David Hilbert: with Hilbert's axioms as exemplary, by Hilbert's third problem as solved by Dehn, one of the actors, by Hilbert's fifteenth problem from the needs of 19th century geometry. The subject matter of manifolds is a strand common to algebraic topology, differential topology and geometric topology.\nTimeline to 1900 and Henri Poincaré\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n!

M might have no triangulation, hence no piecewise-linear maximal atlas; it might have a unique PL structure; or it might have more than one maximal atlas, and so more than one PL structure. The status of the conjecture, that the second option was always the case, became clarified at this point in the form that each of the three cases might apply, depending on M.\nThe \"combinatorial triangulation conjecture\" stated that the first case could not occur, for M compact.
