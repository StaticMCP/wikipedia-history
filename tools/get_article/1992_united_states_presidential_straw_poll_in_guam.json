Thus, it is ineligible to elect members of the Electoral College, instead, the territory conducts a non-binding presidential straw poll during the general election. In turn cast direct electoral votes for president and vice president. Although Ross Perot appeared on the ballot in every U.S. state in the general election, he did not appear on Guam’s ballot.\nDemocratic governor Bill Clinton won the straw poll with 59.11% of the vote.\nResults\nThe votes of Guam residents didn't count in this November presidential election, but the territory nonetheless conducts a presidential straw poll to gauge islanders' preference for president every election year. Since the first straw poll was in 1980.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1992 United States presidential straw poll in Guam\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 10em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 10em\" |Running mate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Percentage\n|-\n! style=\"background:#33f; width:3px;\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic\n|Bill Clinton\n|Al Gore\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |10,233\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |59.11%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Republican\n|George H.
