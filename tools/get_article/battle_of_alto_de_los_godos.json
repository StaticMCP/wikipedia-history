It resulted in a patriot victory against the forces of Spanish general Domingo de Monteverde.\nIt was one of the five attempts by the royalists to regain control over the region and it is notable for its inclusion of women in combat, such as Juana Ramírez, who was also known as \"The Advancer\" (La Avanzadora).\nSee also\n*\nSources\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJwVAAAAYAAJ&q=maturin Historia de la revolución de la República de Colombia en la América Meridional, Volumen 2 page 123, by José Manuel Restrepo]\n\n---\n\n## Battle of alto de los godos\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Alto de los Godos"
