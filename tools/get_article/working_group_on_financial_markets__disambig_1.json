Initially, the term was used to express the opinion that the Working Group was being used to prop up the stock markets during downturns. Financial writers for British newspapers The Observer and The Daily Telegraph, along with U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, writers Kevin Phillips (who claims \"no personal firsthand knowledge\" ) and John Crudele, have charged the Working Group with going beyond their legal mandate. Charles Biderman, head of TrimTabs Investment Research, which tracks money flow in the equities market, suspected that following the 2008 financial crisis the Federal Reserve or U.S. government was supporting the stock market. He stated that \"If the money to boost stock prices did not come from the traditional players, it had to have come from somewhere else\" and \"Why not support the stock market as well? Moreover, several officials have suggested the government should support stock prices.\"\nIn August 2005, Sprott Asset Management released a report that argued that there is little doubt that the PPT intervened to protect the stock market.  However, these articles usually refer to the Working Group using moral suasion to attempt to convince banks to buy stock index futures.\nFormer Federal Reserve Board member Robert Heller, in the Wall Street Journal, opined that \"Instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity, and thereby increasing the danger of inflation, the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market, thereby stabilizing the market as a whole.\" Author Kevin Phillips wrote in his 2008 book Bad Money that while he had no interest \"in becoming a conspiracy investigator\", he nevertheless drew the conclusion that \"some kind of high-level decision seems to have been reached in Washington to loosely institutionalize a rescue mechanism for the stock market akin to that pursued...to safeguard major U.S. banks from exposure to domestic and foreign loan and currency crises.\" Phillips infers that the simplest way for the Working Group to intervene in market plunges would be through buying stock market index futures contracts, either in cooperation with major banks or through trading desks at the U.S. Treasury or Federal Reserve.\nSee also\n* Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000\n* Single Audit\n* Government Accountability Office,\n* Revenue (bottom line vs. \"top line\")\n* Government-owned corporation\n* Budget theory\n* Comprehensive income\n* Permanent fund\n* Public company\n* Crony capitalism\n* Government Accountability Office investigations of the Department of Defense\n* Federal Accountability Act (Canada)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.safehaven.com/article-721.htm The Plunge Protection Team], by John Mauldin\n* [http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_stock_markets_da/ The Stock Market's Da Vinci Code] , by Jonathan Moreland"
