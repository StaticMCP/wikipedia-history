Hawaii went through a transition where it was first the Kingdom of Hawaii, then a political coup overthrew Queen Liliʻuokalani in 1893. Women were not allowed to vote and lost political power in the provisional government. In the same year as the coup, Wilhelmina Kekelaokalaninui Widemann Dowsett and Emma Kaili Metcalf Beckley Nakuina began to make plans to support women's suffrage efforts. When Hawaii was annexed, members of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) advocated for women's suffrage for the territory. In 1912, Dowsett and a diverse group of women created the National Women's Equal Suffrage Association of Hawaiʻi (WESAH). In 1915 and 1916 Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole brought women's suffrage petitions to the United States Congress, but no action was taken. In 1919, suffragists from WESAH fought for women's suffrage in the territorial legislature, but were also unsuccessful. Women in Hawaii gained the right to vote when the Nineteenth Amendment became part of the United States Constitution on August 26, 1920.\n19th century\n]]\n1890s\n1890\n* Representatives William Pūnohu White and John Bush work to amend the constitution for women's suffrage.\n1892\n* Joseph Nāwahī also puts forward women's suffrage legislation.\n1893\n* Queen Liliʻuokalani is deposed in a coup d'état that creates a provisional government.\n* Women lose many political rights under the provisional government, including voting rights.\n* Hui Aloha ʻĀina o Na Wahine (Hawaiian Women's Patriotic League) was founded to oppose the overthrow and annexation, on March 27, 1893, by Emilie Widemann Macfarlane and later led by Abigail Kuaihelani Campbell.\n1894\n* A Woman Suffrage Committee of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) works to get the Hawaii constitutional convention delegates to support women's suffrage.\n1899\n* Susan B.
