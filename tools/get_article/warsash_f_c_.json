This hard work was carried out by local fishermen when they unable to put to sea during the winter months. Many village residents earned their living from the crab industry and this was how the football club became known as the 'the Crabs'. In 1911 the first pavilion was erected, funded by voluntary subscription.\nThe twenties saw Warsash initially playing the in the Meon Valley League before progressing on to the Southampton League, under the dedicated leadership of Arthur Jupe, who ran the club for 44 years.\nThe post-war era saw renewed interest as the club returned to the Southampton League, winning promotion to the Senior section for first time in 1947 where they continued to make steady progress. The sixties saw the clubs fortunes take off as they won the Senior Division 1 title and reached four Southampton Senior Cup finals, all played at The Dell, Southampton. In 1965 they won 4-2 against Netley Sports and in 1967 they defeated Swaythling Athletic Reserves 2-0.\nIn 1968 Warsash made a successful application to join the expanding the Hampshire League and were placed in Division 3 East, where they consolidated for a number of years. The club continued to thrive, running three teams along with a successful Sunday side. They even had their own Supporters Club and regularly played infront of large crowds. In 1970, they reached their fifth Southampton Senior Cup Final, losing 0-1 in a replay against Saints 'A'.\nWarsash won the Division 3 title in 1974 and after several promising seasons in Division 2 they won promotion as runners-up in 1977. However, Division 1 proved to be much harder and they were relegated straight back again. The club remained a steady Division 2 side, but by the end of the eighties they were frequently struggling, and were relegated in 1989.\nBack in the Southampton League, Warsash continued to struggle and suffered further relegation's down to Junior Division 1. They quickly regained their Senior status, but folded in 1997 after a disastrous season.\nHonours\n*Hampshire League\n**Division 2 Runners-up 1976/77\n**Division 3 Champions 1973/74\n*Southampton Football Association\n**Senior Cup Winners 1964/65 and 1966/67, Finalists 1961/62, 1963/64 and 1969/70\n*Southampton League\n**Senior Division 1 Champions 1960/61, Runners-up 1957/58\n**Senior Division 2 Runners-up 1955/56\n**Junior Division 1 Runners-up 1946/47\n**Junior Division 2 Champions 1964/65 (2nd team)\n**Junior Division 8 Runners-up 1995/96 (2nd team)\n**Junior Division 10 Champions 1975/76 (3rd team)\nHampshire League Record 1968-89\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center\n!Season\n!Division\n!Position\n!Significant events\n|-\n|1968/69||Division 3 East||6/14||\n|-\n|1969/70||Division 3 East||9/16||Southampton Senior Cup finalists\n|-\n|1970/71||Division 3 East||4/16||\n|-\n|1971/72||Division 3||11/16||league re-structure\n|-\n|1972/73||Division 3||10/16||\n|-\n|1973/74||Division 3||1/16||Promoted\n|-\n|1974/75||Division 2||11/16||\n|-\n|1975/76||Division 2||4/16||\n|-\n|1976/77||Division 2||2/16||Promoted\n|-\n|1977/78||Division 1||15/16||Relegated\n|-\n|1978/79||Division 2||9/16||\n|-\n|1979/80||Division 2||14/16||\n|-\n|1980/81||Division 2||19/20||\n|-\n|1981/82||Division 2||10/20||\n|-\n|1982/83||Division 2||5/19||\n|-\n|1983/84||Division 2||14/18||\n|-\n|1984/85||Division 2||14/18||\n|-\n|1985/86||Division 2||17/18||\n|-\n|1986/87||Division 2||12/17||league re-structured following formation of Wessex League\n|-\n|1987/88||Division 2||17/19||\n|-\n|1988/89||Division 2||18/19||Left competition\n|}\nGround\nWarsash FC played at the Recreation Ground, Osbourne Road, Warsash, SO31 9GJ. .\nThe venue is now owned by Fareham Borough Council  and has a single full-sized adult pitch with a pavilion located behind the goal.
