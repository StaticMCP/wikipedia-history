Although another reviewer thought the film score \"surprisingly forgettable... it should fail to connect with film music listeners and moviegoers alike\", Jerry McCulley thought the soundtrack \"rises admirably to the occasion with a sweeping orchestral score that masterfully trades on a wealth of disparate historical and stylistic influences\".\nSee also\n* Kingdom of Heaven\nNotes"
