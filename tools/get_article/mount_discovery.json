The Brown Peninsula extends to the northeast of the mountain between the Koettlitz Glacier and the Ross Ice Shelf.\nBlack Island and White Island rise from the ice shelf to the northeast of the mountain.\nMinna Bluff, a long peninsula, extends from the southeast of the mountain.\nThe Eady Ice Piedmont is to the south of the mountain.\nA ridge extends southwest from Mount Discovery to Mount Morning.\nFeatures\nFeatures and nearby features include Mount Morning, and Helms Bluff.\nMount Morning\n.\nDome-shaped mountain,  high, standing west-southwest of Mount Discovery and east of Koettlitz Glacier.\nDiscovered by the BrNAE (1901–04) which named it for the Morning, relief ship to the expedition.\nHelms Bluff\n.\nA prominent north-facing bluff  east of Mount Morning.\nMapped by USGS from ground surveys and Navy air photos.\nNamed by US-ACAN in 1963 for Lieutenant Commander Louis L. Helms, United States Navy, officer in charge of the Squadron VX-6 winteringover detachment at McMurdo Station, 1961.\nDiscovery Glacier\nA broad glacier,  long, between Hurricane Ridge (Antarctica) and Mount Discovery.\nThe glacier flows north to coalesce with the east margin of lower Koettlitz Glacier.\nNamed by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (1999) in association with Mount Discovery, which Captain Robert Scott had named after the expedition ship of the British National Antarctic Expedition (BrNAE), 1901–04.\nLake Discovery\nA lake,  long, situated at the north end of Hurricane Ridge on the west margin of Discovery Glacier.\nNamed by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (1999) in association with Discovery Glacier, a partial source for the lake, and Mount Discovery, the dominant feature in the vicinity.\nSee also\n*List of volcanoes in Antarctica\n*List of Ultras of Antarctica\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n* }}"
