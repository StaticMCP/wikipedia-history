He was a leading figure in the American Sociological Association, helping to found its journal American Journal of Sociology.\nHe had wide-ranging interests in eugenics and criminology. An adherent of the American Progressive Movement in his early career, with a special interest in the protection of the rights of white workers and the white working-class. He soon gained and has kept an enduring reputation as a racist and eugenicist for his vocal opposition to the rights of Asians in California, as well opposing their further immigration into the United States.\nEarly life\nHe was born in Virden, Illinois. His father was a farmer. He attended Coe College and graduated in 1887. After two years as an instructor at a business school, the Fort Dodge Commercial Institute, he went to Germany for graduate study at the University of Berlin. He returned to the U.S., and in 1891 he received his PhD from Johns Hopkins University in  political economy under Richard T. Ely, with minors in philosophy and ethics. He has been described as a disciple of Lester Ward.\nAcademic career\nRoss was a professor at Indiana University (1891–1892), secretary of the American Economic Association (1892), professor at Cornell University (1892–1893), and professor at Stanford University (1893–1900). He was then a professor at the University of Nebraska (1900–1904) and University of Wisconsin-Madison (1905–1937).\nIn the field of economics, he made contributions to the study of taxation, debt management, value theory, uncertainty, and location theory.\nRoss affair and departure from Stanford\nIn Stanford's \"first academic freedom controversy\", Ross was fired from Stanford because of his political views on eugenics. He objected to Chinese and Japanese immigrant labor (on both economic and racial grounds: he was an early supporter of the \"race suicide\" doctrine and expressed his wish to restrict entry of other races in strong and crude language in public speeches) and Japanese immigration altogether. In the speech that was the catalyst for his potential firing and ultimate resignation, he was quoted as declaring, \"And should the worst come to the worst it would be better for us if we were to turn our guns upon every vessel bringing Japanese to our shores rather than to permit them to land.\" In response, Jane Stanford called for his resignation.\nIn Ross' public statement as to his resignation, he wrote that his friend David Starr Jordan had asked him to make the speech. Jordan managed to keep Ross from being fired, but Ross resigned shortly after.\nThe position was at odds with the university's founding family, the Stanfords, who had made their fortune in Western rail construction, a major employer of coolie laborers.\nRoss had also made critical remarks about the railroad industry in his classes: \"A railroad deal is a railroad steal.\" This was too much for Jane Stanford, Leland Stanford's widow, who was on the board of trustees of the university. Numerous professors at Stanford resigned after protests of his dismissal, sparking \"a national debate... concerning the freedom of expression and control of universities by private interests.\" The American Association of University Professors was founded largely in response to this incident.\nNebraska, Wisconsin, and later life\nRoss left for the University of Nebraska, where he taught until 1905. In 1906, he moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he became Professor of Sociology, and eventually chairman of the department. He retired in 1937.\nHis understanding of Americanization and assimilation bore a striking resemblance to that of another Wisconsin professor, Frederick Jackson Turner. Like Turner, Ross believed that American identity was forged in the crucible of the wilderness. The 1890 census's proclamation that the frontier had disappeared, then, posed a significant threat to America's ability to assimilate the mass of immigrants who were arriving from southern and eastern Europe. In 1897, just four years after Turner had presented his frontier thesis to the American Historical Association, Ross, then at Stanford, argued that the loss of the frontier destroyed the machinery of the melting pot process.\nIn 1913, the State of Wisconsin passed its first sterilization law. Ross, who lived in Wisconsin at the time, was a reserved proponent of sterilization and indicated his support for the measure.  He qualified his support by contrasting it with the greater harm of hanging a man and advocated its initial use \"only to extreme cases, where the commitments and the record pile up an overwhelming case.\" Involuntary sterilization remained legal in Wisconsin until July 1978.\nRoss visited Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. He endorsed the revolution even as he acknowledged its bloody origins. He was subsequently a leading advocate of US recognition of the Soviet Union. He later served on the Dewey Commission, which cleared Leon Trotsky of the charges made against him by the Soviet government during the Moscow Trials.\nFrom 1900 to the 1920s, Ross supported the alcohol Prohibition movement as well as continuing to support eugenics and immigration restriction. By 1930, he had moved away from those views, however.\nIn the 1930s, he was a supporter of the New Deal programs of President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1940, he became chairman of the national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, serving until 1950.\nHe died in 1951.\nWorks\n* [https://archive.org/stream/dollarshonest00rossrich#page/n3/mode/2up Honest Dollars].
