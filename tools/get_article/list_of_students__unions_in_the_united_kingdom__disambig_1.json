Although most are known as Students' Unions other common terms include Guilds of Students and '''Students' Associations''', the latter being the more common term in Scotland. Student unions facilitate student societies, such as sports clubs and student newspapers, as well as representing students politically to their respective universities and at a national level. However, it is possible for individual students not to be a member of their union.\nThe majority of unions are affiliated with the National Union of Students, although a minority are not and unions can disaffiliate from the NUS.  There are several other representative bodies of which unions may be members such as the Aldwych Group, for unions of Russell Group institutions, and the National Postgraduate Committee, which represents postgraduate students. In Northern Ireland, all unions are members of the National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland.\nStudents' unions tend to be run by a team of student-elected sabbatical officers. Funding for the unions comes from a \"block grant\" from the university and the provision of services to members through the running of shops and bars. Students' unions are regulated under the Education Act 1994, an Act of Parliament which states that student unions must be run in a democratic manner. Edinburgh University Students' Association is the oldest students' union in the United Kingdom and Liverpool Guild of Students is England's oldest students' union. The University of Glasgow has two independent students' unions, although undergraduates usually only join one of these (but can choose to join both). Some student common rooms at collegiate universities also have the status of students' unions under the 1994 Education Act and exist as independent charities. Keele University also has two independent unions, one for all students (Keele University Student's Union) and one specifically for its postgraduate community (Keele Postgraduate Association - also known as the KPA).\nNotes\n*Further education colleges can have student unions (which may also be members of the NUS), however, this article only lists higher education unions\n*This article lists all higher education unions regardless of whether they are affiliated to the NUS\n*Member institutions of the University of London are listed under \"L\"\n*College common rooms at collegiate universities that are independent charities are student unions under the 1994 act, but must be registered with the Charity Commission if they have an income over £100k. These are listed under their parent university.\nA\n*University of Aberdeen\n**Aberdeen University Students' Association\n*University of Abertay Dundee\n**University of Abertay Dundee Students'
