They functioned as a big tent political movement that represented a wide array of ideologies, including democracy, socialism, nationalism, communism, and anarchism. Some of these groups were coordinated by or collaborated with political organizations such as the right-leaning Korean Provisional Government, as well as with various left-leaning parties. Many of them operated in the border region between Korea and China, particularly in Manchuria until roughly the end of World War II (1939–1945).\nBackground\nRighteous army of Jeongmi (1907)\nLate Joseon dynasty period Korean nationalism outgrew the unplanned, spontaneous, and disorganized Donghak movement, and became more violent as Japanese colonizers began a brutal regime throughout the Korean peninsula and pursued repressive policies against the Korean people. For at least thirteen years after 1905, small irregular forces, often led by regular army commanders, fought skirmishes and battles throughout Korea against Japanese police, armies, and underworld mercenaries who functioned to support Japanese corporations in Korea, and as well-armed Japanese settlers who seized Korean farms and land. In one period, according to Japanese records in Boto Tobatsu-shi (Annals of the Subjugation of the Insurgent), between October 1907 and April 1908, over 1,908 attacks were made by the Korean people against the invaders.\nThe Righteous Army was formed by Yu In-seok and other Confucian scholars during the Peasant Wars. Its ranks swelled after the Queen's murder by the ronin. Under the leadership of Min Jeong-sik, Choe Ik-hyeon and Shin Dol-seok, the Righteous Army attacked the Japanese army, Japanese merchants and pro-Japanese bureaucrats in the provinces of Gangwon, Chungcheong, Jeolla and Gyeongsang. Shin Dol-seok, an uneducated peasant commanded over 3,000 troops. Among the troops were former government soldiers, poor peasants, fishermen, tiger hunters, miners, merchants, and laborers.\nThe Imperial Korean Armed Forces was disbanded on August 1, 1907. The Army was led by 1st Battalion Commander Major Park Seung-hwan, who committed suicide after the disbandment, and led to the former soldiers of the Korean Army fighting against the Japanese occupying troops in Namdaemun Gate. Many members of the disbanded army joined the Righteous Armies.\nIn 1907, the Righteous Army under the command of Yi In-yeong massed 10,000 troops to liberate Seoul and defeat the Japanese. The Army came within 12&nbsp;km of Seoul but could not withstand the Japanese counter-offensive. The Righteous Army was no match for two infantry divisions of 20,000 Japanese soldiers backed by warships moored near Incheon. The Righteous Army retreated from Seoul and the war went on for two more years. Over 17,000 Righteous Army soldiers were killed and more than 37,000 were wounded in combat. Unable to fight the Japanese army head-on, the Righteous Army split into small bands of partisans to carry on the War of Liberation from China, Siberia, and the Baekdu Mountains in Korea. The Japanese troops first quashed the Peasant Army and then disbanded the remained of the government army. Many of the surviving guerrilla and anti-Japanese government troops fled to Manchuria and Primorsky Krai to carry on their fight. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea, starting the period of Japanese colonial rule.\nSummary\n.]]\nThe March 1st Movement provided a catalyst for the Korean Independence Movement, which was crucial to the spread of Korea's independence movement to other local governments, including Hoengseong. Given the ensuing suppression and hunting down of activists by the Japanese, many Korean leaders went into exile in Manchuria, Shanghai and other parts of China, where they continued their activities.  The Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai in April 1919 and several left-wing organizations.\nThey coordinated armed resistance such as the Northern Military Administration Office, the Korean Independence Army, and the Korean Patriotic Organization against the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1920s and 1930s, including at the Battle of Samdunja, Battle of Bongoh Town in June 1920 and the Battle of Chingshanli in October 1920. However, the Japanese sought revenge by massacring the Koreans at Gando, forcing the resistance forces to Mt. Milsan and form the Korean Independence Corps, then move to Free City, Russia. Their manpower diminished when the Bolsheviks believed them to be a liability to the Soviet Union during the Russian Civil War when the Japanese joined forces with the White Army and forced them disarm and join the Red Army. But they refused and the Red Army massacred them at Svobodny. Still, despite these losses, they executed the Hongkou Park Incident attack on Japanese military leadership in April 1932.\nAlthough the Free City Incident depleted their manpower, many resistance forces advocated for an autonomous region for Koreans to replenish their military and promote their independence movement. The first attempt for self-governance was the Korean Unification Government, a military government formed to unify the resistance forces. However, infighting over political ideological leadership caused the government to fragment as the armies of this government established their own autonomous regions causing the government dissolve. The three self-governing Korean authorities that formed after the government's fall were the General Staff Headquarters on the Manchurian side of the Yalu River; the Righteous Government in the provinces of Jilin and Liaoning; and the Korean People's Association in Manchuria also known as Shinmin Prefecture, is translated from the .}} in northern Manchuria. Although initially driven by Korean nationalism, they increasingly began to take up anarchist principles and socialist principles, in order to counter the rising influence of Marxism–Leninism in the region. also known as the United Society of All Korean People (USAKP) or the General League of Koreans (GLK), is translated from the  (HCH).}}\nThe Japanese invaded Manchuria forced members of these authorities to defect and form the National People's Prefecture under a political party and their army, the Korean Revolutionary Party and the Korean Revolutionary Army. Some however formed political parties in the provisional government such as the Korean Independence Party and the Korean National Revolutionary Party with their own armed wings. They coordinated with the Chinese Nationalist and Communist armies such as the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army against the Japanese armies to continue their fight for independence.\nAs they enter World War 2, their struggles culminated in the formation of the Korean Volunteer Army, and the Korean Liberation Army in 1940s, bringing together all Korean resistance groups in exile once more.\n1910s\nKorea Liberation Corps\nThe Korea Liberation Corps () was a Korean association formed in 1913 to fight against Japanese rule. At its height its members numbered about 200. The corps was initially organized in Punggi by Kim Byeong-yeol, Kang Byeong-su, Yu Chang-sun, Jang Du-hwan, Yi Gak, Han Hun, Yu Jang-yeol, Jeong Jin-hwa, Chae Gi-jung, Jeong Man-gyo, Hwang Sang-gyu, Kim Sang-ok, and Jeong Un-hong. This group is sometimes called the \"Punggi Gwangbokdan,\" or Punggi Liberation Corps. In 1915 this group united with a group of independence leaders in Daegu at an assembly in Dalseong Park, to officially form the Korea Liberation Corps. Its first commander-in-chief was Park Sang-jin. This anti-Japanese independence group sourced money for the training of troops, trained troops, planned assassinations of pro-Japanese Koreans (and other pro-Japanese in Korea), formed a provisional government, and worked with domestic and foreign organizations (to increase foreign understanding of Korea under Japanese occupation and get foreign funding) in the 1910s.\n1920s\nHeroic Corps\n, commander of the Heroic Corps, and the Korean Volunteer Corps]]\nThe Heroic Corps was an organization founded in Korea in 1919, during the Japanese colonial period. Its activists believed in revolutionary uprising as well as egalitarianism.\nAfter the March 1st Movement was crushed in 1919, many independence activists moved their bases to foreign countries. However, members of the Heroic Corps thought that those organizations were too moderate and would not contribute to independence in Korea, and instead took a more radical approach by opposing compromising solutions such as culturalism. The Heroic Corps wished for a violent revolution, reflected by the Manifesto of the Korean Revolution () by independence activist Shin Chae-ho. The Corps struggled for independence by assassinating high-ranking Japanese officials and committing acts of terrorism against government offices. The Heroic Corps moved their base to Beijing, China and brought members to Shanghai where they had about 70 members in 1924. Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, Kim Chang-suk, and Shin Chae-ho were engaged as advisers and Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Republic of China, supported the Heroic Corps. However, as time passed, their movement evolved with the spirit of the times.\nKorean Independence Army\nin 1921|right|thumb]]\nIn 1919, Hong Beom-do (1868 ~ 1943) created relations with Koreans residing in Yeonggae, Primorsky Krai, and Gando (Jiandao).\nThe army crossed the Yalu River and wiped out a Japanese military unit. This was the first domestic military operation to take place in Korea following the March 1st Movement. In October, Hong's forces once again moved into Korea, occupied Ganggye and Manpojin, fighting a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Jaseong county, northern Korea. However, due to difficulties in supplying his weapons and logistics, in the winter of 1919, he went under the Korean National Association in Gando and received financial support. The number of soldiers increased to 600.\nBy March 1920, Hong was allied with the Military Affairs Command to provided a boost to the national spirit of Koreans everywhere and prompted further armed resistance struggles in Manchuria. 2,000 Korean independence fighters in the Jilin area attacked the camp of the Japanese army at night, killing 300 people and routing 400 while developing an independence movement while maintaining organic contact with the other independence groups. The army had moved its base from Antuhyun to Fengwudong, Wang Qinghyun, China and received financial support from the Korean People's Association for a larger domestic resistance operation. Hong also joined forces with the National Liberation Army, which was under the leadership of the Korean People's Association. The military's finances and administration were managed by the Korean Minjok Association and the Korean Independence Army was directed by Hong Beom-do. Around 200 old righteous soldiers and old farmers and laborers from Gando, centering on Hongbeom-do, purchased weapons from various places to train the independence army.\nIn the Battle of Baegunpyeong on the 21st of October, the Battle of Wanlugu, Battle of Cheonsupyung, Battle of Eorangchon on the 22nd, and the Battle of Cheonbosan on the 24th, the enemy lost 1,254 dead and over 2,000 wounded. Among them, the 1st Regiment under Hong Beom-do killed 1,200 enemy soldiers. After that, in fear of retaliation from the Japanese Empire, 600 members of the Korean Independence Army moved to Noryeong under the command of Commander Hong Beom-do and joined the Korean Independence Corps.\nCheonmasan Army\n]]\nThe Cheonmasan Army was an organization that carried innovative guerrilla warfare among domestically based armed struggle groups from the March 1st Movement until the 1924s led by General Choi Si-heung and his younger brother Choi Si-chan. It is also called Cheonmadae, a name given because its base is located on Mt. Chŏnma (Chonma-san) in Goryeongsak-myeon, Uiju-gun, North Pyongan Province. It was also called Cheonmabyeolyeong and Cheolmabyeolyeong. Until the early 1920s, after the March 1st Movement, the Cheonmasan Army was evaluated as the most revolutionary guerrilla organization based in Korea. The Cheonmasan Corps achieved significant accomplishments by conducting fierce guerrilla warfare against the Japanese military and police. It closely cooperated with the independent military headquarters established in Manchuria. Afterwards, the Cheonmasan Corps participated as a part of various armed independence movements such as the Seorogunjeongseo (Western Route Military Government Office), Uimin Society, Byakpadae, and Giwon Independence Group. When their domestic activities became difficult, they moved to Manchuria and joined the Korean Provisional Government.\nDue to the Japanese suppression of Independence activities, the Cheonmasandae joined with the General Command of the Liberation Army, which was carrying out armed activities there, and was expanded and reorganized into the Cheolmabyeolyeong of the Liberation Army. Accordingly, Cheonmasan Army took the lead in participating in the General Administration of the Liberation Army, Korean Unification Government, and the General Staff Headquarters. They established military discipline by guiding delinquent soldiers, while strengthening training to raise the volunteer army to the level of the regular army, earning great trust from General Oh Dong-jin, the commander-in-chief.\nThe Cheonmasan Army's also incorporated into the Unification Government. When they reorganized into the Korean Unification Government, they were organized into the 3rd Company of the Volunteer Army. When the conflict between the Unification Government and the Righteous Army Command reached a serious level, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th companies organized the General Staff Headquarters.\nPatriotic Blood Corps\nThe Patriotic Blood Corps (Hyeolseongdan, (혈성단), (血誠團)) was an anti-Japanese armed group organized in Chupung, Primorsky Krai, Russia in 1920. It was founded by Kang Guk-mo, Kim Jong-hwa, and others based on members of the Korean Independence Corps who had moved from Western Jiandao. Chae Young (蔡英) was appointed commander and won the battle against the Japanese army in June 1920. In October 1920, after the Battle of Cheongsanri, they joined the armed groups gathered at Milsan and formed the Korean Independence Corps. To avoid pursuit by the Japanese army, they left Chupung and moved to Annuchino, where the headquarters of the Russian partisan unit was located. In November, this unit merged with Han Chang-geol's Suqing army and Park Gyeong-cheol's New People's Corps (Shimindan) at Trechii-pujin, a Korean village in the Chuguyev Valley. The commander of the integrated unit was Chae Young.\nIn Nov. 28, 1920, they moved to Baededun, Ohun County, Heilongjiang Province, Manchuria, and officially named the unit the Korean Patriotic Youth Blood Corps.\nThen they moved to Baedalchon, Baedalchon was an independence movement base located at the most northern place among the Korean villages in Manchuria and the Maritime Province, it was at the current administrative district of Wuyun, Jiayin County, Yichun City, Heilongjiang Province. Kim Guk-cho named this place as \"Ounhyeon Baedaltun.\"\nIn early 1921, they moved to Iman, Maritime Province, then crossed over to Free City to engage in independence activities.Then Chae young and Jo Maeng-seon left for Irkutsk with Kim Gyeong-cheon's troops. He invited the officers to organize a military academy and train soldiers with Kim and the Korean Communist Party's Irkutsk Faction. On June 28, 1921, Free City Incident arose between Kim Gyeong-cheon, Kang Guk-mo, and Han Chang-geol over the operation of the unit. Son Pungik was shot to death, and the integrated unit was disbanded, and Kang Guk-mo returned to Chupung with some comrades and rebuilt the Patriotic Blood Corps. In the fall, the Patriotic Blood Corps participated in the battle to retake Olga Port led by Lee Won. In November 1922. In the Maritime Province, the order to disarm the Korean partisan unit was issued, and the Korean Patriotic Youth Blood Corps was disbanded.\nKorean Independence Corps\n, the Daejonggyo priest who inspired the militant Korean Independence Movements and became president of the Korean Righteous Corps, Northern Military Administration Office and the Korean Independence Corps.]]\nAt the request of the Chinese side, which could not overcome the pressure of Japan, the independence army units located in all parts of South and North Manchuria, especially in North Gando, moved to the direction of Milsan near the Sino-Soviet border to build a new anti-Japanese war base. In December 1920, under the leadership of Seo Il, the Northern Military Administration Alliance, the Korean Independence Army, the Korean New People's Association, the Korean National Association headed by Gu Chun-seon, and the Korean National Association in Honchun, the Military Affairs Command, Representatives of the Righteous Army Command, Hyolseongdan, Yadan, and Daehanjeonguigunjeongsa crossed over to the Maritime Province of Noryeong to wage a long-term anti-Japanese war. Decided to prepare, he organized this group in Milsan, the Korean Independence Corps (). The total strength was about 3,500.\nIn the process of moving to Free City, the units that did not respond to disarmament returned to Manchuria from Iman, Primorsky Krai (now Dalnerechensk Province, Primorsky Krai, Russia). Units that moved to Free City suffered the Heihe Incident (Yiqing) in the process of integration. After the Heihe Incident, the remaining troops in Free City were reorganized into the Koryo Revolutionary Army. Afterwards, the Koryo Revolutionary Army moved to Irkutsk.\nEfforts to create an independent corps by integrating the units of the Anti-Japanese Independence Army continued. As part of these efforts, a preparatory meeting for the military federation was organized in September 1924. Lee Beom-yoon (李範允) was appointed as the president and Kim Jwa-jin was appointed as the commander-in-chief. Kim Gyu-sik, Choi Jin-dong, Hyeon Cheon-muk, Kang Guk-mo, Nam Sung-geuk, Choi Ho, Park Doo-hee, Yoo Hyeon, Lee Jang-nyeong, etc. was active Centering on Dongnyeong County in Manchuria, it expanded its influence along the Dongji line connecting Subunhe to Harbin.\n1930s\nKorean Patriotic Organization\n]]\nOn September 18, 1931, the Empire of Japan staged the Liutiaohu incident (bombing of the Manchu railroad) and Mukden Incident. The Chinese people's anti-Japanese fervor proliferated because of these incidents. To promote Korea–China relations and to revitalize the depressed independence movement, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea founded a secret organization which would carry out covert missions to assassinate key Japanese figures. That task was entrusted to Kim Gu.\nKim Gu organized the Korean Patriotic Organization () with about 80 members, mostly patriotic Korean youngsters. The organization was based in Shanghai, China. Leaders included Kim Suk, Ahn Gong-geun, Lee Su-bong, and Lee Yu-pil; other notable members were Yoo Sang-geun, Yoo Jin-man, Yun Bong-gil, Lee Bong-chang, Lee Duk-ju, and Choi Heung-sik. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea hope to shock and halt Japan's aggression with assassinations.\nThe Korean Patriotic Organization has been identified as being responsible for the assassination attempts. Following this, Japanese police authorities rushed to arrest key figures of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea by threatening the Shanghai French Concession. Many Korean activists sought refuge in Hangzhou and Jiaxing, through not all made it; among those arrested was Ahn Changho. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea eventually relocated to Hangzhou. Later it moved to Zhenjiang in 1935, and Nanjing in 1936. During that time, the activities of the Korean Patriotic Organization diminished.\nArmies of religious groups\nCorps of the Great Light\nThe Corps of the Great Light (Junggwangdan (중광단)), (重光團)) is an armed group established by the Daejonggyo in North Gando in March 1911. It was established in Wangcheong County in March 1911 by members of the Daejong Church who fled to North Gando. Seo Il was the leader. Although they aimed for armed struggle, they did not have the resources to acquire weapons, so they focused on strengthening the capabilities of the Korean community. From 1911 to 1916, they established 25 schools and operated them and provided education as a principal or teacher, to cultivate talented people.\nKim Gyo- heon, who became the second Taosagyo of Daejonggyo in 1916, went into exile in Bukgando the following year and prepared for an armed struggle in earnest and launched a diplomatic independence movement. Wangqing County was used as the base for the resistance against Japan. He attempted to connect with the independence movement forces in Manchuria and the Maritime Province by dispatching them to Korea. Baeksun and Lee Beom-yoon toured the border regions of Russia and China to recruit volunteer soldiers.\nMarch 1st\nWhen the March 1st Movement broke out in 1919, the Central Light Corps along with Daejonggyo members held anti-Japanese demonstrations along with Christians and Cheondogyo members. They launched a demonstration for national independence centered on Wangcheong-hyeon, Ando-hyeon, and Yangil-hyeon. Immediately after the 3·13 Yongjeong demonstration, a secret organization called 'Free Industrial Complex' was formed at Guoji Street in Yanji County to raise human resources and military funds for the war against Japan, and a monthly salary per person was established. It was decided to collect membership fees of 1 won each.\nOn March 18, 1919, Kim Hyeon-muk (金賢黙) met with Christian Kim Ha-beom (金河範) and others, andDaejonggyo·CheondogyoA protest movement was held with 900 people, including prisoners and students. On March 24, 1919, Hyun Cheon-muk took the lead in the protest movement with a crowd of about 800 people in Ido-gu, Yanji County. On March 26, 1919, in Baekcho-gu, Wangcheong-hyeon, Gyehwa, Kim Seok-gu, and Koo Ja-ik led a rally of about 1,200 people was held and a ceremony to celebrate the declaration of independence was held while waving the Korean flag.\nKorean Righteous Corps\nsymbol.]]\nThe Korean Righteous Corps was a short-lived Korean Independence militant organization organized around May 1919 as a union of Daejonggyo followers and believers of other religions, such as the Confucian Church. The Korean Righteous Corps aimed to carry out a secret armed struggle to achieve independence, and its leader was Seo Il. The Korean Righteous Corps contributed to promoting the necessity of the anti-Japanese independence struggle and promoting national consciousness. They organized a military administration association to build an independence army. They reorganized into the Northern Military Government but they changed the name to Northern Military Administration Office under the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.\nKorean Military Administration Association\nThe Korean Military Administration Association (Daehangunjeonghhoe), 대한군정회 (약칭 군정회), 大韓軍政署)), an armed group organized by the Korean Justice Corps in August 1919. However, because the existing leaders of the Korean Justice Corps were non-experts in military matters, they invited Kim Jwa-jin, a military attaché from the New People's Association, and others to guide the armed group and entrusted them with military training and the formation of an independent army. At that time, they had 500 troops (initial establishment).\nField Corps\nThe Field Corps was organized by the Cheonglimgyo, a branch of Cheondoism who were spreading their influence in North Manchuria immediately after the March 1st Movement, and the head of the Cheonglim religion was Sinpo (申砲). They took the lead and provided military training to young believers to prepare for anti-Japanese military activities. Cheonglimgyo, a sect of Donghak, was expanding its influence in Jilin (吉林) of Manchuria and the Northern Gando region with a strong anti-Japanese awareness.\nAfter the death of Nam Jeong in 1904, their religion declined, but the second-generation religious leader Han Byeong-su organized the Field Corps in Daegu-dong, Serinha, Yeongil-hyeon and carried out an anti-Japanese armed struggle, and through the third-generation religious leader Tae Du-seop. The Field Group was emerging as the 'most active national independence movement group'.\nThey prepared for military activities, as they made thousands of military uniforms without weapons. It is said that after the September 18 Manchurian Incident in 1931, they played an active role in helping Ji Cheong-cheon, the commander-in-chief of the Korean Independence Army, but this is not certain. A Japanese report states that Lim Chang-se led the Field Corps as the leader.\nOrganization\nThis group bided its time by providing military training to young believers in each village. Although there were no weapons and only thousands of military uniforms were purchased, as many as 2,000 young men received military training. Kim Gwang-sook (金光淑), another leader of Cheonglimgyo, was also a key executive.\nThe organization of this dan was headed by Sinpo [申砲, aka Asorae (我笑來)], and the executives were Lim Chang-se (林昌世, aka Gapseok (甲石)) and Kim Gwang-suk (金光淑, aka Byeongju (秉圭)). ] etc. The headquarters was located at Dongbulsa Temple in Yanji County, and it is said that there were 20,000 youth members who received military training, but it is not clear whether this was reported to the Provisional Government.\nArmies of the Nationalist Parties\nKorea Independence Party\nKorea Independence Army\n, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Independence Army]]\nThe Korean Independence Army (), was formed by Kim Chwa-chin, chairman of the Korean People's Association in Manchuria in 1929. Effectively a peasant militia, the army's experienced soldiers were supplemented by guerrillas, trained in the prefecture's military academy, with which the army waged guerrilla warfare against both the Empire of Japan and Soviet Union. It also established a Safety Unit () and an Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Unit, in order to protect Koreans from local bandits and Imperial Japanese forces respectively.\nAfter the Japanese invasion of Manchuria quashed the prefecture, Kim Koo's Korean Independence Party (), absorbed the remnants of the army and placed them under the command of Ji Cheong-cheon. Its main goal was to carry out armed resistance against the Japanese colonial authorities in Korea. The Korea Independence Army consisted mainly of Korean exiles who had fled Korea to escape Japanese repression and Koreans living in China and other parts of Asia. It was initially based in Manchuria, a region in northeastern China, and the army conducted many guerrilla operations against Japanese forces in joint operations with the Chinese Army in Korea, including attacks on police stations, government offices, and other targets. Despite its efforts, the Korea Independence Army faced significant challenges due to its lack of resources and support. It could not mount a sustained campaign against the Japanese colonial authorities, and the organization was eventually dissolved in 1933.\nKorean National Revolutionary Party\nKorean National Revolutionary Party Army\nThe Korean National Revolutionary Party Army was a military force established by the Korean National Revolutionary Party in the mid-1920s, a nationalist political party closely associated with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. The organization was composed mainly of Korean exiles living in China but included some Chinese and foreign fighters. About 200 of its soldiers stayed behind in Manchuria.\nKorean Volunteer Corps\nThe KNRP established the Korean Volunteer Corps as its military organization in October 1938, which, in practice, was controlled by the Chinese National Military Council. The Joseon Volunteer Corps was launched not as a combat unit but as an armed political propaganda unit. For China, the Anti-Japanese War was a 'war of justice', a military struggle and resistance against the invaders. China attempted to make up for its military inferiority through moral superiority, and the Joseon Volunteer Corps was established with the mission of propaganda against the Japanese army and against the Chinese such as the Korean Volunteer Corps News. They carried out guerrilla warfare, and since there were many members who could speak Korean, Chinese, and Japanese, they were in charge of propaganda work, distributing leaflets to the Japanese military and making broadcasts using loudspeakers. This did not change even after they moved to the Eighth Route Army area, and it was not until August 1945 that they were reorganized into a combat unit, and at the end of 1945, they entered Manchuria and expanded into a combat unit. In the summer of 1941, some members of the KNRP and the Korean Volunteers Corps, rendezvoused with the Chinese Communist Party in Northwestern China.\nArmies of the Socialist Parties\nKorean Socialist Party\nKorean Red Guards\nThe Korean Socialist Party formed their own Red Guards led by Yi Dong-hwi consisting of 100 infantrymen.\nKorean Democratic Corps\nThe Korean Democratic Corps (), was a Protestant-affiliated armed independence movement group led by Director Kim Gyu-myeon. They have two branches, Wangcheong-hyeon led by Kim Jun-geun and Park Seung-gil, and Honchun-hyeon led by Commander Han Gyeong-se. To strengthen the military, rifles, pistols, and ammunition were purchased with military funds collected from North Hamgyong Province, Gando, and Russian territory, and armed about 500 independence fighters.\nIn April 1919, the corps merged with the Korean Socialist Party () at the second representative congress of Korean Socialist Party. They assisted Hong Beom-do in the Battle of Fengwudong and the Battle of Cheongsanri. Afterwards, Kim Seong-bae was dispatched as a representative of the Korean People's Assembly to a rally for the formation of the Korean Independence Corps held in Mirsan in December, but it did not achieve any significant results.\nAs the Free City Incident occurred and Japan's ruthless campaign to sweep away independence forces unfolded, the Honchun branch, along with the Wangcheong branch, went into exile and moved to Noryeong. Afterwards, while working for military training and promoting independence ideology, in December 1922, the Lenin government notified of the order of disbandment and disarmament. As a result, it split into the Jaeso faction of Han Gyeong-se and Moon Seong-ryong and the Manchurian faction of Kim Gyu-sik, and in retaliation against the Soviet Union, Kim Gyu-sik killed three Soviet soldiers. As a result of this incident, Han Gyeong-se and Moon Seong-ryong were arrested and imprisoned, and the Jaesopa group was disbanded. And Kim Gyu-sik's group escaped to Manchuria and attempted to resume the independence movement, but it was soon disbanded.\nKorean Revolutionary Party\n, 2nd commander-in-chief of the Korean Revolutionary Army]]\nKorean Revolutionary Army\nHyeon Ik-cheol established the Korean Revolutionary Party and placed the Korean Revolutionary Army under the Military Committee of the National People's Government. The Korean Revolutionary Army greatly reorganized the organization on December 20, 1929, to concretely realize the party's ideology. Through this reorganization, the Korean Revolutionary Army appointed Lee Jin-tak as the commander-in-chief, Yang Se-bong as the deputy commander, and Lee Ung as the chief of staff and organized the existing ten units into seven units. When Yang Se-bong was assassinated, the Korean Revolutionary Party dissolved along with the prefecture in November 1934, and the Korean Revolutionary Army Government was established by integrating the National People's Prefecture and the Korean Revolutionary Army. It became active until 1937.\nArmies of the Communist Parties\nKorean Communist Party\n, leader of the Red Guards of the Korean Socialist Party and the Sakhalin Volunteer Corps of the Shanghai faction of the Korean Communist Party.]]\nYi Dong-hwi, Kim Lip, and others from the Korean Socialist Party formed a temporary organization called the Korean Communist Party in Shanghai around May 1920. However, the communist organizations conflicted with the party's leadership due to ideological differences. Therefore, two factions were formed within the party with their armed units.\nKorean Communist Party's Shanghai faction\nThe armed units of this faction are as follows:\n* Nihang Army: Led by Park Il-ya, was named because it was based in Nikolayevsk Port. Park renamed his unit the Sakhalin Volunteer Corps.\n* Davan Army: Led by Nikolai Choi, was named after its formation in Davan, a Korean village in Khabarovsk.\nKorean Communist Party's Irkutsk faction\nThe armed units of this faction are as follows:\n*Freedom Battalion: A Korean partisan unit became a special Korean infantry battalion belonging to the Far East Republic.  Oh Ha-muk was the commander and the garrison was in Free City. It was absorbed by the Korean Revolutionary Military Government Council's Korean Revolutionary Army.\n* Korean Independence Army: Organized in 1919 in Bongo-dong, Wangcheong-hyeon, Manchuria. Their Commander Hong Beom-do.\nKorean People's Revolutionary Army\n'']]\nKim Il Sung's anti-Japanese guerrilla army, the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, was established on 25 April 1932. The workers, farmers, and young students serve as the core of this army. North Korea claims that it was the first \"self-revolutionary force\" established by Kim Il-sung, known as the \"Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Unit,\" and was initially referred to as the \"Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Unit.\" So the KPRA was also the name for Korean units of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. According to North Korea, the purpose of this organization, in relation to the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, was to \"struggle for the people's interests guided by the Juche idea\" and \"eliminate all class oppression and exploitation and build socialism\".\nAccording to North Korea's official stance, the formation process of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army can be traced back to Kim Il-sung's leadership in presenting a self-reliant anti-Japanese armed struggle line during the Karun Conference held in Jangchunhyeon, Karun, in the summer of 1930. In July of the same year, they established the Korean Revolutionary Army as the first armed organization of the Communists. At the Myeongwol Conference on December 19, 1931, they presented a strategic policy for organizing armed struggles based on guerrilla warfare and declared the establishment of the \"Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Unit\" as a permanent revolutionary force on April 25, 1932, in Sajahwa, Muzutong, Saho, Ando, China, with the Korean Revolutionary Army members, supporters of the Karun Conference, and anti-Japanese people as its core. Subsequently, they further strengthened the leadership and political guidance of the guerrilla unit and reorganized the military command, management system, and rear security system. In March 1934, they transformed the \"Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Unit\" into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. Kim Il-sung identified the Korean People's Revolutionary Army as the core of the Party, state, and military establishment, recognizing it as the key to the establishment of the party, the country, and the military in the northern region of Korea, based on the three major tasks of nation-building, state-building, and military-building for the new country, which he proposed to Korean leaders on August 20, 1945, at a Soviet camp. North Korea also claims that Kim Il-sung enhanced and developed the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into the regular military force, the Korean People's Army, on February 8, 1948, in preparation for the establishment of the North Korean government.\nSixth division\n]]\nThe Sixth Division of the Second Army of the First Route Army of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army led by Kim Il-Sung in 1937 which came to be known as \"Kim Il Sung's division\" consisted of a few hundred men. They crossed the Manchurian-Korean border and attacked a Japanese police station in Pochonbo at 1937. It was widely reported by Korean newspapers such as Donga Ilbo and he became famous in Korea as the most prominent leader of the anti-Japanese movement in the northern half. After the war, some of the Korean nationals in this army became the first generation of the leaders of North Korea. Besides Kim Il Sung, An Gil, Kim Chaek, Choe Yong-gon, and Kang Kon, among others who later became part of North Korea's politics and military forces, were also Korean general officers of the NAJUA.\nEight Girls Jumping Into the River\nTwo of the legendary \"\" were Korean Chinese.

The organization, which started with about 100 people, grew to a maximum of 300 people. The corps students received military training outdoors and studied military science in classrooms.

However, due to the pressure from the alliance between the Japanese Empire and the United States during World War I and the poor harvests and recession, they were forced to close down.\nWillows Korean Aviation School\nWillows Korean Aviation School () was an aviation school meant to train fighter pilots for the Korean Independence Movement, many of whom were members of the Korean National Association. It was established on February 20, 1920, in Glenn County, California, by Korean-Americans and backed by the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai. The choice for a Korean Aviation School to be established in California was for multiple reasons including the March 1st movement, interest and financial support from the Korean American community, the impact of World War I on aviation for combat and defensive purposes, and Japan's inability to control or influence the school on US soil. Although the school lasted until April 1921, it had gained a lot of attention and trained many of the pioneers of Korean aviation, including Park Hee-sung, Lee Yong-keun, and Song Yi-kyun. Two of its graduates went on to join the Republic of Korea Air Force, which recognizes the Willows Korean Aviation School as its predecessor.\nGando National People's Association\nThe Gando National People's Association, which actively accepted the command of the Provisional Government, was active in the unification of independence army units in eastern Manchuria.

In addition, armed groups throughout Gando were integrated and joint assistance was provided in purchasing weapons and training independent forces.\nAfter the Battle of Cheongsanri, the Imperial Japanese Army sought revenge over the previous defeats by inciting the Gando Massacre causing the Gando National Association to dissolve. The National Army joined the Korean Independence Corps at Mt. Milsan representing the Korean and Huncheon Korean National Associations, and established a base in Free City, Russia. However, the Soviet Red Army incited the Free City Incident forcing the groups to disband, and helped Koo Chun-seon and other executives established the National Association Military Department in Dunhua. The National Army survived and in December 1921, it was renamed the 'Central General Inspectorate of the Communist Party of Korea' to strengthen the Shanghai faction of the Korean Communist Party.\nMilitary Affairs Command\nIt is also called Dodokbu and Dokgunbu.

It was formed by integrating the Republican Independence Corps with the Liberation Corps as its core, and it had a different founding entity from the Liberation Army Command, which the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea intended to establish in Sangando. Prior to the organization of the Liberation Army Command, the General Camp of the Liberation Army had already been established, and thus, the Sangando regional command of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was under the responsibility of the General Camp of the Liberation Army. The main camp was divided into four parts: the General Camp, Provincial Camps, County Camps, and Separate Camps.\nAs a military organization under the Provisional Government, the General Camp of the Liberation Army, which carried out anti-Japanese warfare, engaged in 78 skirmishes with the Japanese military and police in 1920, raided 56 Japanese military posts, burned down myeon offices and Yeongrimchang in 20 locations, and killed 95 Japanese police officers.
