It is located in the central North Island of New Zealand in an area known as the King Country. It was formed in 1922 when the South Auckland Rugby Union was split into three (the other two Unions formed were Waikato and Thames Valley).\nHistory\nThe original King Country Rugby Union was formed in 1905 by the Manunui, Matapuna, Oio and Kakahi rugby clubs. In 1907, the newly formed Taumarunui rugby club replaced Oio.\nThe current King Country Rugby Football Union was formed in 1922, by the amalgamation of the first King Country Rugby Union (which was renamed as the Taumarunui Sub-union in 1922) along with the Ruapehu Sub-union in Ohakune (founded 1908), Maniapoto Sub-union in Te Kūiti (1907) and Ōhura Sub-union (1920). These were joined by Ōtorohanga Sub-union in 1927, Kawhia in 1926 (founded 1920) and Kaitieke in 1933 with the Taupō Sub-union transferring from the Hawkes Bay Rugby Union in 1987. The Ruapehu Sub-union returned to its original parent union the Wanganui Rugby Union in 1970.\nThis was the second attempt to establish a Rugby Union in the middle of the North Island, as in 1920 the Rangatiki, Taihape, Ruapehu sub-unions (all affiliated to the Wanganui Rugby Union), and the King Country Union (affiliated to South Auckland) had applied for affiliation as the Main Trunk Union. However, this was declined after the Wanganui Rugby Union objected to the loss of their country players.\nIn those early years King Country representative games were held in Te Kūiti, Taumarunui and Raetihi or Ohakune. Ōtorohanga was first used for a representative game in 1939 with representative games also being hosted in Tokaanu (1966) and Tūrangi (1967).\nIn later years King Country played home games at Piopio, Maihiihi, and Waitomo.\nKing Country played in light blue and green until 1949 when it switched to maroon and gold hoops. In 1980, a maroon jersey with gold collar and cuffs was adopted. The current strip has been used since 1994.\nKing Country has made 22 challenges for the Ranfurly Shield over the years without success but having come close at times, going down to Taranaki in a hard fought game 11–15 in 1958. In 1969 they came even closer when good mates Colin Meads and Kel Tremain were the respective captains, King Country storming back from 6–19 at half time in a torrid second half before going down 16–19.\nA well known and amusing challenge in 1988 against Auckland at Rugby Park in Te Kūiti when “Boris the Boar” mysteriously got onto the field and camped in the Auckland 22 for much of the second half.\nWith the 2020 Heartland Championship cancelled due to Covid-19, the Rams played three First-Class Fixtures against some of their traditional Heartland Rivals. King Country lost their first match against Wairarapa-Bush in the inaugural Meads-Lochore Scroll Fixture (18–22). They won their second fixture versus East Coast (34–22) and in their final game they became holders of the Sir Colin Meads Memorial log beating Whanganui 16–11 in Taumarunui. This game was also Carl Carmichaels 100th first-class game.\nClubs\nKing Country Rugby Football Union is made up of 11 clubs.\n* Bush United Rugby Football Club, Benneydale\n* Kio Kio United Sports Club, Maihiihi\n* Piopio Rugby Football Club, Piopio\n* Taumarunui Districts Rugby Football Club, Taumarunui\n* Taumarunui Rugby & Sports Club, Taumarunui\n* Taupo Marist, Taupō\n* Taupo Rugby & Sports Club, Taupō\n* Taupo United Inc.

Schools play their rugby in other provinces such as Waikato and Bay of Plenty Rugby Union that can offer better opportunities. Players from these schools are still eligible for the King Country Secondary Schools and U19 Rugby Representative teams.\n* Ōtorohanga College\n* Piopio College\n* Tauhara College\n* Taumarunui High School\n* Taupo-nui-a-Tia College\n* Te Kūiti High School\n* Te Kura o Hirangi, Tūrangi\n* Tongariro School, Tūrangi\nTogether these schools are able to challenge for the Sam Te Kaha Shield, which is a challenge shield between all King Country Secondary Schools.\nProvincial representative rugby\nThe King Country team play home matches at Owen Delany Park, Taupō, Rugby Park, Te Kūiti and Taumarunui Domain, Taumarunui.\nNational Provincial Championship (NPC)\nIn 1996, King Country were in the first division of the NPC but in subsequent years struggled and in just 6 years were in the third division.\nHeartland Championship\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=14 | Heartland Championship Results\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Year !! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|!! rowspan=2|!! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Place !! colspan=3|Playoffs\n|-\n! !! !!\n|-\n! 2006\n|5|| 0 || 2 || 3 || 77 || 92 || −15 || 2 || 6 || 6th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Lochore Cup||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Won 17–15 against Thames Valley ||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Lost 34–46 to Poverty Bay\n|-\n! 2007\n|5|| 3 || 0 || 2 || 88 || 66 || +22 || 2 || 14 || 3rd ||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2008\n|5|| 3 || 0 || 2 || 119 || 96 || +23 || 2 || 14 || 3rd ||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2009\n|5|| 2 || 0 || 3 || 100 || 111 || −11 || 2 || 10 || 5th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Lochore Cup||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Lost 27–31 to North Otago|| —\n|-\n! 2010\n|5|| 1 || 0 || 4 || 76 || 119 || −43 || 2 || 6 || 5th || style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2011\n|8|| 1 || 0 || 7 || 150 || 281 || −131 || 1 || 5 || 11th||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No || colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2012\n|8|| 1 || 0 || 7 || 178 || 230 || −52 || 5 || 9 || 11th||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No || colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2013\n|8|| 3 || 0 || 5 || 163 || 211 || −48 || 3 || 15 || 9th||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No || colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2014\n|8|| 5 || 0 || 3 || 196 || 176 || +20 || 5 || 25 || 5th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Lochore Cup||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Lost 6–37 to Wanganui || —\n|-\n! 2015\n|8|| 4 || 1 || 3 || 245 || 192 || +53 || 3 || 21 || 7th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Lochore Cup||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Won 20–6 against Buller ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Won 47–34 against North Otago\n|-\n! 2016\n|8|| 4|| 2 || 2 || 236 || 170 || −66 || 5 || 25 || 6th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Lochore Cup||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Won 48-26 against Poverty Bay ||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Lost 22-44 to North Otago\n|-\n! 2017\n|8|| 1 || 0 || 7 || 206 || 323 || −117 || 8 || 12 || 10th || style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2018\n|8|| 6 || 0 || 2 || 303 || 229 || +72 || 7 || 31|| 3rd ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Meads Cup||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Lost 21-58 to South Canterbury|| —\n|-\n! 2019\n|7|| 2 || 0 || 5 || 172 || 230 || −58 || 5 || 13 || 10th || style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2021\n|8|| 0 || 0 || 8 || 113 || 367 || −254 || 1 || 1 || 12th || style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2022\n|8|| 5 || 0 || 3 || 218 || 201 || +17 || 5 || 25|| 4th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Meads Cup||style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Lost 9-76 to South Canterbury|| —\n|-\n! 2023\n|8|| 3 || 0 || 5 || 175 || 248 || −73 || 4 || 16 || 10th || style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n! 2024\n|8|| 5 || 0 || 3 || 276 || 179 || +97 || 8 || 28 || 5th ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Lochore Cup||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Won 34-31 against Ngati Porou East Coast ||style=\"background: #cfc;\"| Won 46-44 against West Coast\n|-\n! 2025\n|8|| 2 || 0 || 6 || 259 || 234 || +25 || 5 || 15 || 9th || style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| No ||colspan=2| —\n|-\n|}\nThere was no Heartland Championship in 2020 due to Covid 19 restrictions.\nRanfurly Shield\nKing Country have never held the Ranfurly Shield.
