It was part of the wider Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639).\nSafavid Empire\n| combatant2  =  Ottoman Empire\n| commander1  =  Shah Abbas I\n| commander2  =  Unknown Pasha\n| strength1   =\n| strength2   =\n| casualties1 = Unknown\n| casualties2 = Heavy\n}}\nBackground\nDuring the reign of Shah Abbas I, the Safavid Empire underwent significant military reforms and territorial reconsolidation. The Ottomans, seeking to expand influence in the southern Persian Gulf and Shatt al-Arab region, launched an offensive in the Khuzestan province.\nThe Battle\nThe Ottomans moved forces into the marshy terrain near Hawizeh, but were met with a well-prepared Safavid force composed of Qizilbash cavalry and recently trained Georgian and Talish infantry units. The terrain favored the defending Safavids, who utilized their knowledge of local geography to ambush Ottoman troops.\nOutcome\nThe Safavid victory ensured continued control over Khuzestan and blocked Ottoman access to southern Persian Gulf routes. The battle also demonstrated the effectiveness of Abbas I’s army reforms.\nAftermath\nFollowing this defeat, the Ottomans temporarily halted further advances into southwestern Iran. This battle was one of many that paved the way for the eventual Treaty of Zuhab (1639), which stabilized borders between the two empires for nearly a century.\nSee also\n* Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)\n* Shah Abbas I\n* Treaty of Zuhab\nReferences\n* Roger Savory, *Iran Under the Safavids*, Cambridge University Press, 1980.\n* Andrew J.
