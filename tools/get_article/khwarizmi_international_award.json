The awardees, 10 senior researchers and 10 young researchers, are selected by the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST).  It honors \"individuals who have made outstanding achievements in research, innovation and invention, in fields related to science and technology\". The award is given to the most prominent scientists and engineers, with a recent emphasis on digital and mechanical technologies, and is generally considered as the most prestigious scientific award in Iran. Participation is open to non-Iranian researchers.\nFrom the 10th KIA Session, International Organizations such as WIPO, UNESCO, IFIA, COMSTECH, COMSATS, TWAS, and ISESCO sponsored the KIA.\nHistory\nIn 1987, the Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology (IROST), affiliated to the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology of Iran, decided to institute an award which acknowledges the Iranian outstanding achievements in the field of Science and Technology.\nIROST proposed the creation of the Khwarizmi Award in memory of Abu Jafar Mohammad Ibn Mousa Khwarizmi, the great Iranian Mathematician and Astronomer (770-840 C.E).\nHowever the first session which was held in 1987, was only for Iranian nationals, but from the fifth session it became an international award.\nAfter the first award ceremony, it has been officially decided that the award should be accorded, annually, in February. The award certificate would be officially signed and presented by the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nAt the third session, the fields of medical sciences and basic sciences were added to the engineering and technical fields of participation. During this same session, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) stepped in and offered its first sponsorship. WIPO presented a gold medal and a certificate to the first Laureate of the innovation category.\nOriginally, the first Khwarizmi Award contest was held at national level. After the fifth year, the contest opened its door to regional countries. In that year, besides the 19 national Laureates, two prestigious foreign Laureates received the Khwarizmi Award which subsequently produced the foreign section.\nThe fifth session was also important because of the addition of the field of human sciences. The Khwarizmi Award became a strong incentive of excellence for the Iranian researchers, in many different fields of science.\nThe sixth session was held with the participation of national and regional research works from 10 countries, 18 national research works and 3 foreign research works were selected.\nIn 1994, the seventh session the Khwarizmi Award took another significant step with the participation of new countries from Africa and Asia.\nFor more precision in the evaluation process, research works were classified in new different categories, applied research works and fundamental research works, each category with its own evaluation criteria.\nThe competition was broadened to attract more fields of research and eight distinct scientific committees were created: Mechanics, Chemical Industry, Electrical Electronics and Computer, Civil Engineering, Agriculture, Basic Sciences, Medical Sciences and Human Sciences.\nApart from that, at the seventh session, the Khwarizmi Award expanded its area of participation and became an international contest, where all the countries from all over the world were invited to participate and it was renamed as the Khwarizmi International Award (KIA).\nFrom the 10th KIA Session, International Organizations such as WIPO, UNESCO, IFIA, COMSTECH, COMSATS, TWAS, ISESCO and WAITRO sponsored the KIA.\nThe 11th session began with the launch of a new call for participation to Iranian researchers residing abroad. These researchers are the pride of the country as they contribute to the Science and Technology capacity-building of their country and this, in many ways. This vast pool of high skilled scientists entered the competition and most of them were outstanding scientists. In this same session, two Iranian researchers residing abroad received the award.\nThe 21st KIA held in 2008 received 192 projects from 54 countries.\nKIA Laureates\n*Christoph Klein (Germany)\n*Alireza Mashaghi (Netherlands)\n*Andres M. Lozano (Canada)\n*Ali Khademhosseini (USA)\n*Tamio Hayashi (Japan)\n*Fernand Labrie (Canada)\n*Majid Samii (Germany)\n*Paul S. Weiss (USA)\n*Cecilia Lindgren (Sweden)\n*Tofy Mussivand (Canada)\n*Guido Kroemer (Spain)\nKhwarizmi Young Award\nThe Khwarizmi Young Award is a national version of Khwarizmi International Award open only to Iranians aged under 35, which has been awarded since 1999.\nAt the 12th session of KIA, applicants under 30 years old, students in Master and Ph.D. degrees, young inventors and innovators were invited to present their candidatures for a new award, with specific criteria. Consequently at the 13th KIA session, the Khwarizmi Youth Award (KYA) was independently launched to honor young promising scientists and embolden them to keep taking even bigger steps in their research career.\n, 19 sessions of KYA have been held, introducing many young Iranians who have made excellent contributions to the advancement of science, to the wider scientific community.\nSee also\n* List of engineering awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://khwarizmi.ir/fkia/ Official website]\n*[http://khwarizmi.ir/young/ Official Khwarizmi Young Award website (persian)]"
