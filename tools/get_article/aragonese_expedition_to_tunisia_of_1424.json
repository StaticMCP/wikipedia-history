The fleet followed the coast to Genoa, blocking it, and intervening in the ports of Lestri, Bonifacio and Portofino.\nThe expedition departed Malta on 10 September 1424 and made its way towards the North African coast. Djerba was impossible for them to conquer because it was well garrisoned but they managed to capture between 2,000 and 3,500 people. On the other hand, in the Kerkennah Islands the victory was complete and a lot of booty was obtained, capturing 3,000 people. They still dared to attack the city of Tunis, but it avoided the attack by giving them numerous presents and freeing many Christian prisoners. Ausiàs March participated in this expedition.\nThe attack lasted until October 1424, when the fleet returned to Malta.\nAftermath\nIn 1429, the Hafsids attacked Sicily and the Maltese Islands, likely in retaliation to the 1424 Aragonese attack on the Kerkennah Islands.\nReferences"
