In 1967 it was joined by some Christian Democrats to form the Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic, later dropping the 'Fifth'. After the May 1968 crisis, it formed a right-wing coalition named Union for the Defense of the Republic (UDR); it was subsequently renamed Union of Democrats for the Republic, retaining the abbreviation UDR, in October 1968.\nUnder de Gaulle's successor Georges Pompidou it promoted  the Gaullist movement. It dissolved in 1976, and its successor was the Rally for the Republic (RPR) founded by Jacques Chirac.\nSecretaries-general\n*1968–71: Robert Poujade\n*1971–72: René Tomasini\n*1972–73: Alain Peyrefitte\n*1973–74: Alexandre Sanguinetti\n*1974–75: Jacques Chirac\n*1975–76: André Bord\n*1976: Yves Guéna\nElection results\nPresidential\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+President of the French Republic\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Election year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! colspan=\"3\" | 1st round\n! colspan=\"3\" | 2nd round\n|-\n!
