He served as the 13th bishop of the Diocese of Buffalo in New York State from 2004 to 2012.\nKmiec previously served as an auxiliary bishop for the Diocese of Trenton in New Jersey from 1982 to 1992 and as bishop of the Diocese of Nashville in Tennessee from 1992 to 2004\nBiography\nEdward Kmiec was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on June 4, 1936.  At age 25, Kmiec was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Trenton by Archbishop Martin O’Connor in Rome on December 20, 1961.\nAuxiliary Bishop of Trenton\nPope John Paul II appointed Kmiec on August 26, 1982, as an auxiliary bishop of Trenton and titular bishop of Simidicca.  He was consecrated at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption in Trenton, New Jersey, on November 3, 1982, by Bishop John C. Reiss.\nBishop of Nashville\nJohn Paul II appointed Kmiec as bishop of Nashville on October 13, 1992; he was installed on December 3, 1992. He was heavily criticized for his diocese's handling of sexual abuse allegations, particularly those against Reverend Edward McKeown, who was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy.\nBishop of Buffalo, New York\nOn August 12, 2004, Kmiec was appointed by John Paul II as bishop of Buffalo. He was installed on October 28, 2004. In 2007, Kmiec announced that the diocese had a balanced budget, after spending cuts reduced a $2.1 million deficit from the previous year.\nIn August 2009, the Buffalo News reported the removal of Monsignor Fred R. Voorhes, as administrator of St. Teresa's Parish in South Buffalo and the subsequent dismissal of Marc J. Pasquale, as business administrator and director of religious education at St. Teresa's. Parishioners expressed in interviews their discontent with these removals. Pasquale had gone to the Erie County District Attorney's Office prior to his dismissal to raise concerns about questionable financial practices.\nKmiec was heavily criticized for downsizing the diocese from 274 parishes and missions in 2005 to 170 in 2011. He also oversaw the closures of 25 elementary schools. The diocese under Kmiec ordained only 18 priests from 2004 to 2011.\nRetirement and legacy\nOn May 29, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Kmiec's resignation as bishop of Buffalo.
