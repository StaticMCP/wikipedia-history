The monument features a gilded statue of Lady Columbia waving a flag on a pedestal of four stone columns, surrounded on two sides by gilded reliefs depicting the Battle of Baltimore. At the pedestal's base is a bronze statue of Francis Scott Key standing in a rowboat carved from stone.\nHistory\nCharles Marburg gave $25,000 to his brother Theodore Marburg to hire a sculptor to create a monument to Francis Scott Key. The French sculptor Antonin Mercié was selected. Mercié had previously created a bronze equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee in 1890 in Richmond, Virginia. The Francis Scott Key Monument was dedicated on Eutaw Place in 1911.\nIt was restored and rededicated on September 11, 1999.\nThe monument was defaced with the words \"Racist Anthem\" and splashed with red paint in September 2017. The city quickly restored the monument.\nGallery\nFile:Key 5643438604 2072b935c8 o.jpg|Monument circa 1910\nFile:Key monument baltimore 4a24914a.tif|Monument circa 1920\nFile:Key Monument with Flag.JPG|Figure of Columbia with the American Flag\nFile:Statue marked with spray paint graffiti and splashed red paint, Francis Scott Key Monument (1911, Marius Jean Antonin Mercié), W.
