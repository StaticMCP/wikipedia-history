The word \"Wajin\" also refers to related groups outside of Japan.\nThe first secure appearance of Wajin is in \"Treatise on Geography\" (地理志) of the Book of Han (漢書). After that, in \"Gishi Wajinden\" ((魏志倭人伝), a Japanese abbreviation for the \"account of Wajin\" in the \"Biographies of the Wuhuan, Xianbei, and Dongyi\" (烏丸鮮卑東夷傳), Volume 30 of the \"Book of Wei\" (魏書) of the Records of the Three Kingdoms (三国志)), their lifestyle, habits and the way of society are described and by cultural commonality such as lifestyle, customs and languages, they are distinguished themselves from \"Kanjin\" (han people (韓人)) and \"Waijin\" (Wai people (濊人)).\nDescriptions about Wajin can be found in the Old Book of Tang (945 AD) and the New Book of Tang (1060 AD)\nSeveral linguists, including Alexander Vovin and Juha Janhunen, suggest that Japonic languages were spoken by Wajin and were present in large parts of the southern Korean Peninsula. According to Vovin, these \"Peninsular Japonic languages\" were replaced by Koreanic-speakers (possibly belonging to the Han-branch). This event was possibly the reason for the Yayoi-migration into Japan. Janhunen also suggests that early Baekje was still predominantly Japonic-speaking before they got replaced or assimilated into the new Korean society.\nOrigin of the name\n\"Wa (倭)\" was the Chinese name for Japan in ancient times, but the oldest source on its origin is a document written in the 200s by the Wei official (魏の官人) Rujun (如淳), who argued that Wa was derived from the word \"people\" (人偏) who had the custom of \"tattooing (委) on the face.\" This theory is also supported by many Japanese scholars, as the indigenous Ainu people of Japan have the custom of tattooing (sinuye). Furthermore, Chinese from the Qin and Han dynasties to the Sui and Tang dynasties is known to have a pronunciation close to modern Cantonese, and even in modern Cantonese, the pronunciation of \"委奴: Wainu (wai2 nou4)\" and \"倭奴: Wainu (wai1 nou4),\" referring to the \"Ainu (Wainu) people,\" has unchanged from ancient times to the present day.\nAs Baiyue and Wu people\nThe ethnic concept of \"Wa-zoku (倭族, literally \"Wa people\")\" encompasses a wide range of regions and does not limit to the Wajin of the Japanese archipelago. According to Kenzaburo's theory, Wa-zoku are Wajin who came to the Japanese archipelago with rice crop, whose ancestor was the same as the Yayoi people. Torigoe says that the original place of the Wa-zoku is Yunnan.\nSuwa Haruo considered Wa-zoku to be part of Baiyue (百越) in southern China.\nThe Wajin (and the Yayoi) are possibly descendants of the Wu people. A large paddy ruins in the area was created around 450 BC, the Warring States period, in Kyushu, and a record states that \"Wajin [were the] self-named descendants of Zhou\". An influential theory states that the Wu people of the Yangtze River area that followed the hydroponic rice cultivation culture, which is also a symbol of Yangtze civilization, drifted to the Japanese archipelago around the 5th century BC, in collaboration with the destruction of the Kingdom of Wu.\nGenetics\nReferences"
