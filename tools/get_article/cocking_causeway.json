In 1865 a large funeral procession assembled at Cocking Causeway for Richard Cobden, who had lived nearby at Dunford. He was buried at West Lavington church, whose parish at that time included the eastern part of the Causeway, whilst the western part fell into Cocking parish.\nAmenities\nEcclesiastically, Cocking Causeway falls within Cocking with West Lavington Anglican parish.\nThe Greyhound is a freehouse pub with bars, dining areas and gardens.\nCocking Causeway is on the Serpent Trail, a  footpath from Haslemere in Surrey to Petersfield in Hampshire.\nRail\nThe London Brighton and South Coast Railway line between Chichester and Midhurst ran along an embankment parallel to the Causeway. The line had opened in 1881, was closed to passengers in 1935 and was closed completely in 1953. The track bed remains. On 19 November 1951 a freight train hauled by LB&SCR C2X class locomotive no. 32522 was derailed between Cocking and Midhurst after part of the embankment was washed out as a result of a blocked culvert.\nReferences\nExternal links"
