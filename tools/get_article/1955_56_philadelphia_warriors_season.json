The addition of rookie Tom Gola made the difference. In his first season Gola averaged 9.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game. In the Eastern Division Finals the Warriors beat the Syracuse Nationals in 5 games. In the NBA Finals, the Warriors won their 2nd Championship by beating the Fort Wayne Pistons 4 games to 1. The Warriors' 1956 championship marked the first NBA Finals championship won by a team that was established in the National Basketball Association itself (or in this case, the Basketball Association of America precursor) since the Warriors' 1947 BAA Finals championship during the league's inaugural season after the BAA/NBA's prior champions up until this point were won by the American Basketball League's original rendition of the Baltimore Bullets (who have since gone defunct) and the National Basketball League's Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, and Syracuse Nationals. HoopsHype would later rank this championship squad as tied with the 1956–57 Boston Celtics from a season later team as the team with the second-easiest path to the NBA Finals ever in 2024 due to them being one of three total championship teams who had playoff opponents that averaged around an average overall record or less during their championship run.\nRoster\nRegular season\nSeason
