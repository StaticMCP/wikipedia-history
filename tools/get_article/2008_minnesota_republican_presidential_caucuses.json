The caucuses were considered a non-binding straw poll, since the Republican Party of Minnesota officially chose 24 delegates to the 2008 Republican National Convention during district conventions from May 3 to May 24, 2008, and the remaining 14 delegates during the state convention on June 7, 2008.  Those delegates to the national convention officially nominated the President.  Mitt Romney was the winner of the Minnesota caucuses.\nThe 2008 Republican National Convention was held in St. Paul, Minnesota from September 1 until September 4, 2008.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+100% of precincts reporting\n|-\n!
