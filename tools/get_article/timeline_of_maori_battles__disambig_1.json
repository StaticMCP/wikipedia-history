The final, brutal episode of the battle was played out on the flats between Kakahi and the Whanganui river.\n17th century\n* 1642, Dec: Four of Tasman's crew are killed at Wharewharangi (Murderers) Bay by a Ngāti Tūmatakōkiri war party. Tasman's ships are approached by 11 waka as he leaves and his ships fire on them, hitting a Māori standing in one of the waka.  Tasman's ships depart without landing. The Dutch chart the west of the North Island.\n18th century\n* c. 1741, Te-Rangi-hinganga-tahi (\"the day when all fell together\"), also known as The Battle of Paruroa. The battle near Parau in the lower Waitākere Ranges, where paramount chief of Waiohua, Kiwi Tāmaki, was defeated by the Te Taoū hapū of Ngāti Whātua, led by Waha-akiaki, Tūperiri and Waitaheke. This battle signified the end of Waiohua hegemony in the Auckland isthmus.\n* c. 1740s: the final major battle between Ngāti Whātua and Waiohua at Māngere Mountain. The few regrouped Waiohua forces, led by Mahitokotoko and Mahikourona, scattered shells around the base of the pā on top of Māngere Mountain, to warn the warriors of any invading forces. A Ngāti Whātua war party led by Tūperiri attacked the pā by stealth, by placing tōpuni (dog skin cloaks) on top, to muffle the sounds of the shells. After the battle, Tūperiri began to settle central Tāmaki Makaurau, leading to the birth of Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei. The names Te Ara Tōpuni or Te Ara Pūeru (\"the road of cloaks\") can refer to this battle, or describe the site on Māngere Mountain where the battle occurred.\n* 1772, 12 Jun: Marion du Fresne is killed at Tacoury's Cove, Bay of Islands by local Māori.\n* 1773, 18 Dec: A skirmish at Grass Cove in Queen Charlotte Sound results in the deaths of two Māori and nine members of Cook's expedition.\n*Late 1700s: Tūhuru, chief of Ngāti Waewae (a hapu of Ngāi Tahu) defeats Ngāti Wairangi in a battle at Kōtukuwhakaoho (Stillwater, West Coast), securing Ngāi Tahu control over pounamu on the West Coast.\n19th century pre-1839\n* c. 1807: The Battle of Hingakaka (sometimes called Hiringakaka) was fought between two Māori armies, an allied southern North Island army and a Tainui alliance army, near Ōhaupō in the Waikato, and was reputedly \"the largest battle ever fought on New Zealand soil\" – so many chiefs died that it is known as Hingakaka (the fall of parrots).\n* 1807–1845: The Musket Wars were a series of three thousand or more battles and raids fought in New Zealand and the Chatham Islands amongst Māori between 1807 and 1845, after Māori obtained muskets.\n**1807 or 1808: Ngāpuhi fight Ngāti Whātua, Te Uri-o-Hau and Te Roroa iwi at the battle of Moremonui on the west coast of Northland, the first battle in which Māori used muskets.\n**1821: Battle of Okoki with Potatau Te Wherowhero.
