After the sculptor's death in 1921, thanks to a petition created by his student, Piero Da Verno, the statue was erected. The monument was unveiled on April 4, 1927. The statue depicts Bianchi, sitting with a palette in one hand.\n\n---\n\n## Monument to Mose Bianchi\n\n#REDIRECT Monument to Mosè Bianchi"
