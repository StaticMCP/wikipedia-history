In response, the two local councils began funding its maintenance, stated to be around £30,000 to £40,000 per year while Stagecoach continued to operate it. The councils at the time stated that they were planning to identify a new location for the bus station.\nA planning application was submitted for a new bus station in The Wharf area in 2007. The new site was closer to the town centre and near Newark Castle railway station. However, a petition was launched against the building of the new bus station with opponents claiming it would spoil the view in the area. In June 2008, the developers announced in response that it would keep the bus station at its existing site.\nThe former bus station was closed in May 2010 for redevelopment. The rebuilt bus station was opened on 11 November 2011.\nFacilities\nThe bus station has five bays, cycle parking, vending machines, and screens detailing bus departure times.\nReferences"
