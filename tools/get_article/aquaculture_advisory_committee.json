Its role was to provide relevant advice to the Minister regarding the administration of the Aquaculture Act 2001, related policies, proposals, regulations and any amendments to them. In 2012, Fisheries Minister Gail Gago described the AAC as playing \"a vital role in informing and advising Government to ensure the ecological sustainable development of South Australia’s world-leading aquaculture.\" In September 2014 it was recommended that the council be abolished in favour of direct sectoral representation.\nMembership\nMembers were appointed to the Aquaculture Advisory Committee for a period of three years, following a nomination process. As of 2012, members were entitled to sitting fees of $206 per 4 hour session. The Committee typically mets four to five times a year and meetings were held at 25 Grenfell St, Adelaide. The Committee included a combination of Members and Deputy Members who together represent the industry, its regulators and local government.\nAt 30 June 2014, membership included:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n!Membership\n!Representative role\n|-\n|Catherine Cooper\n|Presiding Member\n|Nominated by the Minister\n|-\n|Trent Rusby\n|Member\n|Administration of Harbors and Navigation Act 1993\n|-\n|Andrew 'Andy' Dyer\n|Member\n|Aquaculture industry, Kinkawooka Mussels & SA Mussel Growers Association\n|-\n|Jillian 'Jill' Coates\n|Member\n|Aquaculture industry, South Australian Aquaculture Council\n|-\n|Michelle Grady\n|Member\n|Environmental conservation\n|-\n|Brian Jeffriess\n|Member\n|Aquaculture industry, Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association\n|-\n|Hagen Stehr\n|Member\n|Aquaculture industry, Stehr Group, Clean Seas\n|-\n|Professor Kym Abbott\n|Member\n|Research & Development, University of Adelaide\n|-\n|Stewart Payne\n|Member\n|Local Government\n|-\n|Peter Dolan\n|Member\n|Administration of Environment Protection Act 1993\n|-\n|Mehdi Doroudi\n|Member\n|Administration of Aquaculture Act 2001\n|-\n|David Craig Ellis\n|Deputy Member\n|Aquaculture industry, David Ellis & Associates\n|-\n|Helen Fulcher\n|Deputy Member\n|Environmental conservation\n|-\n|Roseanne Healy\n|Deputy Member\n|Research & Development\n|-\n|Tara Ingerson\n|Deputy Member\n|Administration of Environment Protection Act 1993\n|-\n|Rachel Lawrie\n|Deputy Member\n|Aquaculture industry, Marine biologist\n|-\n|Jonathan 'John' Luckens\n|Deputy Member\n|Aquaculture industry, Australian Freshwater Crayfish Growers' Association SA\n|-\n|Lorraine Rosenberg\n|Deputy Member\n|Local Government\n|-\n|Emmanuelle Sloan\n|Deputy Member\n|Administration of Aquaculture Act 2001\n|-\n|Marcus Stehr\n|Deputy Member\n|Aquaculture industry, Stehr Group, Clean Seas\n|-\n|Abigail Walters\n|Deputy Member\n|Administration of Harbors and Navigation Act 1993\n|}\nPrevious members included (but were not limited to):\n* Prof. Gail Anderson\n* Prof. Anthony Cheshire\n* Steven Clarke\n* Andrew Christian\n* Debra Davey\n* Andrew James Ferguson\n* David Hitchcock\n* Julianne Marshall\n* Steven Mawer\n* Heather Montgomerie\n* Mary Mitchell\n* Ian Nightingale\n* Frederick 'Fred' Pedler\n* Emmanuelle Sloan\n* Jeffrey Todd\n* Grant Westphalen\n* Wolfgang Zeidler\n* Bruce Zippell\nReferences"
