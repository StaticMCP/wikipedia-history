The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama Casualty, which is set in the emergency department of the fictional Holby City Hospital, based in the equally fictitious town of Holby. Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards. He opined that Casualty limited itself to \"accident of the week\" storylines, while Holby City allowed the possibility of storylines about long-term care, rather than immediate life-and-death decisions.\nHolby City has earned various awards and nominations, with the nominations in categories ranging from Best Drama to its writing and editing work to the cast's acting performance. It received nominations for eight awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTAs), winning the Best Continuing Drama in the 2008 British Academy Television Awards — an award for which it was unsuccessfully nominated in for three years prior to winning and five years after winning. Despite being the most shortlisted Holby City actress, Amanda Mealing (who portrayed Connie Beauchamp) did not win any awards for her role. Rosie Marcel was the most acclaimed actor from the series, winning four awards for her role as Jac Naylor. Rebecca Wojciechowski and Peter Mattessi are the only members of the show's production team to win an accolade; they have each won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award. The serial has also been nominated for 32 awards at the National Television Awards, although it never won.\nAwards and nominations\nBBC Drama Awards\n(pictured), who portrayed Will Curtis, came nineteenth in the \"Best Actor\" category and eighteenth in the \"Most Desirable Drama Star\" in 2004.]]\nThe BBC Drama Awards were an online award ceremony organised by BBC Online and voted by BBC Online users to celebrate a year in BBC television and media.
