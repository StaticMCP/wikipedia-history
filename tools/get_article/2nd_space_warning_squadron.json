It operates the Space-Based Infrared System satellites conducting global monitoring for significant infrared events.\nThe squadron's mission is to operate and maintain the Space-Based Infrared System.  Additionally, it reports ballistic missile and space launches, nuclear detonations, and infrared data of operational value to the President of the United States, Secretary of Defense, combatant commanders, intelligence agencies, and global warfighters.\nOperations\nOn 7 January 2020 2nd Space Warning Squadron detected the launches of more than a dozen missiles against US and coalition partners. This provided crucial warning to the warfighters, which helped them to take cover.\nHistory\nThe squadron has operated ground stations set up to control the Defense Support Program (DSP) and Space-Based Infrared System, space-based surveillance systems configured to detect and report ballistic missile launches, space launches, and nuclear detonations since 1992.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 2d Space Communications Squadron on 1 May 1992\n: Activated on 15 May 1992\n: Redesignated 2d Space Warning Squadron on 1 May 1993\nAssignments\n* 21st Operations Group, 15 May 1992\n* 21st Space Wing, 21 July 1995\n* 460th Operations Group, unknown – present\nStations\n* Buckley Air National Guard Base (now Buckley Space Force Base), Colorado, 15 May 1992 – present\nSystems Operated\n* Space-Based Infrared System satellites (200x-present)\n* Defense Support Program satellites (1992–present)\nList of commanders\n* Lt Col Francois Roy, July 2013\n* Lt Col April Wimmer, 7 July 2015\n*Lt Col Shannon DaSilva, 11 May 2017\n* Lt Col Brandon Davenport, 5 June 2019\n* Lt Col Michael Mariner, 1 July 2021\n* Lt Col Scott M.
