The main deity is Lord Thanthondreeswarar (Lord Shiva) and the female deity is Goddess Dharmasamvarthini.\nThanthondreeswarar Temple is located on the banks of Vasishta Nadi (Vasishta River).\nThis temple comes under the Hindu Religious Charitable Endowment Department.\nHistory\nThe inner sanctum was constructed by 'Milagu Chetty' and the rest were constructed by King Paranthaga Chola (Paranthaka Chola). Construction of Rajagopuram was started during the 12th century by King Paranthaka Chola, but was left incomplete.\nIt also showcases the Dravidian architecture and is representative of the Chola Empire's Ideology and the Tamil civilisation.\nLegend\nManickam Chetty, a pepper merchant was living near a village close to the temple. His job was carrying loads of pepper and selling it in the market place. One day he was crossing this dense forest where the shrine is located at present. As darkness sunk in, he wanted to take rest. In order to eat, he crushed pea aubergine (Sundaikai, an edible vegetable) with a stone. Suddenly he heard a voice saying, \"The stone hurts my head. Apply some pepper on my head. Bewildered by this incident, the merchant said that he did not have any pepper and added that he had only Black Gram (Ulundu). Next day he proceeded to the market place and opened his baggage. He was shocked to find black gram instead of pepper. He worshipped God and prayed for His forgiveness. God  asked him to bring some mud from the place where he had crushed pea aubergine (sundaikai) and spray it in the baggage containing black gram. He followed His instructions and black gram transformed into pepper again.\"\nOn his way back, out of curiosity, he examined the place where he took rest. He was surprised to find a Suyambu Lingam (Lingam which originates by itself from earth). He worshipped the Lord and it is believed that the inner sanctum of the temple was built by him. Henceforth he was called Milagu Chetty (Milagu means Pepper) and the place where pepper transformed into black gram is called Ulundurpettai. The place has retained its name since then.  As per history the inner sanctum was constructed by Milagu chetty and the rest was constructed by king Paranthaga chola. This has been mentioned in the book \"The Manual Of Salem District  in the Presidency of Madras\" by Lee Fanu  and the same idea has been endorsed by Dr. Busnagi Rajannan, a History professor.\nRajagopuram\nThe Rajagopuram is  about 97 feet tall having 7 stages(floors).\nConsecration Ceremony (Kumbabishekam) for the new Rajagopuram was performed on 24 February 2002.\nBrahmanda Purana\nBrahmanda purana is one of the 18 puranas in Sanskrit and is written by the great saint, Vedha Vyasa. In 130th chapter of this purana, Sudamuni narrated the glory of Lord and this temple to his disciples and other saints.\nKanampulla Nayanar\nKanampullar, one of the Nayanmars hailed from a rich family in this same village. He was a sincere devotee of Sri Thanthondreeswarar. He considered lighting lamps in this temple as his prime duty and did it with utmost dedication.\nHe went through a rough phase and lost all his wealth. Poverty drove him to Thirpuliswaram and he continued lighting lamps in a Shiva temple there. To earn his living, he used to cut a kind of grass called Kanampul and sell it in the market. He spent his meagre income on oil and wicks.\nLord Shiva decided to test his devotion. One day his grass was not sold and he did not have enough money to buy oil and wick to light the lamps. He used his locks of hair as wick in the lamp and lighted it. Extremely pleased with the supreme devotion of Kanampullar, Shiva appeared in front of him and he became one with God.\nA statue of Kanampullar holding a lamp can be seen in this temple in front of Pradhosha Nandi (The Devine Bull). He is the 48th among the Nayanmars.\nThis adds to the pride of Belur.\nTemple’s Architectural Note\n* The temple is constructed in such a way that every year, in the first week of Tamil month (Chithirai) the sunlight falls on the main deity in early morning.\n* A structure of a mythical lion, \"YAZHI\" (A statue of lion) made out of a single stone with a rolling ball inside its mouth is carved on two pillars.\n* A structure of Lord Shiva riding a vedhic horse is carved on two other pillars made out of a single stone.\nRenovation Work\nRenovation (1991)\nThe inner sanctum was renovated and four vimanas were constructed. Consecration Ceremony (Kumbabishekam) was performed in the same year.\nRenovation (1992 - 2002)\nTemple renovation and reconstruction of Rajagopuram was initiated in the year 1992. A local non-profit organization, \"Belur Narpani Mandram\" raised fund for this work. Construction of Rajagopuram and renovation of the temple was completed by 2002.\nConsecration Ceremony (Kumbabishekam) was performed on 24 February 2002.\nTransportation\nTemple is located close to the Belur Bus Terminus (Approx 600 Meter from Bus Terminus).\nBus Route\nBelur is 30&nbsp;km from Salem city and is 6&nbsp;km to the north of Valappadi, a neighbouring town.\nBus service to Belur is available from neighbouring towns Salem, Attur & Vazhappady frequently.
