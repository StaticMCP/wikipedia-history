Strier.\nAt the time the long-term study of the muriquis began Abdala was in his 70s.\nBesides the forest, his farm included an active coffee plantation and cattle ranch, and employed over 20 families whose houses were on the farm.\nAbdala put up researchers in his farmhouse until a small vacated house on the edge of the forest had been renovated.\nThis house became the Caratinga Biological Station (Estação Biológica de Caratinga) in May 1983.\nThe biological station was supported by Abdala, the Federal University of Minas Gerais, the World Wildlife Fund and the Brazilian Foundation for the Conservation of Nature (FBCN).\nResearchers found buffy-headed marmosets, an endangered species, as well as healthy populations of brown howler and tufted capuchin monkeys.\nAbdalla died in June 2000 at the age of 92.\nThe private non-profit Society for Muriqui's Preservation, \"Preserve-Muriqui\", created by the Abdala' family, now manages the reserve.\nThe Feliciano Miguel Abdala Private Natural Heritage Reserve was created by decree on 3 September 2001.\nConservation International Brazil provided technical and financial support for founding the reserve in partnership with the Caratinga Biological Reserve Association and the Biodiversity Foundation (Fundação Biodiversitas).\nEnvironment\nThe reserve is located in the municipality of Caratinga in the state of Minas Gerais.\nIt has an area of . It is located on the left bank of the Manhuaçu River in the Doce River basin.\nThe region has a rugged terrain with altitudes from . The reserve holds parts of the basins of the Jaó and Matão streams.\nThe climate is hot, with average rainfall of about , falling mainly in the summer (October to March).\nThe reserve contains an example of the Atlantic Forest biome.\nAbout 80% of the land is covered in well-preserved forest, while the remainder holds abandoned pasturage and secondary growth forest.\nMany of the neighbours also have small areas of forest beside the reserve.\nThe reserve holds many endemic plants and is home to various endangered birds and mammals.\nVegetation is mainly semi-deciduous forest, with the best-preserved parts in the lower areas along the two streams, where the canopy is continuous and about  high with emergent trees reaching over  in height.\nHigher up the primary forest makes way for secondary forest and then bushy scrub at the summit.\nThe reserve is home to a population of endangered northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus) spider monkeys.\nIt has been estimated that there were a million of these monkeys when the Europeans arrived, but they are now on the list of 25 most endangered primates in the world.\nThere were about 60 spider monkeys on the reserve when it was established.\nAs of 2006 there were less than 1,000 surviving individuals in the world, of whom 226 were living in the reserve.\nBy 2011 the reserve had 320 individuals, the largest concentration in the world.\nAbout 362 species of vertebrate have been recorded, including 79 species of mammal, 204 species of birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians.\nThe pit viper Lachesis muta and the Natterer's longwing butterfly (Heliconius nattereri) are considered endangered.\nConservation\nThe reserve is classed as IUCN protected area category IV (habitat/species management area).\nIt has the objective of conserving biological diversity in a private area.\nPreserve-Muriqui aims to guarantee survival of the northern muriqui in its natural environment and to support research, while working with the inhabitants of neighbouring properties and providing jobs for local people.\nThe reserve has been the subject of many scientific studies including 22 independent research projects and ten PhD theses.\nThe reserve is open to eco-tourists, providing guided tours of the forest.\nFees are used to help support the reserve.\nLocal people are employed at competitive rates on tasks such as opening trails and following the muriquis.\nThis has contributed to local support for conservation and research in the reserve.\nThe Preserve Muriqui has started seedlings of native trees and guided the neighbours to reforest the hilltops to revitalise the springs.\nIt has also taught the neighbours intensive farming techniques to grow more crops while farming a smaller area.\nThe manager of the reserve said that the proprietors of the local farms have become the guardians of the forest.\nFile:Alouatta guariba (Brown Howler Monkey).jpg|Brown howler\nFile:Callithrix flaviceps.jpg|Buffy-headed marmoset\nFile:Brachyteles hypoxanthus3.jpg|Adult northern muriqui using its prehensile tail\nFile:Brachyteles hypoxanthus northern muriqui.jpg|Northern muriqui resting\nNotes\nSources\n*\n|title=About Us|publisher=Preserve Muriqui\n|url=http://www.preservemuriqui.org.br/ing/quem.htm|accessdate=2016-05-09}}\n*\n|title=Ecoturism: Visitation|publisher=Preserve Muriqui\n|url=http://www.preservemuriqui.org.br/ing/tur_visita.htm|accessdate=2016-05-09}}\n*\n*\n|title=Home|publisher=Preserve-Muriqui\n|url=http://www.preservemuriqui.org.br/ing/home.htm|accessdate=2016-05-09}}\n*\n*\n*|date=22 January 2011|work=Jornal Hoje\n|title=Reserva ambiental particular garante a sobrevivência do macaco muriqui\n|url=http://g1.globo.com/jornal-hoje/noticia/2011/01/reserva-ambiental-particular-garante-sobrevivencia-do-macaco-muriqui.html|accessdate=2016-05-09}}\n*|language=Portuguese\n|title=Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Feliciano Miguel Abdala|publisher=SENAC Minas\n|url=http://www.descubraminas.com.br/Turismo/DestinoAtrativoDetalhe.aspx?cod_destino=266&cod_atrativo=4130|accessdate=2016-05-09}}\n*|accessdate=2016-05-09|language=Portuguese\n|title=RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala|publisher=Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation\n|url=http://www.icmbio.gov.br/portal/unidadesdeconservacao/biomas-brasileiros/mata-atlantica/unidades-de-conservacao-mata-atlantica/5409-rppn-feliciano-miguel-abdala}}\n*|title=RPPN Feliciano Miguel Abdala|publisher=Preserve-Muriqui|url=http://www.preservemuriqui.org.br/ing/rppn.htm|accessdate=2016-05-09|archive-date=2020-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117111831/http://www.preservemuriqui.org.br/ing/rppn.htm|url-status=dead}}\n*\n*|language=Portuguese\n|title=Unidade de Conservação: Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Feliciano Miguel Abdala|publisher=MMA: Ministério do Meio Ambiente\n|url=http://sistemas.mma.gov.br/cnuc/index.php?ido=relatorioparametrizado.exibeRelatorio&relatorioPadrao=true&idUc=1254|accessdate=2016-05-09}}"
