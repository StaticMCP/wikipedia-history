Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the C16 class, C representing they had four driving axles, and the 16 the cylinder diameter in inches.\nA third purchased by contractor O’Rourke & McSharry, was purchased for the Central Railway in December 1887. The latter was sent to North Ipswich Railway Workshops in July 1888 for overhaul, but did not return entering service with the Southern & Western Railway. All were reboilered in 1900. They were transferred to the Maryborough / Bundaberg area hauling limestone trains to the Mount Morgan gold mine. All were withdrawn in the 1920s.\nClass list\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Worksnumber\n!Central Railwaynumber\n!Southern & WesternRailway number\n!Queensland Railwaysnumber\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|6112\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|\n|align=center|143\n|December 1882\n|Written off July 1924\n|-\n|align=center|6121\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|\n|align=center|144\n|December 1882\n|Written off March 1925\n|-\n|align=center|7117\n|align=center|46\n|align=center|103\n|align=center|103\n|December 1887\n|Written off October 1922\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
