There is a duty to guarantee that the right to rest is in fact observed. It also declared the 1999 amendment to be contrary to art 17, though the UK government had already backtracked with SI 2006/99 regulation 2.\nSee also\n*UK labour law\n*Working Time Directive\n*Corps of Commissionaires Management Ltd v Hughes [2009] IRLR 122, also on rest\n*Gallagher v Alpha Catering Services Ltd [2005] IRLR 102, Peter Gibson LJ, [50] a rest break must be fixed in advance of its commencement\nNotes"
