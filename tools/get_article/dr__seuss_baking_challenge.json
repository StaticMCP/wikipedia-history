It premiered on Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Freevee on December 13, 2022.\nSummary\nCompeting in teams of two, bakers and cake artists take on a series of culinary challenges inspired by iconic Dr. Seuss stories, such as The Cat in the Hat, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and Horton Hears a Who!. Their creations are judged by pastry chefs Clarice Lam and Joshua John Russell, based on taste, creativity, and storytelling.\nThe first three episodes acted as qualifiers with three teams going head to head to win spots in the next round. After that the show changes to a typical format with all teams competing in every challenge and one team being eliminated every episode. Ultimately in the finale the two remaining teams competed for the $50,000 prize.\nContestants\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Team\n!colspan=\"2\"|Bakers\n!Eliminated\n|-\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#40d73c\"|Green Team\n| Cristina Vazquez\n| Kerrie Breuer\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"lightgreen\"|Winners\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#46bdc6\"|Teal Team\n| Rebecca Reed\n| Ashley Ball\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"lightblue\"|Runner-up\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#b45f06\"|Brown Team\n| Angel Figueroa\n| Maya Hayes\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"#f4c7b8\"|Eliminated in Episode 7\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#aa74c6\"|Purple Team\n| Nikki Jessop\n| Alejandra Galan\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"#f4c7b8\"|Eliminated in Episode 6\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#568fea\"|Blue Team\n| Kyle Smothers\n| Huiwen Lu\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"#f4c7b8\"|Eliminated in Episode 5\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ffdc25\"|Yellow Team\n| Lorenzo Delgado\n| Tareka Lofton\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"#f4c7b8\"|Eliminated in Episode 4\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ff9900\"|Orange Team\n| Chris Cwierz\n| Alene Paulk\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"lightpink\"|Withdrew\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ff3098\"|Pink Team\n| Daniel Santo Edwards\n| Joyce Osorio\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"#f4c7b8\"|Eliminated in Episode 3\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ea4335\"|Red Team\n| Angelo Satterwhite\n| Lily Sanchez\n|style=text-align:center bgcolor=\"#f4c7b8\"|Eliminated in Episode 1\n|}\nProduction\nOn March 17, 2022, it was announced that a Dr. Seuss-themed baking competition series was in development at Amazon Studios, and would also be produced by Dr. Seuss Enterprises and Super Delicious.
