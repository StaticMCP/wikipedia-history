Although it can detect various types of malware, SUPERAntiSpyware is not designed to replace antivirus software.\nDetails\nSUPERAntiSpyware's virus definitions are updated several times a week and generally receive a build update once a month. The company claims that it is specifically designed to be compatible with other security applications, and can, therefore, be used even when other applications are incompatible with other anti-spyware products.\nThe product is available as freeware for personal use with limited functions.\nReception\nIn 2011, SUPERAntiSpyware received a \"DISMAL\" rating from PC Magazine, which complained that it had no real-time protection and the lowest detection rate and lowest score in a malware removal test. Both the freeware and commercial version received a 4 out of 5 star average user rating on CNET's Download.com website.\nAcquisition\nOn 16 July 2011, SUPERAntiSpyware was acquired by Support.com. The transaction was structured as an acquisition of assets with a cash purchase price of $8.5 million. All employees, including the founder, Nick Skrepetos, joined the acquirer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
