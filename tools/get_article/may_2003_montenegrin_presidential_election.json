They were the third such elections in six months, as those held in December 2002 and February 2003 had been declared invalid due to voter turnouts of less than 50%. For the May election, the turnout rule was abolished. The result was a victory for Filip Vujanović, who was nominated by the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro and Social Democratic Party of Montenegro, who received 64.2% of the vote. Vujanović had also won both previous votes by a large margin. The elections were boycotted by the opposition Together for Change coalition.\nResults\nAlthough Dragan Hajduković was a member of the Greens of Montenegro, he ran as an independent.\nReferences"
