As boys they graze sheep and goats in their village, but Ajay dreams of becoming a dentist. His parents (Ramnath and Radha Devi) support their sons, while his elder brother Vijay is a source of strength. Ajay’s ambition takes him away from home to pursue formal education; along the way he meets and falls in love with fellow student Dr Pragati Agarwal. The couple’s romance is tested by poverty and Ajay’s single-minded focus on his studies. Despite setbacks and family obligations, Ajay perseveres—working menial jobs to pay tuition, studying late into the night, and refusing to give up when opportunities seem out of reach. With the encouragement of his brother and Pragati, Ajay eventually graduates from dental school and establishes a practice in Chandigarh, becoming one of the region’s most respected dental surgeons. The film ends with Ajay using his success to give back to his community, highlighting his belief that education and persistence can overcome even the most humble beginnings.\nSoundtrack\nThe Music and background score were composed by Monty Sharma, the first collaboration with Prasidh Eklavya Entertainment. The soundtrack features eight songs with lyrics penned by Dr. Ajay Aryan.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
