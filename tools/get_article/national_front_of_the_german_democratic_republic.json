Although it was presented as a broad alliance, real political authority in the country rested with the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The National Front's primary role was to manage electoral processes through a single list of approved candidates (Einheitsliste) for the Volkskammer. This system was designed to present an appearance of democratic pluralism under a multi-party system.\nThe National Front developed out of the Democratic Bloc, established in 1945. After the Second World War, the Soviet Union permitted the formation of four parties, but in 1946 the Communist Party forced a merger with the Social Democrats to create the SED. Other parties such as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDPD) were gradually brought into line through intimidation and the removal of dissenting leaders. Two additional parties, the Democratic Farmers' Party (DBD) and the National Democratic Party (NDPD), were created in 1948 under SED direction to draw support away from existing parties and incorporate former Nazis. These non-SED parties were called Blockpartei.\nMass organisations such as trade unions and women's groups were also part of the National Front and held seats in the Volkskammer. Many of their representatives were SED members, ensuring continued control. All parties and organisations were required to accept the SED's leading role as a vanguard party, and even regional leaders were subject to SED approval. Although the blockpartei were granted significant resources and governmental representation, all ministers operated under the authority of the SED's Central Committee.\nIn the final months before the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, some blockpartei members began to express limited dissent. The National Front was dissolved in February 1990, ahead of the first free elections in East Germany. After reunification, the blockpartei merged with their West German counterparts: the Liberal Democrats and National Democrats joined the Free Democratic Party (FDP), while the East German CDU and the DBD merged with the West German CDU. These mergers were controversial due to the blockpartei access to well-developed infrastructure and resources under the SED regime, putting them at a great competitive advantage over newly established parties.\nConstituent parties\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Party\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Ideology\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Emblem\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Flag\n!  style=\"width:100px; text-align:center;\"|Foundation\n!  style=\"width:100px; text-align:center;\"|Dissolution\n!  style=\"width:100px; text-align:center;\"|Seats in the Volkskammer (1986)\n|-\n| Socialist Unity PartySED||CommunismStalinism (until 1956)||  || ||  21 April 1946 || 16 December 1989 || 127\n|-\n| Christian Democratic UnionCDU||Christian socialism ||  ||  || 26 June 1945 || 1/2 October 1990 || 52\n|-\n| Liberal Democratic PartyLDPD ||Liberal socialism||  ||  || 5 July 1945|| 27 March 1990 || 52\n|-\n| Democratic Farmers' PartyDBD||Agrarian socialism ||  ||  || 17 June 1948 || 15 September 1990 || 52\n|-\n| National Democratic PartyNDPD ||National liberalismGerman nationalism||  ||  || 5 May 1948 || 27 March 1990 || 52\n|-\n|}\nConstituent mass organizations represented in the People's Chamber\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Organization\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Emblem\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Flag\n!  style=\"width:80px; text-align:center;\"|Foundation\n!  style=\"width:80px; text-align:center;\"|Dissolution\n!  style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"|Assigned representatives in the Volkskammer (1986)\n|-\n| Free German Trade Union FederationFDGB ||  ||  || 1946 || 1990 || 61\n|-\n| Free German YouthFDJ ||  ||  || 1946 || exists today || 37\n|-\n| Democratic Women's League of GermanyDFD ||  ||  || 1947 || 1990 || 32\n|-\n| Cultural Association of the DDRKB ||  ||  || 1945 || 1990 || 21\n|-\n| Peasants Mutual Aid AssociationVdgB ||  ||  || 1945 || 1994 || 14\n|-\n|}\nOther organizations associated with the National Front\nThe following organizations, which were part of the NF, did not send elected representatives to the Volkskammer but were active in the performance of its activities.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Organization\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Emblem\n!  style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"|Foundation\n!  style=\"width:50px; text-align:center;\"|Dissolution\n|-\n| Society for German–Soviet Friendship ||  || 1949 || 1992\n|-\n| People's Solidarity ||  || 1945 || exists today\n|-\n| Sport and Technology Association ||  || 1952 || 1990\n|-\n| German Gymnastics and Sports Federation ||  || 1957 || 1990\n|-\n| Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation ||  || 1948 || 1990\n|-\n| Writers' Association of the GDR ||  || 1945 || 1990\n|-\n| Association of Gardeners, Settlers, and Animal Breeders ||  || 1952 || 1990\n|-\n|  ||  || 1966 || 1990\n|-\n| Union of Journalists ||  || 1945 || 1990\n|-\n|  ||  || 1946 || 1990\n|-\n|  ||  || 1949 || 1990\n|-\n| Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime ||  || 1947 || banned in East Germany in 1953, exists today\n|-\n| Association of German Consumer Cooperatives ||  || 1949 || exists today (Zentralkonsum eG)\n|-\n| German Red Cross of the GDR ||  || 1952 || 1991\n|-\n| Committee of Antifascist Resistance Fighters ||  || 1953 || 1991\n|-\n| Solidarity Committee of the GDR ||  || 1960 || 1990\n|-\n| League of Lusatian Sorbs ||  || 1912founded before the creation of the GDR || exists today\n|-\n|}\nHistory\n, 1953]] The Nationale Front election poster from 1950\nThe National Front was the successor to the Demokratischer Block which had been founded in the Soviet occupation zone. The Front itself was founded on 30 March 1950. It operated through the issuing of a generally consistent proportion of seats (divided between the Front's parties and SED-controlled mass organisations) submitted in the form of a single list of candidates during each election to the People's Chamber.  Seats were awarded on the basis of a set quota rather than vote totals. As voters only had the option of approving or rejecting the list in far-from-secret conditions, it \"won\" with virtually unanimous levels of support.\nAlthough nominally a broad-based coalition of parties, in practice the SED was the only one with any real power. By ensuring that Communists dominated the lists, the SED essentially predetermined the composition of the People's Chamber.\nIn 1950-1951, the public rejection of the validity of the list by some German politicians resulted in some of them being imprisoned for \"rejecting the electoral law of the German Democratic Republic\" (as in the case of LDPD leader Günter Stempel).  Although the SED had already become a full-fledged Stalinist \"party of the new type\" by the formation of the GDR, the other parties did not completely bend to the SED's will for a time.  By the mid-1950s, however, the more courageous members of the constituent parties had been pushed out, and the parties had all been transformed into loyal partners of the SED.  By this time, the SED itself had purged its few independent-minded members as well.  The Front now took on a character similar to other groupings in the Eastern Bloc.  For the next three decades, the minor parties in the Front had to accept the SED's \"leading role\" as a condition of their continued existence.\nOn 1 December 1989, the Front was effectively rendered impotent when the Volkskammer deleted the provision of the Constitution of East Germany  that gave the SED a monopoly of power.   Four days later, the Christian Democratic Union and Liberal Democratic Party, having thrown out their pro-Communist leaderships, withdrew from the Front. On 16 December the SED, having transformed itself into a democratic socialist party, reformed itself into the Party of Democratic Socialism. On 20 February 1990, an amendment to the constitution removed mention of the Front.\nChairmen of the National Front\nThe National Front, as in institution, was led by a National Council that included representatives from all of its constituent organisations, with the SED being over-represented. The National Council elected a Presidium, whose chairman always was an independent politician. Despite the NF's power on paper, the chairman had almost no influence.\n* Prof. Erich Correns (1950–1981)\n* Prof. Lothar Kolditz (1981–1989)\nElectoral history\nVolkskammer elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Government\n|-\n|1950\n|12,088,745\n|99.6%\n|}}\n| 136\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1954\n|11,828,877\n|99.46%\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1958\n|11,689,110\n|99.87%\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1963\n|11,533,859\n|99.25%\n|}}\n| 32\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1967\n|11,197,265\n|99.93%\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1971\n|11,207,388\n|99.5%\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1976\n|11,245,023\n|98.58%\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1981\n|12,235,515\n|99.9%\n|}}\n| 66\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|12,392,094\n|99.94%\n|}}\n|\n| 1st\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Politics of East Germany\n* List of Volkskammer members (9th election period)\n* Vietnamese Fatherland Front\n* Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland\n* Polish Committee of National Liberation/Front of National Unity\n* National Front\n* Fatherland Front\n* People's Democratic Front/Front of Socialist Unity and Democracy\n* Lao Front for National Construction\n* National United Front of Kampuchea\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.paper.olaf-freier.de/blockpt.htm Die Transformation der DDR-Blockparteien während und nach der politischen Wende]"
