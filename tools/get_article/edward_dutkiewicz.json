He held two solo shows at Flowers East gallery in Hackney and later exhibited in Paris, Cologne, Stockholm, and San Francisco. Though he remained relatively unknown, he was regarded as a \"serious\" artist, producing expressionistic paintings and abstract sculptures.\n\"Icarus\" – oil on canvas by Edward Dutkiewicz, approx. 4ft x 6ft\nDutkiewicz received a number of commissions for his work, including from the architect Piers Gough, who placed one of his polished steel sculptures at Camden Lock, and from the Estorick Collection in Islington for a female portrait to be placed in their garden. Several of his works were also installed at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Additionally, Dutkiewicz sold several of his collages through the Paintings in Hospitals charity.\nDutkiewicz battled multiple sclerosis, with which he was diagnosed at the age of 21. By the time he was 40, he was no longer able to exhibit. During the last six months of his life, he was unable to use his hands at all and contemplated suicide. He died in London on 9 December 2007.\nIn an obituary of Dutkiewicz, collector Michael Estorick noted, \"If there are echoes of Alexander Calder and Matisse in his use of bright colour and abstract form, it is also of their playfulness and joy. For sure, no one who has experienced so much pain has also expressed as much fun and the pleasure of simply being alive, or, for that matter, has given so much to those around him.\"\nReferences\n*[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/6291/lang/1 ArtFacts]"
