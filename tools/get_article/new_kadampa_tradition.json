The NKT-IKBU is an international organisation registered in England as a charitable, or non-profit, company. The NKT-IKBU has expanded more rapidly than other Buddhist traditions in Great Britain, and has spread across the globe. It currently lists more than 1,300 affiliated centres in over 25 countries.\nThe NKT-IKBU teaches a form of Gelug Tibetan Buddhism which it says is inspired and guided by \"the ancient Kadampa Buddhist Masters and their teachings\", as presented by its founder, Tibetan-born Kelsang Gyatso. Kelsang Gyatso sought to make Buddhist meditation and teaching more readily accessible to Westerners living in the 21st century. Scholars of Buddhism generally consider the New Kadampa Tradition as outside mainstream Tibetan Buddhism, but its teachings are generally in line with Gelug Buddhism.\nThe New Kadampa Trust has been criticised for its rejection of other Buddhist groups, the exclusivity of its teachings, its worship of Dorje Shugden, and its association with an anti-Dalai Lama protest movement, the International Shugden Community, which is supported by China. Former members and their families have also raised concerns about the group and its practices.\nHistory\n1975–7: Manjushri Institute\nThe NKT can be traced back to its precursor organisation, the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition  (FPMT), then known as the Yeshe Foundation. The Yeshe Foundation was formed following early encounters between Westerners and the Tibetan Gelug teachers Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche in a monastery they founded in 1969 near Kathmandu, Nepal. Their Western following created a network of Buddhist centres and, in 1975, Lama Yeshe founded the Yeshe Foundation to coordinate the groups and promote their purpose of \"preserving the principles and teachings of Mahayana Buddhism\". Its administrative headquarters were, at the time, based in the United States. These centres followed a pattern where, as the centre was established, Lama Zopa would appoint a Tibetan geshe to run it.\nIn September 1975, Peter Kedge and Harvey Horrocks had identified Conishead Priory, a neglected Victorian mansion in Ulverston, as the potential new centre for the Yeshe Foundation in the United Kingdom, and had already selected the name Manjushri Institute for Wisdom Culture. In 1976, the Yeshe Foundation purchased Conishead Priory for £70,000, having successfully fundraised the capital. On 1 July 1976, the Manjushri Institute was legally established as a charitable trust with four trustees: Lama Yeshe, Kedge, Horrocks, and Roy Tyson, with Lama Yeshe as the spiritual director.\nLater that year, Thubten Yeshe, Thubten Zopa Rinpoche and Peter Kedge visited India to invite Kelsang Gyatso, a former classmate of Lama Zopa's, to teach the programme at Manjushri Institute on a three-year contract. In November 1977, Geshe Kelsang arrived at the Manjushri Institute, on a supported visa, as its first resident teacher.\n1978–85: Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition\nIn 1978, Publications for Wisdom Culture moved to the Manjushri Institute. On 24 August, at a formal meeting, the directors changed the name of the Yeshe Foundation, which Lama Yeshe said he did not like, to the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT).\nThe same year, Kelsang Gyatso also established the Madhyamaka Centre in York under his own spiritual direction. While the FPMT aimed to embrace all lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, Kelsang Gyatso believed in a more exclusivist teaching, creating conflict between the FPMT's leadership and Geshe Gyatso, which was deepened by the creation of a new centre distinct from the FPMT. Subsequently, Lama Yeshe sent a letter to Kelsang Gyatso asking him to step down as resident teacher at the Manjushri Institute.\nAround this time, Peter Kedge, the principal officer of FPMT, also left the Manjushri Institute to manage FPMT's business projects in Hong Kong. In 1979, Lama Yeshe asked Geshe Jampa Tekchok to teach a twelve-year Geshe Studies Programme at the Manjushri Institute, modelled on the program of studies for the traditional geshe degree.\nBy 1981, the management committee of Manjushri Institute was made up principally of Kelsang Gyatso's closest students, also known as \"the Priory group\". This group, which had initially been left to its own devices, gradually became dissatisfied with the increasingly centralised nature of the FPMT. According to Kay, Lama Yeshe tried at different times to reassert his authority over the institute, but his attempts were unsuccessful.\nAfter disputes between the FPMT management and the residents of the Manjushri Institute escalated, the FPMT managers asked the Dalai Lama's Office to send mediators to help solve the problem. In October 1985, four new trustees were appointed to the Manjushri Institute: two chosen by FPMT and two by the Manjushri Institute. A new constitution was formulated as a result.\n1987–1990: Retreat\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Kelsang Gyatso engaged in a three-year retreat  in Dumfries, Scotland. Geshe Losang Pende from Ganden Shartse monastery was invited by Kelsang Gyatso to lead the General Programme in his absence.\nDuring the period of retreat, Kelsang Gyatso wrote several books and planned to establish the NKT. According to Kay, Geshe Kelsang's first major development during the retreat was the introduction of the Manjushri Institute's new Teacher Training Programme (TTP).\nIn 1990, Kelsang Gyatso taught in the US, including visiting the centre of Geshe Lhundup Sopa in Madison, Wisconsin. During this time, pictures of the Dalai Lama were also removed from Kelsang Gyatso's centres; NKT says this was to clarify that the Dalai Lama was not a lineage guru of those centres.\n1991–2: Formation of the New Kadampa Tradition\nIn April 1991, Geshe Kelsang announced the formation of the New Kadampa Tradition, an independent organisation, and invited the centres he had established to join. In 1992, a new charitable company, Manjushri Mahayana Buddhist Centre, was incorporated, separate from the FPMT. It later became the Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre. It has remained the NKT's flagship centre since that time. The Manjushri Institute Library, with over 3,000 books, was removed from the site. From this point onwards, only students of Kelsang Gyatso were able to teach at his centres.\nPractices\nScholars of Buddhism such as Robert Bluck, Daniel Cozort, David Kay, and Helen Waterhouse have described the formation of the New Kadampa Tradition as unusual among Tibetan Buddhist groups. Unlike those other organisations, NKT intentionally distinguishes itself from the traditions that preceded it and its contemporaries. It does this while also emphasising the purity of its Tibetan lineage.\nKelsang Gyatso said his aim was to establish an independent movement which directly followed the \"pure\" teachings of Je Tsongkhapa and which focussed exclusively on the translations and commentaries of Geshe Kelsang himself. Waterhouse has described this view as sectarian. According to Kay, the NKT defines itself in this way to show that it is adapted for the needs of Westerners, but also to emphasise that it alone is guardian of \"the pure tradition of Tsongkhapa in the modern world\".\nTibetologist Robert Barnett says the NKT is unusual in its criticism and rejection of mainstream Tibetan Buddhism. Kelsang Gyatso himself severed ties with the Gelug teachers in India and Tibet, establishing himself as the organisation's sole religious authority. In 1996, Kelsang Gyatso was formally expelled by the Sera Je Monastery for his worship of Dorje Shugden and criticism of the Dalai Lama, and had his geshe degree revoked.\nBluck sees an \"apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and complete separation from contemporary Tibetan religion, culture and politics.\" University of Oxford professor Peter Clarke has characterised the NKT-IKBU as a \"controversial Tibetan Buddhist New Religious Movement\", not because of any moral failings but because of the NKT-IKBU's separation from contemporary Tibetan Buddhism. The NKT-IKBU disagrees that there is a contradiction, saying: \"It is possible to be a follower of Je Tsongkhapa's lineage but not a Tibetan Buddhist, just as a child of Russian immigrants to America may consider themselves American but not Russian.\"\nThe NKT's isolation from mainstream Tibetan Buddhism conversely gave a new identity to Kelsang Gyatso's followers, who built many new centres rapidly and were able to distinguish themselves from other traditions, including their more inclusive rivals such as the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (now the Triratna Buddhist Community). Despite its separation from contemporary Tibetan Buddhism, the commitments undertaken by NKT members also include maintaining \"a deep respect\" for all Dharma teachings and other Buddhist traditions. When asked about sectarianism between the Gelugpas and other schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Kelsang Gyatso said that \"the Kagyupas as well as the Nyingmapas and the Sakyapas\" also have \"a complete path to enlightenment\".\nDorje Shugden\nAccording to the NKT, Dorje Shugden worship is \"the very essence of the New Kadampa Tradition\", and the protector is presented as the deity most able to help practitioners. The NTK's The Heart Jewel and Wishfulfilling Jewel sādhanas, as compiled by Kelsang Gyatso, incorporate elements of the Dorje Shugden sādhana. Dorje Shugden may also have influenced Geshe Kelsang's teaching that practitioners cannot mix with other traditions, a view which has been criticised by other Buddhists and led to Kelsang Gyatso's expulsion from Sera Je Monastery and its revocation of his geshe degree. The Western Shugden Society, which received backing from the Chinese government to criticise the Dalai Lama, describes Kelsang Gyatso was the final teacher in the Dorje Shugden spiritual lineage.\nKadampa Buddhism\nAccording to the NKT-IKBU, it is Tibetan in its antecedents, and follows the teachings of the historic \"old\" Kadampa school and the \"New Kadam\" Tradition of Je Tsongkhapa, the latter of which became the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. The NKT consider Kelsang Gyatso the one who \"is primarily responsible for the worldwide revival of Kadampa Buddhism in our time\".\nThe NKT has been criticised for the lack of clarity regarding its lineage, and especially the use of the name Kadampa. Both Buddhists and non-Buddhists have described the NKT as \"a breakaway sect or cult\" of the Gelug school, rather than the older Kadampa tradition of Atisha, as the NKT often suggests. Followers of the NKT refer to themselves as Kadampa Buddhists, the temples of the New Kadampa Tradition are referred to as Kadampa Buddhist Temples, and more recently, NKT teachers are named Kadampa teachers. Additionally, the Dharma centres of the New Kadampa Tradition are called Kadampa Buddhist Centres.\nBluck says there remains an apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and separating completely from contemporary Tibetan tradition. While the NKT strongly emphasises its unbroken \"lineage\" to the Kadampa tradition, it has no Tibetan followers and claims to stand outside current Tibetan Buddhism.\nIn 1998, Kelsang Gyatso stated in an interview:\nTeachers\nJe Tsongkhapa (Tsong-kha-pa), founder of the Gelug school, in the fifth vision of Khedrub Jey (Mkhas-'grub)\nThe NKT-IKBU traces its spiritual lineage from Shakyamuni through Tsongkhapa, Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo, Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, and Kelsang Gyatso. The NKT often compares Kelsang Gyatso to Atisa, as a reformer of Buddhism.\nAs in other Tibetan traditions, the NKT considers Kelsang Gyatso a Buddha or enlightened being. According to Oxford Biographies, Kelsang Gyatso is presented as the third and final Buddha in a sequence beginning with Shakyamuni and Je Tsongkhapa. Dorje Shugden is considered the protector of this lineage. David Kay has criticised the exclusivity of Kelsang Gyato's teachings and his emphasis on the purity of lineage, saying: \"The NKT presented his books as the emanations of the mind of a Buddha.\"\nKelsang Gyatso\nAfter leaving Tibet in 1959, Kelsang Gyatso taught and engaged in retreat in India for 18 years. Trijang Rinpoche, Kelsang Gyatso's root guru, asked him to be the resident teacher at Manjushri Institute (now known as Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre) in England. Kelsang Gyatso taught the General Programme at Manjushri from 1976 to 1987.\nBeginning in 1987, Kelsang Gyatso entered a 3-year retreat at Tharpaland in Dumfries, Scotland. During his retreat, he wrote five books and established the foundations of the NKT-IKBU. He officially launched the NKT in 1991.\nKelsang Gyatso died on 17 September 2022. Ten days after his death, he was cremated at Barrow Crematorium, Cumbria.\nOther teachers\nAlongside Kelsang Gyatso, who as founder and former spiritual director was the main teacher of the NKT-IKBU and his successors, all teachings (i.e. the three study programs) are held by Western students—lay persons and ordained alike. Qualification as an NKT-IKBU Dharma teacher is generally achieved by attending the NKT-IKBU's own Teacher Training Programme, which Kelsang Gyatso regarded as \"a western equivalent to the traditional Tibetan Geshe degree\", although much compressed.\nKelsang Gyatso is one of several prominent Tibetan Buddhist gurus to train Westerners in the Dharma. Kelsang Gyatso explained the importance of Western Dharma teachers to the flourishing of Dharma in the world, saying that one fully qualified teacher is worth a thousand enlightened students. The training programme may include a period of correspondence learning, with an intensive in-person programme each summer at Coniston Priory.\nTraining and leadership roles are offered to lay members as well as ordained members, which Kelsang Gyatso saw as a necessary adaptation from the practices of Tsongkhapa, who restricted tantric teachings to monastics. Kelsang Gyatso said that monks, nuns, and lay people can all become spiritual guides if they have the necessary experience, qualities and training.\nIn addition to the TTP commitment, all Resident Teachers have to attend International Teacher Training Program each year, taught in repeated rotation according to a sixteen-year study scheme. Ordained and lay Resident Teachers who have taught successfully for four years are given the titles 'Gen' and 'Kadam', respectively.\nActivities\nTeachings and books\nThe NKT-IKBU's teachings are written in English and based exclusively on the teachings and published works of Kelsang Gyatso. These are, in turn, translations of and commentaries on Gelug works, especially those of its founder Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe NKT has a Prasangika Madhyamaka philosophical orientation, and emphasises the teachings on dependent arising and emptiness. The main practice in the NKT-IKBU is Lamrim (the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment), Lojong (Training the Mind), and Vajrayana Mahamudra (the practices of Highest Yoga Tantra). The NKT also includes traditional Mahayana Buddhist teachings, including those on karma, rebirth, going for refuge, the Four Noble Truths, the Threefold Training, the six perfections, and developing bodhicitta, in addition to general teachings on meditation and the importance and value human of life.\nAccording to Helen Waterhouse, Kelsang Gyatso followed the Tibetan Buddhist custom of studying texts through the teacher's commentaries and the contents of NKT teachings are \"not different from that of mainline Gelugpa\". She says that where the NKT is unusual is in its assertion that Geshe Kelsang's texts contain \"the whole of what is necessary\" and its emphasis on exclusively following the training and practices set by Geshe Kelsang. This extends to avoiding other traditions, religions, and mind training techniques, and an emphasis on maintaining the \"pure lineage\" of Geshe Kelsang's practices. The NKT also advises members against reading books by other teachers. Waterhouse says that some practitioners find this advice contentious and not all of them follow it. Unlike most mainstream Gelug practices, the NKT encourages the practice of Dorje Shugden, who is often considered a symbol of sectarianism in Tibetan Buddhism.\nStudy programs\nNKT-IKBU offers three study programs: an introductory General Programme, a more advanced Foundation Programme, and a Teacher Training Programme. It is believed by NKT-IKBU followers that the teachings transmit the pure lineage of Je Tsongkhapa in its entirety.\nThe General Program (GP) provides an introduction to basic Buddhist ideas and meditation. Cozort explains that GP classes are \"simply the ongoing general instructure for all comers at NKT Centers or wherever NKT teachers find a venue for teaching.\" The Foundation Program (FP) includes the study of six commentaries written by Kelsang Gyatso on several classical texts. The Teacher Training Program (TTP) is intended for people who wish to train as NKT-IKBU Dharma Teachers who, in turn, will teach Buddhism to newcomers as well as serve as tantric gurus. All resident teachers of NKT-IKBU centres follow this program of study and practice. It involves the study of 14 texts by Kelsang Gyatso, including all of those in the Foundation Program. This program also includes commitments concerning one's lifestyle, based on the five lay vows of the Pratimoksha, and the completion of specific meditation retreats. There is also a \"teaching skills\" class every month.\nReligious practices\nNKT-IKBU meditation practices include traditional Lamrim subjects such as the preciousness of human life, death, rebirth, samsara, kindness, compassion, equanimity, and the role of the guru in Buddhism. Chanted prayers follow a traditional Tibetan format, including going for refuge, generating bodhicitta and the four immeasurables, imagining the Buddhas and bodhisattvas as physically present, asking for and receiving blessings, the transfer of merit, and so on.\nJe Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden practices are also recited daily, alongside a number of other ritual practices, including prayers to Avalokiteshvara, Heruka, Vajrayogini, Tara, Manjushri, Amitayus and the Medicine Buddha. Keslang Gyatso compiles or approves all the sādhanas used by the NKT.\nReligious observances\nFrom its inception, NKT-IKBU Dharma centres followed a common calendar for religious observances, including some of the traditional Buddhist religious days. In 2004, the dates of lunar month observances were changed to the respective days in the common calendar.\nCommon Buddhist celebrations observed by the NKT include monthly celebrations for the Buddha Tara, Je Tsongkhapa, and Eight Mahayana Precepts:\n* Tara Day (8th of each month)\n* Tsog Day (10th and 25th of each month)\n* Precepts Day (15th of each month)\nThe NKT also observes Dorje Shugden practices, used by some forms of Tibetan Buddhism:\n* Protector Day (29th of each month)\nAnnual holidays common to other Buddhist traditions include:\n* Buddha's Enlightenment Day (15 April)\n* Turning the Wheel of Dharma Day (4 June [49 days after Buddha's Enlightenment Day, and also Kelsang Gyatso's birthday])\n* Buddha's Return from Heaven Day (22 September)\n* Je Tsongkhapa Day (25 October)\nAnnual holidays unique to the NKT-IKBU include:\n* NKT Day (the first Saturday in April) which commemorates the founding of the NKT-IKBU\n* International Temples Day (the first Saturday in November) celebrates the building of Kadampa Buddhist Temples around the world\nInternational Buddhist festivals\nThree annual Buddhist NKT Festivals are held each year: (1) The Spring Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (2) The Summer Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (3) The Fall Festival – held at various locations outside the UK. These are taught by the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition, currently Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong.\nOrdination\nThe NKT-IKBU reports that it has over 700 monks and nuns. Ordination ceremonies are usually held twice a year in the main NKT Temple at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Center in Cumbria (UK), Ulverston. To ordain, one must ask Kelsang Gyatso's permission, and also the permission of his or her parents.\nBuddha established both lay and ordained Pratimoksha vows, and established several levels of ordination vows. However, in the NKT-IKBU, Kelsang Gyatso established a simplified alternative tradition of ordination with ten vows that summarise the Vinaya, and a single ordination ceremony.\nThe NKT is unusual in having only 10 ordination vows, which are identical for both nuns and monks:\n# abandon killing\n# abandon stealing\n# abandon sexual activity\n# abandon lying and cheating\n# abandon taking intoxicants\n# practice contentment\n# reduce one's desire for worldly pleasures\n# abandon engaging in meaningless activities\n# maintain the commitments of refuge\n# practise the three trainings of pure moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom\nIn The Ordination Handbook, Kelsang Gyatso described these vows as being easier to integrate into today's society, saying:\nHe also says:\nThe ordination tradition of the NKT-IKBU is based on the Mahayana Perfection of Wisdom Sutras. Kelsang Gyatso says that when a person is first ordained they receive a Rabjung (preliminary) ordination; when their renunciation improves and deepens, their ordination naturally transforms into a Getsul (sramanera) ordination; and when their renunciation becomes \"a spontaneous wish to attain nirvana\", their ordination naturally transforms into a Gelong (bhikkhu) ordination. For this reason, Kelsang Gyatso did not require a separate ritual ordination ceremony.\nMonks and nuns in the NKT-IKBU abandon the physical signs of a lay person by shaving their head and wearing the maroon and yellow robes of an ordained person. They are given a new name which starts with \"Kelsang\", since it is traditional for ordinees to receive part of the ordaining master's name (up until his death, this was Kelsang Gyatso). They also engage in a Sojong ceremony twice a month to purify and restore their vows.\nMonastics who break their ordination vows must leave their Centre for a year, with the exception of attending various bigger courses, Celebrations and Festivals. After that year, \"with some conditions\" they can return but cannot teach or participate in the Teacher Training Program.\nPractitioners who wish to ordain approach their Buddhist teacher when they feel ready, and request formal permission once they have their teacher's consent. They may decide to live in one of the NKT-IKBU's many Buddhist centres, but this is not a requirement. They are, in general, not financially provided for by the NKT-IKBU, and many are encouraged to seek unemployment benefits. If they live in an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, they still have to pay rent for their accommodation and pay for meals and the spiritual programs. To finance this, some have part-time or full-time work. According to Belither, \"a few people are sponsored because of their NKT work but others are on 'extended working visits' or work locally, and some are legitimately on employment benefit.\" When working, they may wear ordinary clothes if more convenient, and typically change out of robes to attend benefits appointments.\nOrganisation\nLeadership\nThe New Kadampa Tradition was founded in 1991, when it separated from the Manjushri Institute, and became a distinct legal entity the following year. Each of the individual centres remained legally and financially independent from the organisation as a whole, but Kelsang Gyatso set the teachings and practices across the organisation as General Spiritual Director.\nFrom 1991 to 1995 Gelong Thubten Gyatso was designated as Kelsang Gyatso's future successor. He disrobed in 1995, and Kelsang Gyatso provisionally appointed four \"Gen-las\": Losang Kelsang, Kelsang Jangsem, Kelsang Dekyong and Samden Gyatso.\nIn August 2001, Kelsang Gyato established a system of democratic succession for the General Spiritual Director of the NKT- IKBU, with each term of office limited to four years. In February 2007, Samden Gyatso resigned as Deputy Spiritual Director. In 2008, Gen-la Khyenrab became Acting General Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision and, when Kelsang Gyatso retired, assumed the post of General Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four-year term. Gen-la Dekyong, the National Spiritual Director of the United States of America, additionally assumed the post of Deputy Spiritual Director.\nThe Internal Rules\nThe governing document for the NKT is called A Moral Discipline Guide—The Internal Rules of the New Kadampa Tradition ~ International Kadampa Buddhist Union. Section 1 of The Internal Rules is a legally binding document, approved by the UK Charity Commission in 2020. The Internal Rules define the NKT-IKBU as the coalition of international study and meditation centres that follow Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's \"pure tradition\", his three study programmes, and The Internal Rules themselves.\nDharma centres\nThe NKT-IKBU currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in 40 countries, and reports having an estimated 8,000 members. Each centre is an independent charitable corporation; smaller groups branch off the centres and meet weekly in places such as churches and community centres. New Dharma centres are expected to be self-supporting, as neither Kelsang Gyatso nor the NKT-IKBU owns the centres.\nA Kadampa Meditation Centre (KMC) serves the local, national, and international communities, and is generally more centrally organised than regular Kadampa Buddhist centres. Besides having a program of courses for the local community, KMCs host major gatherings such as dharma celebrations, national festivals, and international festivals. They are also home to the International Kadampa Temples. KMCs are non-profit organisations and all their annual profits are donated to the International Temples Project. There are currently 18 KMCs around the world, with several in the US.\nThe NKT-IKBU has also established a Kadampa Buddhist Temple in the United Kingdom, as well as in New York, Arizona, Brazil, Portugal, and Spain.\nReception\nNew Kadampa Survivors\nA group of former members have criticised the New Kadampa Tradition for its exclusivism, alleged incidents of abuse and exploitation, and demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban on Dorje Shugden practice. Buddhists, family members and charities have also raised concerns about the New Kadampa Tradition's practices and community centres. Suzanne Newcombe, honorary director of the charity Inform, says NKT is one of the \"most inquired-about groups\" which has \"raised a lot of concerns in Britain and gained international attention\". She said that when she had asked to discuss former members' concerns with the NKT, it was not \"really interested in constructively engaging in a dialogue\". In response, the NKT told the BBC that its centres \"offer everyone within their communities full support with their problems, within the scope of the charity's objectives\".\nDorje Shugden activism\nThe New Kadampa Tradition has been criticised for its involvement with the International Shugden Community and, as a consequence, what David Kay calls its \"leading role in a Western-based campaign mounted against the Dalai Lama\" during his visit to the United Kingdom in 1996. Geshe Kelsang—who is often credited with popularising Dorje Shugden worship to the West—and the NKT objected to the Dalai Lama's advice that Buddhists should not worship Dorje Shugden, a Gelug Dharmapala (protector deity) dating to the 17th century, whose worship became more prominent in the 1930s under the repressive regime of Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo.\nDorje Shugden is often worshipped as a violent protector, particularly against other traditions, and it was a key tool in Pabongkhapa Rinpoche's persecution of the flourishing Rimé movement, his attempt to forcibly convert Nyingma Buddhists, and his destruction of artefacts associated with Padmasambhava. It is therefore associated with repressive Gelug rule among many Tibetans.\nDorje Shugden worship was especially popular under the Third Trijang Rinpoche, Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso, an ardent advocate for Dorje Shugden for the protector. Both the Dalai Lama and Kelsang Gyatso studied under Trijang Rinpoche, and the Dalai Lama practised Dorje Shugden worship before he fled Tibet in 1959. In the 1970s, after learning about the history of repression and sectarianism attached to Dorje Shugden, the Dalai Lama rejected these practices, and advised other Tibetan Buddhists to do the same, but Kelsang Gyatso objected to this stance. At odds with most scholars, Kelsang Gyatso also considers Dorje Shugden an enlightened being. Dreyfus says the view that Shugden is enlightened exists only amongst the \"most extreme followers of Shukden\", and Kay suggests this viewpoint is unique to the New Kadampa Tradition.\nIn response to the Dalai Lama's pronouncements, the NKT protested alongside the Shugden Supporters Community (which later became the International Shugden Community), who coordinated protests across Europe that accused the Dalai Lama of religious repression. The NKT was often portrayed by the media as a front for the SSC/ISC, which the NKT strongly denied, although most Western SSC/ISC members were also members of the NKT. In 1996, Kelsang Gyatso was formally formally expelled from the Sera Je Monastery and his geshe degree voided as a result of his support for Dorje Shugden and criticism of the Dalai Lama.\nAt the height of the protests, on 4 February 1997, Lobsang Gyatso, the principal of the Buddhist School of Dialectics and a critic of Dorje Shugden worship, and two of his students were murdered in Dharmasala; Interpol said the murderers were former monastics and members of the SSC. In response, Kelsang Gyatso denied the involvement of any NKT members. He formally withdrew the NKT from the protests in 1998, although NKT members continued to be involved in the ISC.\nIn 2015, before the ISC disbanded, Reuters reported that most of its Western members were NKT members who said they were not acting on behalf of the NKT. The Reuters investigation also found members of the ISC had received support and encouragement from the Chinese government, including several monks from the Tibetan diaspora who were associated with Shugden worship. Later, Professor Robert Barnett told The Observer that no such evidence existed to implicate protestors in the UK, although he criticised the UK protestors for using practices and methods that paralleled those used by the Chinese authorities.\nRecruitment\nScholars have said that the NKT's use of publicity is unusual among Buddhist groups. Ken Jones says the NKT is comparatively more \"forceful and extroverted\" than other Buddhist groups, and this has helped it recruit new members. One factor in recruitment, according to Helen Waterhouse, is that an NKT-IKBU centre often hosts activities every day, in contrast to other groups \"which meet on a weekly basis but provide little other support or activity\".\nDavid Kay says that the NKT-IKBU is sensitive to criticism on the subject of expansion. Robert Bluck attributes NKT-IKBU's rapid growth to \"a wish to share the Dharma rather than 'conversion and empire-building'\".\nSee also\n*Heruka Kadampa Meditation Centre\n*New religious movement\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n* }}\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*"
