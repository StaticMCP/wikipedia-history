It is named for Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, who had been Prime Minister of the UK from 1765 to 1766. The county was organized in 1771, with its county seat at Exeter. In 1823, certain townships from northwestern Rockingham (and some northern townships from Hillsborough County) became part of the formation of Merrimack County. In 1844, its area was further reduced by the formation of Belknap County to the northwest. In 1997, the county court facilities were moved to Brentwood, a rural town adjacent to Exeter.\nGeography\nThe county occupies the southeastern corner of the state of New Hampshire, and it contains the state's easternmost point.
