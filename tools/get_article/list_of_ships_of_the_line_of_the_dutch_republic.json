      "text": "# List of ships of the line of the Dutch Republic\n\nThis is a list of Dutch (the United Provinces of the Netherlands) ships of the line, or sailing warships which formed the Dutch battlefleet. It covers ships built from about 1623 (there are few reliable records of individual earlier warships) until the creation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in March 1815, including the period of the French-controlled Batavian Republic, nominal Kingdom of Holland and direct French annexation between 1795 and 1813. It excludes frigates and lesser warships.\nThe Dutch were often handicapped by the smaller size of their ships relative to the vessels of other nations, particularly those of England and France. This was partly due to the shallow home waters of the Netherlands, which limited the maximum draft with which ships could operate.  Consequently, the Dutch did not build large three-deckers such as were found in the navies of England and France, except for a brief period from 1682 to 1695 (and a very few much later on during the Napoleonic era). However, during the period up to 1650 the Dutch made up in sheer quantity of ships for what they lacked in terms of the size of vessels; the list below is incomplete and does not include some of the many hundreds of Dutch warships belonging to the United Provinces between 1579 (when the Netherlands effectively became independent from Spanish control) and 1795 (in which latter year the French invaded and established the puppet state of the Batavian Republic).\nThe Five Admiralties\nAdministratively and politically, until 1795 there was not a single Dutch Navy but five distinct Admiralties. In the south was the Admiralty of Zeeland covering the Province of Zeeland (indicated by \"(Z)\" preceding a ship's name in the list below). Next were three covering the Province of Holland - the Admiralty of the Maas (or \"Maze\") in the south of Holland, centred on Rotterdam (indicated by \"(M)\"), the Admiralty of Amsterdam in the centre of the Province (indicated by \"(A)\"), and the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier in the north of Holland (indicated by \"(N)\"). The fifth was the Admiralty of Friesland covering the Province of Friesland (indicated by \"(F)\"), albeit with fewer ships than the other four Admiralties. Each Dutch warship belonged exclusively to one or other of the five Admiralties, although in the 17th century the Dutch fleet included many ships of mercantile ownership, particularly those belonging to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The names of Dutch warships were often common to several Admiralties, so that there were vessels bearing the same name in different Admiralties at the same time.\nArmament was often changed, so the number of guns mounted in any ship frequently varied from year to year. During the 1650 - 1680 period, many Dutch ships of the line were \"up-gunned\", ending with significantly more guns (or guns of larger calibres) than when they first came into service.\nThe Dutch Rating System\nPrior to 1632, the Dutch did not have a system of categorising vessels beyond a simple functional division into \"ships\", \"frigates\" and lesser ship-rigged \"three-mast yachts\". On 11 March 1632, the Dutch government approved three standard designs (which they termed \"charters\") to which all new warships should be built. These set the requirement for low-built ships without castles, an uninterrupted deck, slim hulls and light construction; the three designs were of 100 (Amsterdam) feet, 120 feet and 128 feet length (measured on the uppermost continuous deck) respectively, and future charter divisions retained this classification by length rather than by tonnage or number of guns (as used by England and France). However, later in the 17th century, the Dutch moved towards using a Rating system similar (but not identical) to the English or French system, while retaining the terminology of \"Charters\" well into the 18th century. To provide flagships for the battlefleet, two two-decked ships were built in this period, both at Rotterdam for the Admiralty of the Maas - the Aemilia of 1632 and the Brederode of 1644; each was 144 (Amsterdam) feet in length and 35 feet in breadth.\nThe system coincided with the English categories of 1st to 4th Rates, i.e. they comprised the battlefleet units. In 1652 the Dutch - under pressure from their naval commander Maarten Tromp to build larger ships to combat the English - revised this rating system which was still based on a series of Charters, initially grading the battlefleet units by length of ship with classes of 130 (Amsterdam) feet, 136 feet and 140 feet; this was at a time when the largest ship in the Dutch navies measured 134 feet in length.  Subsequently, having won the Battle of Dungeness in November 1652, Tromp persuaded the Staten-Generaal to add a further class of 150 feet ships as the \"1st Charter\", although only two of this length were built initially - the Eendracht and Groot Hollandia, both launched at Rotterdam for the Admiralty of the Maas in 1653 and 1654 respectively with 58 guns each.\nBetween 1652 and 1680 the \"Charters\" underwent drastic revision, but it was still more appropriate to classify ships of the line during this era by their (gundeck) length than by the number of guns carried. The lengths remained the basis of the Charters. By 1680, following the end of the later Anglo-Dutch Wars, the Staten-Generaal divided the warships of the five Admiralties into eight charters''. The first four charters comprised the battlefleet, while the next three (5th to 7th Charters) covered frigates down to 20 guns, and the 8th Charter included smaller cruising warships.\nThe 1st Charter comprised the largest two-deckers before 1680, together with 'partial' three-deckers (i.e. ships with only a partial battery on the third deck, without any guns in the waist), then subsequently covered the full three-deckers (for which see note below). These were ships carrying more than 70 guns, although this had risen to about 80 guns by 1670 and by 1680 to encompass ships of 90 guns or more. They generally (but not always) carried a mix of 36-pounder and 24-pounder guns on their primary (lower) gun deck, with lighter cannon (18-pounders and 12-pounders) on the upper deck and 6-pounders on their quarterdecks.\nThe other battlefleet Charters were all two-decked warships. By the 1670s the 2nd Charter were all two-decker warships with a number of guns initially around 60 to 74, although by 1680 the 60-gun and 64-gun ships had been relegated to the 3rd Charter. They usually carried 18-pounders (or a mixture of 24-pounders and 18-pounders) on the lower deck. The 3rd and 4th Charter ships usually carried 18-pounders or 12-pounders as their main battery.  The 4th Charter ships by 1680 carried between 44 and 56 guns; by 1714 a minimum of 50 guns applied.\nDimensions\nAll lengths quoted in this article are measured in Amsterdam feet, taken as the length of the uppermost continuous deck from stem to stern. The Amsterdam foot (Amsterdamse voet) was equivalent to 28.3133 cm, and thus equated to 0.9289 of an English foot, a factor to bear in mind in any comparisons. It was divided into eleven inches (Amsterdamse duim) equal to 2.57393 cm, compared with 2.54 cm for an English inch. Thus 150 Amsterdam feet equated to 139&nbsp;ft 4 inches in English measurement. The Rotterdam foot was considerably longer - 31.39 cm (equal to almost 1.03 English feet) - and was divided into twelve inches, each of 2.615 cm. However in 1653 all the Admiralties adopted the Amsterdam foot, and this has been employed throughout this article except where otherwise stated.\nTons\nThe system of weights was similarly united in the Netherlands, with the Amsterdam pound (pond) equal to 494.1 grams, compared with the English pound of 453.6 grams. Thus the Amsterdam pound (in which all ordnance calibres are quoted below) was 8.93% greater than the English pound (e.g the Dutch \"24-pounder\" was equivalent to 26 lb 2.3 oz.\nThree-deckers\nMost of the Dutch ships of the line, for reasons given above, were built with two decks of guns. However, in the 1660s four ships of the Amsterdam Admiralty were built which were structurally three-deckers (the Spiegel of 1663, followed by the Gouden Leeuw, Witte Olifant and Dolphijn of 1666), but these had only partially armed upper decks, with guns mounted forwards and aft (under the quarterdeck) but not in the waist at this level. From 1682 twenty complete three-deckers were built, the last in 1721; these comprised the 1st Charter issued on 15 February 1680, and provided for these to have dimensions of 170 (Amsterdam) feet on the gundeck (146 ft 3 in on the keel) x 43 feet x 16 ft. After these twenty, no further 1st Charter ships were built by the Netherlands.\nShips of the \"Old Navy\" (1579 to 1648)\nThis is the period during which the Dutch provinces consolidated their independence from Spanish rule, forming the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and took part in the Eighty Years' War. Almost all of these ships were relatively small, with only a single gun deck, and were owned by the five Admiralties. The majority were between 120 and 130 feet in length as measured on the upper deck, the exceptions being the fleet flagships built in 1632 and 1644, which are separately listed below; the warships built for the Admiralties were supplemented frequently by ships hired from the VOC (East India Company, established 1602), WIC (West India Company, established 1621) or other mercantile source (this was particularly true in 1652, at the outbreak of the 1st Anglo-Dutch War), but only a few of these are mentioned.\nFleet flagships\nThe Aemilia and Brederode, although entering service 12 years apart, had identical dimensions of 144&nbsp;ft x 35&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in x 14&nbsp;ft 2 in, in Amsterdam feet (equating to 132&nbsp;ft x 32&nbsp;ft x 13&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in in Rotterdam feet). Both were built for the Maas Admiralty in the naval shipyard at Rotterdam by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel. Each was a two-decked ship, with 13 pairs of gunports on the lower tier in Aemilia and 12 pairs in Brederode. Although no dimensions are known for the Maagd van Dordrecht, she was quoted as being 300 lasts (the same as Aemilia) so was probably of similar size.\n* (M) Aemilia. 46 guns (built 1632, 300 lasts). Carried (in 1642) 4 × 36-pdrs; 11 × 24-pdrs; 33 × 12-pdrs; 9 × 6-pdrs; crewed (1635) by 160 sailors and 30 soldiers. She served as Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Harpertszoon Tromp's flagship at the Battle of the Downs in 1639 (by then with 57 guns); sold to France 1643 as a privateer, captured by Spain and broken up 1647.\n* (M) Maagd van Dordrecht. 42 guns (built 1632, 300 lasts). Carried (in 1642) 10 × 24-pdrs; 14 × 18-pdrs; 16 × 12-pdrs; 6 × 6-pdrs; crewed by 140 sailors and 30 soldiers. She was flagship of Vice-Adm Witte Corneliszoon de With from 1639 to 1643, but not subsequently mentioned.\n* (M) Brederode. 49 guns (built 1644). Carried (in 1652) 4 × 36-pdrs; 12 × 24-pdrs; 8 × 18-pdrs; 20 × 12-pdrs; 10 × 6-pdrs; crewed by 175 sailors and 75 soldiers. Up-gunned to 54 guns, she served as the fleet flagship for most of the First Anglo-Dutch War (under Maarten Tromp from 1652 to 1653, and Witte de With for rest of career until 1658); captured and sunk in the Battle of the Sound on 8 November 1658.\nShips of between 120 and 130 feet\n* (N) Eenhoorn (or Witte Eenhoorn). 34 guns (built 1623, measuring 125 × 29 × 11ft, 200 lasts) - 1655\n* (N) Stad Medemblik. 26 guns (built 1625, 120 × 27 × 11&nbsp;ft) – sunk at the Battle of the Gabbard in June 1653.\n* (Z) Middelburg. 30 guns (1632, 125 ft)\n* (A) Utrecht. 32 guns (1633) – Blew up on 28 September 1648\n* (M) Gelderland. 40 guns (1634, 128 ft) – 1659\n* (A) Frederik Hendrik. 36 guns (1636)\n* (A) Zutphen. 30 guns (1636, 125 ft)\n* (A) Bommel. 30 guns (1637, 120 ft) – broken up in 1655\n* (F) Breda. 28 guns (1637 purchase from VOC, 120 ft) – captured by Sweden in the Battle of the Sound in 1658\n* (N) Eendracht. 42 guns (1639, 130 ft) – sunk in action 1676\n* (A) Zon (or Vergulde Zon). 40 guns (1640, 124 ft)\n* (A) Edam. 38 guns (1641, 124 ft) – captured by English Navy on 4 June 1669, becoming HMS Black Bull\n* (A) Groningen. 40 guns (1641, 125 ft)\n* (A) Goes (or Ter Goes). 40 guns (1641, 124 × 30 × 11&nbsp;ft)\n* (A) Graaf Willem. 40 guns (1641, 125 ft) – captured by England at the Battle of the Gabbard, 1653\n* (N) Prinses Roijaal. 40 guns (built 1641, measuring 125 × 30 × 11ft)\n* (R) Prinses Roijaal Maria. 36 guns (built 1643, measuring 124&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in x 29&nbsp;ft 5&nbsp;in x 13&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;in)  – captured by England in June 1652, renamed Princess Maria\n* (A) Gewapende Ruyter (captured French Villeroi). 36 guns (1650) – Captured by England 1652\n* (A) Maan. 40 guns (built 1643, measuring 125 × 31 × 12&nbsp;ft) – broken up 1656\n* (A) Verenigde Provinciën (or Zeven Provinciën). 40 guns (1643, 128 ft) – broken up 1665\n* (A) Zeelandia. 34 guns (1643, 120 × 29 x 11 ft) - sunk in action 12 December 1677\n* (Z) Vlissingen. 32 guns (1643, 130 ft)\n* (A) Haarlem. 40 guns (1644, 128 ft) – broken up 1667\n* (A) Leeuwarden. 34 guns (built 1645, measuring 121 × 30 × 12 ft) - hired to Venice 1655\n* (M) Prinses Louijsa. 36 guns (built 1647, measuring 120&nbsp;ft x 28&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in x 12&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in)\nShips of the \"New Navy\" (1650 to 1682)\nThis is the period during which the United Provinces fought three Anglo-Dutch Wars – conflicts of 1652-1656, 1665-1667 and 1672-1674; although England withdrew from this contest in 1674, the Dutch remained at war against the French until 1678. The Charter (rating) system was introduced in 1652 - initially defined by ships' lengths - but was radically revised during this era (see notes above).\nAt the start of the 1st Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch navies relied heavily on hired ships to expand their fleet, but a programme to build thirty new ships of the line was promptly started. This comprised a flagship of 150 (Amsterdam) feet in length (the Eendracht of 1653), and twenty-nine other ships of 130 feet or more. It was followed within a year by a second thirty-ship programme, again consisting of a flagship of 150 (Amsterdam) feet in length (the Groot Hollandia of 1654), and twenty-nine other ships of 130 feet or more.\n1st Charter\nThe first two of these were launched for the Maas Admiralty in 1653 and 1654. While structurally three-deckers, on these two ships the upper deck was only armed forward (under the forecastle) and aft (under the quarterdeck), with no guns in the waist (this system was also common to other navies in the mid 17th century). Each measured 150 × 38 × 15 Amsterdam feet, and was initially armed with 58 guns. The first ship was originally intended to be named Prins Willem, but Willem himself ruled that it should bear the name Eendracht (\"Concord\") to honour the relationship between the seven provinces which constituted the United Netherlands.\n* (M) Eendracht 58 guns originally, 72 by 1665 (1653). Designed by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel, built at Dordrecht - sunk (by magazine explosion) at Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665\n* (M) Groot Hollandia (or simply Holland) 58 guns originally (1654). Designed by Jan Salomonszoon van den Tempel, built at Dordrecht - sold in 1687\nOther ships of 130 feet or more\nBuilt 1648-1652\n* (A) Jaarsveld. 44 guns (1648), 130 ft x 32 ft x 13 ft – flagship of Johan van Galen at the Battle of Montecristo (September 1652); wrecked 9 February 1653 on a rock when leaving Livorno.\n* (A) Vrede. 44 guns (1650) 131 ft x 32 ft x 13 ft - the precursor of the numerous 130-ft ships built in the First Anglo-Dutch War building programme; she took part in the Battles of Dover (June 1652), Dungeness (Dec 1652), Portland (Feb/March 1653) and the Gabbard (June 1653), all under Gideon de Wildt; later she took part in the Battle of Lowestoft (May 1665) under Hendrik  Gotskens, and was broken up 1667.\n* (A) Vrijheid. 46 guns (1651), 134 ft x 34 ft x 13.25 ft – the largest ship built for the Admiralty of Amsterdam since the early part of the 17th Century. she took part in the Battle of Portland (Feb/March 1653) and was Vice-Adm Witte de With's flagship in the Battle of Scheveningen (Aug 1653); she blew up and sank in action at the Battle of Palermo on 2 June 1676.\n* (A) Huis van Nassau. 36 guns (1651). Formerly the Portuguese Sao Bartholemeu, captured in 1651. Sold 18 August 1651.\n* (F) Groenwald. 44 guns (1652), 132 ft x 31 ft. Deleted 1655.\nThe 1653 Programme\nThe Dutch had learnt by late 1652, following their defeats in the first year of the Anglo-Dutch War, that a haphazard collection of warships and armed merchantmen could not prevail against a professional naval force. In October 1652 discussions began with a view to producing specially designed warships. In February 1653 the States-General authorised the building of thirty new warships, financed by two million guilders. Tromp's plea that these should all be as big as or bigger than the equivalent English ships was ignored, but the programme was completed in 1653, comprising the flagship Eendracht (1st Charter, 150&nbsp;ft in length) and 29 lesser ships.\n* (M) Prins Hendrik 44 guns (130 ft). Built by Jacon Hermanszoon Wittert. Last mention in 1656 for expedition to Danzig, under command of Aert van Nes.\n* (M) Utrecht (130 ft)\n* (F) Prinses Albertina (130 ft)\n* (F) Westergo (134 ft)\n* (F) Oostergo (140 ft)\n* (F) Stad en Lande (134 ft)\n* (F) Elf Steden (130 ft)\n* (N) Wapen van Holland 50 guns (134 ft)\n* (N) Jozua 50 guns (136 ft)\n* Seven ships were built for the Admiralty of Zeeland, two each in Middelburg, Veere and Zaandam, and one in Vlissingen.\n** (Z) Dordrecht. 46 guns (Middelburg, 1653) 130 ft x 34 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1673.\n** (Z) Middelburg. 46 guns (Middelburg, 1653) 130 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1693.\n** (Z) Veere (also called Ter Veere, or Wapen van Ter Veere, or Kampveere). 44 guns (Veere, 1653) 130 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Captured by the English in 1673, and renamed Arms of Terver.\n** (Z) Vlissingen. 44 guns (Vlissingen, 1653) 130 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1674.\n** (Z) Zeelandia (also called Hof van Zeeland, or Groot Zeelandia). ? guns (Veere, 1653) 136 ft x 34 ft x 13 ft. Burnt in action 1666.\n** (Z) Zierikzee (also called Wapen van Zierikzee). 40 guns (Zaandam, 1653) 130 ft x 31 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1674.\n** (Z) Utrecht. ? guns (Zaandam, 1653) 134 ft x 33 ft x 13 ft. Not mentioned after 1673.\n* Ten ships were built for the Admiralty of Amsterdam, all in that port.\n** (A) Amsterdam. (140 ft)\n** (A) Burcht van Leiden. (132 ft)\n** (A) Landman. (130 ft)\n** (A) Maarseveen (or Huis te Maarseveen) (130 ft)\n** (A) Oosterwijk (or Huis te Oosterwijk) (140 ft)\n** (A) Stad en Lande (130 ft)\n** (A) Stavoren. (130 ft)\n** (A) Zuiderhuis.

(130 ft)\n* (A) Huis te Kruiningen (140 ft) – originally ordered for Genoa, and purchased by the Amsterdam Admiralty on the stocks.\n* (A) Huis te Zwieten (146 ft) – originally ordered for Genoa, and purchased by the Amsterdam Admiralty on the stocks. Given to the VOC, rearmed with 70 guns, captured by England at the Battle of Lowestoft, 1665\nArmaments were significantly increased over the lifetimes of these ships. As an example, the Zeeland ships of 130 (Amsterdam) feet in length were designed to each carry 44 guns - comprising four bronze 24-pounders, ten iron 18-pounders and four bronze 12-pounder on the lower deck; eight iron 12-pounders and ten iron 8-pounders on the upper deck; and eight bronze 6-pounders on the quarterdeck; but all ended up carrying a heavier armament or up to 50 guns or even more.\nThe 1654 Programme\nA second set of thirty warships was ordered in 1653 by the States-General, again comprising a flagship (the Groot Hollandia, similar to the Eendracht) and 29 smaller ships. In January 1654 the States-General decreed that, since it  - rather than the provincial Admiralties - had financed these programmes, all sixty ships would be considered national property, so that the Admiralties were unable to sell them off at the conclusion of hostilities, as had been the practice in the past.\n* (M) Prins Willem 44 guns (134 ft)\n* (A) Doesburg (130 ft)\n* (A) Duivervoorde (130 ft)\n* (M) Klein Hollandia 52 guns (134 ft) - sunk in action 1672, defending the Smyrna convoy\n* (A) Prins te Paard (136 ft)\n* (A) Gouden Leeuw (134 ft)\n* (N) Alkmaar (or Burgh van Alkmaar) 32 guns (130 ft)\n* (N) Caleb 42 guns (132 ft)\n* (N) Hollandsche Tuin 56 guns (134 ft)\n* (N) Gelderland (136 ft)\n* (N) Wapen van Nassau (134 ft) – (also called Gouden Leeuw)\n* (N) Drie Helden Davids (130 ft)\n* (F) Omlandia (130 ft)\n* (A) Dom van Utrecht (130 ft)\n* (A) Tromp (130 ft)\n* (A) Tijdverdrijf (136 ft)\n* (A) Stad Gouda (130 ft)\n* (M) Gelderland (134 ft) – later renamed Prins Mauritz\n* (A) Raadhuis van Haarlem (130 ft)\nOther ships of the line (less than 130 ft)\nNote that this list is incomplete and will be extended.\n* (N) Jupiter (128 ft)\n* (F) Klein Frisia (120 ft)\n* (M) Prins Maurits (ex-Gelderland) 39 guns (119 ft).

Sunk at the Battle of Scheveningen, 1653\n* Louisa Hendrika 45 – East Indiaman, served as warship\n* Vogelstruis 40 guns (1652, 160 ft) – East Indiaman, hired about July 1652\n* Witte Lam 28 (1652, 127 ft) – East Indiaman, hired in March 1652, but discarded by December.\n* Groote Liefde 38 (1652, 132 ft) – East Indiaman, hired in March 1652. Captured by England at Battle of Portland in 1653, renamed Great Charity; retaken by the Dutch at Battle of Lowestoft in 1665.\nBuilt 1660 to 1680\nWith the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the Staten-Generaal ordered the construction of twenty-four large ships, with a second group of twenty-four being added soon after. This programme, which was all built in the period 1664 to 1667, included ten ships of 160 (Amsterdam) feet length or more, now forming the 1st Charter.\n1st Charter\n* (A) Hollandia'' 82 guns (1665, 165 ft) - Cornelis Tromp's flagship at the St James Day Battle, sold to be broken up in 1694\n* (M) Zeven Provinciën 80 guns (1665, 163 ft) - Michiel de Ruyter's flagship at the St James Day Battle, broken up 1694\n* (N) Pacificatie 80 (1665, 160 ft) - Volckert Schram's flagship at the St James Day Battle\n* (M) Eendracht 76-80 (1666, 160 ft) - Aert van Nes's flagship at the St James Day Battle\n* (N) Westfriesland 78 (1666, 160 ft)- Jan Meppel's flagship at the St James Day Battle\n* (A) Gouden Leeuw 80 (1666, 170 ft) - Cornelis Tromp's flagship at the Battle of Texel\n* (A) Olifant (or Witte Oliphant) 80 (1666, 171 ft)\n* (A) Dolphijn 84 (1667, 171 ft)\n* (M) Voorzichtigheid 80-84 (1667, 165 ft) - renamed (rebuilt?)

This period continues until the French occupation of December 1794 to February 1795, following which the five separate Admiralties were replaced on 27 February 1795 by a single committee dealing with all navy affairs. The list below is continued beyond 1795 to include other ships originally ordered for the United Netherlands but subsequently brought into service for the (French dominated) Batavian Republic.\n2nd Charter\nThe ships of the 2nd Charter each carried 74 guns. In general, they measured 179 (Amsterdam) feet on the upper deck (equivalent to 166&nbsp;ft on the upper deck (equivalent to 166&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in in British units of measurement), with a breadth of 49 Amsterdam feet (45 British feet) and a depth in hold of 20 Amsterdam feet (18 British feet).\n* (A) Neptunus 74 guns (1782) - condemned 1794\n* (A) Jupiter 74 guns (1782) - captured by the British at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797 and became HMS Camperdown\n* (F) Stad en Lande 74 guns (1782) - broken up 1792\n* (F) Friesland 74 guns (1783) - broken up 1792\n* (N) Zeven Provinciën 74 guns (1783) - sold to be broken up 1794\n* (A) Vrijheid 74 guns (1783) - captured by the British at the Battle of Camperdown on 11 October 1797\n* (A) Prins Maurits 74 guns (1783) - captured in 1797\n* (M) Willem de Eerste 74 guns (1785) - renamed Brutus in 1795 by the Batavian Republic, then Noord Brabant in 1806 under French control; sold to be broken up in 1820\n* (M) Staaten Generaal 74 guns (1788) - renamed Bato in 1798 by the Batavian Republic - run ashore and burnt at Simon's Bay on 10 January 1806 to avoid capture by the British\nNote a further 74-gun ship begun at Amsterdam in 1795 (and thus not for the pre-1795 United Provinces) was launched on 9 August 1796 for the Batavian Republic as Washington – captured by the British in the Vlieter (off Texel) on 28 August 1799 and became HMS Princess of Orange.\n3rd Charter\nThe ships of the 3rd Charter each carried between 64 and 68 guns.

They were the largest sailing warships built in the Netherlands up to that time. The five Amsterdam-built ships (by master shipwrights R. Dorsman and P. Schuijt Jnr.) had ports for 80 guns, with 30 on the lower deck, 30 on the upper deck and 20 on the quarterdeck and forecastle - they actually mounted (in French service) twenty-eight 36-livre guns, thirty 30-livre guns, fourteen 12-livre guns, two 60-livre and six 30-livre carronades. The three Rotterdam-built ships (by master shipwright Pieter Glavimans Jnr., who probably produced the overall design for the class) were initially assigned 10 more ports on the quarterdeck and forecastle (with 10 guns behind ports and 20 in the open), causing them to be rated as 90-gun ships.\nThe class measured 195 (Amsterdam) feet in length, 51 feet in breadth, and 22 feet in depth in hold.\nAll eight ships were incorporated into the French Imperial Navy on 9 July 1810, and received French names. All were rated as 80-gun ships by the French, armed as mentioned above. All were returned to Dutch service and renamed in 1814, except for the Admiraal Piet Hein (ii) which had been re-worked as a 74-gun ship on the stocks at Rotterdam and was seized by the Dutch in their December 1813 uprising.\n* Wrecker (Amsterdam, launched 28 July 1798).

Wrecked in Algoa Bay, South Africa on 11 December 1817.\n* Admiraal de Ruyter (ii) (Amsterdam, launched 9 November 1808). In July 1810 renamed Amiral de Ruyter, then De Ruyter in April 1811, reverting to Dutch control as Admiraal de Ruyter on 22 April 1814.

However, on 14 February 1811 Napoleon had ordered her to be disassembled and reworked as a 74-gun ship of the Pluton'' (or 'petit modele') type. Launched 1 May 1813, but seized by the Dutch in their December 1813 uprising and restored as Admiraal Piet Hein.
