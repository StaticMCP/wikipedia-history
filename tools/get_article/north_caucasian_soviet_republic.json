A republic of the Russian SFSR, it was created by merging the Kuban-Black Sea Soviet Republic, the Stavropol Soviet Republic, and the Terek Soviet Republic. Its capital was Yekaterinodar; however, on August 16, 1918 Yekaterinodar was taken by Denikin's Volunteer Army, and the capital was moved to Pyatigorsk.\nBy the end of 1918, the majority of the republic's territory was captured by the White Army. On January 11 1919, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee abolished the republic.\nSee also\n* Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus\nReferences"
