His patent (Shukhov cracking process – patent of Russian Empire No. 12926 from November 27, 1891) on cracking was used to invalidate Standard Oil's patents (Burton process – Patent of United States  No. 1,049,667 on January 7, 1913) on oil refineries.\nPresent\nIn 1937 the Shukhov cracking process was superseded by catalytic cracking. It is still in use today to produce diesel.\nSee also\n* Cracking (chemistry)\n* Timeline of historic inventions\n* Burton process\nReferences\n* [http://science.howstuffworks.com/oil-refining5.htm Information on cracking in oil refining]\n* [http://www.shukhov.org/shukhov.html Biography of Vladimir Shukhov]\n* \"Vladimir G.
