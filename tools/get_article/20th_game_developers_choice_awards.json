Though normally held at the Game Developers Conference, due to the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, the conference was postponed to later in 2020, and the awards were presented via online streaming media, alongside the Independent Games Festival awards.\nKate Edwards, former head of the International Game Developers Association and current head of the Global Game Jam, will receive the Ambassador Award for her past and current work in the industry.\nFollowing from a similar event with The Game Awards 2019, Geoff Keighley worked with several of the games featured in the Awards as well as other indie developers to present forty game demos to be available from March 18 to March 23 through Steam as part of the Steam Game Festival - Spring Edition. Keighley planned to offer further events throughout the year to tie to other award shows and game conferences. In addition to games that were featured as part of the GDC and IGF, the Steam Game Festival also featured demos from other GDC-sponsored events that had been affected by the pandemic such as the Indie Megabooth and the Day of the Devs.\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on January 8, 2020, and winners (in bold below) named on March 18, 2020.\nGame of the Year\n* 'Untitled Goose Game (House House/Panic)'\n** Death Stranding (Kojima Productions/Sony Interactive Entertainment)\n** Control (Remedy Entertainment/505 Games)\n** Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (FromSoftware/Activision)\n** Outer Wilds (Mobius Digital/Annapurna Interactive)\nBest Audio\n* 'Control (Remedy Entertainment/505 Games)'\n** Death Stranding (Kojima Productions/Sony Interactive Entertainment)\n** Sayonara Wild Hearts (Simogo/Annapurna Interactive)\n** Untitled Goose Game (House House/Panic)\n** Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (Infinity Ward/Activision)\nBest Debut Developer\n* 'ZA/UM (Disco Elysium)'\n** Mobius Digital (Outer Wilds)\n** William Chyr Studios(Manifold Garden)\n** Foam Sword Games (Knights and Bikes)\n** Chance Agency (Neo Cab)\nBest Design\n* 'Baba Is You (Hempuli)'\n** Outer Wilds (Mobius Digital/Annapurna Interactive)\n** Death Stranding (Kojima Productions/Sony Interactive Entertainment)\n** Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (FromSoftware/Activision)\n** Untitled Goose Game (House House/Panic)\nBest Mobile Game\n* 'What the Golf?
