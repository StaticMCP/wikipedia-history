This force would operate as an autonomous European pillar within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe treaty was signed on 27 May 1952 by Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and West Germany. Article 129 of the treaty allows for additional countries to join the community.\nBy 1954, four out of the six signatories had ratified the treaty. Ratification by France and Italy was not completed, after the French National Assembly voted for indefinite postponement of the process in 1954. The treaty was never formally annulled and ratification remains technically open for completion. Recent geopolitical developments—including the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the re-election of US President Donald Trump in 2024—have renewed interest in the treaty. On 3 April 2025, a bill to ratify the EDC was introduced in both chambers of the Italian Parliament.\nProvisions\nThe EDC would entail a unified defence, divided into national components, funded by a common budget, common arms, centralised military procurement, and institutions.\n, with reference to the organisation's Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Council.]]\nPreamble\nEstablishes the intent to strengthen peace and unity in Europe, ensure security, and lay the groundwork for eventual political federation.\nTitle I – Fundamental Provisions\nChapter I – The European Defence Community\nArticles 1–7: Legal foundation, aims, principles (e.g., peaceful purpose, equal treatment, NATO cooperation), juridical personality.\nChapter II – The European Defence Forces\nArticles 8–12: Establishment of integrated armed forces; restrictions and exceptions for national forces (e.g., police, UN missions, royal guards).\nTitle II – Institutions of the Community\nChapter I – General Provisions\nArticles 13–20: Overview of the four institutions: Council of Ministers, Commissariat, Assembly, Court of Justice.

A 2024 article by Professor Federico Fabbrini at Dublin City University, as well as a 2025 study led by former French defence minister Sylvie Goulard, have found that it is still legally feasible for Italy and France to ratify the treaty, thereby bringing it into force. This suggests that the ratification process that halted in 1954 may proceed.\nStatus in France\nOn 30 August 1954, the French National Assembly voted 264 against, 319 in favour and 31 abstentions on a motion for indefinite postponement of ratification.\nBy the time of the vote, concerns about a future conflict faded with the death of Joseph Stalin and the end of the Korean War. Concomitant to these fears were a severe disjuncture between the original Pleven Plan of 1950 and the one defeated in 1954. Divergences included military integration at the division rather than battalion level and a change in the command structure putting NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in charge of EDC operational capabilities. The reasons that led to the failed ratification of the Treaty were twofold, concerning major changes in the international scene, as well as domestic problems of the French Fourth Republic. There were Gaullist fears that the EDC threatened France's national sovereignty, constitutional concerns about the indivisibility of the French Republic, and fears about West Germany's remilitarisation. French Communists opposed a plan tying France to the capitalist United States and setting it in opposition to the Communist bloc. Other legislators worried about the absence of the United Kingdom.\nThe Prime Minister, Pierre Mendès-France, tried to placate the treaty's detractors by attempting to ratify additional protocols with the other signatory states. These included the sole integration of covering forces, or in other words, those deployed within West Germany, as well as the implementation of greater national autonomy in regard to  budgetary and other administrative questions. Despite the central role for France, the EDC plan collapsed when it failed to obtain ratification in the French Parliament.\nStatus in Italy\nThe original ratification process in Italy was halted after the French National Assembly voted for indefinite postponement.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the re-election of US President Trump in 2024, the treaty has regained interest.\nOn 3 April 3 2025, deputy Mauro Del Barba (Italia Viva – Centro – Renew Europe) tabled a bill to ratify the treaty in both chambers of Parliament. As of now, the bill is still under review and has not yet been assigned to a specific committee for further consideration.\nHistory\nBackground\nDuring the late 1940s, the divisions created by the Cold War were becoming evident. The United States looked with suspicion at the growing power of the USSR and European states felt vulnerable, fearing a possible Soviet occupation. In this climate of mistrust and suspicion, the United States considered the rearmament of West Germany as a possible solution to enhance the security of Europe and of the whole Western bloc.\nIn August 1950, Winston Churchill proposed the creation of a common European army, including German soldiers, in front of the Council of Europe:\n}}\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe subsequently adopted the resolution put forward by the United Kingdom and officially endorsed the idea:\nIn September 1950, Dean Acheson, under a cable submitted by High Commissioner John J. McCloy, proposed a new plan to the European states; the American plan, called package, sought to enhance NATO's defence structure, creating 12 West German divisions. However, after the destruction that Germany had caused during World War II, European countries, in particular France, were not ready to see the reconstruction of the German military. Finding themselves in the midst of the two superpowers, they looked at this situation as a possibility to enhance the process of integrating Europe, trying to obviate the loss of military influence caused by the new bipolar order and thus supported a common army.\n1950–1951: Launch of the Pleven Plan\nThe treaty was initiated by the Pleven plan, proposed in 1950 by then French Prime Minister René Pleven in response to the American call for the rearmament of West Germany. The formation of a pan-European defence architecture, as an alternative to West Germany's proposed accession to NATO, was meant to harness the German military potential in case of conflict with the Soviet bloc. Just as the Schuman Plan was designed to end the risk of Germany having the economic power on its own to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the military possibility of Germany's making war again.\nOn 24 October 1950, France's Prime Minister René Pleven proposed a new plan, which took his name although it was drafted mainly by Jean Monnet, that aimed to create a supranational European army. With this project, France tried to satisfy America's demands, avoiding, at the same time, the creation of German divisions, and thus the rearmament of Germany.\n}}\nThe EDC was to include West Germany, France, Italy, and the Benelux countries.  The United States would be excluded.  It was a competitor to NATO (in which the US played the dominant role), with France playing the dominant role. Just as the Schuman Plan was designed to end the risk of Germany having the economic power to make war again, the Pleven Plan and EDC were meant to prevent the same possibility. Britain approved of the plan in principle, but agreed to join only if the supranational element was decreased.\nAccording to the Pleven Plan, the European Army was supposed to be composed of military units from the member states, and directed by a council of the member states’ ministers. Although with some doubts and hesitation, the United States and the six members of the ECSC approved the Pleven Plan in principle.\n1951–1952: Negotiations and signing\nspeaking at the signing ceremony in the French foreign ministry's ''Salon de l'Horloge'' on 27 May 1952]]\nThe initial approval of the Pleven Plan led the way to the Paris Conference, launched in February 1951, where it was negotiated the structure of the supranational army.\nFrance feared the loss of national sovereignty in security and defence, and thus a truly supranational European Army could not be tolerated by Paris. However, because of the strong American interest in a West German army, a draft agreement for a modified Pleven Plan, renamed the European Defense Community (EDC), was ready in May 1952, with French support.\nOn 27 May 1952 the foreign ministers of the six 'inner' countries of European integration signed the treaty:\n* Belgium: Paul Van Zeeland\n* France: Robert Schuman\n* Italy: Alcide De Gasperi\n* Luxembourg: Joseph Bech\n* Netherlands: Dirk Stikker\n* West Germany: Konrad Adenauer\nA European Political Community (EPC) was proposed in 1952 as a combination of the existing European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the proposed European Defence Community (EDC). A draft EPC treaty, as drawn up by the ECSC assembly (now the European Parliament), would have seen a directly elected assembly (\"the Peoples’ Chamber\"), a senate appointed by national parliaments and a supranational executive accountable to the parliament.\n1953–1954: Partial ratification\nIn 1953 and 1954, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany ratified the treaty.\n1954–present: Prolonged suspension of French and Italian ratification\nFollowing the French National Assembly's vote to indefinitely postpone ratification in 1954, Italian ratification was also put on hold.\nThis resulted in the\n* Abandonment of the European Political Community idea.\n* The London and Paris Conferences provided for West Germany's accession to NATO and the Western European Union (WEU), the latter of which was a transformed version of the pre-existing Western Union.\n* Meeting of European leaders in the Messina Conference in 1955, where they established the Spaak Committee which would pave the way for the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC). The EEC member states tried to create foreign policy cooperation in the De Gaulle-sponsored Fouchet Plan (1959&ndash;1962). European foreign policy was finally established during the third attempt with the European Political Cooperation (EPC) (1970). This became the predecessor of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Today the European Union and NATO, and formerly also the Western European Union, all carry out some of the functions which was envisaged for the EDC, although none approach the degree of supranational military control that the EDC would have provided for.\nSee also\n* History of the European Union\n* Western Union\n* Western European Union\n* European Political Community (1952)\n* Common Foreign and Security Policy (1993&ndash;present)\n* European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI)\n* European Security and Defence Policy (1999&ndash;present)\n* Treaty of Brussels\n* European Defence Agency\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Fursdon, Edward.
