In 1881, he was awarded the Marquis of Lorne's Medal for Design. Two years later, in 1883, he became a member of the prestigious Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

In 1907, Howard was selected to represent the OSA on the Toronto Guild of Civic Art committee during the selection of art purchases.\nHoward died in Toronto on February 17, 1916.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gallery.ca/library/ngc136.html Alfred Harold Howard fonds] at the National Gallery of Canada.\n*[https://ago.ca/sites/default/files/SC115.pdf A.
