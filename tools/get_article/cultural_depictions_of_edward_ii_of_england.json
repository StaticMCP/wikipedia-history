In recent years, several acclaimed productions have been staged in the United Kingdom, although the play is seldom performed in the United States outside of large cities and university towns.\n*Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of Marlowe's play, The Life of Edward II of England, was written in 1923.\n* The character of Patrick de Salis in Susan Howatch's historical novel Cashelmara is based on Edward II.\n*The English world music/folk/reggae band Edward the Second and the Red Hot Polkas, formed in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1985, took for its original name a punning reference to the supposed manner of Edward's murder in the nearby Berkeley Castle.\n*The English composer John McCabe's ballet, Edward II (1995), is also based on the Marlowe play.\n* English classical composer George Benjamin's 2018 opera Lessons in Love and Violence, based on the libretto of Martin Crimp, uses the Edward II theme.\n* The Scottish patriotic song (and national anthem candidate), \"Flower of Scotland,\" written by Roy Williamson of The Corries, mentions Edward II's defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn.\nLiterature\n*Margaret Campbell Barnes' Isabel the Fair focuses on Queen Isabella.\n*John Crowley's first novel, The Deep (1975), features (in part) a fantasy version of the story of Edward II and his Wars as seen by a strangely sexless visitor from outside the world.\n*Medieval mystery novelist P.
