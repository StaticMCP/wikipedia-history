      "text": "# Battle of Pavia tapestries\n\nThe Battle of Pavia tapestries are a set of seven tapestries made from about 1528 to 1531 depicting events from the Battle of Pavia of 24 February 1525.\nThe tapestries were designed under the direction of Bernard van Orley and made in Brussels at a workshop of Willem and Jan Dermoyen. They are made of wool, silk, silver, and gold. Each weighs about one hundred pounds.\nThe battle was between forces of Charles V and Francis I. Charles V was not present at the battle, but Francis I was, and was taken prisoner in the defeat of the French side.\nThe tapestries are owned by the Museo e Real Bosco di Capodimonte. The tapestries are on tour in the United States in 2024 and 2025 at the Kimbell Art Museum, the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.\nNotes\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of pavia tapestries\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Pavia tapestries"
