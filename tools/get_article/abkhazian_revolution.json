After mass protests in the capital Sukhumi and the occupation of his office on 27 May, Ankvab fled to his hometown of Gudauta and ultimately resigned on 1 June, after previously denouncing the demonstration as an attempted coup d'état.\nThe uprising was attributed to public anger with Ankvab over his perceived liberal policy toward ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia, a breakaway republic with limited recognition. Although Abkhazia seceded from Georgia in 1992, the Ankvab administration allowed ethnic Georgians to register as voters and receive Abkhazian passports.\nThe revolution led to an early presidential election being called in August 2014. Opposition leader Raul Khajimba was elected president with a narrow majority of the vote.\nBackground\nIn May 2011, Sergei Bagapsh died in office, leading to the 2011 presidential election. Alexander Ankvab won with 54.9% of the votes.\nIn late April 2014, the opposition submitted a 5 May ultimatum to President Ankvab to dismiss the government and make radical reforms.\nTimeline until Alexander Ankvab's resignation\n*May 27: In the centre of Sukhumi 10,000 supporters of the Abkhaz opposition gathered. On the same day, President Aleksandr Ankvab's headquarters in Sukhumi were stormed by opposition groups led by Raul Khadjimba, forcing him into flight to Gudauta. The opposition claimed that the protests were sparked by poverty, but the main point of contention was President Ankvab's liberal policy towards ethnic Georgians in the Gali region. The opposition said these policies could endanger Abkhazia's ethnic Abkhazian identity. Georgia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on the international community to act in response to the political unrest in Abkhazia. (See Issue of ethnic Georgians)\n*May 28: During the night, Russia's Deputy Security Council Secretary Rashid Nurgaliyev met with Ankvab, who described the events as an \"armed coup attempt.\" It was also reported that Ankvab met with Putin's aide Vladislav Surkov, who had traveled to Sukhumi with Nurgaliyev. On May 28 Surkov also met with opposition leaders Raul Khajimba, Sergei Shamba, Akhra Bzhaniya, and Vitaly Gabniy, as well as with the lawmakers of Abkhazia's parliament. On May 30 media reported that Ankvab moved to Russian Federation military base in Gudauta due to security concerns.\n*May 31: The Abkhaz parliament appointed speaker of the parliament Valeri Bganba as an acting president. It also decided to hold an early presidential election on August 24. The resolution said that the document was adopted \"in connection with Alexander Ankvab's inability to exercise the powers and responsibilities of the President of the Republic of Abkhazia...\" President Ankvab slammed parliament for urging him to step down and for a vote of no confidence in the Cabinet.\n*June 1: Ankvab resigned \"with the goal of preserving stability in the country\".
