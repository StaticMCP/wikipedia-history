Payne in August 1963. During his tenure as president the college established Savannah's first graduate program in education (Master of Science in Elementary Education, 1968) and saw the program gain NCATE accreditation. Additionally, white students were admitted to the college as a result of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the first white faculty members were hired.\nAlso during Jordan's administration a major building program began which resulted in the construction of a modern student union, new football stadium, fine arts building, Payne Hall, and new dormitories for men and women.\nJordan resigned from the college in 1971 to accept a position as vice chancellor for the central office of the Georgia Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia. He was the first African-American to hold this position. Ursula H. Shelton was the first African-American Administrative Assistant to work under Dr. Jordan during this new era in Atlanta.\nLegacy\nThe Howard Jordan Business Building on the university's campus is named in honor of Dr. Jordan. It houses 11 classrooms and the supporting staff and faculty offices. It also has a 300-seat auditorium, a general computer lab and business media facilities.\nSuggested Reading\n*Hall, Clyde W (1991).
