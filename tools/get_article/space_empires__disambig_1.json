Treaties can be signed between two empires, varying from the basic trade agreement to full-blown partnerships and even protectorates. The player can also conduct intelligence operations, from simple information gathering missions, to ship bombs, to inciting rebellion on a planet.\nInterstellar travel in Space Empires is not faster-than-light drive based, but instead relies on anomalies called \"warp points\", essentially wormholes between two star systems. Warp points are naturally occurring but a player can open and close these warp points if she or he has the appropriate technologies.\nGames\n* Space Empires (unreleased)\n* Space Empires II (1995)\n* Space Empires III (1997)\n* Space Empires IV (2000)\n* Space Empires: Starfury (2003)\n* Space Empires V (2006)\nRelease and development\nSpace Empires II and Space Empires III were released as shareware. Space Empires III was later released as freeware. MikroBitti called Space Empires III one of the best shareware space strategy games, rivaling the quality of commercial products.\nIn 2006, Strategy First acquired Malfador Machinations and the Space Empires intellectual property prior to publishing Space Empires V. Strategy First still owns the Space Empires intellectual property and has not developed another PC game.\nIn 2011, Strategy First released a board game named Space Empires: 4X, based on the digital model of the Space Empires computer games, utilizing sprites and mechanics from Space Empires IV.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170221181939/http://www.spaceempires5.com/ Space Empires Universe site], community homepage (offline) via Internet Archive\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013081246/http://malfador.com/ Developer website], company homepage (offline) via Internet Archive\n* [http://www.andybrain.com/extras/aaron-hall-interview.htm Interview with Aaron Hall], the creator of Space Empires"
