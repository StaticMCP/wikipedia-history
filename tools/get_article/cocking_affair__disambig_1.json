It has been made into an opera entitled A Scholar Under Siege.\nBackground\nGovernor Talmadge's first political interference was in 1935, when he supported a 1935 bill that would have given the governor additional control over funds appropriated to the Georgia Board of Regents, transferred the titles to all Board of Regents property to the state, and absorbed any trust funds or investments held by the university system. In addition to the obvious disadvantages for the university system, this would have made it difficult or impossible to fund building projects (such as the construction of a new gym at Georgia Tech) as the state could not take on Public Works Administration (PWA) loans.\nA compromise deal was reached; if the bill passed with the support of the regents, the state would provide funding to cover projects that would have been supported by PWA loans; however, Talmadge's effort to control the regents and the university system was relatively clear at the time.\nThe event also highlighted tensions between state politics and higher education governance in Georgia.\nFiring\nTalmadge fired Walter Cocking, who was dean of the College of Education at the University of Georgia. Talmadge accused Cocking of championing integration, in this case the admission of African-American students to historically all-white educational institutions. Talmadge declared that he would fire anyone who stood for \"communism or racial equality\".\nConsequences\nAs a result of the firings, all Georgia universities lost their accreditation. This incident also contributed to Talmadge's loss in the subsequent election to Ellis Arnall.\nSee also\n* History of Georgia\n* History of Georgia Tech\n* Georgia Southern University\n* Johns Committee\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\nFurther reading\n*Bailes, Sue. \"Eugene Talmadge and the Board Of Regents Controversy,\" Georgia Historical Quarterly, Winter 1969, Vol. 53 Issue 4, pp 409-423"
