Birch, 1874.\nThe Perak War (1875–1876) took place between British and local forces in Perak, a state in northwestern Malaysia. The sultan of Lower Perak and other local chiefs attempted to end foreign influence in the region and remove the British administrator James W. W. Birch. Following the killing of Birch in 1875, British forces defeated the followers of Lela Pandak Lam.\nBackground\nIn the 19th-century, the Malay sultanates gradually came under the control of the colonial British Empire. Officially the British pursued an abolitionist policy in all areas under their control after Slavery Abolition Act 1833. From the 1870s, when the British felt their power was secure enough to introduce policies they felt would be unpopular, they actively started to pursue an abolitionist policy against slavery in Malaya. In 1875, the British Resident of Perak James W. W. Birch was killed by Lela Pandak Lam in 1875 after having assisted slave refugees from the royal harem of the Sultan of Perak.\nAfter the murder of Birch, local Malays first planned on attacking Bandar Bahru on the night of 2 November, but the plan was aborted due to heavy rain. British reinforcements started to arrive from Hong Kong and Burma by 6 November. A skirmish happened near a Malay-held stockade near Bandar Tua, Perak on 7 November 1875 involving around 106 British soldiers. This was the first battle in the war. Encountering unexpected resistance, the battle ended with the retreat of the British detachment, who lost 4 men including Captain Innes, an officer. Reinforcements were sent, and 300 men soon arrived in the state with 80 boats. Most of the army were sent from India and Hong Kong.\nWar\nBattle of Bandar Tua\nAfter the assassination of British Resident James W. W. Birch, the British attacked Lela Pandak Lam's stronghold in Pasir Salak. on 7 December, 1875, but were stopped at Kampung Biak. In Lakaran Melayu by Sir Frank Swettenham, the bravery of two Malay scouts, Nakodah Orlong and Alang, is described. Nakodah Orlong was killed in the ambush. Alang defended his leader's body throughout the day and eventually brought it back to the base by swimming in the river. The attack failed for the British, with many wounded and killed.\nSiege of Pasir Salak\nOn the 15th, the British army arrived at Pasir Salak. The place was well defended, with a fort that had a six-foot rampart, coupled with a wooden wall on top and with a trench filled with sharpened spikes and traps. The warriors had several lantaka with them, alongside some muskets. The British attacked relentlessly, but the first attack failed, killing Captain Innes. The British were later successful and captured the fort on 12 December. Pasir Salak was razed by the soldiers under orders from William Jervois.\nBattle of Kota Lama Kanan\nThe warriors, under Lela Pandak Lam, soon retreated to Sayong. The British followed them, attacking enemy forts and villages on the way. Then, on 4 January 1876, they were ambushed at Kota Lama Kanan, Sayong. Brigadier H.J. Hawkins was killed during the fight.\nEnd\nSoon, the warriors began to lose strength. By mid-1876, the war ended with the capture of prominent leaders and warriors, such as Lela Pandak Lam, Sultan Abdullah II and Ngah Ibrahim. The first was captured and hanged in Matang with two followers in 1877, while the latter two were exiled to the Seychelles. Thus ended any direct opposition over British control of Perak.\nReferences\n* Swettenham, Frank Athelstane (1967), Stories and sketches.
