It was established in 1971 \"as an expression of the conviction that educational institutions have an important role to play in the encouragement and development of basic science as it applies to medicine\".\nMedals are presented annually at Brandeis University on the basis of recommendations of a panel of scientists selected by the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center. Awards are given to scientists for recent discoveries of \"particular originality\" and \"importance to basic medical research\". A $30,000 prize and a medallion accompanies each award.\nThe Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, named after Lewis Solon Rosenstiel, was established in 1968, carrying out research in basic medical science.\nRecipients\nSource: [http://www.brandeis.edu/rosenstiel/rosenstielaward/past.html Brandeis University]\n*2025 Steven Henikoff, for his transformative research on genome organization and gene expression.\n*2024 Winrich Freiwald, Nancy Kanwisher, Margaret Livingstone, Doris Tsao for discovering how and where in the brain face recognition occurs.\n*2023 Wolfgang Baumeister, for his pioneering work in the development of cryo-electron tomography and his insights into the structures and functions of the protein quality control machinery\n*2022 Christine Holt and Erin Schuman, for their pioneering work that shed light on the role of local protein synthesis in neuronal development and function.\n*2021 Robert H.
