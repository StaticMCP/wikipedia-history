The album was made available through the band's official website on 3 June 2011, before being released in shops on 27 June. It is the final album to feature original drummer Nick Hodgson before his departure from the band in December 2012. The album was later re-issued in North America, under the new title Start the Revolution Without Me. This version of the album was released on 6 March 2012, and includes the brand new track \"On the Run\", plus tracks previously only available on the digital version of the album. Around the same time, a special limited edition vinyl box set was released through the band's official website in the United Kingdom, containing the entire twenty-three tracks from the digital deluxe version of the album, spread across four 10\" vinyl records.\nBackground\nJust days before the album was announced, a music video for the track \"Little Shocks\" was released online via the band's official website. The album's title is taken from the lyrics of the track \"Child of the Jago\". The album was uniquely promoted in the United Kingdom, as copies purchased from the band's website from 3 June could contain a track listing chosen by the purchaser. Each album could contain ten of any of the twenty-three tracks available on the digital deluxe version of the album, and each individual album artwork could be edited to the purchaser's design. Purchasers could also share their version of the album, and for every other buyer who chooses to purchase their version, they earn £1.\nTrack listing\nThe Future Is Medieval\nAll tracks written by Kaiser Chiefs.\nStart the Revolution Without Me\nPersonnel\n*Ricky Wilson – vocals\n*Andrew 'Whitey' White – guitar\n*Nick Hodgson – drums, backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Man on Mars\" and \"If You Will Have Me\"\n*Simon Rix – bass\n*Nick \"Peanut\" Baines – keyboards\n*Tony Visconti – producer, engineer\n*Ethan Johns – producer, engineer\n*David Arnold – additional strings on several tracks\n*Tim Hodgson – additional lyrics on \"If You Will Have Me\"\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (2011)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
