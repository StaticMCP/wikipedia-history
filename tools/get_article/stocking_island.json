The island features beaches and several resorts.\nLocation and geography\nStocking Island is lightly inhabited, with a population of only 10. It is located  from Government Dock, George Town, across the harbor. The long narrow island protects George Town from ocean waves, creating a natural harbor. There is one high hill, known locally as the Beacon, which is capped with an old, unused gas beacon. The glass top portion is missing, but the concrete pillar is visible for miles. The central part of Stocking Island features an inlet known as Hurricane Hole where sailboats anchor for protection during storms, and which features a blue hole. Opposite Hurricane Hole is a sandbar beach called the Spit.\nNearby islands include Lilly Cay, Elizabeth Island, Guana Cay, and Fowl Cay.\nReferences"
