Two teams of two players compete, with one player throwing a ball at an opponent, who tries to hit it with a bat and then switch places with their partner in order to score.\nBola de gude\nThis is a game where players flick marbles at other marbles in order to capture them, with the player capturing the most marbles by the end of the game winning.\nCinco Marias\nThis game is a version of knucklebones.\nLuta de galo\nPlayers keep a handkerchief hanging out of their waist, and must hop on one leg while keeping the opposite arm stuck to their chest. Players lose if their raised foot touches the ground, if they allow their arm to come off their chest, or if their handkerchief is snatched by the opponent.\nReferences"
