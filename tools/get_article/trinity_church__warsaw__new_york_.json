The Carpenter Gothic style frame church was built in 1853-1854 and closely follows the plan and elevations of a country church published by Richard Upjohn (1802–1878) in his book ''Upjohn's Rural Architecture (1852). Upjohn's connection with the design of the church has been confirmed by a letter dated December 30, 1853.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nDue to years of deterioration, the steeple was removed in 2016.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090724043756/http://geocities.com/trinitywarsaw/ Welcome to Trinity Episcopal Church in Warsaw, NY website]\n*[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM31XF_Trinity_Church_Warsaw_New_York Trinity Church - Warsaw, New York - U.S. National Register of Historic Places on Waymarking.com]"
