He graduated from Tulane University School of Medicine in 1955, and completed his internship from William Beaumont Army Hospital, El Paso, TX in 1956. He later completed his Fellowship from Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 1961. He also practiced neuropsychiatry for few months in 1956.\nProfessional work\nHe is a specialist in contact and occupational dermatitis, including the toxicological and pharmacological aspects. He is also known for his work in neonatal skin, dose response of topical drugs and per-cutaneous penetration. The UCSF Dermatology Department website lists 1,500 medical journal articles by Dr. Maibach published from 1960 to 2025.\nResearch ethics\nIn December 2022, UCSF released the results of a preliminary investigation into his research conducted on prisoners at the California Medical Facility at Vacaville. The report raised ethical concerns over how the research was conducted, especially with regards to getting informed consent from and communicating research risks to participants, and the fact that many of the prisoners were being assessed or treated for psychiatric conditions. The report noted that the experiments did not involve treating medical conditions the patients had, in some cases involved exposing patients to herbicides and insecticides.\nIn his response to the report, Maibach expressed remorse regarding his involvement in the research, stating \"[While] the work I did with colleagues at CMF was considered by many to be appropriate by the standards of the day, [in retrospect] those standards were clearly evolving. I obviously would not work under those circumstances today... I have sincere remorse in relationship to these efforts some decades ago.\"\nThe University of California at San Francisco issued an apology for its role in supporting the research.\nHonors\nMaibach was awarded an honorary PhD by Universite de Paris-Sud in 1985 and Université Claude Bernard, Lyon in 2008. In 2013, he was awarded the Master Dermatologist Award by the American Academy of Dermatology.\nBooks\nCutaneous Biometrics by Howard Maibach (Editor) and Nily Osman (Editor), published 2024.\nTextbook of Cosmetic Dermatology (Series in Cosmetic and Laser Therapy) by Robert Baran (Editor) and Howard Maibach (Editor), published 2024.\nIn Vitro Percutaneous Absorption: Principles, Fundamentals, and Applications by Robert L.
