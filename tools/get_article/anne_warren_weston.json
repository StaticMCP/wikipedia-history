She is largely memorialized by the letters she wrote to the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, and others.\nBiography\nEarly life\nAnne Warren Weston was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts on July 13, 1812.\nExpanded description\nWeston wrote letters to the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, detailing the expectations and persecution of abolitionism. She gave a circular to the Abolitionists of Massachusetts.\nDeath and afterward\nWeston died in 1890.\nPhilosophical and political views\nIn her Circular to Abolitionists of Massachusetts, Weston lays out a set of guidelines for the Anti-Slavery Society to carry forth their goals, including having men and women sign separate documents and sending all signed memorials to the legislature. She cites the Preamble to the United States Constitution as evidence that the legislation of Massachusetts is hypocritical in their refusal to provide life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to a portion of the population.\nBibliography\n# \"Anne Warren Weston.\" Women in Peace.\n# Weston, Anne Warren.
