It is the ninth title in The King of Fighters series and the second one to be produced by Eolith. Similarly to The King of Fighters '98, it brings together characters from various SNK franchises and has a diverse roster of fighters.\nIn 2003, the game was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan, followed by global ports to PlayStation 2 in 2004 and Xbox in 2005, both of which were released in North America in a two-in-one bundle with the following game in the series, The King of Fighters 2003. In 2009, SNK Playmore produced a remake subtitled Unlimited Match (KOF 2002UM, or KOF 02UM) for the PlayStation 2, released in Japan, then worldwide on Xbox Live Arcade in 2010, which itself was released worldwide on Steam in 2015, and for arcades in 2011.\nThe game is celebrated for its extensive character selection, fluid animation, and engaging fighting mechanics.\nGameplay\nThe King of Fighters 2002 discards the 4-on-4 \"Striker Match\" format used in the previous three games in the series and returns to the 3-on-3 Battle format originally used in the series up until KOF '98.\nThe game also revamps the Power Gauge system into a format similar to the one used in The King of Fighters '97''. Like the previous games in the series, the Power Gauge is filled as the player attacks the opponent or performs Special Moves during a battle. The number of Power Gauges the player can stock up is increased by one with each member of the team. For example, the first member of the team can stock up to three Power Gauges, while the third member can stock up to five. A single Power Gauge stock can be used to either perform a Counterattack and Evasion technique while guarding an opponent's attack, use a Super Special Move, or initiate the MAX Activation state. The same case also applies to the 1-on-1 format, where the Power Gauge the player can stock up is also increased by one with each round loss. For example, on the first round, the player can stock up to three Power Gauges, while losing two rounds allows the player to stock up to five.\nDuring MAX Activation, the player's offensive and defensive strength is increased for a short period and can cancel any attack into another. In this state, a Super Special Move can be used without consuming a Power Gauge stock. There are also MAX Super Special Moves, which are Super moves that can only be performed during MAX Activation with one Power Gauge stock, and MAX2 moves that require two stocks while low on health.\nCharacters\nJust like ''The King of Fighters '98, the game has no storyline since the NESTS story arc has already concluded in the previous game, The King of Fighters 2001. Instead, a \"Dream Match\" is included featuring characters from all the previous games in the series. In addition to the recurring teams from the series, including the original Japan Team, the game also features a series of teams representing each of the previous game series from The King of Fighters '96 to The King of Fighters 2001''. Omega Rugal returns as the final boss as well. However, not all the characters from the previous games are featured, and series' regulars such as King and Shingo Yabuki are absent from the Neo Geo version for the first time since their first appearance. The Dreamcast version of the game, nevertheless, features King and Shingo, while three additional characters from SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom, namely Geese Howard, Goenitz, and Orochi Iori, are included in the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions. Several characters have been redrawn, most notably the Orochi Team, representing ''The King of Fighters '98.\nJapan Team\n* Kyo Kusanagi\n* Benimaru Nikaido\n* Goro Daimon\nFatal Fury Team\n* Terry Bogard\n* Andy Bogard\n* Joe Higashi\nArt of Fighting Team\n* Ryo Sakazaki\n* Robert Garcia\n* Takuma Sakazaki\nIkari Team\n* Leona Heidern\n* Ralf Jones\n* Clark Still\nPsycho Soldier Team\n* Athena Asamiya\n* Sie Kensou\n* Chin Gentsai\nWomen Fighters Team\n* Mai Shiranui\n* Yuri Sakazaki\n* May Lee\nKorea Team\n* Kim Kaphwan\n* Chang Koehan\n* Choi Bounge\nYagami Team\n* Iori Yagami\n* Mature\n* Vice\n97 Special Team\n* Ryuji Yamazaki\n* Blue Mary\n* Billy Kane\nOrochi Team / Awakened Orochi Team\n* Yashiro Nanakase / Orochi Yashiro\n* Shermie / Orochi Shermie\n* Chris / Orochi Chris\n'K' Team\n* K′\n* Maxima\n* Whip\nAgent Team\n* Vanessa\n* Seth\n* Ramón\nNESTS Team\n* Kula Diamond\n* K9999\n* Ángel\nSingle entry'\n* Geese Howard\n* Goenitz\n* Orochi Iori\n* King\n* Kusanagi\n* Omega Rugal\n* Shingo Yabuki\nDevelopment\nEarly in development of The King of Fighters 2002 was meant to remove the Striker System from the NESTS trilogy due to negative feedback. Development was also done by Brezza Soft. There were not major plans for the story as if it could be another NESTS game despite KOF 2001 ending it. Due to the culmination of the NESTS story arc from previous installments, SNK decided to mix elements from such as arc with the first Orochi story arc, resulting in a cast that reunites characters from both narratives. There was a proper focus in bringing back Rugal Bernstein who starred as the final boss from previous installment but with new updated moves. The enemy AI was toned down when compared to previous games.\nNona was in charge of the illustrations, leading to mysteries about the main characters of this installment. Since The King of Fighters 2001 was aimed towards a Korean audience, SNK noted there are about 4 million KOF'' fans in the country. There have been many posts about it on various websites. The Tactical Order System in particular seemed to be popular with players. The team expressed complications with pleasing both Koreans and Japanese with rise of popularity of the franchise. The series' protagonist Kyo Kusanagi remained popular within fans after the NESTS arc which resulted in the team's decision to create a clone of him, Kusanagi, wearing his highschool uniform which the original Kyo dropped in ''The King of Fighters '99. While the game gives Kusanagi no narrative like the other characters, Kusanagi would be given a backstory in The King of Fighters 2003.\nUnlimited Match\nA remake of KOF 2002, The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match (KOF 2002UM) was released on February 26, 2009 for the PlayStation 2 in Japan, on November 3, 2010 for Xbox Live Arcade and on January 24, 2011 for arcades. The PlayStation 2 version also includes a port of the original The King of Fighters 2002 Neo Geo version. The game was later ported to Steam on February 27, 2015, and PlayStation 4 on February 8, 2021. A physical release was set for late Spring 2021. This remake features new characters, stages, music and artwork, as well as system and roster rebalancing.\nUnlimited Match'' has 66 characters in total, making it the series' largest roster to date. There are 44 characters from The King of Fighters 2002, 16 characters from the NESTS arc, including King and Shingo, and six hidden characters, including additional characters from the previous console versions with the exception of Orochi Iori and particularly K9999. A new character called  was designed to take his place in the game.\nIn November 2020, the Steam version of the game was updated with rollback netcode, allowing for higher quality online play. The PlayStation 4 version was released with this same rollback netcode. In January 2022, the PC version was patched with spectating lobbies and additional improvements.\nSeveral teams have been re-arranged for Unlimited Match to account for the additional characters, as indicated below; characters added to this version are marked in italics.\nArt of Fighting Team\n* Ryo Sakazaki\n* Robert Garcia\n* Yuri Sakazaki\nPsycho Soldier Team\n* Athena Asamiya\n* Sie Kensou\n* Bao\nWomen Fighters Team\n* King\n* Mai Shiranui\n* Kasumi Todoh\nMasters Team\n* Heidern\n* Takuma Sakazaki\n* Chin Gentsai\nNESTS Team\n* Kula Diamond\n* Ángel\n* Foxy\nEast Asian Triple Alliance Team\n* Jhun Hoon\n* Shingo Yabuki\n* Lin\nPretty Girl Fighters Team\n* May Lee Jinju\n* Hinako Shijo\n* Li Xiangfei\nCloned Kyo Team\n* Kusanagi\n* Kyo-1\n* Kyo-2\nBosses\n* Krizalid\n* Cloned Zero\n* Original Zero\n* Igniz\nSingle Entry\n* Nameless\n* Sie Kensou ('99 - 2000 \"Psychic Powerless\" version)\n* Takuma Sakazaki ('99 - 2001 \"Classic\" version)\n* Robert Garcia ('99 - 2000 \"Charge\" version)\n* Nightmare Geese\nReception and legacy\nThe original The King of Fighters 2002 was regarded by Hardcore Gaming 101 as the high point of the franchise for its cast and balanced gameplay. They also noticed the developers were able to improved the visuals and feel similar to ''The King of Fighters '98 for removing the Striker System and going back to the original character rooster. The amount of characters alongside its revamped fighting engine appealed to GameSpot to the point of declaring as one of the best in 2D fighters. MeriStation was more critical to the removal of its Striker system as it recycled the old style alongside the boss Rugal Bernstein without offering the players anything to stand out within the franchise. IGN was glad with how the game mixed old characters and new characters to create a more unique cast. Despite lamenting the removal of Strikers, IGN praised the new gameplay mechanics as well as notable visual improvement. GameRevolution said that game also feels another take on The King of Fighters '98 due to its gathering of classic characters but lamented it suffered from poor graphics that feel dated.\nDuring its release week, Unlimited Match sold 19,000 copies in Japan. In Issue 114 from Arcadia, the game was featured at ninth in its Top Ten Video Games list. Critical reception to the game was positive with Eurogamer and PALGN acclaiming large number of playable characters, although mixed opinions were given to its aging graphics. In addition, despite lacking a plot, the large interaction between characters was praised for adding depth to the game according to Wired. The game has generally been considered one of the most popular games in the franchise in Latin America.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20020926205455/http://www.brezza.com/ Official website]\n*[https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/us/games/steam/kof2002um/ Official The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match website]\n*[https://game.snk-corp.co.jp/official/kof2002/kof2002_top.html Official The King of Fighters 2002'' website]"
