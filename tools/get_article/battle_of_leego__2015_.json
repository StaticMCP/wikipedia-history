A military outpost with around 100 Burundian soldiers was attacked by militants with a car bomb, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.\nThe Mail & Guardian described the attack as the \"latest attack during the insurgents’ annual Ramadan fighting season.\" It was reported that militants beheaded survivors of the attack at the base. Footage has been released of barefoot dead soldiers and a soldier being shot.\nSomali and AMISOM troops reportedly retook the base and town on 28 June while al-Shabaab withdrew and offered no resistance to them but not before beheading the local Deputy District commissioner among the captives they took.\nThe battle coincided with the 2015 Ramadan attacks conducted by ISIL and its sympathizers. However no direct link between the al-Shabaab attack and the other attacks that day exists.\nSee also\n* 2015 timeline of the War in Somalia\nReferences"
