The majority of passenger services run nowadays are operated by the state company České dráhy (Czech Railways), which until 2007 also managed cargo services now run by ČD Cargo. In 2009 the country had 9,420&nbsp;km of standard gauge track, 3,153&nbsp;km of which is electrified. There are two main electrification systems in the Czech Republic, 3&nbsp;kV DC in the northern part, and 25&nbsp;kV 50&nbsp;Hz AC in the south (in addition, one historical 24&nbsp;km long line uses 1.5&nbsp;kV DC; and since 2009 one short local line to Austria uses 15&nbsp;kV 16.7&nbsp;Hz AC). Locomotives had to be changed on boundaries in the past, two-system locomotives have been introduced in 1974. The network has same gauge links to all four countries bordering the Czech Republic (Slovakia, Austria, Germany and Poland) with passenger services to all four countries in operation. Major hubs for international passenger services on the network are in Prague, Ostrava, Brno and Břeclav, and the busiest station (by number of passengers) is Praha hlavní nádraží. The maximum speed for passenger traffic is .\nHistory\nThe history of rail transport in the territory of the present-day Czech Republic dates back to the Austro-Hungarian empire. The first horse-drawn railway in Europe, between České Budějovice and Linz (in present-day Austria) commenced operations in 1832, and the first locomotive-hauled railway from Vienna to Břeclav opened seven years later. Throughout the rest of the 19th century the rail network in the whole of Europe grew rapidly and after the First World War and the independence of Czechoslovakia, the company Československé státní dráhy (Czechoslovak state railways) was founded. From 1948 until the Velvet Revolution the border crossings with Austria and West Germany were strictly controlled and only a limited number of trains was operated. Following the fall of communism, the railway network was reopened to Western Europe; the first EuroCity trains operated in transitional Czechoslovakia in 1991. In the 21st century the network has undergone extensive modernisations, and newer rolling stock (such as the Class 680 \"pendolino\") have been introduced.\nOperation\nMost of the Czech railway network is maintained by Správa železnic, a state-owned company. In 2010, the Czech government proposed merging Správa železnic (then-called SŽDC) and České dráhy to a single company. In 2011, RegioJet, a subsidiary of Student Agency, became the first company to actively compete with České dráhy on a route, launching a service between Prague and Havířov. Other private companies own exclusive rights to run services on certain lines. The Czech Republic is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC) and has the country code 54.\nTrain categories\nRail links to adjacent countries\n*  Austria voltage change 25&nbsp;kV 50&nbsp;Hz AC to 15&nbsp;kV 16.7&nbsp;Hz AC\n*  Germany voltage change 3&nbsp;kV DC to 15&nbsp;kV 16.7&nbsp;Hz AC\n*  Poland same voltage 3&nbsp;kV DC\n*  Slovakia same voltage 3&nbsp;kV DC (north) and 25&nbsp;kV 50&nbsp;Hz AC (south)\nSeveral border crossings did not survive political changes in 1918 or 1945. However, some of them were renewed after 1989.\nBorder crossings with regular passenger traffic as of 2023:\n* Germany – 11\n* Austria – 4\n* Slovakia – 5\n* Poland – 8\nModern and historical railway maps\nGallery\nFile:E 186 291-1 Metrans Uhrineves.JPG\nFile:CD-RJ als EC 73.jpg\nFile:386 202 Regiojet Praha-Smichov 2018 20.jpg\nFile:480 001 Cerhenice1.jpg\nFile:CD Class 912 at Kladno station CZ 328.jpg\nFile:Pardubice, hlavní nádraží, jednotka 814.137.jpg\nFile:80-29 003 Bftn CD Ostrava-Kuncice.jpg\nFile:Brno, Královo Pole, železniční stanice, vůz 80-30 002 (02).jpg\nFile:Trutnov hl.n., 854+810.jpg\nFile:845.114-7 Návarov.jpg\nSee also\n*Czech rail border crossings\n*History of rail transport in the Czech Republic\n*Narrow gauge railways in the Czech Republic\n*High-speed rail in the Czech Republic\n*List of Czech locomotive classes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* }}\nExternal links\n* illustrated description of the railways of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s."
