The city of Jaleshwar where this temple is located is named after this temple.\nRecords indicate that the temple was in existence since the time of King Janak. It is believed that during the marriage between Rama and Sita, soil was taken from this temple. A copper inscription in the temple indicates that to administer the temple, in  AD, King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah provided 275 bighas of land.\nThe temple is built in Gumbaja architecture style. A square Shiva Linga, submerged in water, lies at the center of the main temple. There is a pond near the temple.\nIn the year of 1200 BS (1143 AD), the then Mahant of this temple installed a bell at the main gate of the temple Ishannath Mandir at Damani village of the Belsand block in the Sitamarhi district of Bihar in India.\nGallery\nFile:Jaleshwor Mahadev temple - panoramio.jpg| Main temple\nFile:Jaleshwor Mahadev under water - panoramio.jpg| Shiva Linga in water\nSee also\n*List of Hindu temples in Nepal\nReferences"
