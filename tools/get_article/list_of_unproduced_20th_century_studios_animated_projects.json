Following the release of the album of the same name, but due to the poor sales and reviews of the album, the ideas never materialized.\n|-\n|}\n1992\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150pt;\"| Series || style=\"width:100pt;\"| Title || Description\n|-\n| Alien || Operation: Aliens || In 1992, a planned animated series based on the 1986 film Aliens titled Operation: Aliens was being produced for Fox Kids along with an LCD game, board game, a Sega Genesis video game, and action figures as tie-ins for the proposed series, but was ultimately cancelled, with the only things that came out of this scrapped project was the action figure line.\n|}\n1993\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150pt;\"| Series || style=\"width:100pt;\"| Title || Description\n|-\n| Ren & Stimpy || Untitled Ren & Stimpy film || In May 1993, Nickelodeon announced a two-year picture deal with 20th Century Fox to produce some of its films, including its IPs such as the aforementioned Ren & Stimpy. However, the idea of a \"warm and fuzzy\" family film adaptation of the show's \"cynical and gross\" style of humor was deemed unfit and would have likely ran into creative issues with creator John Kricfalusi (who would be forced out several months after the deal was announced). Fox's film deal with Nick expired when Viacom purchased the network, along with Paramount Pictures, in 1994 leaving Paramount to distribute and co-produce the network's theatrically released films.\n|-\n| Doug || Untitled Doug film || Nickelodeon was also making a Doug film adaptation in 1993 when they made a deal with Fox to make films based on their properties along with films, but the plans evaporated when Viacom acquired Paramount Pictures in 1994, and the deal expired in the following year.

The series was being developed by Roustabout Productions, a newly formed animation company. According to Nick Dubois, creative director and co-founder of Roustabout, the series would take a lighthearted approach with tongue-in-cheek humor. A clip was created but the series was never produced due to Fox Kids signing an exclusive deal with Marvel Comics. The clip aired in commercials for Youngblood action figures.\n|-\n| Cyberforce || A Cyberforce TV series was proposed aside with the Youngblood TV series, but was scrapped alongside it for the same reason.\n|}\n1995\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150pt;\"| Series || style=\"width:100pt;\"| Title || Description\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Feature film || Betty of the Jungle'' || In 1995, animator Bill Kopp (creator of Fox Kids' Eek! the Cat, The Terrible Thunderlizards and Mad Jack The Pirate) pitched an idea for an original adult animated film called Betty of the Jungle, in which he describes it as a sexy George of the Jungle about jungle warrior woman Betty (set to be voiced by Loni Anderson) and her gun-caring poodle (set to be voiced by Bruce Willis) who battle evil to protect their jungle village.

Stine. It was going to be produced by 20th Century Fox and DreamWorks Pictures, but was later scrapped because it did not materialize since they could not find a script they liked or determine which book or monster to adapt. Years later, in 2015, Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation made a Goosebumps film directed by Rob Letterman, along with a sequel in 2018.\n|}\n1999\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150pt;\"| Series || style=\"width:100pt;\"| Title || Description\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Feature film || Inferno: Rebellion in Hell || In 1999, Fox Animation had optioned ''Barlowe's Inferno'' by Wayne Barlowe into a potential adult animated film that would follow one man's journey into Hell.\n|-\n| Rhapsody || Fox Animation had intended to produce an animated film based on the first installment of the Rhapsody trilogy by Elizabeth Haydon.

The project was envisioned as a comedy with both live action and animated elements, and an original storyline that would combine details from several Berenstain'' books. According to Levy: \"I'd like the film to be un-ironic about its family connections but have a wry comedic sensibility that isn't oblivious to the fact that they're bears\". Comparing it to the film Elf, Levy said he thought the Berenstain Bears film would be \"witty but never sarcastic\". As of January 2012, the project was reportedly in the script phase, but the company's option has since expired.\n|}\n2010s\n2011\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150pt;\"| Series || style=\"width:100pt;\"| Title || Description\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Feature film || Mutts || In 2011, Blue Sky Studios announced a film adaptation of the comic strip, Mutts.
