The sculpture weighs 5000 pounds and the total weight including the framework is 8000 pounds.\nThe inscription on the back of the arm reads:\nMONUMENT\nTO\nJOE LOUIS\nBY\nROBERT GRAHAM\nA GIFT FROM SPORTS ILLUSTRATED\nTO THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF\nDETROIT. THE DETROIT INSTITUTE OF\nARTS AND ITS FOUNDERS SOCIETY\nON THE OCCASION OF THE MUSEUM'S\nCENTENNIAL. 1885-1985.\nIt represents the power of his punch both inside and outside the ring. Because of Louis' efforts to fight Jim Crow laws, the fist was symbolically intended as a statement against racism. Graham referred to the sculpture as a \"battering ram\".  It is claimed to be an historical metaphor, even down to its placement (pointing toward Canada).\nThe sculpture was vandalized by two white men in 2004, who covered it in white paint and left a sign which read, \"Courtesy of Fighting Whities\". Graham responded that the piece was \"working\" if it aroused passion.\nThe sculpture is one of two monuments in Detroit honoring Joe Louis. The other is a full-size statue of Louis located inside the Huntington Place convention center.\nIn popular culture\nIn 2013, Detroit-based artist Jerry Vile placed a 4-ft. tall can of Crisco in front of the monument with a statement indicating it was for \"helping to ease the pain of Detroit's bankruptcy.\" Many interpreted the can as a reference to fisting, a sex act in which Crisco is sometimes used as lubricant.\nReferences"
