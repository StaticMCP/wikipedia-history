He also played in the Southern League for Coventry City and was nicknamed \"Tubby\". He was described as \"a great centre-forward\" who possessed \"an invaluable capacity for keeping opposing defences guessing\".\nPersonal life\nAs of 1901, Warren was working as a plumber in Hinckley. He married in 1903 and had two children before his wife died in 1915. At the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Warren was the licensed victualler of the Three Tuns Inn, Hinckley. In December 1915, 18 months after the outbreak of the war, he enlisted in the Army Reserve and remarried in 1916 and had another child. In April 1917, Warren was posted to the Western Front as a private in the Army Service Corps and was killed just one month later in the Loos Salient, while serving with the York and Lancaster Regiment. He was buried in Philosophe British Cemetery, Mazingarbe.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|Leicester Fosse\n|1903–04\n|Second Division\n|21\n|7\n|0\n|0\n|21\n|7\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Coventry City\n|1907–08\n|Southern League First Division\n|6\n|6\n|0\n|0\n|6\n|6\n|-\n|1908–09\n|Southern League First Division\n|31\n|15\n|2\n|1\n|33\n|16\n|-\n|1909–10\n|Southern League First Division\n|17\n|9\n|5\n|2\n|22\n|11\n|-\n|1910–11\n|Southern League First Division\n|25\n|7\n|0\n|0\n|25\n|7\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!73\n!31\n!7\n!3\n!80\n!34\n|-\n|Stockport County\n|1911–12\n|Second Division\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!97\n!38\n!7\n!3\n!104\n!41\n|}\nHonours\nNuneaton Town\n* Atherstone Nursing Cup: 1912–13\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
