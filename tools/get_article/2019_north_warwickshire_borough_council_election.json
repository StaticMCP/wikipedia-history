It was held on the same day as other local elections in the UK. It resulted in the Conservative Party retaining control of the council.\nBoth the Conservative and Labour parties saw increases in their vote share, especially the former, which was likely due to UKIP losing nearly 20% of their vote share. The Conservatives lost one seat to Labour but still retained a majority of seats.\nSummary\nElection result\n1\n|votes %       =54.5\n|seats %       =60.0\n|votes         =16,266\n|plus/minus    =+10.5\n}}\n1\n|votes %       =41.4\n|seats %       =40.0\n|votes         =12,358\n|plus/minus    =+5.0\n}}\n|votes %       =2.4\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =731\n|plus/minus    =–15.3\n}}\n|votes %       =0.9\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =224\n|plus/minus    =±0.0\n}}\n|votes %       =0.7\n|seats %       =0.0\n|votes         =221\n|plus/minus    =–0.3\n}}\n|-\nWard results\nArley and Whitacre\nAtherstone Central\nAtherstone North\nAtherstone South and Mancetter\nBaddesley and Grendon\nColeshill North\nColeshill South\nCurdworth\nDordon\nFillongley\nHartshill\nHurley and Wood End\nKingsbury\nNewton Regis and Warton\nPolesworth East\nPolesworth West\nWater Orton\nReferences"
