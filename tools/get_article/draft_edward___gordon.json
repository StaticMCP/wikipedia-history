It is based on the story of the same name and Edward's Day Out from The Railway Series book The Three Railway Engines.\nPlot\nEdward is an old, blue mixed-traffic tender engine who lives in a shed with four other engines and is feeling sad as he has not been out in a long time. Gordon boasts about Edward never being chosen to go out again in favour of bigger and stronger engines. One summer day, the driver and fireman see how upset he is, so they choose him over the other engines. Edward has a wonderful day pulling some coaches. The coaches are very impressed with Edward, as is his crew. That night in the sheds, Edward tells the other engines that he will go out again the next day but falls asleep before he can find out what they think of it.\nNext morning, Gordon is bragging to Edward. He tells the old engine to watch him rush by with the express that afternoon. Edward ignores him and goes to shunt trucks in the yard. Later, Edward sees Gordon pass by the yard but, instead of pulling coaches, Gordon is pulling a goods train which makes him very cross. Edward laughs about this and goes back to work.\nA porter soon calls Edward to help Gordon, who is stuck on a hill. Gordon's driver and fireman talk to their engine severely. When Edward arrives, Gordon does not think that he can help. The train is brought down to the bottom of the hill and then both engines puff together up it. All the while, Gordon persistently complains but, to his surprise, they reach the top. Gordon thunders away at high speed, cheering for himself and leaves Edward far behind, having forgotten about him. Out of breath, Edward slowly runs into a siding at Maron Station, where the crew give him a nice, long drink and promise to reward him with a new coat of blue paint with red stripes the next day.\nExternal links"
