It was opened with only a basic wood platform and shelter in connection with the adjacent granite quarry and the associated worker's houses.  Its later traffic was entirely walkers and like Ingra Tor Halt it was retained in an attempt to counter competition from local bus services and encourage tourist traffic.\nHistory\nThe branch line was authorised in 1878 and opened on 11 August 1883.  was the junction for the line when the halt opened, three other stations had been added to the line in the 1920s,  in 1924,  in 1936. Much of the route followed the course of the old Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway. King Tor Halt was opened almost on the site of the old Royal Oak Sidings.\nThe freight traffic on the branch line included granite from the rail served quarries of Swelltor and Foggintor which were closed in 1906.\nOwned by the Princetown Railway until 1 January 1922, the company then merged with the Great Western Railway (GWR). The line passed to British Railways (Western Region) in 1948 and closed on 3 March 1956. The track was lifted during winter of 1956/7.\nMuch of the old track formation now forms the route of the Dousland to Princetown Railway Track, and only the concrete base of the shelter at the halt remains.\nServices\n}}\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Sources\n* Atterbury, P.
