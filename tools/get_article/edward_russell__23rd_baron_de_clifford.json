He was baptised on 27 May 1824 at Ratley, Warwickshire, England and, then educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. On his father's side, he was related to the Dukes of Bedford, and was a second cousin of the Prime Minister during his term in parliament, John Russell, 1st Earl Russell.\nIn 1853, he married Harriet Agnes Elliot, daughter of Admiral Sir Charles Elliot and Clara Genevieve née Windsor. They had at least four children: Maud Clara Russell (1853–1947); Edward Southwell Russell (1855–1894); Charles Somerset Russell (1857–1886); and Katherine Russell (1861–1950).\nRussell was elected a Whig Member of Parliament for Tavistock in 1847 and held the seat until 1852 when he did not seek re-election.\nHe became the 23rd Baron de Clifford upon the death of his mother in 1874. After his death three years later, the title passed to his son and namesake, Edward Southwell Russell. At this point, his will was proven by probate at under £90,000.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
