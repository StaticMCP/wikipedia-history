The ward was named after Netherfield Road, a key thoroughfare in the area.\nIn 1973, as part of a wider reorganization of Liverpool’s wards, Netherfield was abolished and its areas were merged into newly drawn wards. The restructuring aimed to modernize the city's electoral boundaries.\nGeography\nNetherfield ward was located in the northern part of Liverpool, covering areas around Netherfield Road and parts of Everton. It was bordered by the Everton, St. Domingo, and Brockfield wards. The area was historically residential, with close links to Liverpool’s docks and city centre.\nLegacy\nThough the ward no longer exists, its name remains associated with Netherfield Road, a historically significant part of Liverpool. The electoral changes of 1973 marked a shift in the city’s political landscape, with older wards like Netherfield being absorbed into broader constituencies.\nElections\n1914\n1919\n1920\n1921\n1922\n1923\n1924\n1925\n1926\n1927\n1928\n1929\n1930\n1931\n1932\n1933\n1934\n1935\n1936\n1937\n1938\n1945\n1946\n1947\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\n1961\n1962\n3%}}\n19%|}}\n3%|}}\n1963\n1964\n1965\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1969\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1975\n1976\n1978\nReferences"
