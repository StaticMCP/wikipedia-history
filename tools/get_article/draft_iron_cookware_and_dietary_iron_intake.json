When heated in acidic liquid or moist foods, small amounts of iron are released and absorbed into the dish, similarly to conventional cast iron cookware. Iron-containing cookware has been used in several regions as a low-cost dietary approach for populations at risk of iron deficiency anaemia.\nA 2021 systematic review of thirteen studies found that cooking food in iron-containing cookware—including cast-iron pots and small iron ingots—consistently increased the iron content of food and, in several trials, improved haemoglobin levels in children and adults vulnerable to iron deficiency.\nRandomised controlled trials from Ethiopia, Brazil and India have shown that daily use of iron cookware can increase haemoglobin levels or reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia, particularly among young children and other vulnerable groups.\nModern commercial ingots\nSeveral modern products are manufactured as compact cast-iron ingots designed to increase the iron content of food when boiled or simmered in liquid. These tools operate on the same principle as traditional cast-iron cookware but are shaped for convenience, portability and ease of use in small households.\nOne widely used contemporary example is the Iron Egg, a small cast-iron ingot intended for home cooking. It is designed to be placed in boiling water, soups or sauces so that a controlled amount of iron is released into the food. The ingot’s compact form allows it to function independently of full-size pots and pans, enabling iron supplementation even in kitchens that do not regularly use cast-iron cookware.\nOther manufacturers produce comparable cast-iron ingots and weighted implements for dietary iron fortification, but they generally follow the same principle: providing a reusable, heat-stable source of iron that can be added to cooking vessels as needed.\nDesign and use\nModern cast-iron ingots used for dietary iron fortification are typically produced in simple geometric or rounded shapes that maximise surface contact with boiling liquid. The Iron Egg exemplifies this approach: a compact, smooth cast-iron form that can be added to a cooking pot to increase the iron content of the dish.\nThese ingots are usually pre-seasoned or coated with a thin layer of oil to reduce rusting between uses. During cooking, the ingot is submerged in liquid for a set period of time, after which it can be cleaned, dried and reused. Because they operate independently of pan size or material, such ingots are intended as a flexible alternative to full-size cast-iron cookware.\nMechanism of iron release\nIron leaching from cookware occurs when moisture, acidity or heat causes a small amount of iron to dissolve into the cooking liquid or food. Foods with higher acidity—such as tomato-based sauces—tend to absorb greater quantities of iron, whereas neutral or low-acid foods absorb smaller amounts. The process is comparable across cast-iron pots, pans and iron ingots, although the exact iron contribution depends on cooking time, food composition and the condition of the cookware.\nHistory\nIron cookware has been used globally for centuries, with cast-iron vessels documented in Asia, Europe and Africa. Their ability to increase the iron content of food was noted in public health programmes during the twentieth century, particularly in regions where iron deficiency anaemia was widespread. Interest in compact iron ingots emerged in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries as part of broader efforts to provide low-cost household strategies for improving dietary iron intake.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.theironegg.com Official website of The Iron Egg] – example of a modern cast-iron ingot\nReferences"
