The right–wing Social Revolutionary Abram Gotz was elected Chairman of the committee.\nThe committee distributed anti–Bolshevik leaflets, supported the strike of civil servants and the campaign of Kerensky–Krasnov to Petrograd, organized an armed uprising of junkers in Petrograd itself, the Mensheviks and Socialist–Revolutionaries who left the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets and others.\nAccording to John Reed's testimony, the committee had already posted a petition in Petrograd on November 8 stating the illegality of the Bolshevik government, declared its intention to recreate the Provisional Government, which \"will bring the country to the Constituent Assembly and save it from counter-revolution and anarchy\", and urged citizens not to recognize illegal power Bolsheviks and stand up \"to defend the homeland and revolution\".\nOn October 29, the Committee for the Salvation of the Homeland and the Revolution launched an anti-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd. The Engineering Castle became the center of the uprising, and the main armed force – the cadets of the Nikolaev Engineering School who were stationed in it. Georgy Polkovnikov, the commander of the Petrograd Military District, deposed by the Bolsheviks, declared himself the commander of the \"rescue forces\" and, by his order, forbade parts of the district to obey the orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee. For some time, the rebels managed to seize the telephone station and disconnect Smolny, arrest part of the commissars of the Military Revolutionary Committee and begin disarming the Red Guards. However, the bulk of the troops of the Petrograd garrison did not join the uprising. By 11 a.m. on October 29, the forces of the Military Revolutionary Committee recaptured the telephone exchange and surrounded the Engineering Castle with superior forces. The uprising was finally suppressed by the morning of October 30.\nIn parallel, the forces of the Military Revolutionary Committee blocked a number of cadet schools in Petrograd, which in some cases was accompanied by victims. Particularly stubborn resistance was provided by the Vladimir School, where up to 200 people died on both sides, during the assault artillery was used.\nAt the end of November 1917, the committee was transformed into the \"Union for the Defense of the Constituent Assembly\", which also included representatives of other parties; the right-wing Social Revolutionary Vasily Filippovsky became the chairman. After the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the Union self-destructed.\nSee also\n*Uprising of junkers in Petrograd\n*Regional Committee in Protection of Revolution in Ukraine\nSources\n*[https://bigenc.ru/domestic_history/text/2085114 The Committee for the Salvation of the Homeland and the Revolution] / Lyudmila Novikova // Great Russian Encyclopedia: in 35 Volumes / Editor-in-Chief Yuri Osipov – Moscow: Great Russian Encyclopedia, 2004–2017\n*[https://bigenc.ru/domestic_history/text/4245721 Union of Defense of the Constituent Assembly] / Vasily Kudryakov // Great Russian Encyclopedia: in 35 Volumes / Editor-in-Chief Yuri Osipov – Moscow: Great Russian Encyclopedia, 2004–2017\n*"
