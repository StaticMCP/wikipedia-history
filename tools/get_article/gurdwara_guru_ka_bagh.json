A shrine commemorative of the first meeting of  Tegh Bahadur and Gobind Singh was established here. Its present building was constructed during the 1970s and 1980s. An old well which is still in use and a dried stump of the Imli tree under which the sangat met Guru Tegh Bahadur still exists.\nSee also\n*Akal Takht\n*Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib\n*Takht Sri Damdama Sahib\n*Takht Sri Hazur Sahib\n*Takhat Shiri Patna Sahib\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120217005152/http://www.takhatpatnasahib.com/Gurdwara-Guru-Ka-Bagh.aspx Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110808112424/http://www.sridasamgranth.com/ Sri Dasam Granth ], The Sri Dasam Granth Sahib website"
