The album peaked at number 99 on the ARIA Charts.\nReception\nThe Allmusic review by Ned Raggett awarded the album 3 stars and states \"Kuepper's all-around abilities — he plays all the guitars and most of the bass — readily come to the fore, with his own particular combination of psychedelic murk and straightforward playing in evidence throughout. It resists all trends, and all for the better at that\".\n}}\nTrack listing\n:All compositions by Ed Kuepper except as indicated\n# \"Confession of a Window Cleaner\"&nbsp;– 5:49\n# \"Pissed Off\"&nbsp;– 3:09\n# \"Highway to Hell\" (Bon Scott, Angus Young, Malcolm Young)&nbsp;– 5:08\n# \"Messin' Pt.
