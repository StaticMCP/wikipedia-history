It's the proverbial rollercoaster of kung fu, magic, monsters, humor, tension, visual spectacle and gruesome bits.\"\nCraig Lines of Den of Geek wrote that Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain \"was a significant film for the Hong Kong 'New Wave' movement that revolutionized the industry in the late '70s\", characterized by \"young filmmakers [who] broke free from the traditional studio system to create weird, energetic and experimental movies\". Lines praised the actors' performances and the martial arts choreography, and noted the film's \"warm, full-hearted message of kindness and acceptance\".\nThe film is considered an influence on John Carpenter's 1986 film Big Trouble in Little China.\nHome media\nThe U.K. release of the DVD by Hong Kong Legends features an audio commentary with Tsui Hark and film critic Bey Logan.\nThe Hong Kong release of the DVD by Fortune Star Media features the Cantonese version of the film's trailer, as well as an interview with actor Yuen Biao.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
