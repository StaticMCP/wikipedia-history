It included the area of what is now Manchester city centre and the adjoining area of Ancoats.\nIn 1792 commissioners, usually known as police commissioners, were established for the improvement of the township. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the municipal borough of Manchester was established in 1838 as a local authority area, and included the townships of Manchester, Beswick, Cheetham, Chorlton-on-Medlock and Hulme.\nReferences"
