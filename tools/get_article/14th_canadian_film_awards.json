The ceremony was hosted by Andrew Stewart, Chairman of the Board of Broadcast Governors.\nFor this year's awards, there were 137 entries from 39 producers, with the greatest increase in the Training and Instruction category. The roster of 55 judges in Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa was maintained. Also ongoing was the stream of memos and letters to the CFA suggesting that it change its categories, judging criteria and, most significantly, its position that films not be judged on their quality, but on whether or not they achieved their stated purpose. CFA management discussed all suggestions but maintained its position.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: Not awarded\n*Feature Film: No entries submitted\n*Theatrical Short: Morning on the Lièvre — National Film Board of Canada, David Bairstow producer and director\n*TV Information: William Lyon Mackenzie: A Friend to His Country — National Film Board of Canada, Julian Biggs producer and director\n*TV Entertainment: Word Game — Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Philip Keatley producer\n*Films for Children: Dance Squared — National Film Board of Canada, Frank Spiller producer, René Jodoin director\n*Travel and Recreation: Glooscap Country — Nova Scotia Information Service, Margaret Perry producer and director\n*General Information: Circle of the Sun — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Colin Low director\n*Public Relations: Campus on the Move — Crawley Films, Peter Cock producer and director\n::Abitibi — Crawley Films, F.
