It was established by the Constitution of 1946, dissolved by the Constitution of 1958 and replaced with the current-day Senate.\nHistory\nThe constitution of the Fourth Republic, which came into force in 1946, stipulated that parliament was bicameral. The upper house was named the \"Council of the Republic\" (as opposed to the Senate of the Third Republic) and was granted greatly diminished powers.\nRole\nThe council did not have the power to make laws, which was the responsibility of the National Assembly. The council was mainly consultative, and bills were only given a single reading at the council before being passed.\nHowever, it did share responsibility should the need arose to amend the constitution in matters regarding the election of the President of the Republic. A formal notice to the council was required to declare war.\nIn 1954, the Constitution was amended to provided that all bills would be examined successively by the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic, essentially restoring full legislative powers to the latter.\nComposition\nMembers of the Council were known as '\"councillors\" (conseiller) from 1946 to 1948, and then \"senators\" from 1948 onwards. The number of senators had to be between 250 and 320. Senators were elected by indirect universal suffrage: five-sixths were elected by communes and departments; the other one-sixth were elected by the National Assembly, the lower house. They served six-year terms.\nPresident\nThe President was the presiding officer of the council.\nPolitical Party:\n|MRP|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Rad-Soc|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2|Portrait\n! width=200|Name\n! width=120|Took office\n! width=120|Left office\n! width=120|Political Party\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"| 1\n|  || Auguste Champetier de Ribes || 27 December 1946 || 6 March 1947 || MRP\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"| 2\n|  || Gaston Monnerville || 18 March 1947 || 4 October 1958 || Rad-Soc\n|}\nReferences\nNotes"
