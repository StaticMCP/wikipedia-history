The United Kingdom closed its embassy in Syria in 2012, and the Embassy of Syria, London was closed the following year. After the fall of the Assad regime, the resumption of relations was announced in July 2025.\nHistory\n20th century\nWorld War I and Deir ez-Zor occupation\nDuring World War I, the United Kingdom played a significant role in the Allied victory in Syria, collaborating with Arab Sharifian Army during the Arab Revolt, which was supported by British Army officer T. E. Lawrence. This partnership helped secure major victories, including the capture of Damascus in 1918.\nFollowing the war, the implementation of the Sykes-Picot Agreement shaped the division of the region, granting Britain influence outside Syria. On 11 January 1919, British forces occupied Deir ez-Zor, annexing it to Iraq. However, local resistance, supported by Iraqi officers and tribes, culminated in the city's liberation on 27 December 1919, as British troops withdrew to Iraq.\nWorld War II and Levant Crisis\nIn 1941, the British launched the Syria-Lebanon Campaign to counter Vichy French influence in the region, fearing it could bolster Axis powers. British troops, alongside Free French forces and Commonwealth allies, successfully invaded Syria and Lebanon, driving out Vichy French forces and establishing control under the Free French government.\nThe British later became involved in the Levant Crisis of 1945, as tensions between the French and Syrians escalated. When French forces bombarded Damascus in May 1945 to suppress growing independence movements, the British intervened militarily, pressuring the French to withdraw. This intervention paved the way for Syrian independence and the end of French colonial rule, solidifying Britain's role in shaping the region's post-war order.\n1950s\nOn 6 November 1956, during the Suez Crisis, a Royal Air Force Canberra PR.7 was sent to overfly Syria on a photo reconnaissance mission, and was shot down by a Syrian Air Force Gloster Meteor. As of 2022, this was the last RAF aircraft shot down in an enemy air-to-air engagement.\n21st century\nBa'athist Syria\nAsma al-Assad was born and raised in England.]]\nIn 2001, positive relations were developed between Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Syrian government, as part of the War on Terror.\nIn 2002, President Bashar al-Assad made an official visit to the United Kingdom, the first Syrian leader to do so. He and his wife Asma met with Queen Elizabeth II.\nIn 2003, the British Syrian Society was established in London by Fawaz Akhras, father-in-law of Bashar al-Assad.\nSyrian civil war\nin November 2015.]]\nSince the emergence of Syrian civil war in 2011, relations have deteriorated, and the UK was one of the first countries to recognise the opposition as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. The Embassy of Syria in London closed in 2013.\nIn 2018, the UK took part in the missile strikes against Syria alongside the United States and France.\nIn March 2021, the British Government placed sanctions on key allies of Assad.\nPost-Assad regime\nBritish prime minister Keir Starmer and foreign secretary David Lammy welcomed the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024. A week later, the UK announced a £50 million aid package to support food, shelter, healthcare, and restoring essential services in Syria.\nIn January 2025, the UK took part in the Riyadh meetings on Syria, which focused on addressing the ongoing situation in Syria and exploring measures to promote stability in the country. During the meetings, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy held talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani. Two months later, the United Kingdom pledged an additional £160 million to Syria for aid.\nOn 24 April 2025, the UK lifted sanctions on several Syrian government agencies, including the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Defense, and the General Intelligence Service, as well as the police, air force, military, and state-run media.\nOn 5 July 2025, British foreign secretary Lammy announced that relations would be reestablished during a visit to Damascus. In addition, the United Kingdom pledged £94.5 million to provide urgent humanitarian aid, support Syria's long-term recovery, and assist neighboring countries hosting Syrian refugees.
