A Conservative, he was re-elected in 1911 and 1917 but was defeated in 1921. He was re-elected again in 1925 and 1926. He died in office in 1929. In 1921, he was the Minister presiding over the Department of Health and Minister of Immigration and Colonization.\nIn 1918, Edwards, and later William Folger Nickle, raised concerns in Parliament about Chief Justice Charles Fitzpatrick's use of a $2,500 allowance to cover travel costs to England to sit as a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, despite not attending any sittings. Edwards accused Fitzpatrick of \"deliberately stealing from the treasury of the country and putting the money in...[his] own pockets\" Fitzpatrick and Prime Minister Robert Borden responded that there was no legal issue and that Fitzpatrick had acted in good faith. When Edwards revived the issue the following year, Fitzpatrick, by then Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, returned the allowance.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
