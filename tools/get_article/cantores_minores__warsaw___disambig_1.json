Herter, with the help of Ryszard Gieros and Alfred Stefankiewicz. From almost the very beginning, it has been affiliated with St. John’s Archcathedral in Warsaw. In 2016, Ryszard Gieros was replaced by Henryk Grocholski, a long-time member of the choir, as President of the Board of the Cantores Minores Choral Association. Another long-time member of the choir, Franciszek Kubicki, took over the post of conductor, with Jakub Szafrański as his assistant. Joseph Herter received the title 'Honorary Conductor – Founder of Cantores Minores' and Ryszard Gieros – 'Honorary President of the Board – Founder of Cantores Minores'.\nRepertoire\nThe choir has a broad repertoire including Gregorian chant, a cappella sacred works (for Lent and Advent, Passion songs, Christmas carols), sacred compositions with the accompaniment of organ and other instruments, as well as patriotic and popular songs.\nThe choir sings at the 11:00&nbsp;a.m. Mass at St. John’s Archcathedral every fourth Sunday of the month as well as during major church holidays.
