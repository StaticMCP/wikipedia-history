Other traditions say that the present-day Lozi were called Aluyana, and that the Makololo termed them Malozi in the 19th century which was subsequently adopted. Historian Mutumba Mainga considered the latter to be true, given that the language of the king's court was Siluyana. The name Rotse is a European rendering of Lozi.\nIn this article, Luyana is used to refer to the modern-day Lozi before the Makololo conquest and rule in the mid-19th century; Lozi is used after that point and in reference to the present.\nGeography\nnear Mongu]]\nLozi territory (Barotseland) encompasses southwestern Zambia, which consists of Kalahari desert and shrubland. The Zambezi River runs north to south, surrounded by the Bulozi Floodplain (Ngulu) which has an abundance of alluvial deposits. The Zambezi floods annually between January and May. The Plain is flanked by forests on either side which lie on higher ground. Various tributaries of the Zambezi run across the Plain, creating small valleys.\nHistory\nOrigins\nLozi tradition further editions were published in 1922, 1934, 1939, and 1951. The work served to make Lozi identity and royalism inseparable, and plays a central role in the contemporary independence movement.}} holds that they were the first people in the Bulozi Floodplain, having always inhabited it since descending from Nyambe (God) and Mbuyu (a female ancestor). Genetic evidence however supports a migration from western DR Congo in accordance with the Bantu expansion model. Traditions of other groups, such as the Kazembe-Lunda, Ndembu-Lunda, and Nkoya, say that the Luyana/Lozi state traced its roots back to the Mwata Yamvo dynasty of the Lunda Empire. Historians Mutumba Mainga, Bizeck Phiri, and Lawrence Flint all lend credence to this; most groups in Zambia trace their origin to the Congo Basin.}} Lozi traditions mention a small people called bo Mbonezi Kai, likely a reference to the Khoisan.\nLozi tradition says that the Plain was inhabited by two broad groups: northerners and southerners (who were organised into chiefdoms). Northerners included the Muenyi, Imilangu, Ndundulu, Mbowe, Liuwa, Simaa, Makoma, and Nyengo, while southerners included the Subiya, Mbukushu, Toka, Totela, Shanjo, and Fwe. Both groups are linguistically (and probably ethnically) distinct, with southerners linguistically similar to Tonga in Southern Province, whose speakers arrived earlier, and northerners somewhat linguistically similar to Luba in DR Congo. Mainga says that a Lunda dynasty arrived in the northern Plain, likely in the late-16th century, and draws comparisons to groups within the Nkoya and Luvale who received Lunda dynasties following Lunda prince Cinyama's departure after the Lunda-Luba merger which happened in the late-15th or 16th centuries. Due to similarities Lunda states such as Kazembe share with the main Lunda state that are not found in the Lozi state, Mainga theorizes that the Lozi-Lunda left soon after the merge out of disillusionment, while the other states were founded later as part of a policy of expansion and maintained ties with the main state. Mainga also considers the dynasty to have spoken a similar language to Siluyana, which was native to earlier people on northern Plain, or to have adopted Siluyana as their court language.\nLozi tradition says that members of the familial dynasty rose to power among groups in the northwestern modern-day Kalabo District,}} whether by overthrowing local leaders or by negotiating local political systems.}} A leader named Mboo Mwanasilundu Muyunda became paramount, and is regarded as the first Litunga (king), dated to the 17th century. One strain of tradition says that Mbuyu was preceded by fourteen queens over the course of three generations (with Nasilele as the first queen), indicating high political instability.}} According to tradition, Mboo conquered the Mishulundu, Namale, Imulangu, Upangoma, Liuwa, Muenyi, and Mambowe (all located in Kalabo District at this time), though his expansion was halted at the Luena Flats by Sihokanalinanga (likely Nkoya leader Sihoka) and his people. Tradition says that Mboo's \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" administered their own provinces, akin to a confederation, and created their own Makolo (groups of men that served as armies or labourers, which likely began as bands of followers). Disputes within the royal dynasty caused two groups to leave and found their own polities. One of these was led by Mwanambinyi, Mboo's younger brother. Traditions represent his power struggle with Mboo as a series of contests, during which he uses supernatural powers to best Mboo, provoking Mboo's hatred and jealousy. After Mwanambinyi survives a murder attempt by Mboo, he flees with his followers (called Akwanda or Makwanda) to Imatongo in modern-day Senanga District, and conquers the Mbukushu and Subiya.}} The second group to leave was led by Mange, Mboo's nephew, who is said to have left because he was excluded from government. Accordingly they went east across the Zambezi, and then southwards once nearer the Luena River until reaching a forest in modern-day Mongu District. Mange was said to have been a skilled hunter.}}\nExpansion\nOver the course of the next few generations, royal prestige and power strengthened, and a royal cult developed. Institutions were borrowed from other groups and created by certain Litungas.}} During the reign of Yeta I (the third Litunga) all Makolo came under his control, and new ones could only be created by the monarch. Lozi tradition credits Ngalama (the fourth Litunga) with expanding the state and conquering the polities of Mwanambinyi and Mange. Tradition represents Mwanambinyi as hiding in mist or creating floods or droughts which hamper Ngalama's forces, until attrition by war causes him and his followers to \"disappear into the ground\" at Imatongo.}}}} The conquest of Mange happens after a series of defeats and Mange's dispute with his mother Nolea over a woman, which lead Nolea to surrender Mange's protective charms to Ngalama. Mange's followers were called Akangwa Mange (\"those who failed Mange\"), now the . Mutumba Mainga considers these narratives to refer to real historical events. This saw the Luyana overcome rival centres of secular and ritual power to gain control of the entire Plain.\nFollowing the conquests of Mwanambinyi and Mange, challenges arose in the administration of the newly-acquired land. The distance of Mwanambinyi's lands in the south from the capital proved the prior system of appointing commoners as Manduna to administer territories ineffective, and groups such as the Subiya gained autonomy. To address this, Ngombala (the sixth Litunga) established another centre of power in the south at Libumbu or Libumbwandinde. Tradition says that Notulu, Ngombala's daughter, was the first southern ruler, and details dynastic conflict between Notulu and her brother Mbanga; Mainga says that this may conceal revolts by the southern groups. Mbanga is said to have come to rule after Notulu's abdication, with it centred on Nalolo. This southern 'kingdom' (called Lwambi) remained subordinate to the Litunga's rule (called Namuso). Having consolidated his control over the Plain, Ngombala launched extensive military campaigns. The Plain was the economic heart of the region as it was linked to the wider region via the Zambezi's many tributaries, though the Luyana still relied on the forest communities to import wood, canoes, beeswax, and various other goods. This incentivised the Luyana to conquer the surrounding communities, who were relatively decentralised and struggled to mount effective opposition. Ngombala first campaigned in the south to reconquer the Subiya and Mbukushu, and expanded further into modern-day Sesheke District to reach Musi o Tunya (Victoria Falls). They then went west along the Chobe River to conquer the Mashi, Jalla's Litaba says that it was Ngombala who appointed Ilishua to the Kwando Valley.}} then north to conquer the Makoma. Ngombala's forces met the Mbunda, conquering some of them and forming an alliance with an Mbunda leader named Yambayamba. In these newly-conquered lands, Ngombala established a system of tribute wherein people were obligated to send some of what they produced to the Plain, as well as young men and women for labour. This greatly increased the wealth of the Litunga.\nDecline of royal power and Makololo conquest\nOver time, power gradually shifted from the Litunga to the state bureaucracy, putting the king in precarious situations which necessitated compromises. Though there wasn't initially a system for redistribution of tribute throughout the kingdom, later Litungas were pressured by the bureaucracy to weaken their monopoly.}} Yubya (the seventh Litunga) introduced measures where Manduna (singular: Induna) who collected the tribute could keep part of it. The ninth Litunga, Mwananyanda (r. ?c. 1780), oversaw friction between different factions of the royal family and Manduna, to which he responded with violent suppression and executions, and he is said to have killed the Ngambela and his own brother. Civil war erupted between Mwananyanda and the Lwambi ruler Mwanamatia, during which Mwanamatia was killed, allowing Mwananyanda to appoint the new Lwambi ruler (Kusio). Southern groups regularly took opportunities to revolt during internal conflict, seeking to weaken Luyana authority.\nMulambwa (the tenth Litunga, r. c. 1780c. 1830) challenged Mwananyanda and succeeded him to the title, also seeing off Lwambi ruler Kusio. He introduced a law that required the Litunga to provide for Makolo during war and reward them with cattle on their return, as well as one about compensating family members of deceased soldiers with slaves and other loot.}} Mulambwa also began giving secret prior-warning to those condemned in a bid to win popularity with the public, and made an alliance with the Nkoya, settling some of them in the Plain. Mulambwa faced extensive revolts early on which he defeated, and gave Nkoya king Katusi a seat in the Kuta (national council). In the south near modern-day Sesheke District he defeated and expelled a group led by Mwana Mukasa (possibly a Tswana ruler of Tawana). After this Mulambwa found himself in a long, drawn-out conflict against Luvale ruler Cinyama. (Mulambwa, slaves) In the early-19th century, two Mbunda groups led by Mwene Kandala and Mwene Ciyengele migrated to the Plain, seeking protection. Mulambwa welcomed them and gave the rulers seats in the Kuta, and Ciyengele was raised to the status of a prince. The Mbunda were instrumental in defeating the Luvale, and assisted Mulambwa in several other conflicts. Despite this, the attempt to integrate the Mbunda into the state caused problems, partly because the state's legitimacy relied upon adherence to the Luyana ideology of kingship, wherein ancestor worship at the Royal Graves (Litino) was paramount; while the Mbunda believed in ancestral spirits, their religious beliefs attributed misfortune to witchcraft and valued divination. Thus the Mbunda rulers were nicknamed Na yange nji Mwene (\"I too am king\").}}\nTowards the end of Mulambwa's reign, the Luyana state found itself in perilous crisis. Lozi tradition says that an old and nearly-blind Mulambwa cursed the population and prophesised that they would be ruled over by people with walking sticks, and then by people with books. Mulambwa's death caused a succession crisis, wherein empowered senior Manduna acted as kingmakers, and several factions were realised. The title was contested by Silumelume in the north and Lwambi ruler Mubukwanu in the south (both sons of Mulambwa), threatening civil war. Silumelume was declared Litunga by Ngambela (Prime Minister) Muswa, though his position remained insecure. To strengthen his position, Silumelume planned to attack Mubukwanu, and made preparations by sending the Makolo (armies) of two northern Manduna supportive of Mubukwanu out of the Plain to fight the Ila. One of the Manduna's Likolo included the Mbunda, and after uncovering Silumelume's plan the Induna informed Mwene Ciyengele. Ciyengele liaised with Mubukwanu, seeking clarification. Silumelume, who had expected the Mbunda to remain neutral, grew suspicious and repeated the order to Ciyengele; Ciyengele responded that they ought to undergo a formal send-off before leaving the Plain. At the Kuta in the capital, the Mbunda performed their war dances while wearing their war-dress; during the ceremony an Mbunda shot Silumelume dead with an arrow.\nBefore all this, the Makololo (a Sotho people) reached an area near the Chobe/Kwando/Linyanti River, having fled the Mfecane from modern-day South Africa's Free State in 1823. Reportedly there was a clash between the Makololo and a Luyana army that had been sent out, which the Makololo repelled. The Makololo, led by Sebetwane, settled there for some time before moving into modern-day Southern Province by crossing the Zambezi at Kazungula. There on the Batoka Plateau they were resisted by the Toka who they defeated. The Makololo then advanced towards the Kafue River, though were repelled by the Ila. They settled on the Batoka Plateau for some time before being confronted by the Matebele, who had also fled the Mfecane. The presence of the Makololo and Matebele in the south prevented the Luyana from raiding the Toka and Ila for cattle and slaves, greatly harming the supply of slave labour into the kingdom. The Matebele forced the Makololo to move once more, this time towards the Plain.\nBack at the Plain, upon hearing of Silumelume's death, Mubukwanu moved northwards to claim the kingship, but found that the Namuso had rallied around a new candidate, Mwananono (a son of Mwananyanda). Mubukwanu forced Mwananono, Muswa, and some supporters to flee. Some traditions say that Muswa met the Makololo in Batoka and told them to conquer the fractured Luyana.}} Kololo tradition says that near the Kafue River a nameless old man with an ox horn had told them of the Plain's wealth and offered to direct them there. Before Mubukwanu could be installed and with animosity still between various Luyana factions, around 1840 Sebitwane's Makololo entered onto the Plain. They ambushed Mubukwanu's forces at Kataba. Tactically and physically superior, the Makololo defeated Mubukwanu's forces, pushing them back to Nea where they were defeated again, and again at Liondo. Some traditions say Mubukwanu died in this final battle, while others say he was captured before being rescued by Imasiku (his son), later dying by poison at Lukwakwa. After their defeat, the Luyana split into three groups: one went north to Lukwakwa; the second, which included most of the royal family, went northwest to Nyengo; the third remained in the Zambezi Valley. Following their success, the Makololo carried out pacification campaigns to consolidate their rule over the Valley.\nMakololo rule and the Restoration\nDuring the Makololo's pacification campaign of the Valley, they were again confronted by the Matebele, led by Nxaba. Nxaba asked some Luyana fleeing to Nyengo for directions to the Makololo; a few Lozi led them to the Luete River before abandoning them there. The Matebele moved south where they were ambushed by the Makololo, almost wiping them out.}} Nxaba escaped and gave himself up to an exiled Lozi group who drowned him; Mainga says that this had the consequence of securing Makololo rule over the Valley. They centred their power in the southern Linyanti Swamps, likely because that was where they were best received by southern groups odious of the Luyana. Makololo rule differed greatly from Luyana rule in a number of ways. The Kololo king enjoyed greater power with fewer checks, though still valued public opinion. While the Luyana kings lived in ritual seclusion and were highly privileged, Makololo kings were accessible by nearly everyone and regularly appeared in public. Kololo administrative positions were given to royals, rather than the aristocratic Manduna. The Makololo also excluded women from politics, contrary to the Luyana. Due to the hostility of the conquered groups against Makololo rule, the Luyana's tribute system partially collapsed, and people largely lived independently. The Makololo turned to external trade instead, welcoming Europeans. Their strong desire for firearms saw them trade slaves to the Mambari for muskets, thus linking the Plain into the wider slave trade. Under Sebitwane, the Kololo Kingdom covered the former Luyana state's lands, and expanded further.\nGovernment\nThe state was headed by a Litunga (king). Succession to the title was available to male patrilineal descendants of Mbuyu, which regularly caused succession crises as candidates vied for the title.\nThe government was seated in the capital, and consisted of legislative, judicial, consultative, and administrative bodies. The Mulongwanji (National Council or Kuta) included Manduna (\"Councillors\", singular: Induna) and was headed by the Ngambela (Prime Minister), and dealt with general national matters such as law-making or war. The Ngambela acted as both the Litunga's spokesperson, and as the principal representative of the people. The Natamoyo (\"Master/Mother of Life\") held a special role where they could veto any decision made by the Kuta or Litunga if it were deemed harsh or unjust, and their residence served as a sanctuary for anyone [condemned]. The Litunga could promote or demote Manduna, but not the Ngambela or Natamoyo. Another centre of power existed in the south (called Lwambi), ruled by a member of the royal family, and was subordinate to the north (called Namuso); the southern ruler had representative Manduna in the Mulongwanji, and the Litunga had some in the Lwambi Kuta.\nThe Mulongwanji consisted of several factions of Manduna: the Makwambuyu (seated on the Litunga's right in the Kuta) was composed of Lozi aristocrats, as well as the Ngambela and Natamoyo, and appointed [administrative leaders]; the Likombwa (seated on the Litunga's left) advanced the Litunga's interests in opposition to the Makwambuyu which represented the public; The Likombwa was possibly repurposed by Mulambwa (the tenth Litunga) to serve his interests.}} and the Linabi which consisted of the royal family. Manduna in the Mulongwanji also comprised several inner Kuta or councils, namely the Sikalo Kuta (composed of the most senior members of the factions), Saa Kuta (a less senior version of the Sikalo), Katengo Kuta (its purpose in early times is unclear),}} and Situmbo sa Mulonga (the Litunga's private hand-picked council which offered him advice).\nMakolo (singular: Likolo) were groups of men that served as armies or labourers and initially corresponded to territories. They were headed by an Induna who lived at the capital and discussed policy with the Litunga and his advisors through a representative. Makolo likely began as bands of followers and were created and employed by members of the royal dynasty, though over time they all came under the control of the Litunga who also appointed their Manduna (sometimes as a reward for service or bravery shown). At one point all women, men, and children were part of a Likolo; which one was determined by their father's or guardian's association, meaning they generally comprised patrilineal kin. Makolo engaged in work that depended on their territories' resources, and could work on construction or raid for the Litunga if needed. The southern ruler had control of subgroups of Makolo (Lwambi Makolo), though the ruler's authority over these was superseded by the Litunga's.\nAppointments to governmental positions generally came through the Lifunga institution, where the Litunga, or representatives of him, travelled throughout the kingdom and brought child prodigies back to the capital. The children (boys and girls) lived in royal or senior households and underwent apprenticeships, later gaining responsibilities and duties based on merit. Girls did domestic work in the royal household, though some became Anatambumu (\"Mothers of the King\") who comprised a council headed by the Queen Mother (Makoshi) which engaged in governing. The Makoshi had the power to veto the Litunga's decisions. In the late-19th century with the Revival, women were excluded from government and the institution was expanded to produce labourers, causing people to hide their children out of fear.\nAdministration\nThe kingdom was divided into Silalo (singular: Lilalo) headed by Manduna, who were appointed by the Litunga and approved by village heads. The Lwambi ruler had control over some Silalo Manduna, though the division between Lwambi and Namuso rule didn't perfectly align with territorial units. A Silalo Induna had a regional Kuta (council) composed of village headmen which people could spectate, and people were mandated to attend when a law was being made in order to gauge public opinion. Silalo Induna also had a corresponding Induna in the Mulongwanji to report matters to when they visited, who in turn reported to the Ngambela. Silalo themselves were composed of several Silalanda (singular: Lilalanda), which were groupings of villages. A Lilalanda was led by the most senior headman of its villages, who also had their own Kuta and resolved disputes between villages. Villages typically accommodated kin, and their headmen had to be accepted by the village's family heads and approved by the Litunga. It was the responsibility of the headmen to resolve minor disputes between people and ensure people's needs were met. Max Gluckman wrote in 1941 that these divisions only concerned land use and not governance of people, citing unstable settlement of the Plain because of seasonal flooding. He considered the Makolo to serve as the kingdom's administrative units. Mutumba Mainga disagrees with this and says that settlements on the Plain were permanent, citing lengthy family histories about landholdings and villages. She also says that Makolo often corresponded to Silalo because they were both dependent on kinship.\nIdeology of kingship\nLozi tradition holds that members of the royal dynasty have divine ancestry due to them descending from Mbuyu, which is believed to imbue them with mali a silena (royalty) which determined eligibility for kingship. The Litunga underwent an elaborate installation ritual, which involved purification rituals, before being presented to the public. Royal rituals and ceremonies included playing of the Maoma drums. The Litunga was bound to ritual seclusion, and spoke only through an intermediary. After death, the Litunga was believed to become more powerful and remain able to affect peoples lives. A group of families chose to live near where a deceased Litunga chose to be buried, and one person took on the position of Nomboti or Nameto. The Nomboti tended to the deceased Litunga's grave, appeased him with sacrifices, and acted as an intermediary between him and the public. Sacrifices were placed on the Limbwata (an opening in the grave), and the deceased Litunga's spirit was consulted via the Nomboti for major policy decisions and the installation of a new monarch. Traditionally, fires were put out after a monarch's death, and only relit once the new monarch lights a fire.\nEconomy\nThe Litunga was responsible for public infrastructure such as building mounds to save settlements from flooding or canals for drainage or transport. People in the kingdom had to pay tribute to the Litunga in the form of part of their catch or harvest (called Mubingu). In the 19th century, around a quarter of the population are estimated to have been slaves, who were used for public construction or agricultural work.\nThe communities of the Bulozi Floodplain and those of the forests relied upon each other for certain goods; from the forest communities, those of the Plain imported wood, canoes, bark to make rope, honey, and beeswax among others. The communities of the Plain exported to those of the forests cattle, milk, and fish. Initially this trade was conducted via barter, though after Ngombala's conquests he established a tribute system (Namba) wherein the forest communities were obligated to send some of what they produced to the capital. Another institution called Maketiso involved the communities sending young men and women to the Plain when demanded in order to meet labour demand. These were overseen by Lindumeleti (singular: Ndumeleti), who reported to the Litunga if they weren't carried out, which was met with force.\nSociety and culture\nNational hunts (Lisula) were held annually and led by the Litunga.\nSeasonal floods meant that settlements were built on termite mounds (mazulu) and artificial mounds (liuba), though people were sometimes forced into the forest at the height of flooding season.\nThe Kuta controlled the transmission of history through institutions such as the Royal Graves (Litino), histories of titles and positions, and the Royal Band (Bambeti). The Royal Band played praise songs and narrative songs, and could give cryptic advice or criticism to the current Litunga.\nLozi years were 13 months long, with a month's length determined by the moon's waxing and waning, and months grouped into seasons. A new year was accompanied by the start of agricultural work.\nList of rulers\nThe following list of rulers is largely taken from African States and Rulers 3rd ed. (2006). The location of the Royal Graves (Sitino, singular: Litino) are largely derived from Alphonse Jalla's Litaba za Sicaba sa Malozi (\"History of the Lozi Nation\"), first published in 1909 or 1910.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Ruler\n!Reign\n!Gravesite\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Mbuyu\n|?\n|Makono\n|One strain of tradition says that Mbuyu was the last of a dynasty of 15 queens over the course of three generations, with Nasilele as the first queen.\n|-\n|1.\n|Mboo Mwanasilunda Mulunda\n|17th century\n|Imwambo\n|Preceded by Mbuyu in tradition, Inuwa was Ngambela (Prime Minister)\n|-\n|2.\n|Inyambo\n|?\n|Liondo\n|\n|-\n|3.\n|Yeta I\n|?\n|Namanda\n|\n|-\n|4.\n|Ngalama\n|?\n|Kwandu\n|\n|-\n|5.\n|Yeta II\n|?\n|Nandopu  ?\n|\n|-\n|6.\n|Ngombala\n|?\n|Ñundu\n|\n|-\n|7.\n|Yubya\n|?\n|Namayula\n|\n|-\n|8.\n|Mwanawina I (also \"Musanawina\")\n|?\n|Lienenu\n|\n|-\n|9.\n|Mwananyanda (also \"Musananyanda\")\n|?1780\n|Kasiku\n|\n|-\n|10.\n|Mulambwa\n|17801830\n|Lilundu\n|\n|-\n|11.\n|Silumelume and Mubukwanu\n|18301838\n|Namaweshi (Silumelume)\n|Joint rulers\n|-\n|12.\n|Mubukwanu\n|18381841\n|Nambi ?\n|\n|-\n|13.\n|Imasiku\n|18411860\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Sipopa and Njekwa\n|18601864\n|\n|Joint regents\n|-\n|14.\n|Sipopa\n|1864August 1876\n|\n|Njekwa was Ngambela until 1871\n|-\n|\n|Mowa Mamili\n|August 1876October 1876\n|\n|Regent\n|-\n|15.\n|Mwanawina II\n|October 1876May 1878\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Vacant\n|May 1878August 1878\n|\n|\n|-\n|16.\n|Lewanika (also \"Lubosi\")\n|August 1878August 1884\n|\n|1st reign, Silumbu was Ngambela\n|-\n|17.\n|Tatila Akufuna\n|September 1884July 1885\n|\n|Usurper, Mataa was Ngambela\n|-\n|\n|Vacant\n|July 1885November 1885\n|\n|\n|-\n|16.\n|Lewanika\n|November 1885February 1916\n|\n|2nd reign and the last sovereign ruler, Mwauluka was Ngambela until 1898\n|-\n|\n|Mokamba\n|February 1916March 1916\n|\n|Regent\n|-\n|18.\n|Yeta III (also \"Litia\")\n|March 1916June 1945\n|Mulumbo\n|\n|-\n|\n|Shemakone Kalonga Wina\n|June 1945June 1946\n|\n|Regent (1st time)\n|-\n|19.\n|Imwiko Lewanika (also \"Imwiko I\")\n|June 1946June 1948\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Shemakone Kalonga Wina\n|June 1948August 1948\n|\n|Regent (2nd time)\n|-\n|20.\n|Mwanawina III\n|August 1948November 1968\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|Hastings Noyoo\n|November 1968December 1968\n|\n|Regent\n|-\n|21.\n|Lewanika II (also \"Godwin Mbikusita\")\n|December 19681977\n|\n|\n|-\n|22.\n|Ilute (also \"Yeta IV\")\n|1977July 2000\n|\n|\n|-\n|23.\n|Lubosi Imwiko II\n|October 2000present\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
