The project and missions revolve around biomedical engineering.\nProject\nTeams were tasked with identifying a problem that can occur in the human body and creating an inventive solution. Then teams shared their project with the community and with judges at competition.\nGameplay\nThe table performance portion of Body Forward is played on a 4 ft by 8 ft field rimmed by wood boards. At competition, two of these fields are placed together to form an 8 ft square. In each -minute match, a team competes on each field with their robot to earn up to 400 points manipulating the mission models.\nOne of the mission models, the Mechanical Arm Patent, straddles both fields in the center. This model can earn points for either team, or both in the rare circumstance of simultaneous triggering.\nThe touch penalty objects are red blood cell models. All 11 are worth 5 points each anywhere on the field, but are removed every time the robot is touched outside of base.\nMissions\nAll of the Body Forward missions related to various medical fields and practices. They are:\n* Common Bone Repair - 25 points\n* Special Bone Repair - up to 25 points\n* Rapid Blood Screening - up to 40 points\n* Bad Cell Destruction - up to 25 points\n* Mechanical Arm Patent - 25 points\n* Cardiac Patch - 20 points\n* Pacemaker - 25 points\n* Nerve Mapping - 15 points\n* Object Control Through Thought - 20 points\n* Medicine Auto-Dispensing - up to 30 points\n* Robotic Sensitivity - 25 points\n* Professional Teamwork - 25 points\n* Bionic Eyes - 20 points\n* Stent - 25 points\n* Red Blood Cells - up to 55 points\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110114172808/http://www.firstlegoleague.org/media/twocol.aspx?id=247 Official website]"
