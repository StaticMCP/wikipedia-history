Federal Election Commission (No. 24-621) is a pending United States Supreme Court case regarding the constitutionality of federal limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates.\nBackground\nLegal background\nFederal law has long regulated how much a political party can spend in coordination with its candidates—distinct from independent expenditures. These \"coordinated party expenditure limits\" were enacted to prevent donors from usurping candidate contribution limits. In 2001, the Supreme Court decided Federal Election Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado II). Colorado II upheld these limits, holding that coordinated spending was \"virtually indistinguishable\" from independent expenditures, and that the government had an important interest in preventing actual or apparent corruption.\nIn the years since Colorado II, the Supreme Court's campaign finance jurisprudence has shifted significantly. In 2010, the Court decided Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which struck down limits on corporate independent expenditures, reasoning that independent expenditures could not corrupt candidates. In 2014, the Court decided McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, further narrowed the anti-corruption rationale in invalidating aggregate contribution limits. In McCutcheon, the Court emphasized that only quid pro quo corruption can justify limiting campaign contributions. In 2022, the Court decided Federal Election Commission v. Ted Cruz for Senate, which struck down a law forbidding the repayment of candidate loans with post-election contributions. In Cruz, the Court again emphasized that limits on campaign contributions must be tailored to preventing only quid pro quo corruption.\nFactual background\nPlaintiffs are the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), then-candidate JD Vance, and then-Congressman Steven Joseph Chabot. In 2022, plaintiffs brought suit in the Southern District of Ohio challenging the coordinated party expenditure limits. Following discovery, the district court certified the question presented to the en banc United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\nThe Sixth Circuit, in an opinion by Chief Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, answered the question in the negative. While acknowledging the shifting legal landscape since Colorado II, it concluded that the deferential review prescribed by that opinion foreclosed plaintiffs' facial and as-applied challenges.\nJudge Amul Thapar concurred. His opinion reasoned that under the current legal landscape, the Federal Election Campaign Act's expenditure limits should fall. However, he acknowledged that the panel was still bound by the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado II. Judge John K. Bush similarly concurred, casting doubt on Colorado II.\nJudge Jane Branstetter Stranch concurred in the judgment. Her opinion criticized the majority for casting doubt on the reasoning of Colorado II, and offered a defense of FECA's coordinated party expenditure limits on the merits. Judge Rachel Bloomekatz concurred in the judgment, associating herself with Judge Stranch's opinion on the grounds of stare decisis.\nJudge Chad Readler dissented. His opinion argued that the changed legal landscape had rendered Colorado II obsolete, and that the Sixth Circuit was not precluded from assessing FECA's limits in light of more recent precedent.\nSupreme Court\nOn December 4, 2024, plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. On May 19, 2025, the government responded. In its filing, it declined to defend the constitutionality of FECA's limits, arguing instead that the limits violated the First Amendment. On May 30, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) filed a motion in the case seeking to intervene to defend the constitutionality of the limits. On June 30, the Supreme Court granted certiorari, along with the DNC's motion to intervene.\nReferences"
