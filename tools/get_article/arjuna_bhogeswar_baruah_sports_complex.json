It hosted the 2007 National Games, and was used for the lying-in-state of Zubeen Garg in 2025.\nHistory\nDevelopment and construction\nThe locality of Sarusajai won the bid to host the 2007 national games on 13 December 2002, though the sports infrastructure of the town was not able to accommodate the event. It marked the first time the games had ever been held in Assam and only the second time in the Northeast, after Manipur. French Architectural firm STUP consultants, which previously designed infrastructure for the Montreal Olympics and venues in the 2004 Athens Olympics, presented its designs to the government of Assam in 2003. President of the Indian Olympic Association, Suresh Kalmadi, Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, and governor Ajai Singh laid the foundation stones for the athletics stadium, indoor hall, and aquatic stadium in December 2003. The project was spread over 369 bighas of land.\nThe state government engaged STUP consultants to design the infrastructure for the city, while the stadium construction was completed by Larsen & Toubro. The development project for the turfing of the football ground was a collaborative effort between the soil conservation department and STUP consultants, and the landscaping and plantation project was delayed due to Larsen & Toubro being unable to clear some of the sites. Larsen & Toubro began construction of the stadium on 2 March 2004, on the basis of designs prepared by STUP consultants.\nDespite concerns over parts of the complex being still constructed in the days before the games, the complex was ready for the opening of the 2007 games. In 2012, The Telegraph reported that the complex had cost , and that there had been \"negligible\" use of the infrastructure since the 2007 games.\nIn March 2020, bodybuilder Mahadev Deka inaugurated the gym and fitness centre at the sports complex.\nUse\n(pictured) lay in state at the complex in 2025.]]\nThe complex has hosted 2007 National Games, 2016 South Asian Games, 2020 Khelo India Youth Games, 2024 Khelo India University Games and Khel Maharan. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the open area in the indoor stadium was converted to become care centres for COVID.\nThe Athletic Stadium is currently home to NorthEast United and Inter Kashi while the Indoor Stadium hosted the Northeastern Warriors. In September 2025, the complex was used for the lying in state of Assamese singer Zubeen Garg.\nRenaming\nOn 28 May 2025, the Assam government under Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma approved the renaming of the Sarusajai Sports Complex, to be named after legendary Assamese athlete, Bhogeswar Baruah. During Abhiruchi Sports Day on 3 September, the sports complex was formally renamed, with Sarma stating that he felt \"privileged\" to rename the stadium in Baruah's honour.\nFuture\nIn February 2017, Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that the Assam government would create the Arjun Bhogeswar Baruah State Sports Academy, and proposed  for the building of the school, using the infrastructure of the sports complex.\nIn 2019, Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal laid the foundation stones for the state sports school named after Baruah to be located at the sports complex. The school is set to be built on 20 bighas of land and will have a focus on six disciplines: athletics, football, boxing, weightlifting, archery, and taekwondo.\nFacilities\nSports venues\n|zoom=15|caption=Venues in the Arjun Bhogeswar Baruah Sports Complex.
