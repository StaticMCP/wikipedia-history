It was broadcast on NBC.\nWhen Frasier was announced as the winner of Outstanding Comedy Series, Emmy history was made. The NBC sitcom became the first show to win one of the two main series prizes five consecutive years. This record has since been passed by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, whose winning streak was ten years, but for the main two genres, it was not matched until 2014, when the ABC sitcom Modern Family won its fifth consecutive award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Frasier tied for the most major wins overall with three.\nThe Practice won Outstanding Drama Series. For the second straight year, medical drama ER came into the night as the most nominated program, but once again walked away empty handed, going 0/8 in major categories.\nAlly McBeal became the first hour-long series to be nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series since Love, American Style in 1971.\nThis year saw the Emmys move to a new venue, the Shrine Auditorium, marking the return of the award ceremony to Los Angeles for the first time since the 1976 Emmy Awards, following a 20-year residency at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium outside L.A. in Pasadena.\nAs of the 2023 Emmy Awards ceremony, this is the last year where all the nominees for Outstanding Drama Series were from the broadcast networks.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Frasier (NBC)'\n** 3rd Rock from the Sun (NBC)\n** Ally McBeal (Fox)\n** The Larry Sanders Show (HBO)\n** Seinfeld (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Practice (ABC)'\n** ER (NBC)\n** Law & Order (NBC)\n** NYPD Blue (ABC)\n** The X-Files (Fox)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)'\n** Dennis Miller Live (HBO)\n** Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher (ABC)\n** The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (NBC)\n** Tracey Takes On...
