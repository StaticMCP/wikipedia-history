It closed in 2018.\nHistory\nMartin Luther King Jr. Academy opened in 1970 as \"Second Chance High School\" to educate dropouts and at-risk students. In November of that year, it was renamed by a petition of the student body in honor of civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968.\nThe school was originally located in a storefront on Broadway in Gary's Midtown neighborhood, but later moved to 711 Chase in Ambridge Mann.\nSee also\n* List of high schools in Indiana\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310221918/http://www.garycsc.k12.in.us/mlk/index.html Martin Luther King Jr. Academy Official Site]"
