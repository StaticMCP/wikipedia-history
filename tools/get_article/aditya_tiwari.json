He then attended the University of East Anglia and received a Master of Arts in Journalism.\nIn Queeristan: LGBTQ Inclusion in the Indian Workplace (2020), Parmesh Shahani wrote about meeting Aditya in 2019, describing him as a “young openly gay poet” from Jabalpur whose family’s acceptance empowered him to create “his own queer-friendly universe.” Shahani also noted his debut poetry collection, April is Lush, which was published in 2019. In 2023, Aditya's anthology Over the Rainbow: India’s Queer Heroes was published by Juggernaut Books during India’s marriage equality hearings. The book was featured by The Indian Express as a top Pride Month read. The Hindu described it as “lucidly written,” and Hindustan Times noted that it “presents the stories of 19 queer people who have done their bit to bring about positive change in society.”\nHe has spoken at various literary festivals, including the Hyderabad Literary Festival and New Delhi's Rainbow Lit Fest, one of India's largest LGBT literary festivals. Aditya actively engages in advocacy for the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. His work has appeared in several national and international publications including The Times of India, Hindustan Times, PinkNews, and The Telegraph.\nIn 2022, he produced and hosted a six-part radio series on the BBC, which primarily focused on a range of diverse experiences, including men’s mental health. He later served as a producer at the BBC in 2024, and in 2025 was selected to participate in a cross-border programme organised by the Goethe-Institut in partnership with Deutsche Welle (DW) and other collaborators, aimed at rebuilding trust in the media.\nSelected works\n*\n*\nSee also\n* List of LGBT writers\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://aditya-tiwari.com/ Official Website]\n* [https://www.thechakkar.com/home/golchakkar11 Aditya's Interview on Indian Literature] with Ruth Vanita\n* [https://mappingsexuality.ashoka.edu.in/search/?publications%5Bpage%5D=29 April is Lush at Centre for Studies in] Gender and Sexuality, Ashoka University"
