The organization's goal is to \"discover, promote, and advance\" the careers of young American pianists. The organization hosts a biennial competition called the American Piano Awards, which switches focus from classical piano to jazz piano every two years. Valued at over $200,000, the awards of the competition are among the most lucrative piano prizes in the world. The Cole Porter Fellowship, awarded to the winner of the jazz competitions, is one of the greatest honors young American jazz musicians can receive. In non-competition years, the organization hosts a piano recital series, and from 2003 through 2008, the organization produced Indy Jazz Fest.\nHistory\nThe organization was \"born\" in New York City in 1979 as the Beethoven Foundation, conceived by Danish pianist Victor Borge, Tony Habig of the piano manufacturer Kimball International, and Julius Bloom, former general manager of Carnegie Hall. Their original intent was to help identify and develop young American pianists to compete in international piano competitions by offering fellowships over a three-year period that included cash awards, concerts and media coverage. In 1982, The Beethoven Foundation moved its national headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana due to its central location and Habig & Borge's geographical ties to the area.\nIn 1989 the organization was renamed as The American Pianists Association to reflect a broader mission and scope that included jazz pianists. The jazz competition was added in 1992.\nThe organization was rebranded as American Piano Awards in 2024 to better reflect its most significant programs and aid in the public's understanding of its mission and purpose. The executive offices are a part of the Arts Collaborative housed in Lilly Hall at Butler University.\nCompetitions\nFinalists for the American Piano Awards compete through a series of adjudicated public recitals. The classical competition includes solo piano, chamber music, and concerto performances and ends with each finalist performing a piano concerto with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. The jazz competition includes repertoire for solo piano, jazz trio, vocal jazz, and jazz orchestra.\nAward recipients\nThe American Piano Awards website lists these winners:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
