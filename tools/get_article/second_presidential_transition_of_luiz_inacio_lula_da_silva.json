Then vice president-elect Geraldo Alckmin was appointed as the chair of Lula's transition team on November 1, 2022.\nBackground\nFollowing the results of the 2022 Brazilian general election on October 30, president-elect Lula's campaign team expressed concern about incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro's 44-hour delay in recognizing the results of the polls and authorizing the start of the government transition. The green light was given only on November 2 by Bolsonaro's Chief of Staff of the Presidency, Ciro Nogueira.\nTimeline\nPost-election\n*October 30: Lula is declared the winner of the election.\n*October 31: President Bolsonaro refuses to accept the elections results.\n*November 1: Vice president-elect Alckmin appointed as the chair of Lula's transition team.\n*November 2: Bolsonaro avoids conceding but authorizes the beginning of transition, as pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations blocked access to airports and highways.\n*November 3: President Bolsonaro met vice president-elect Alckmin at the Planalto Palace.\nEstablishment of the transition team\nThe transition team was appointed by Lula since the day after the elections with more than fifty Brazilian officials led by some names that will compose the new administration as ministers.
