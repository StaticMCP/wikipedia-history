Largely built in 1823 (although its rear wing dates to around 1300), it was formerly the clergy house for the nearby St Oswald's Church. It is now a Grade I listed building. It is constructed in coursed limestone. A post-war extension of the property is not of special interest.\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in Lancashire\nReferences"
