The school is part of the St. George Region of high schools and is administered by the New South Wales Department of Education.\nHistory\nThe school was established in 1959 to relieve overcrowding in existing schools and given the name Kingsgrove North by a Committee of P & C. Stage1 of the building, consisting of blocks \"B\" & \"C\" was constructed by Monier Builders Ltd at the cost of £189,153.  The Manual Arts block, also included in Stage 1, was not begun until 28 February. The first KNHS Headmaster was Errol Johnston and the first school captains were Ron Graham (1960–1963) and Judith Timmins (1960–1961).  The school badge is based on suggestions from teachers and students and consists of a  \"rotary wheel\" that represents the wheel of industry and \"surrounding stars\" to indicate hard work to achieve high goals. The school pledge was composed in 1961 by a school teacher and consists of: The future is a challenge, let us excel our lives with power and purpose, let us excel.  The prefect's pledge was introduced in 1962 and says: \"I promise at all times and in all places, to maintain the honour of the school; that with sincerity, justice and integrity, I will discharge my duties ; so that in these things I shall excel, for what I am, this school will be.\" The school received the Director General's Award for Excellence in 2004 and 2005 and a National Award for Quality Schooling in 2007.\nDescription\nThe school is situated in Kingsgrove, a suburb of southern Sydney.
