On 10 April 2012 the medal became known as the Overseas Territories Special Constabulary Medal, and underwent a minor change in design. This reflected the change in the way Britain's remaining colonies were described, they being classed as 'Overseas Territories' from 2002.\nEligibility\nThe medal is presented to members of the Special Constabulary of a British colony or Overseas Territory for long and meritorious service. It is awarded for part-time service of either nine years if unpaid, or fifteen years paid. A clasp is awarded for each further ten years of service.\nDescription\nThe medal is circular, silver and  in diameter. It has the following design:\n* The obverse shows the right-facing effigy of Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II with an appropriate inscription. When the name of the medal changed in 2012, an updated effigy of Elizabeth II was adopted, designed by Ian Rank-Broadley.\n* The reverse shows the Royal cypher above the words 'FOR FAITHFUL SERVICE', surrounded a laurel wreath. The inscription 'COLONIAL SPECIAL CONSTABULARY' appeared outside the wreath until 2012, when this changed to 'OVERSEAS TERRITORIES SPECIAL CONSTABULARY'.\n* The medal has the name and details of the recipient inscribed on the rim.\n* The  wide ribbon is green with two narrow white stripes towards the centre and wide edges of dark blue.\n* The clasp for further awards is attached to the ribbon and is silver and decorated with a spray of laurel.\nReferences"
