The official release of this version of the product reads and writes files conformant to ISO/IEC 29500 Transitional, and reads files conformant to ISO/IEC 29500 Strict.\nMicrosoft Office 2007\nOn July 28, 2008, Murray Sargent, a software development engineer in the Microsoft Office team confirmed that Word 2007 will have a service pack release that enables it to read and write ISO standard OOXML files. However, as of Service Pack 2 (released 2009) Microsoft is not claiming Microsoft Office 2007 compatibility with the ISO OOXML standard.\nOpen XML Format SDK\n| latest release version = v2.12.2\n| latest release date    =\n| repo                   =\n| programming language   = C#\n| operating system       = Windows, Unix-like\n| platform               = .NET Framework, .NET Core, UWP, Mono, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac, Xamarin.Android\n| genre                  = Software library\n| license                = Apache License 2.0\n| website                =\n}}\nMicrosoft Open XML Format SDK contains a set of managed code libraries to create and manipulate Office Open XML files programmatically. Version 1.0 was released on June 10, 2008 and incorporates the changes made to the Office Open XML specification made during the current ISO/IEC standardization process. Version 2 of the Open XML SDK supports validating Office Open XML documents against the Office Open XML schema, as well as searching in Office Open XML documents. On March 13, 2008, Doug Mahugh, a senior product manager at Microsoft specializing in Office client interoperability and the Open XML file formats, confirmed that version 1.0 of the Open XML Format SDK \"will definitely be 100% compliant with the final ISO/IEC 29500 spec, including the changes accepted at the BRM\". In a ComputerWorld interview from 2008, Doug Mahugh said that \"Microsoft would continue to update the SDK to make sure that applications built with it remained compliant with an Open XML standard as changes were made in the future\".  By June 2014, the Open XML SDK was at version 2.5 and had been released as open source under the Apache License 2.0 on GitHub.\nSee also\n* Comparison of Office Open XML software\n* Network effect\n* Open format\n* Office suite\n* OpenDocument Format\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081222083630/http://openxmlcommunity.org/applications.aspx Microsoft's office open XML Community website]"
