Even Mashal Khan's case was elevated due to social media and its power,\" he said. \"It's funny because these are our seniors, yet a lot of inappropriate content has been released without any objections because of the lack of censor board in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\"\nOfficial website\nSoundtrack\nMusicians involved in the production of the soundtrack include Fortitude, Khumariyaan, King Compass and the duo of Naseer & Shahab.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
