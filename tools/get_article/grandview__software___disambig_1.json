Living Videotext was acquired by Symantec in 1987. Grandview was sold until the early 1990s and is no longer supported by Symantec.\nIt closely resembled PC-Outline, an outliner for IBM PCs of the 1980s, authored by John Friend.  Grandview was derived from the same software.\nReception\nStating that GrandView was \"more than an outliner\", BYTE in 1988 approved of its built-in word processor. While noting the software's complexity, the magazine concluded that \"GrandView—once you get over the top of the learning curve—will save scads of time and money\", with a \"more than reasonable\" $295 price. BYTE in 1989 listed GrandView as among the \"Distinction\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it was \"packed with goodies\" and worth the time necessary to learn how to use it.\nSee also\n* Outliner\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue139/114_GrandView_20.php Compute! magazine review of Grandview 2.0, 1992]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080917041953/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1563/is_n6_v9/ai_10748021 Home Office Computing review, 1991]\n*[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Symantec-Corporation-Company-History.html History of Symantec Corporation]\n*[http://www.outlinersoftware.com/topics/viewt/6291 A version of GrandView 2.0 for DOS that is completely portable, fully functional, and ready to run on any modern version of Windows up to Windows 10, using vDos-lfn]\n*[http://tech.kateva.org/2014/02/grandview-outliner-and-information.html GrandView 2.0 Reference Guide 737 pages ]"
