The Croxteth Country Park ward was created as a single-member ward from the eastern half of the former Croxteth ward. The ward is centred around the Croxteth Park estate and includes Croxteth Hall.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Lila Bennett (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\nReferences"
