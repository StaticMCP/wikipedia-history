This went against one of the Canadian Film Association's main objectives–to show the public the value of the awards. In the end, the winners were announced via press release, award certificates were sent to the winners, and the Ottawa Film Society organized public screenings of the winning films.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: The Stratford Adventure — National Film Board of Canada, Guy Glover producer, Morten Parker director\n*Theatrical Feature Length (Documentary): The Stratford Adventure — National Film Board of Canada, Guy Glover producer, Morten Parker director\n*Theatrical Short: Not awarded\n::Honorable Mention: High Tide in Newfoundland — National Film Board of Canada, Nicholas Balla producer, Grant McLean director\n*Non-Theatrical, Open: Riches of the Earth — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Colin Low director\n::Honorable Mention: One Little Indian — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly and Colin Low producers, Grant Munro director\n*Non-Theatrical, Government Sponsored: Gift of the Glaciers — Film and Photographic Branch, Government of Alberta, K.
