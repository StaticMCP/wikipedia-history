His father, Benjamin King, made navigational and mathematical instruments. King received training to become a house painter in Boston, Massachusetts, which became one of his many occupations.\nCareer\nKing had pursued several vocations before beginning his artistic career. He painted houses, made frames, decorated carriages and made mathematical and navigational instruments. After his marriage in 1770, King became increasingly interested in art, but also continued to make instruments.\nHe made a miniature portrait painting Reverend Ezra Stiles in 1770, which is now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection. Stiles, who performed King's marriage ceremony, went on to become the president of Yale College. The following year he painted Stiles' portrait on canvas.\nKing taught artists Ann Hall, Charles Bird King, Edward Greene Malbone, and Washington Allston. Malbone had been encouraged by King to become an artist. Hall visited Newport to receive lessons from King.\nHe created a transparency for the Rhode Island State House in 1783, which was \"probably\" illuminated from torches placed behind the large transparency.\nPersonal life\nKing was married to Amy Vernon in 1770 by Reverend Ezra Stiles. She was the daughter of a successful merchant, Samuel Vernon.\nHe died December 20, 1819, in Newport.\nGallery\nFile:Samuel King, Reverend Ezra Stiles, 1770, watercolor on ivory.jpg|Reverend Ezra Stiles, 1770, watercolor on ivory, Metropolitan Museum of Art\nFile:Samuel King - Ezra Stiles (1727 -1795), B.A. 1746, M.A. 1749 - 1955.3.1 - Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|Reverend Ezra Stiles,'' 1771, oil on canvas, Yale University Art Gallery\nReferences"
