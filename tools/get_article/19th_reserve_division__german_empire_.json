The division was formed on mobilization of the German Army in August 1914 as part of X Reserve Corps.  The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.  The division was raised in the Prussian Province of Hanover, the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, and the Duchy of Brunswick.\nCombat chronicle\nThe 19th Reserve Division began the war under command of Generalleutnant Max von Bahrfeldt on the Western Front, participating in the opening German offensive which led to the Allied Great Retreat and ended with the First Battle of the Marne.  Thereafter, the division remained in the line on the Aisne and in the Champagne.  From May 1915 to March 1916, the division fought in Upper Alsace.  It then fought in the Battle of Verdun until July, when it went into the Argonne Forest.  In October 1916, it saw action in the later phases of the Battle of the Somme.  In April 1917, the division fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also known as the Third Battle of Champagne.  In May, it was sent to the Eastern Front, and fought around Riga until September.  It then returned to the Western Front, where it saw action in the Battle of Passchendaele.  It was back in the trenchlines at Verdun from October 1917 to April 1918.  In August–September 1918, the division faced the French and American Oise-Aisne Offensive.  It remained in the line until war's end.
