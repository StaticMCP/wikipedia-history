Although she was recognized as being part of the royal Wang clan, she was put under her paternal grandmother's clan, the Chungju Yu clan.\nShe firstly married Wang Gyu, who was also the grandson of Lady Heondok and King Taejo, the only son of Crown Prince Sumyeong. They had a daughter together who would eventually marry King Mokjong, the son of King Gyeongjong.\nBut after Wang Gyu's death, Lady Yu remarried again and became a queen consort through her marriage with her half first cousin, King Seongjong, as his first and primary wife. From this marriage, Queen Mundeok became the fifth reigned Goryeo queen who followed her maternal clan after Queen Heonjeong, her half first cousin and the first Goryeo queen who remarried.\nHer death date is unknown, but seeing that her son-in-law (biologically, her nephew), King Mokjong gave her posthumous names in 997, it seemed that she died sometime before that.\nPosthumous name\n*In April 1002 (5th year reign of King Mokjong), name Hyo-gong () was added.\n*In March 1014 (5th year reign of King Hyeonjong), name Sun-seong () was added.\n*In April 1027 (18th year reign of King Hyeonjong), name Yeong-yong () and Suk-jeol () was added.\n*In October 1056 (10th year reign of King Munjong), name Won-heon () was added.\n*In October 1253 (40th year reign of King Gojong), name Seon-wi () was added to her posthumous name too.\nFamily\n* Father - Wang So, Gwangjong of Goryeo (; 925 – 4 July 975)\n* Mother - Queen Daemok of the Hwangju Hwangbo clan (; 925–?)\n* Siblings\n** Older sister - Wang Ah-ji, Lady Cheonchujeon (; 950–?)\n** Older brother - Wang Ju, Gyeongjong of Goryeo (; 9 November 955 – 13 August 981)\n** Younger brother - Crown Prince Hyohwa (; 956–959)\n** Sister - Royal Lady Bohwa ()\n* Spouses\n** Wang Gyu, Prince Hongdeok (; 951–?)\n*** Father-in-law - Crown Prince Sumyeong (; 904–?)\n*** Unnamed mother-in-law (908–?)\n** Wang Chi, Seongjong of Goryeo (15 January 961 – 29 November 997)\n*** Mother-in-law - Queen Seonui of the Jeongju Yu clan (; 937–?)\n*** Father-in-law - Wang Ok, Daejong of Goryeo (; 937–969)\n* Issue\n** Daughter - Queen Seonjeong of the Chungju Yu clan (; 980–?); with Wang Gyu\n*** Son-in-law - Wang Song, Mokjong of Goryeo (; 980 – 1009)\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Lee Hyun-kyung and Baek Seung-hee in the 2009 KBS2 TV series Empress Cheonchu.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0019445 Queen Mundeok] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000924875 문덕왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
