Recordings on which a group receives artist billing are eligible here, even when the vocal features only one member of the group. The entire group or collaborative performance, rather than the presence of a lead vocal performance, determines category eligibility\".\nThe award goes to the performing artists. The producer, vocal arranger, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.\nIt was one of several new categories for the annual Grammy Awards ceremony to start from 2012. It combines the previous categories for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The restructuring of these categories was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards and to eliminate the distinctions between collaborations and duo or groups.\nLady Gaga has the most wins in this category, with three. SZA and Bruno Mars are the only other acts overall to win this category multiple times, each with two wins. Coldplay and Ariana Grande are the acts with most nominations in this category, receiving a total of five nods.\nRecipients\nreceived her first posthumous award for \"Body and Soul\" with Tony Bennett.]]\nis the first act to win multiple times since the category's revamp, winning in 2019, 2021 and 2025.]]\n. \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga was the first all-female collaboration to win this category.]]\nbecame the first openly transgender artist to win this award.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Recipients\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2012\n| Tony Bennett and Amy Winehouse\n| \"Body and Soul\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2013\n| Gotye featuring Kimbra\n| \"Somebody That I Used to Know\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2014\n| Daft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers\n| \"Get Lucky\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2015\n| A Great Big World and Christina Aguilera\n| \"Say Something\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2016\n| Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars\n| \"Uptown Funk\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2017\n| Twenty One Pilots\n| \"Stressed Out\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2018\n| Portugal.
