According to frontman Dave Wyndorf, the album is a \"reimagined\" version of their previous album, 2013's Last Patrol, featuring four new songs and two live tracks. The album is not strictly a remix of Last Patrol, as songs feature new recordings and arrangements aimed at giving the album what Wyndorf describes as \"a weird 1960s vibe\". The album concludes with two live tracks recorded at the AB in Brussels in 2014, and which feature the debut performance of the band's new bassist, Chris Kosnik.\n}}"
