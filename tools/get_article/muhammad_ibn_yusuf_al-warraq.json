      "text": "# Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Warraq\n\nMuhammad ibn Yūsuf al-Warrāq () (* 904 in Guadalajara; † 973 or 974 in Córdoba) (in present-day Spain) was an Andalusían historian and geographer.\nLife\nHe spent many years in Kairouan and returned to Cordoba during the reign of Caliph al-Hakam II.\nWorks\nAl-Warrāq wrote for al-Hakam II a series of historical and geographical works on North Africa, none of which have survived whole, although many fragments of his extensive production are preserved in al-Bakri's Book of Roads and Kingdoms from one century later. From the extracts transcribed in al-Bakri's work relying on al-Warrāq, one can conclude that the latter was the first to mix geography and history. Any geographical subject is accompanied by its historical context and a detailed description. Ibn Hazm mentioned that his roots lay in the Berber tribal confederation of the Zenata.\nSee also\n* Al-Bakri\n* Zenata\nNotes\n\n---\n\n## Muhammad ibn Yūsuf al-Warrāq\n\n#REDIRECT Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Warraq\n}}"
