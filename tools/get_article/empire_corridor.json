Major cities on the route include Poughkeepsie, Albany, Schenectady, Amsterdam, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo. Much of the corridor was once part of the New York Central Railroad's main line.\nAmtrak's Empire Service and Maple Leaf serve the entire length of the Empire Corridor, with the Maple Leaf continuing northwest to . The Lake Shore Limited follows most of the corridor from New York City, diverging west to Chicago at the Buffalo–Depew station. The Berkshire Flyer takes the corridor to , before diverging east to , while the Adirondack and Ethan Allen Express  travel one stop further to , before diverging north to  and , respectively. Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line merges with the Empire Corridor in Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx, just south of , providing commuter rail service between Poughkeepsie, New York and Grand Central Terminal in New York City.\nThe line is electrified by both overhead catenary and top-running third rail on the Amtrak-owned segment between Penn Station and 41st Street, as well as by under-running third rail on the Metro-North segment, from the merge with the Hudson Line to . The Amtrak-owned section between 41st Street and the merge with the Hudson Line is unpowered, and can only be served by diesel or dual-mode trains.\nThe corridor is also one of ten federally designated high-speed rail corridors in the United States. If the proposed high-speed service were to be built on the corridor, trains traveling between Buffalo and New York City could travel at speeds of up to . In the 1890s, the Empire State Express between New York City and Buffalo was about 1&nbsp;hour faster than Amtrak's service in 2013. On September&nbsp;14, 1891, the Empire State Express covered the  between New York City and Buffalo in 7&nbsp;hours and 6&nbsp;minutes (including stops), averaging , with a top speed of .\nOwnership\nThe Empire Corridor is largely owned by CSX Transportation (CSX), which owns most of the trackage between Niagara Falls and Poughkeepsie. Amtrak owns trackage rights for most of the Hudson line section north of Poughkeepsie to its rail yard in Albany. South of Poughkeepsie, the Empire Corridor is coextensive with Metro-North's trackage until it forks-off between Metro-North's Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil stations in the Bronx, to cross the Harlem River over the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge and make the Empire Connection to Penn Station. Amtrak owns the trackage after that fork, the West Side Line.\nThe corridor had been part of the main line of the New York Central Railroad; it was the eastern leg of the NYC's famed \"Water Level Route\" to Chicago. The corridor passed to Penn Central in 1968 upon the NYC's merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and passed to Conrail in 1976. In a series of purchases in the 1980s and 1990s, Amtrak bought the Bronx–Manhattan segment, Metro-North acquired the Poughkeepsie–Bronx segment, and CSX acquired the remainder when it split Conrail's assets with Norfolk Southern, in 1999.\nOn October&nbsp;18, 2011, Amtrak and CSX announced an agreement for Amtrak to lease, operate and maintain the CSX-owned trackage between Poughkeepsie and Schenectady. Amtrak officially assumed control of the line on December&nbsp;1, 2012. Later, Amtrak bought the segment between Schenectady and Hoffmans to its west from CSX.\nCurrent services\nThe busiest segment of the Empire Corridor is between New York City and Albany with twelve trains per day.\nAmtrak\n.  Looking south from 254th street bridge, Riverdale, Bronx, NY]]\nThe following trains operate along the varied segments of the corridor:\n*Empire Service: local service along the entire corridor from New York City to . Most trains operate along the southern segment between New York and , with three trains in each direction continuing west to Niagara Falls daily.\n*Maple Leaf: daily service from New York City to , operating on the entire corridor.\n*Lake Shore Limited: daily service from New York City to , splitting from the corridor at . A section of this train splits-off at Albany–Rensselaer to serve Boston.\n*Adirondack: daily service from New York City to , splitting from the corridor in Schenectady.\n*Ethan Allen Express: daily service from New York City to , splitting from the corridor in Schenectady.\n*Berkshire Flyer: weekly summer service between New York City and , reversing direction and splitting from the corridor at Albany–Rensselaer.\nCommuter rail\n*Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line, from Poughkeepsie, New York to Grand Central Terminal, New York, comprises the corridor between Poughkeepsie to south of Riverdale. From 2026, one round trip per day will continue north all the way to Albany–Rensselaer.\nFreight service\nFreight service is provided by CSX Transportation.\nStations\nAll stations are in the state of New York.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Location\n!rowspan=2 nowrap=yes|Mile (km)\n!rowspan=2|Station\n!rowspan=2|Current stationopened\n!colspan=7 class=unsortable|Corridor services\n!rowspan=2 class=unsortable|Connections\n|-\n!class=unsortable|ES\n!class=unsortable|ML\n!class=unsortable|LS\n!class=unsortable|AD\n!class=unsortable|EA\n!class=unsortable|BF\n!class=unsortable|HD\n|-\n|Niagara Falls\n|\n|Niagara Falls\n|December 6, 2016\n|● || ● || || || || ||\n| NFTA Bus: 52\n|-\n|Buffalo\n|\n|\n| November 8, 2020\n|● || ● || || || || ||\n| NFTA:  (at Canalside station) NFTA Bus: 14, 16, 42, 74  Amtrak Thruway to Jamestown\n|-\n|Depew\n|\n|\n|October 28, 1979\n|● || ● || ● || || || ||\n| NFTA Bus: 46\n|-\n|Rochester\n|\n|Louise M.
