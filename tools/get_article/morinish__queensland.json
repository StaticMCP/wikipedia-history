In the , Morinish had a population of 62 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded by the Fitzroy River to the north and west.\nTen Mile Creek rises in the south-west of the locality () and flows northward through the locality where it becomes a tributary of the Fitzroy River ().\nThe former town of Morinish is south of centre of the locality (approx ).\nHistory\nGold was found at Morinish in 1866 with miners working in the area by December 1866, and a \"new rush\" being described in the newspapers in February 1867 with the population being estimated on the field as 600.\nThe Morinish Post Office opened on 1 July 1867 and closed on 4 November 1872.\nThere were at least three major mines in the period of 1880s to 1900s: Welcome Reef, Alliance Mine and Mount Morinish Mine.\nPerhaps reflecting the changing fortunes on the goldfields, schooling in Morinish was available intermittently.\nMorinish Provisional School opened circa 1882 and closed circa 1890. A second Morinish Provisional School opened circa 1894 and closed circa 1897, but it is not known if this was first school re-opening or a different school.\nIn 1902, two new provisional schools opened called Morinish No 1 Provisional School and Morinish No 2 Provisional School. They were half-time schools (meaning they shared a single teacher between them). In 1915, the No 2 school was closed and the No 1 school became the full-time  Morinish State School. It closed in 1928 due to \"insufficient pupils\". In 1930, the school building was relocated to establish the State School at Garnant. Morinish State School was on Morinish Road (approx ).\nTen Mile Creek Provisional School opened in 1916 but closed circa 1917.\nMorinish was within the Shire of Fitzroy until 2008 when amalgamation of local government areas resulted in it becoming part of the newly created Rockhampton Region.\nDemographics\nIn the , Morinish had a population of 89 people.\nIn the , Morinish had a population of 62 people.\nEducation\nThere are no school in Morinish. The nearest government primary school is Ridgelands State School in neighbouring Ridgelands to the west. The nearest government secondary school is Rockhampton State High School in Wandal, a suburb of Rockhampton; however, it is sufficiently distant that other options would be distance education and boarding school.\nNotable residents\n* William Anderson Forbes (1839-1879), bush balladeer, worked on the goldfield in the 1860s.\n* Fergus McMaster, one of the founders of the airline Qantas, was born in Morinish\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
