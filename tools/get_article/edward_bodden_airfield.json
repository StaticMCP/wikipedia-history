Runway length includes a  displaced threshold on Runway 28.\nThe Cayman Brac non-directional beacon was located  east of the airport, on Cayman Brac island, but was decommissioned in 2021 and replaced with the BRACC airway intersection.\nLittle Cayman Airport's other main building, a 75-foot (23-metre) free span airplane hangar located directly across the field from Bodden Terminal, was built in 1970 by Ryan Construction of Cayman Brac for Dolphin Limited under the direction of General Manager Richard Bennett.\nThe airport has an exemption of airworthiness from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Caymen Islands, however, as of June 2025, the exemption would not continue unless the airport adheres to current standards.\nAirlines and destinations\nCayman Airways Express serves the airport with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter commuter twin turboprop aircraft which have STOL capability.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*Transport in the Cayman Islands\n*List of airports in the Cayman Islands\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/19.6493/-80.0887 Edward Bodden Airfield Airport] at OpenStreetMap\n*\n*[https://www.world-airport-codes.com/cayman-islands/edward-bodden-4132.html Little Cayman Airport] - World Airport Codes\n*"
