In collaboration with linguist and teacher Brother Steve Morelli , they established a plan to revive the language. First, they found the last remaining recordings of Gumbaynggirr, in order to build up the vocabulary and to create a grammar of the language. In that year, Morelli (nicknamed \"Gugs\") worked with the group, which included Maggie Morris, and the Gumbaynggirr Language and Culture Group was established in Sherwood.\nAfter obtaining funding from the federal government the elders published the first Gumbaynggirr dictionary-grammar, in 1992. A second edition of Gumbaynggirr dictionary and learners grammar was published in 2015.\nThe success of the centre led to growth and expansion. Muurrbay was confirmed as a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) in 1997 and started offering language classes. In 2004, it became a regional language centre, adding a further six languages to its offerings.\nIn 2014, the co-op received extra funding for language revitalisation.\nDescription and governance\nMuurrbay is a regional language and training centre focused on language revitalisation of seven Aboriginal languages in the Northern Rivers, Mid North Coast, and Central Coast of New South Wales. It is a Registered Training Organisation (RTO), and collaborates with local government and community groups about appropriate use of Indigenous history and names in public spaces. It also develops research programs for documentation and archival of linguistic and cultural materials, and collaborates with universities in other language research.\nIt publishes a variety of materials relating to language, as well as delivering services in linguistics, information technology, and education, including teaching language in local schools.\nPeople\n, elder Gary Williams is CEO of Muurrbay. Micklo Jarrett is chair, and former politician Aden Ridgeway is also on the board.\nco-founder Steve Morelli (\"Gugs\") is still employed at the centre. He was born in Hungary and migrated to Australia with his family in the 1950s. He earned a BA in Languages, followed by graduate diplomas in linguistics and counselling, and has been recognised for his work at Muurrbay several times. In 1996 he received the Aboriginal Education Award of Excellence from the Department of School Education, Aboriginal Education Unit. He received the Patji-Dawes Language Teaching Award by the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language in 2019 (the International Year of Indigenous Languages) for outstanding achievement, after being nominated by Gary Williams. In 2021 he was awarded an Order of Australia Medal \"for services to the Indigenous Community of Mid-North-Coast NSW\", which he said was shared with the local elders and community.\nUses\nWilliams and other members of the Muurrbay team advised the actors in the 2016 ABC series Cleverman on pronunciation of Gumbaynggirr, which they used along with alongside the northern NSW language of Bundjalung.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
