The street was named in honour of King George V on December 9, 1924.\nHistory\nKing George Street was dedicated in honour of the seventh anniversary of the British conquest of Jerusalem under General Allenby. The inauguration took place in 1924, in the presence of Sir Herbert Samuel, the High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Ronald Storrs, the military governor of Jerusalem, and Raghib al-Nashashibi, the Arab mayor of Jerusalem.\nJerusalem's first traffic light was installed at the intersection of King George Street and Jaffa Road. In 1950–1966, the Knesset, Israel's parliament, met at Beit Froumine on King George Street. It was used by Israel's first five governments, until the Knesset moved to a permanent building in Givat Ram.\nUntil the advent of the Jerusalem Light Rail, King George Street was one of two Jerusalem streets with a pedestrian scramble; the other is Kikar HaShabbat.\nLandmarks\n* Great Synagogue and Heichal Shlomo\n* Jewish Agency for Israel\n* Beit HaMa'alot (\"elevator house\"), 1935 highrise building with elevator, architects Alexander Friedman and Meir Rubin\n* Beit Avi Chai culture centre and Art Gallery\n* The National Institutions House\n* Independence Park\n* Yeshurun Central Synagogue\n* Shiber Pit, the former Menorah Garden – the small park with the bronze horse statue at the junction with Ben Yehuda Street.\nSee also\n* King George Street (Tel Aviv)\n* 1984 King George Street attack\n* Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing\n* King George Street bombing\nGallery\nImage:King george ave.jpg|Commemorative plaque on King George Street\nImage:King george ave 2.jpg|Dedication of the street in 1924\nFile:Jerusalem skyscrapers at head of Ben Yahuda Street.jpg|Construction of high-rise building on King George Street, 1940\nFile:King George Street Jerusalem Carillon.jpg|The carillon of the shopping center at the beginning of the street\nFile:BeitAviChaiMay062023.jpg|Beit Avi Chai\nReferences\nExternal links"
