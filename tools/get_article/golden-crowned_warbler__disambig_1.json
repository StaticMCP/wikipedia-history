It has a large geographic range that extends from northeastern Mexico south to northern Argentina. The white-bellied warbler was formerly treated as a separate species but is now considered to be conspecific with the golden-crowned warbler.\nTaxonomy\nThe golden-crowned warbler was formally described in 1830 under the binomial name Sylvia culicivora by the German accountant Wilhelm Deppe in a price list of specimens that had been collected in Mexico by Wilhelm's brother Ferdinand Deppe. The specific epithet combines the Latin culex, culicis meaning \"midge\" and -vorus meaning \"eating\". The golden-crowned warbler is now one of 12 species placed in the genus Basileuterus that was introduced in 1848 by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis. The genus name is from Ancient Greek βασιλευτερος/basileuteros meaning \"more kingly\".\nFourteen subspecies are recognised:\n* B. c. flavescens Ridgway, 1902 – central west Mexico\n* B. c. brasierii (Giraud Jr, 1841) – northeast, central east Mexico\n* B. c. culicivorus (Deppe, 1830) – central south Mexico to north Costa Rica\n* B. c. godmani Berlepsch, 1888 – central Costa Rica to west Panama\n* B. c. occultus Zimmer, JT, 1949 – west Colombia\n* B. c. austerus Zimmer, JT, 1949 – central Colombia\n* B. c. indignus Todd, 1916 – north Colombia\n* B. c. cabanisi Berlepsch, 1879 – northeast Colombia and northwest Venezuela\n* B. c. olivascens Chapman, 1893 – north, northeast Venezuela and Trinidad\n* B. c. segrex Zimmer, JT & Phelps, WH, 1949 – south Venezuela, west Guyana and north Brazil\n* B. c. auricapilla (Swainson, 1838) – central, east Brazil\n* B. c. azarae Zimmer, JT, 1949 – southeast, south Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and north Argentina\n* B. c. viridescens Todd, 1913 – east Bolivia\n* B. c. hypoleucus Bonaparte, 1850 – southwest Brazil and northeast Paraguay\nThe subspecies B. c. hypoleucus, with white underparts, was formerly considered to be a separate species, the white-bellied warbler. It is now treated as a conspecific with the golden-crowned warbler based partly on evidence from a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 which found that B. c. hypoleucus did not form a monophyletic clade within the complex.\nDescription\nThe golden-crowned warbler is  in overall length. It has grey-green upperparts and bright yellow underparts. The head is grey with a black-bordered yellow crown stripe, a yellow or white supercilium and a black eyestripe. Sexes are similar, but the immature golden-crowned warbler is duller, browner and lacks the head pattern other than the eyestripe.\nThe subspecies fall into four groups. The Central American culicivorus group (known as the stripe-crowned warbler) is essentially as the nominate described above, the southwestern cabanisi group (known as Cabanis's warbler) has grey upperparts and a white supercilium, the aureocapillus group (known as the golden-crowned warbler) of the southeast, has a white supercilium and orange-rufous crown stripe, and the single subspecies in the hypoleucus group (known as the white-bellied warbler) with white, not yellow, underparts that occurs in south central Brazil.\nDistribution and habitat\nIt breeds from Mexico and south through Central America to northeastern Argentina and Uruguay, and on Trinidad. It is mainly a species of lowland forests.\nBehaviour\nThe golden-crowned warbler feeds on arthropods, especially insects and spiders. Their song is a high thin pit-seet-seet-seet-seet, and the call is a sharp tsip. It lays two to four rufous-spotted white eggs in a domed nest in a bank or under leaves on the forest floor. The eggs are incubated by the female for 10 to 12 days. Parent birds will feign injury to distract potential nest predators.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
