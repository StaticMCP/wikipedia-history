It is the 24th-highest of the Adirondack High Peaks, with an elevation of . The mountain is located in the town of Harrietstown in Franklin County. It is named for New York governor William Seward.\nHistory\nThe mountain had the Mohawk name Ou-kor-lah, translated into English as \"Great Eye\", for a white spot on its side when viewed from Long Lake. The name Mount Seward was first used in print in a 1841 report to the New York State Legislature prepared by state geologist Ebenezer Emmons. The first recorded ascent of the mountain was made by surveyor Verplanck Colvin accompanied by mountain guides Alvah Dunning and Mitchell Sabattis on October 15, 1870.\nAscent routes\nThe summit of Seward can be accessed on unmarked trails. The easiest access to the Seward Range is on the Ward Brook Truck Trail, which begins at a parking lot on Coreys Road south of the village of Saranac Lake. Between an intersection with a horse trail  from the trailhead and the Ward Brook lean-to located  from the trailhead, the trail crosses three brooks; the preferred route to Seward Mountain branches off from the trail at the first of these. An alternative route to the Seward Range follows the Calkins Brook Track Trail. This trail begins at the same parking lot and coincides with the Truck Trail for  before diverging to the right. The unmarked trail to the Seward Range branches off of the Calkins Brook Trail at . Another unmarked trail connects the summits of Seward Mountain, Donaldson Mountain, and Mount Emmons.\nClimate\n(1991–2020 normals)\n|single line = y\n|Jan high F = 20.0\n|Feb high F = 22.2\n|Mar high F = 29.6\n|Apr high F = 44.3\n|May high F = 56.9\n|Jun high F = 65.3\n|Jul high F = 69.3\n|Aug high F = 68.0\n|Sep high F = 62.4\n|Oct high F = 49.7\n|Nov high F = 35.2\n|Dec high F = 25.5\n|Jan mean F = 11.4\n|Feb mean F = 13.2\n|Mar mean F = 20.9\n|Apr mean F = 34.3\n|May mean F = 47.0\n|Jun mean F = 56.1\n|Jul mean F = 60.5\n|Aug mean F = 59.2\n|Sep mean F = 53.0\n|Oct mean F = 40.9\n|Nov mean F = 28.0\n|Dec mean F = 18.0\n|Jan low F = 2.8\n|Feb low F = 4.2\n|Mar low F = 12.2\n|Apr low F = 24.2\n|May low F = 37.1\n|Jun low F = 46.8\n|Jul low F = 51.8\n|Aug low F = 50.4\n|Sep low F = 43.7\n|Oct low F = 32.1\n|Nov low F = 20.8\n|Dec low F = 10.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 4.39\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.27\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.97\n|Apr precipitation inch = 4.98\n|May precipitation inch = 5.29\n|Jun precipitation inch = 6.28\n|Jul precipitation inch = 6.00\n|Aug precipitation inch = 5.73\n|Sep precipitation inch = 5.36\n|Oct precipitation inch = 6.19\n|Nov precipitation inch = 4.85\n|Dec precipitation inch = 4.69\n|source=PRISM Climate Group\n}}\nSee also\n* List of mountains in New York\n* Northeast 111 4,000-footers\n* Adirondack High Peaks\n* Adirondack Forty-Sixers\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://dec.ny.gov/things-to-do/hiking/adirondack-backcountry/backcountry-information-for-adirondack-park Backcountry information for Adirondack Park] at dec.ny.gov\n*[https://www.lakeplacid.com/hiking/seward-range Seward Range hiking guide] at lakeplacid.com\n*[https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=6000 Seward Mountain geography] at peakbagger.com\n*[https://www.summitpost.org/page/150703 Seward Mountain description] at summitpost.org"
