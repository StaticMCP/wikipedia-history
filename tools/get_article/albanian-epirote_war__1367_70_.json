His rule marked a renewal of hostilities in the region, persecuting the local nobility, which inspired a series of revolts against his rule. Preljubović also waged a continuous war against the Albanians of Arta and Angelokastron such as in 1367, right after taking power.\nWar\nIn 1367, Pjetër Losha together with his son, Gjin, launched an invasion into Thomas II Preljubović's Despotate. During their campaign, Peter was supported by the Albanian Mazaraki and Malakasioi tribes, who helped him ravage the countryside around Ioannina and later lay a three-year siege on the city itself. In 1370, the siege and thus the war ended with a ceasefire, in which Thomas's daughter Irina, was forced to marry Gjin, son of Pjetër Losha.\nReferences"
