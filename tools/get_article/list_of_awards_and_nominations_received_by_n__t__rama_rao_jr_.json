Rao first appeared as a child artiste in the film Brahmarshi Viswamitra, written, directed and starred by his grandfather N. T. Rama Rao in 1991. He went on to play the titular role as Rama in the 1997 mythological film Ramayanam. Rao made his debut as a lead actor in 2001 with the film Ninnu Choodalani, which was a box office failure. He tasted his first success in the same year with the S. S. Rajamouli's directorial debut, coming-of-age action film Student No: 1.\nThough Subbu which released in the same year could not impress the audience, his 2002 action film Aadi was a massive success. For the film, Rao received Nandi Special Jury Award presented by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The two next films Allari Ramudu and Naaga were back-to-back failures. His second collaboration with the director S. S. Rajamouli was the 2003 action film Simhadri, which ended up as one of the biggest blockbusters of that year. In the film, Rao is seen as a kind-hearted man, Simhadri who has a violent past. In 2004, Rao played a dual role for the first time film Andhrawala directed by Puri Jagannadh. The film could not reach the high expectations and bombed at the box office. Samba which released in the same year had a decent response but his subsequent films Naa Alludu, Narasimhudu and Ashok were a string of failures.\nIn 2007, Rao made his third collaboration with the director S. S. Rajamouli for the socio-fantasy film, Yamadonga. For this film, the actor made a complete body transformation and shed extra kilos. The film was praised for its unique story and performances and became one of the biggest hits of that year. Rao has won his first Filmfare Award as Best Actor – Telugu for the film.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope-\"col\" | Award\n! scope-\"col\" | Year\n! scope-\"col\" | Category\n! scope-\"col\" | Work\n! scope-\"col\" | Result\n! scope-\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n|Bollywood Life Awards\n|2023\n|Best Actor  South\n|RRR\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" |CineMAA Awards\n|2003\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Best Actor\n|Aadi\n|\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|Simhadri\n|\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Yamadonga\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2011\n|Adhurs\n|\n|\n|-\n|Brindavanam\n|\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Oosaravelli\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Dammu\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Temper\n|\n|\n|-\n|Critics' Choice Super Awards\n|2023\n|Best Actor in an Action Movie\n|RRR\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\" |Filmfare Awards South\n|2003\n| rowspan=\"11\" |Best Actor – Telugu\n|Aadi\n|\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|Simhadri\n|\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|Rakhi\n|\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Yamadonga\n|\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Kantri\n|\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Adhurs\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Temper\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Nannaku Prematho\n|\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Jai Lava Kusa\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|RRR\n|\n|\n|-\n|FNCC Awards\n|2004\n|Best Actor\n|Simhadri\n|\n|\n|-\n|Gemini TV Awards\n|2008\n|Best Actor\n|Yamadonga\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |IIFA Utsavam\n|2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Actor – Telugu\n|Temper\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Janatha Garage\n|\n|\n|-\n|Indiana Film Journalists Association, US\n|2023\n|Best Lead Performance\n|RRR\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mirchi Music Awards South\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|Star As A Singing Sensation – Telugu\n|\"Follow Follow\" (from Nannaku Prematho (Follow Follow))\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Star As A Singing Sensation – Kannada\n|\"Geleya Geleya\" (from Chakravyuha)\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Nandi Awards\n|2002\n|Special Jury Award\n|Aadi\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Best Actor\n|Nannaku Prematho and Janatha Garage\n|\n|\n|-\n|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards India\n|2023\n|Favorite Movie Actor (South)\n|RRR\n|\n|\n|-\n|Santosham Film Awards\n|2004\n|Best Young Performer\n|Simhadri\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |South Indian International Movie Awards\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2017\n|Best Actor – Telugu\n|Janatha Garage\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best Male Playback Singer – Kannada\n|\"Geleya Geleya\" (from Chakravyuha)\n|\n|-\n|2018\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Best Actor – Telugu\n|Jai Lava Kusa\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|RRR\n|\n|\n|-\n|South Scope Awards\n|2009\n|Stylish Male Actor – Telugu\n|Kantri\n|\n|\n|-\n|Zee Cine Awards Telugu\n|2018\n|Best Actor\n|Jai Lava Kusa\n|\n|\n|-\n|Zee Cinemalu Awards\n|2017\n|King of Box Office\n|Janatha Garage\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* N.
