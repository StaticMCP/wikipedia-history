Artists are unlike the objective camera lens which records only a single instant and no more. The war artist captures instantaneous action and conflates earlier moments of the same scene within one compelling image.\nHistory\nIn World War I, eight artists commissioned as captains in the U.S. Corps of Engineers. These men were sent to Europe to record the activities of the American Expeditionary Forces.\nIn 1941, the Navy Combat Art Program was founded in order to ensure that competent artists would be present at the scene of history-making events.  Eight active duty artists developed a record of all phases of World War II; and all major naval operations have been depicted by Navy artists.  During the Korean War, the program was revived with two military artists in combat contexts. Since then, artists have been sent to other combat zones, including the Persian Gulf.\nThe U.S. Army War Art Unit was established in late 1942; and by the spring of 1943, 42 artists were selected.  In May 1943, Congress withdrew funding the unit was inactivated.\nThe Army's Vietnam Combat Art Program was started in 1966.  Teams of soldier-artists created pictorial accounts and interpretations for the annals of army military history. These teams of five soldier-artists typically spent 60 days of temporary duty (TDY) in Vietnam embedded with various units.  The U. S. Army Center of Military History (CMH) currently includes an Army Art Collection with about 40 representative war artists.\nIn 1992, the Army Staff Artist Program was attached to the United States Army Center of Military History. Army artists are a permanent part of the Museum Division's Collections Branch.\nThere are significant differences in the artwork created by the branches of the U.S. military:\nScope\nMilitary art and the work of American military artists includes both peacetime and wartime.  For example, USMC combat artist Kristopher Battles deployed with American forces in Haiti to provide humanitarian relief as part of Operation Unified Response after the disastrous earthquake in 2010.\nSelect artists\nWorld War I\n*William James Aylward\n*Walter Jack Duncan\n*Harvey Thomas Dunn\n*Kerr Eby Marines\n*George Matthews Harding\n*Wallace Morgan\n*Ernest Clifford Peixotto\n*J.
