These institutions were planned for the Vindhyachal, Devipatan, and Moradabad divisions. On 1 November 2023, the Uttar Pradesh Cabinet gave formal approval for the establishment of a state university in Moradabad.\nThe Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, laid the foundation stone for the Moradabad state university on 16 March 2024. During the ceremony, he also announced that the university would be named after Guru Jambheshwar, the founder of the Bishnoi community. According to local tradition, Guru Jambheshwar had arrived in Lodhipur Vishanpur town of Moradabad from Rajasthan 493 years ago, in 1587 AD (Vikram Samvat 1587). On 11 June 2024, the state government formally approved the university’s official name as Guru Jambheshwar University.\nOn 3 December 2024, Prof. Sachin Maheshwari was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of the university. The University Grants Commission (UGC) granted recognition to the university on 27 March 2025, with the university’s establishment being retroactively acknowledged from 8 November 2023. The university’s official website and logo were unveiled on 14 July 2025.\nThe Guru Jambheshwar University now oversees all the colleges within the Moradabad division that were previously affiliated with MJP Rohilkhand University, Bareilly. A total of 372 colleges across the division are affiliated with the university, including 87 in Moradabad, 122 in Bijnor, 82 in Amroha, 37 in Rampur, and 44 in the Sambhal district.\nThe university commenced teaching from the academic session 2025-26.\nCampus\nThe university is presently functioning from a temporary campus at Govt Polytechnic, Kanth Road, Moradabad. Construction of the permanent campus of the university at Hardaspur, Moradabad began in June 2024.
