It was formed in on 15 December 1914 when a second Naval Division was raised and joined with the first Naval Division. The Naval Corps occupied the Belgian coast for the full duration of the first world war and was responsible of defending the coast, and the frontline immediately behind the coast. It was still in existence at the end of the war. The Naval Corps was commanded throughout its existence by Admiral Ludwig von Schröder, brought out of retirement.\nChronicle\nAfter the German invasion of Belgium, the State Secretary of the German Imperial Naval Office von Tirpitz raised on 29 August 1914 a Naval Division, assigned with securing the Belgian and Channel coast in order to prevent the British using the harbors along these coast to send reinforcements to the Western Front. On 15 December 1914 a second Naval Division was raised and the two Naval division were joined in the newly established Naval Corps. The 1st Naval Division defended the coastline in Flanders, the 2nd Naval Division held the land front.The coast defence was reinforced considerably on the orders of Tirpitz, by transferring the idle coastal batteries defending the rivers Elbe, Weser, Jade and the Baltic Sea to Flanders. In June 1917 a third Naval Division was attached to the Naval Corps.\nThe Flanders U-boat flotilla was constituted on 29 March 1915 in Bruges as part of the Naval Corps. The boats used Zeebrugge and Ostend as exit ports. Commanded by  Karl Bartenbach, the force comprised nine Type UB I U-boats at the end of April 1915. On 26 May 1915 the first Type UC I minelayer  arrived at Zeebrugge and nine more joined in 1915.\nAfter the loss of four torpedo boats in the Battle off Texel on 17 October 1914, the German Navy was reluctant to send large torpedo boats to Flanders. But these boats were much needed for the defence of the captured Belgian coast. As a compromise, on 21 May 1915 the Flanders Torpedoboat Flotilla was established as part of the Naval Corps, based in Bruges and equipped with eleven small coastal A-I-class torpedo boats which were transported in sections by rail to Hoboken and re-assembled there.\nOrder of battle\nOn 30 oktober 1918\nThe Naval Corps was part of the 4th Army, Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht, still holding the extreme right of  the Western Front.\n* 1st Naval Division\n* 2nd Naval Division\n* two thirds 38th Landwehr Division}}\n* one third 3rd Division}}\n* 85th Landwehr Division\nAt the end of 1918\nMarineKorps Flandern\n– Admiral Ludwig von Schröder\n1.
