      "text": "# Draft:King Engine Bearings\n\nKing Engine Bearings (also known as King Bearings) is a manufacturer of internal combustion engine bearings used in automotive and motorsport applications. The company produces OEM replacement and high-performance bearings and has been active in racing segments since at least the 2010s.\nHistory\nThe company originated in 1960, with multigenerational leadership tied to the founding family. King has exhibited regularly at U.S. automotive trade shows such as the SEMA Show and the Performance Racing Industry (PRI) Show.\nProducts and technology\nKing manufactures connecting rod and main engine bearings for a range of engines, including performance-oriented lines marketed to racers and engine builders. Media coverage has highlighted the company’s use of different bearing constructions (bi-metal and tri-metal) for distinct applications, as well as proprietary coatings intended to improve wear resistance and performance under marginal lubrication.\nOne coating family widely covered in the automotive press is pMaxKote™, described as a polymer overlay designed to protect bearings under high load and during oil starvation events. Power Automedia testing coverage has also discussed pMaxBlack™ overlays and comparative wear testing performed with Driven Racing Oil.\nKing’s product lines reported in industry outlets include HP- and XP-series bearings for performance builds, along with technology features marketed to improve geometry, oiling, and shell-to-shell consistency.\nMotorsport and aftermarket presence\nCoverage in enthusiast and trade media places King Bearings among top bearing choices for modified domestic V8s (e.g., GM LS/LT) and import performance platforms in drag racing and other motorsports. Company representatives and sponsored racers have appeared in PRI/SEMA videos and features explaining application-specific bearing selection and failure prevention.\nReception and discussion\nAutomotive media frequently present King’s coatings and materials as part of a broader trend toward polymer-enhanced engine bearings intended to tolerate marginal lubrication and high specific loads; comparative technical articles and show coverage discuss benefits and trade-offs versus conventional overlays.\nSee also\n* Bearing (mechanical)\n* Engine\n* Internal combustion engine\n* Automotive engineering\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
