      "text": "# Pittsburgh Rebellion\n\nThe Pittsburgh Rebellion was a women's American football team based in Pittsburgh and a member of the Legends Football League (LFL).\nHistory\nThe franchise was announced as the twenty-first franchise in the Legends Football League (LFL) in late 2016. The team was a member of the Eastern Conference in the 2017 season and played in Highmark Stadium, an outdoor soccer-specific stadium. Following the season, the Rebellion decided not to play in 2018 in order to find a more suitable venue to host the team's home games. The team also did not return in the 2019 season, but planned a 2020 return before the entire league essentially ceased operations in December 2019.\nSeasons\n2017 season\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
