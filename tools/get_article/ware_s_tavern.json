The two story wood-frame structure was built c. 1780 by Benjamin Ware as a house for his family.  It has a centered entry that is now sheltered by a Colonial Revival (early 20th century)  surround.  Ware's son Eleazer converted the building into a tavern; it was greatly enlarged with an ell to the rear c. 1840.  The building ceased to be used as a tavern by 1889; an ell was removed sometime in the 19th century, and now stands at 109 S. Main Street.\nThe tavern was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sherborn, Massachusetts\nReferences"
