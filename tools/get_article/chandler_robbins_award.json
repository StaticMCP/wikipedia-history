      "text": "# Chandler Robbins Award\n\nThe ABA Chandler Robbins Award for Education/Conservation is an award given by the American Birding Association to an individual who has made significant contributions either to the education of birders or to bird conservation and the \"management or preservation of habitats on which birds and birding depends.\"  The award may also recognize efforts in both fields.\nOne of five awards presented by the ABA for contributions to ornithology, the award is named in honor of Chandler Robbins, who himself advanced both conservation and education.  Robbins is author of an influential field guide to birds and the architect of the North American Breeding Bird Survey.\nThe award was first bestowed on Ted Lee Eubanks.\nList of recipients\nSince the award's inception in 2000, there have been 17 recipients.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
