The campaign was an important episode in the Moravian Margrave Wars and a decisive victory of Sigismund.\nContext\nIn March 1402, Sigismund captured his brother Wenceslaus, the titular King of Bohemia. This sparked a revolt among a faction of the nobility in the Kingdom of Bohemia led by Margrave Jobst of Moravia. Wenceslaus was imprisoned in Vienna that August, and Sigismund launched a campaign in December to suppress regions loyal to Wenceslaus. Kutná Hora, an important mining town and center of regional wealth, was specifically targeted for its strategic value.\nFrom his camp near Kolín, Sigismund summoned the local lords, knights, and city leaders to join their levies and siege equipment to his campaign, threatening severe reprisals if they refused.\nThe city of Prague responded to the call by sending a contingent led by Markvart of Úlice. The League of Lords also lent military support, as well as the lord . Sigismund brought an army of Cuman mercenaries from Hungary, who sowed terror in the area around Poděbrady, Kolín, and Kutná Hora. Sigismund's army, numbered around 20,000, comprised Hungarians, Cumans, and local allies.\nOrder of battle\nThe siege began on 3 December 1402, when a contingent of Sigsmund's army encircled Kutná Hora. Under the command of Conrad of Vechta, the defenders resisted resolutely, engaging in several fierce battles before the walls. The clashes resulted in significant losses, but precise details of the battles are lacking in historical accounts.\nOn 24 December part of the Prague forces launched an assault on the nearby fortress of Suchdol, where their commander, Markvart of Úlice, was killed by an arrow on 27 December. Faced with Sigismund's numerical superiority, the inhabitants of Kutná Hora sought the intervention of allied lords to negotiate a surrender with the League of Lords. In January 1403, the town capitulated, and its representatives were forced to go to Kolín to beg Sigismund for mercy, accepting humiliating terms.\nConsequences\nThe campaign saw the devastation and capture of several additional strongholds loyal to Wenceslaus. While Sigismund was unable to prevail during his  and , the areas around these cities were laid to waste. The , for instance, was so complete that the village was never resettled. Sigismund was successful in the  and , further diminishing Wenceslaus' influence on the region.\nThe fall of Kutná Hora enabled Sigismund to seize Wenceslaus' royal treasures, including a valuable crown and precious gold and silver objects. He imposed an exorbitant fine on the town, while his troops continued their pillaging in the surrounding regions until February, leaving a lasting memory of their depredations.}}:99\nWenceslaus estimated his losses at a sum equivalent to several million modern Czech korunas. Although Sigismund strengthened his temporary control, the abuses of his army fueled persistent resistance against him in the kingdom throughout 1403.\nNotes\nReferences"
