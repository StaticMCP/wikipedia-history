AMPAS decided to hold the awards in November to move them closer to the eligibility period; therefore, the ceremony took place only seven months after the 2nd Academy Awards, making 1930 the only year in which two Academy Awards ceremonies were held. This was the first ceremony to be voted on by the full membership, rather than by the small clique that voted at the previous two ceremonies.\nAll Quiet on the Western Front became the first film to win both Best Picture and Best Director, which would become common in later years. Lewis Milestone became the first person to win two Oscars, having won Best Director – Comedy at the 1st Academy Awards. The Love Parade received six nominations, the greatest number of any film to that point, but did not win in any category.\nBest Sound Recording was introduced this year, making it the first new category since the inception of the Oscars. It was awarded to Douglas Shearer, brother of Best Actress winner Norma Shearer, making them the first sibling winners in Oscar history. Ruth Chatterton's performance in Sarah and Son, directed by Dorothy Arzner, was the first nominee from a female-directed film.\nA portion of the awards were filmed for the first time: Universal Pictures co-founder and president Carl Laemmle receiving a special Academy Award for All Quiet on the Western Front, given to him by Louis B. Mayer, vice president of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; Norma Shearer winning Best Actress for The Divorcee, and screenwriter Frances Marion winning Best Writing for The Big House.\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on September 19, 1930.
