The album was released in October 1993 on the RooArt label and peaked at No. 20 on the ARIA Album Charts.\nBilly Bragg provides the vocals with Mick Thomas on \"Island of Humour\". \"Stalactites\" marks the first occasion when all members collaborated on the writing of a WPA song and it refers to a well known Melbourne restaurant.\nThe first single from the album, \"Monday's Experts\", released in August 1993, peaked at No. 45 on the ARIA Singles Charts. The two subsequent singles, \"The Rain in My Heart\" (December 1993) and \"Island of Humour\" (January 1994) however failed to chart.\nTrack listing\n| title1          = Monday's Experts\n| length1         = 2:52\n| title2          = Live It Everyday\n| note2           = Peter Lawler, Mick Thomas, Mark Wallace\n| length2         = 3:48\n| title3          = Money Cuts You Out\n| length3         = 3:13\n| title4          = The Rain in My Heart\n| length4         = 3:59\n| title5          = It Wasn't Easy\n| note5           = Mick Thomas, Mark Wallace\n| length5         = 4:00\n| title6          = Keep Talking to Me\n| length6         = 4:56\n| title7          = Island of Humour\n| length7         = 2:59\n| title8          = Easy Money\n| note8           = Peter Lawler\n| length8         = 2:17\n| title9          = In My Lifetime\n| length9         = 4:03\n| title10         = Always Leave Something Behind\n| length10        = 5:55\n| title11         = If You Were a Cloud\n| length11        = 3:07\n| title12         = The Year She Spent in England\n| length12        = 4:38\n| title13         = Stalactites\n| note13          = Peter Lawler, Marcus Schintler, Mark Wallace, Paul Thomas, Mick Thomas\n| length13        = 2:16\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredited to:\nWeddings Parties Anything\n* Peter Lawler - bass guitar, vocals\n* Marcus Schintler - drums, vocals\n* Mick Thomas - guitar, vocals\n* Paul Thomas - guitar, vocals\n* Mark Wallace - accordion, vocals\n* Jen Anderson - strings\nAdditional musicians\n* Billy Bragg - guitar, vocals\n* Michael Barclay - vocals\n* Anna Burley - vocals\n* Hugh Newinson - saw\n* Parkville Quartet - strings\n* Students of St Joseph's School - vocals\n* Barb Waters - vocals\n* Stacey Wright - vocals\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Chart performance for King Tide\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nExternal links\nReferences"
