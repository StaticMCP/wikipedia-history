On 16 January 1922 the region was detached from the Mountain ASSR and the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Oblast on 1 September 1921. It became an autonomous republic on 5 December 1936. On 30 January 1991, the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR declared state sovereignty. It is now the Kabardino-Balkaria republic, a federal subject of the Russian Federation. The Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR bordered no other sovereign states during the existence of the Soviet Union.\nLike the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR was shared by two nationalities. Both autonomous republics resided as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and featured Russians as the ethnic majority.\nHistory\nThe Russian, Ottoman and Persian Empires fought for the region between the 17th and 19th centuries, during which the region was under Russian control. After the October Revolution, the region joined the Mountain Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921, during the Russian Civil War. The territories were detached from the Mountain ASSR to the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Oblast in 1922, and on 5 December 1936 it was transformed into the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.\nIn 8 April 1944, Joseph Stalin accused the Balkars of cooperating with Nazi Germany, men of military age suspected of being collaborators were deported to internment camps in Central Asia. Balkar lands were incorporated into Kabardin ASSR except for Baksan valley which was ceded to the Georgian SSR. After the end of war, most of those interned were allowed to return, except those who actually were involved in anti-Soviet conspiracies. In 11 February 1957, the original name of Balkar-Kabardin ASSR was restored.\nGeography\nThe Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was located in the North Caucasus mountains. It covered an area of .\nRivers\nThe main rivers include the Terek River (623&nbsp;km), Malka River (216&nbsp;km), Baksan River (173&nbsp;km), Urukh River (104&nbsp;km), and Cherek River (76&nbsp;km).\nLakes\nAn area of  is covered solely by river basins. More than 100 lakes are located in the borders, although none of them has very large surface area. Most of the lakes are located in the mountains, formed by glacial processes. Lakes located on a plain include Tambukan Lake.\nMountains\nMount Elbrus (5,642 m) is volcanic and the highest peak in the Caucasus.\nOther major mountains include Mount Dykhtau (5,402 m), Mount Koshkhatau (5,151 m), and Mount Shkhara (5,068 m).\nResources\nAlong with timber, the mining of minerals such as iron, molybdenum, gold, coal, tungsten, and lead were a main industry in the Kabardino-Balkarian ASSR. The region also has a great abundance of mineral water.\nSee also\n*Kabardino-Balkarian Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\n*Flag of the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\nReferences"
