It was created in 2007 as Maryhill/Kelvin, and in that election it returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system. The same boundaries were used in 2012. For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the boundaries were changed, the ward substantially decreased in territory and population, was renamed Maryhill and returned three members.\nBoundaries\nLocated in the far north of Glasgow with East Dunbartonshire to the north, the ward includes the former burgh of Maryhill (and the Wyndford housing estate) between the River Kelvin to the west and the Port Dundas branch of the Forth and Clyde Canal to the east, as well as the Maryhill Park, Summerston, Gilshochill, Acre and Dawsholm neighbourhoods to the north of the main canal.\nThe 2017 changes removed the Cadder neighbourhood which was assigned to Canal ward (along with a large area around Balmore Road which is almost uninhabited); part of North Kelvinside (streets to the north-west of Queen Margaret Drive, which now forms Maryhill's southern boundary) was added from the same ward. Kelvindale and Kelvinside were removed and assigned to a new Partick East/Kelvindale ward.\nThe ethnic makeup of the Maryhill ward using the 2011 census population statistics was:\n*91.2% White Scottish / British / Irish / Other\n*4.9% Asian (mainly Chinese)\n*3% Black (mainly African)\n*0.8% Mixed / Other Ethnic Group\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Mary Paris(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=77; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Robert Winter(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Alex Dingwall(SNP/Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Mohammed Razaq(Labour)\n|-\n!2010\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|John Letford(SNP/Alba)\n|rowspan=1|Martin Rhodes(Labour)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Franny Scally(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Jane Morgan(Labour)\n!rowspan=4; colspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2021\n!rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Abdul Bostani(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Keiran O'Neill(Labour)\n|-\n!2024\n|rowspan=1|Marie Garrity(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2024 By-election\n2022 Election\n2022 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 Election\n2017 Glasgow City Council election\n2012 Election\n2012 Glasgow City Council election\n2007 Election\n2007 Glasgow City Council election\nSee also\n*Wards of Glasgow\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/maryhill-ward-glasgow-city Listed Buildings in Maryhill Ward, Glasgow City] at British Listed Buildings"
