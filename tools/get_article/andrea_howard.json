Howard (m. 1974; died 2016)\n| years_active = 1972–1992 (as actress)\n}}\nAndrea Howard (born February 10, 1947) is an American businesswoman and retired actress who worked in film and television in the 1970s and 1980s.\nHer more notable films include The Nude Bomb as Agent 22 (1980), and ''Thank God It's Friday as Sue (1978). Some of her notable television credits include the American daytime soap opera Santa Barbara as Veronica Gayley (1984–85) and the comedy series Holmes & Yoyo as Maxine Moon (1976–77).\nHoward married her first husband at the age of eighteen and had two children from the marriage, but she was divorced by the age of twenty-five. Her first job in the business was as a production assistant at Universal Studios and, shortly after that, made the change to acting. Andrea retired from acting in the early 1990s after a 20-year career. She then went into the real estate business with her second husband and also studied interior design. In later years, she has owned a winery in Bennett Valley with her husband and a bed and bath boutique store with her daughter. She currently lives in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where she has worked as a realtor.\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Program\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Episodes\n|-\n| 1974\n| The Snoop Sisters\n|  Secretary to Arwin Shanks\n| Blue Day For Blackbeard\n| 1\n|-\n| 19751976\n| McMillan & Wife\n| KathiJoanne Nelson\n| Love, Honor and SwindlePoint Of Law\n| 2\n|-\n| 1976\n| Ellery Queen\n| Studio Receptionist\n| The Adventure of the Hard Hearted Huckster\n| 1\n|-\n| 1976\n| Holmes & Yoyo\n| Maxine Moon\n|\n| 1\n|-\n| 1977\n| Lanigan's Rabbi\n|\n| Corpse Of The Year\n| 1\n|-\n| 1977\n| Rosetti and Ryan\n| Sister Contanza\n| Men Who Loved Women\n| 1\n|-\n| 1978\n| Eight is Enough\n|\n| Milk and Sympathy\n| 1\n|-\n| 1979\n| A Man Called Sloane\n| Anna\n| Sweethearts of Disaster\n| 1\n|-\n| 1980\n| B.
