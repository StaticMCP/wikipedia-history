However, when William became a man he demanded that the lands be restored to him, but this claim was denied to him and refused by the Camerons who claimed that the lands had been deserted and now belonged to themselves as they were the first to seize and occupy them.|group=note}} mentions a great battle at Drumlui in which William Mackintosh defeated the Camerons who were under the leadership of Donald Alin Vic Ian, or Donald Alin Mhic Evin. However, a number of Mackintosh and Clan Shaw men were also mortally wounded.\nAftermath\nThis battle led to a long-lasting 350 year feud which did not end until near the end of the 17th century. In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Drumlui each clan alternately harried each other's lands, lifting cattle, until the famous Battle of Invernahavon in 1370.\nReferences\nNotes"
