Hume Award is an annual award presented to the player deemed to be the most \"unsung hero\" for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). It is voted by the fans and presented at the Canucks' last home game of the regular season.\nThe most recent recipient is Kiefer Sherwood, who won it for the first time in the 2024–25 season.\nHistory\nThe Fred J. Hume Award was first presented after the Canucks' inaugural NHL season in 1970–71 and was named after former Mayor of Vancouver Fred J. Hume, who was also owner of the Vancouver Canucks, while they were in the Western Hockey League (WHL), and an active campaigner to bring the NHL to Vancouver. Prior to being decided by a fan vote, the award was decided on by the Vancouver Canucks Booster Club before the organization dissolved in the 2000s.\nThe most times a Canucks player has won the award is three times, which was accomplished by Jannik Hansen (2011, 2013, and 2016).\nWinners\nis the only three-time winner of the award (2011, 2013, 2016).]]\n, and 2004 recipient, Brent Sopel]]\nwon in 2007.]]\nwon in 2008.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Positions key\n| C || Centre\n| LW || Left wing\n| D || Defence\n| RW || Right wing\n| G || Goaltender\n|}\nPlayer is still active with the Canucks.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Season\n!Winner\n!Position\n|-\n| 1970–71\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1971–72\n|\n| C\n|-\n| 1972–73\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1973–74\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 1974–75\n|\n| C\n|-\n| 1975–76\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1976–77\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 1977–78\n|  (2)\n| RW\n|-\n| 1978–79\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1979–80\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1980–81\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 1981–82\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1982–83\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1983–84\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1984–85\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1985–86\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 1986–87\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1987–88\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 1988–89\n|  (2)\n| RW\n|-\n| 1989–90\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 1990–91\n|  (2)\n| LW\n|-\n| 1991–92\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 1992–93\n|\n| C\n|-\n| 1993–94\n|\n| C\n|-\n| 1994–95\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 1995–96\n|  (2)\n| LW\n|-\n| 1996–97\n|\n| C\n|-\n| 1997–98\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 1998–99\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 1999–2000\n|\n| C\n|-\n| 2000–01\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 2001–02\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 2002–03\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2003–04\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 2004–05\n| colspan=\"2\"|Season cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout\n|-\n| 2005–06\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 2006–07\n|\n| D\n|-\n| 2007–08\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2008–09\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 2009–10\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2010–11\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 2011–12\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2012–13\n|  (2)\n| LW\n|-\n| 2013–14\n|\n| G\n|-\n| 2014–15\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 2015–16\n|  (3)\n| RW\n|-\n| 2016–17\n|\n| RW\n|-\n| 2017–18\n|  (2)\n| RW\n|-\n| 2018–19\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2019–20\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2020–21\n|\n| LW\n|-\n| 2021–22\n|\n| D\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n| 2022–23\n|\n| C\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n| 2023–24\n|  (2)\n| LW\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n| 2024–25\n|\n| LW\n|}\nSee also\n* Babe Pratt Trophy\n* Cyclone Taylor Trophy\n* Cyrus H.
