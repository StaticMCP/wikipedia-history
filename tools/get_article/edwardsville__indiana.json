The Duncan Tunnel is located at Edwardsville.\nHistory\nEdwardsville was platted in 1853 by Henry H. Edwards, and named for him. A post office was established at Edwardsville in 1858, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1905.\nIn 1881, the Duncan Tunnel (commonly called the Edwardsville Tunnel) was completed by the Southern Railway. Spanning about 4,295 feet, it remains the longest railroad tunnel in Indiana, originally constructed to navigate the difficult terrain of Floyds Knobs and now in use by Norfolk Southern Railway.\nGeology\nThe Edwardsville Formation is a geological structure in the Borden Group, of the Lower Mississippian sub system, (Osagean, late Tournaisian). Crinoids fossils can be found in the formation.\nReferences"
