The tower of the church was built in the 15th century and the gabled roof was added in the 17th century. It became a Protestant church during the Reformation. There was a major renovation which, apart from work on the tower, ended in 1955.\nThe church is located at the Groot Kerkhof 24 in the centre of Bolsward.\nIt was listed as a Rijksmonument in 1968. It remains in active use, with a weekly Sunday service.\nReferences"
