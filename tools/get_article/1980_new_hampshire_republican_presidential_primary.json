Despite having recently lost the Iowa caucuses in a shocking upset, Ronald Reagan claimed a landslide victory, securing a majority of the vote and a 27 percentage point victory over his next closest opponent, George H. W. Bush. Behind them, Howard Baker of Tennessee finished 3rd, and John Anderson of Illinois finished 4th.\nReferences"
