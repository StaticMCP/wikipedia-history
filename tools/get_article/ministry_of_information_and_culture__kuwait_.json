It was established in 1979 by a decree issued by the state's ruler Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah. The ministry undertakes the media, intellectual and cultural policy and contributes to sponsoring art. The Ministry of Information is also concerned with tourism and antiquities affairs.\nThe current Minister is Abdul Rahman Badah Al-Mutairi.\nMinistry history\nThe year 1954 witnessed the beginning of Kuwait's media march. The Official Gazette was established, and shortly after its issuance, it was attached with its printing presses to the Department of Printing and Publishing,  established in 1955 and headed by Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad. In 1959, the Emiri decree was issued, which stipulated the term “Press and Publishing Department for all issues related to the press.” At the beginning of 1962, government departments were transformed into ministries. The official name of the Department of Governmental Publications and Publishing became “Ministry of Guidance and News”. The Radio and Television Department was attached to it. It took over all Publication media and films, which were taken over by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor and renamed it in February 1971, becoming the Ministry of Information. As for Kuwait Radio, the sound “Here is Kuwait” was launched for the first time in 1951. The half-century development of work in the radio and media efforts resulted in the emergence of eight radio stations within the framework of Radio Kuwait, broadcasting their programs in four languages for a period of 72 hours a day.\nKuwait TV started fast and developed steps since 1961. The Ministry of Guidance and News at that time took over the responsibility for television broadcasting.
