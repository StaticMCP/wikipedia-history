Some of the appointments listed below made into the list of Asian-American firsts.\nExisting Asian coaches reflect that problems of race and sports especially \"Asian stereotypes exist at all levels of basketball\", which contributes to a factor why there has been a lack of Asian coaches in NCAA basketball. The Asian Coaches Association is the most prominent association representing the causes of Asian basketball coaches.\nWomen of Asian heritage coaching men's teams in particular encounter stereotypes. In 1998, Kim Ng recalled \"she has been treated with kid gloves since being named an assistant GM with the Yankees.\"\nList\n:  denotes women coaching or overseeing a men's team.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\"|Name\n! scope=\"col\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\"|League\n! scope=\"col\"|Club\n! scope=\"col\"|From\n! scope=\"col\"|Until\n! scope=\"col\"|Notes\n|-\n| Dave Yanai\n| Head coach\n| NAIA / NCAA D-II Basketball\n| Cal State Dominguez Hills Toros and Cal State Los Angeles Golden Eagles\n| 1977\n| 2005\n|\n|-\n| Erik Spoelstra\n| Assistant coach\n| NBA\n| Miami Heat\n| 1997\n| April 2008\n| Filipino descent from mother's side\n|-\n|Kim Ng\n|Asst.
