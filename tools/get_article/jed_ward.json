On 5 February 2021, Ward signed his first professional contract with the club aged 17.\nOn 9 May 2021, with Rovers already relegated, Ward made his professional debut on the final day of the season against Blackpool as they lost 1–0.\nOn 21 January 2022, Ward joined Southern League Premier Division South club Swindon Supermarine on a one-month loan deal, joining fellow Rovers youngsters Kieran Phillips and Tom Mehew at the club. Ward was recalled from his loan spell on 3 February.\nOn 17 February he joined Prescot Cables on loan for a month.  He returned to his parent club in early March.\nOn 12 August 2022, Ward joined National League South club Hungerford Town on a one-month youth loan deal. On 7 September 2022, this deal was extended until the end of the season. Whilst on loan with the club suffering from a broken hand, Ward signed a new contract with his parent club that would keep him at Rovers until 2024 with the option for a further extension. Despite Hungerford's relegation battle, he impressed with his manager referring to him as an \"ultimate professional\" and \"a very good up-and-coming goalkeeper\". He was recalled from his loan with immediate effect on 7 April, with manager Barton later promising to involve him at some point in the last five matches of the season. On 22 April, he made his first performance since returning to the club, featuring in a 2–0 defeat to Port Vale, with manager Barton impressed by his performance despite the scoreline, tipping him to be a future first-choice goalkeeper for the club.\nOn 25 July 2023, Ward signed for National League club Wealdstone on a season-long loan deal. He was recalled by his parent club on 14 November 2023, featuring that night in an EFL Trophy tie with Newport County.\nOn 27 January 2024, Ward made his home league debut for the club in a 3–1 victory over Oxford United, impressing with a man-of-the-match performance. Having firmly established himself as first-choice goalkeeper, he signed a new four-year contract on 28 March 2024. At the club's end of season awards ceremony, Ward was awarded the Young Player of the Year award.\nFollowing the loan signing of Josh Griffiths, Bristol Rovers' manager Matt Taylor revealed that the long-term plan was for Ward to be loaned out to continue his development. On 31 July 2024, he joined National League side Forest Green Rovers on a season-long loan deal. Ward was recalled on 3 February 2025 following Griffiths' recall by West Bromwich Albion.\nOn 1 August 2025, Ward joined National League club Yeovil Town on a season-long loan.\nInternational career\nOn 21 May 2021, the day after he turned 18, Ward was called up to the England U19 training camp, to be held at St George's Park.\nIn March 2024, Ward received a first call-up for the England U20 squad. On 7 June 2024, Ward made his U20 debut during a 2-1 win over Sweden at Stadion ŠRC Sesvete.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Bristol Rovers\n|2020–21\n|League One\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|2021–22\n|League Two\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0||3||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|League One\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|2023–24\n|League One\n|18||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||19||0\n|-\n|2024–25\n|League One\n|18||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||18||0\n|-\n|2025–26\n|League Two\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!38!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!4!!0!!42!!0\n|-\n|Swindon Supermarine (loan)\n|2021–22\n|SL Premier Division South\n|3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||3||0\n|-\n|Prescot Cables (loan)\n|2021–22\n|NPL Division One West\n|3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||3||0\n|-\n|Hungerford Town (loan)\n|2022–23\n|National League South\n|24||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||27||0\n|-\n|Wealdstone (loan)\n|2023–24\n|National League\n|19||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||20||0\n|-\n|Forest Green Rovers (loan)\n|2024–25\n|National League\n|28||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||31||0\n|-\n|Yeovil Town (loan)\n|2025–26\n|National League\n|19||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||20||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!134!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!10!!0!!146!!0\n|}\nHonours\nIndividual\n*Bristol Rovers Young Player of the Year: 2023–24\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
