It is sited within Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California.\nThe NSWC runs much of the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) training. The main courses are the famous 12-month-long SEAL training (BUD/S and SQT) and 9-month long SWCC training.\nTraining sites and detachments\nThe NSWC currently covers these subsidiary training sites:\n* Detachment at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida;\n* Detachment at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii;\n* Detachment at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona;\n* Detachment at Hurlburt Field, Florida\n* Naval Special Warfare Cold Weather Detachment Kodiak, Alaska\n* SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Training at Naval Support Activity Panama City, Florida\n* Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi\n* Mountain Warfare Training Camp Michael Monsoor.\nNaval Special Warfare Advanced Training Command\n* Advanced Training at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia\nThe Naval Special Warfare Advanced Training Command (NAVSPECWARADVTRACOM) was established 6 December 2006 as a shore activity. It is located at 1 Hooper Boulevard, Imperial Beach, CA 91932-1050 (at the same location as the former NSGD Imperial Beach).\nIt was advertised as another major milestone in the NSW Global Transformation and a reshaping of the Naval Special Warfare Center. The requirement for NSW specialized Courses of Instruction (COI) in support of Overseas Contingency Operations will continue, which was thought to necessitate establishment of the advanced training command. NAVSPECWARADVTRACOM will be responsible for the coordination, management, and conduct of the specialized COIs and for providing the same training to Joint Special Operations and foreign counterpart personnel. Manpower exceeding 200 will be provided by transfers from Naval Special Warfare Center, San Diego. The command supports more than 30 advanced training courses, seven detachments and 15 training sites across the country, including detachments in Alaska and Hawaii.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sealswcc.com SEALSWCC.COM]"
