The two schools' most prominent rivalry was in football, but in later years it has shifted to men's basketball.\nFootball\nWSC, 10–0\n| mostrecent            = August 30, 2025Washington State, 13–10\n| nextmeeting           = September 4, 2027\n| total                 = 94\n| series                = Washington State leads,\n| largestvictory        = Washington State, 84–27 (1975)\n| longeststreak         = Washington State, 20(1928–1949)\n| longestunbeatenstreak = Washington State, 26(1926–1953)\n| currentstreak         = Washington State, 11(2001–present)\n| currentunbeatenstreak =\n| trophy                =\n| trophy series         =\n| stadiums              =\n| map_location          =\n| map_width             =\n| map_label1            =\n| map_mark1             =\n| map_label1_position   =\n| coordinates1          =\n| map_label2            =\n| map_mark2             =\n| map_label2_position   =\n| coordinates2          =\n| map_caption           =\n}}\nSeries history\nThe first game was played  in November 1894 and resulted in a win for Washington State. The game in 1898 was not played because Idaho had an ineligible ringer from Lapwai, David McFarland, a recent All-American from Carlisle. The Vandals' first-ever forward pass was attempted against the Cougars in 1907: it was completed for a touchdown from a drop-kick formation in the fourth quarter and led to a }}\nWashington State has dominated the local rivalry, holding a  lead; the record since 1926 is even more dominant, with a  advantage for the Cougars. The longest winning streak for Idaho was three games  and has only five victories since that three-peat (1954, 1964, 1965, 1999, & 2000) and two ties (1927, 1950) to offset the 58 losses.\nThe games were skipped in 1969 and 1971, notably for Idaho as the 1971 Vandals posted one of the best records  in school history, while WSU  The rivalry became increasingly one-sided as WSU dominated in the 1970s (except for 1974) and the original series ended, following the 1978 game. From 1979 to 1997, the game was played just twice (1982, 1989) until the 10-year renewal from 1998–2007. Since their last wins in 1999 and 2000, Idaho has been physically outmatched in most of the ten games; the game has been played three times since 2007, in 2013, 2016, and 2022.\nAs two schools are in close proximity, there was a tradition called Walkathon from 1938 to 1968; a week following the game, students of the losing school walked from their campus to the winners', then received rides back home from the winning side. This has frequently been misreported as students walking back to their own campus immediately following the game. In 1954, the walk made national news when about 2,000 students from Washington State College made the trek east from Pullman to Moscow after the Cougars lost to Idaho for the first time in 29 years.\nIn a span of less than five months, from November 1969 to April 1970, both schools' aged wooden stadiums (Idaho's Neale Stadium and WSU's Rogers Field) burned down due to suspected arson. The WSU–Idaho game in 1970 was dubbed the Displaced Bowl, which was held in Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane on September 19. The Cougars won the game (their only win that season), as well as the next ten against the Vandals. This&nbsp;was the first in the rivalry played on AstroTurf, which was new to Joe Albi that season.\nIn 1978, the NCAA split Division I football in two: I-A (now FBS) and I-AA (now FCS). Washington State was in Division I-A as part of the Pac-10 Conference and Idaho downgraded to I-AA as part of the Big Sky Conference, whose other football members moved up from Division II. In the late 1970s, I-A football programs were allowed 50% more scholarships and twice as many assistant coaches as I-AA teams. During the years they were in different divisions, the schools met only twice (1982 in Spokane and 1989 in Pullman). In 1996, Idaho moved back up to Division I-A in the Big West Conference, and Idaho and WSU rekindled their century-old rivalry. Since the rivalry was reinstated in 1998, every game has been played at Martin Stadium in Pullman, except for the matchup in 2003, which was played at Seattle's Seahawks Stadium. The last game played on the Idaho side of the border was  in 1966, a come-from-behind  Cougar victory on a very muddy field to prevent a Vandal three-peat.\nFuture of rivalry\nAfter ten years of the renewed rivalry, Vandal head coach Robb Akey, previously WSU's defensive coordinator, said in 2008 that he preferred the game not be played every year, instead saying he would prefer it as a \"once-in-a-while thing.\" Only one game was played during Akey's tenure, in his first season in 2007, and he was fired in October 2012. The meeting in 2013 on September 21 was a one-year revival, and WSU  in 2016. Because of the difficulty of scheduling as an isolated FBS independent, Idaho returned to FCS and the Big Sky in 2018. There was a meeting scheduled for 2020, but it was canceled due to complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic; the teams played next in 2022, a 24–17 Cougar win. Future meetings are currently scheduled for 2025, 2027, and 2029.\nGame results\n| team2 = Washington State / Washington Agricultural\n| team2style =\n| format = compact\n| November 18, 1894 | Moscow,
