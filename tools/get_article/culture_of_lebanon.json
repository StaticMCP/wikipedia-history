It was home to the Phoenicians and was subsequently conquered and occupied by the Assyrians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Persians, the Arabs, the Crusaders, the Ottomans and the French. This variety is reflected in Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different religious groups, and features in the country's festivals, literature, artifacts, cuisine and architecture.\nThe Maronites and the Druzes founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the \"Maronite-Druze dualism\" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifite. Despite the religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they \"share an almost common culture\". Article 11 of the Constitution of Lebanon states: \"Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the French language is to be used\". The spoken Lebanese Arabic dialect used in public mixes Arabic with French. Cuisine and literature are deep-rooted \"in wider Mediterranean and Levantine norms\".\nThe hilly Mediterranean geography of Lebanon has played a role in shaping the history of Lebanon and its culture. Archaeology of Lebanon is conducted to explore the region's past.\nHistory\nArts\nBy the turn of the 20th century, Beirut was vying with Cairo to be the major centre for Near Eastern and Middle Eastern thought, with many newspapers, magazines and literary societies.

Upon his return to Lebanon in 1618, he began modernizing Lebanon. He developed a silk industry, upgraded olive-oil production, and brought with him numerous Italian engineers who began the construction of mansions and civil building throughout the country. The cities of Beirut and Sidon were especially built in the Italianate style.\nThe Italianate, specifically, Tuscan, influence on architecture in Lebanon dates back to the Renaissance when Fakhreddine, the first Lebanese ruler who truly unified Mount Lebanon with its Mediterranean coast executed an ambitious plan to develop his country.\nThe influence of these buildings, such as the ones in Deir el Qamar, influenced building in Lebanon for many centuries and continues to the present time. For example, streets like Rue Gouraud continues to have numerous, historic houses with Italianate influence. Buildings like the Nicolas Sursock mansion on Rue Sursock, which is today a major museum, attest to the continuous influence of Italianate architecture in Lebanon.\nLiterature\n(April 1913)]]\nKhalil Gibran (1883–1931), who was born in Bsharri, is particularly known for his book The Prophet (1923), which has been translated into more than twenty different languages.

Lebanese performers are celebrated throughout the Arab World, and with the notable exception of Egypt enjoy increasing regional popularity. Rising demand for Arabic music outside Western Asia has provided Lebanese artists with a small but significant global audience. However, widespread piracy continues to inhibit the music industry's growth.\nMedia\nLebanon is not only a regional center of media production but also the most liberal and free in the Arab world.

Lebanon's press became a huge industry despite the country's small size and has remained a haven for Arabic publishing.

Lebanon hosts annually two important regional publishing events, the Beirut Book Fair and the Beirut Francophone Book Fair.\nTelevision in Lebanon was introduced in 1959, with the launch of two privately owned stations, CLT and Télé Orient that merged in 1967 into Télé Liban.

The musical plays of Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of modern Arab theatre. Some scholars like Abdulatif Shararah divided theatre in Lebanon into three phases: translations of European plays, Arab nationalism, and realism.\nCultural relations between Lebanon and Egypt\n----\nThe cultural and historical relations between Lebanon and Egypt are considered unique due to a significant overlap between Lebanese and Egyptian cultures, particularly in the fields of literature, theater, cinema, and journalism. These areas have historically fostered mutual influence and collaboration between the two countries. This cultural exchange was highlighted during the conference Egypt in the Eyes of the Lebanese, held as part of the cultural program Egypt in the Eyes of the World. The event took place at the headquarters of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and was attended by the Lebanese Ambassador to Egypt, Madeleine Tabar, along with Ahmed Ghanem, founder of the cultural program, and a number of prominent Lebanese artists.\nFashion\nMany Christians and most Muslims who live in the cities wear modern stylish clothes.
