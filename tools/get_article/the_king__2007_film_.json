It later aired on the Nine Network on 27 August 2007.\nThe film faced criticism from some of those close to Kennedy who felt it did not portray him accurately, feeling that he was portrayed too broadly in a dark manner in the film, as well as what one commentator noted was a \"mad rush to out him, sexually\".\nProduction\nThe screenplay was written by Jaime Browne and Kris Mrksa; the director was Matthew Saville, and the producer was Jason Stephens. Filming began on 6 December 2006 with a  budget and a 20-day shooting schedule. The ABC's Ripponlea studios were utilised to film the scenes for sequences involving Kennedy's roles on In Melbourne Tonight and Blankety Blanks.\nStephen Curry (who plays the role of Graham Kennedy) lost 14 kilograms to portray the young Kennedy, and then regained the weight in two weeks over Christmas 2006 to play the older Kennedy.\nCast\n* Stephen Curry as Graham Kennedy\n* Stephen Hall as Bert Newton\n* Shaun Micallef as Colin Bednall\n* Monica Maughan as Nan\n* Jane Allsop as Noeline Brown\n* Angus Sampson as Ugly Dave Gray\n* Steve Bisley as Harry M.

The \"Weren't you Graham Kennedy?\" syndrome will likely pursue him every time he tries to buy groceries. As it did the King [...]\nCurry is terrific and, although instantly recognisable as the oyster-eyed performer, doesn't impersonate him (though he says he tested prosthetic eyes) so much as inhabit him [...]\nAwards\nAt the 2007 Australian Film Institute Awards The King'' won the award for Best Telefeature or Miniseries. Curry also picked up the award for Best Lead Actor in a Television Drama and Saville for Best Direction in Television.\nSee also\n* List of biographical films\nReferences\nOther references\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185512/http://www.popplanet.biz/story.jsp?id=871 King Cast For TV1]\n*[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20827634-1702,00.html Graham Kennedy – the telemovie]\n*[https://archive.today/20121230132743/http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,20879047-5006022,00.html King given plenty of Curry]\n*[http://blogs.smh.com.au/sit/archives/2006/11/reassessments_f.html Reassessments: From the castle to the kingdom]\nExternal links\n*\n*"
