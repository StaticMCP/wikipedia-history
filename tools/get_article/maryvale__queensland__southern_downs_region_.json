In the , the locality of Maryvale had a population of 392 people.\nGeography\nMaryvale is on the Darling Downs on the Cunningham Highway,  south west of the state capital, Brisbane.\nGlengallan Creek which rises on the western slopes of the Main Range is a tributary of the Condamine River.  It passes through the locality from east to west.  The creek is a source of irrigated water for terraced crops in the area.  At the southern and northern boundaries of Maryvale, elevations rise to greater than 900&nbsp; m above sea level.\nHistory\nThe town's name is derived from a pastoral property name first used about 1847 probably by Patrick Leslie or James Hay.\nA pastoral station was selected in the area in about 1840 by John Cameron. However, Cameron found it difficult to transport the wool from their sheep down through Cunninghams Gap to be sold. Therefore, he relocated into the Fassifern Valley in 1842. The pastoral run at Maryvale was sold to Arnold Weinholt in 1848.\nIn 1911 the Methodist Church and Presbyterian Church jointly established a church in Maryvale, but later it was operated solely by the Methodists.\nOn 30 September 1911, the Maryvale railway line opened from the Southern railway line to Maryvale railway station (the terminus, ). Originally intended as a segment of a more direct (via recta) railway route from Brisbane to Sydney, the segment from Mount Edwards to Maryvale was never completed and the line remained a local branch line until it closed on 1 November 1960.\nMaryvale State School opened on 21 April 1913.\nMaryvale Post Office opened by March 1914 (a receiving office had been open from 1913) and closed in 1981.\nOn Monday 8 September 1924 the Reverend William Powning Glover placed the first stump into position for the construction of an Anglican Church on the site of the original Maryvale homestead built by Arnold Weinholt. It was considered an appropriate location as Canon Glennie, the first Anglican priest on the Darling Downs, had conducted services at the homestead. Glover announced the church would be dedicated to St Alban. On Sunday 22 February Archbishop Gerald Sharp opened and dedicated St Alban's Anglican Church. The church was built on  of ground and the architect was John Shedden Adam of Sydney, the brother-in-law of Reverend Glover.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Maryvale and the surrounding area had a population of 350 people.\nIn the , the locality of Maryvale had a population of 303 people.\nIn the , the locality of Maryvale had a population of 392 people.\nEducation\nMaryvale State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 81 Taylor Street ().
