      "text": "# The Last Generation of the Roman Republic\n\nThe Last Generation of the Roman Republic (1974) is a scholarly work by Erich S. Gruen on the end of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.\nThe central argument of the work is that the Late Roman Republic can be characterised by the strength and continuity of its institutions, rather than by their gradual disintegration. The latter view, first presented in Ronald Syme's influential The Roman Revolution (1939),  was popularly accepted prior to Gruen's The Last Generation, and this work is often considered a reply to Syme.\nReferences"
