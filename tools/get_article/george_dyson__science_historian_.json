When he was sixteen he went to live in British Columbia to pursue his interest in kayaking.\nFrom 1972 to 1975, he lived in a treehouse at a height of 30 metres that he built from salvaged materials on the shore of Burrard Inlet.  Dyson became a Canadian citizen and spent 20 years in British Columbia, designing kayaks, researching historic voyages and native peoples, and exploring the Inside Passage. He was, during this period, estranged from his father for some time.\nCareer\n}}\nDyson's first book, Baidarka, published in 1986, described his research on the history of the Aleutian kayak, its evolution in the hands of Russian fur traders, and his adaptation of its design to modern materials. He is the author of Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965 and Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence, in which he expands upon the premise of Samuel Butler's 1863 article of the same name and suggests that the Internet is a living, sentient being. His 2012 book ''Turing's Cathedral''  has been described as \"a creation myth of the digital universe.\" It was a finalist for the Los Angeles Times 2012 Book Prize in the science and technology category and was chosen by University of California Berkeley's annual \"On the Same Page\" program for the academic year 2013–14.\nDyson is the founder/owner of Dyson, Baidarka & Company, a designer of Aleut-style skin kayaks; he is credited with the revival of the baidarka style of kayak.\nDyson was a visiting lecturer and research associate at Western Washington University's Fairhaven College and was Director's Visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 2002–03. He was a frequent contributor to Edge.org between 1998 and 2019.\n''Turing's Cathedral\nTuring's Cathedral'' is Dyson's fourth book. Though Alan Turing is in the title, the book focuses on John von Neumann and his 1946 attempt to build a computer at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study (known as the IAS machine, MANIAC I was the same machine later built at Los Alamos Laboratory). Dyson interviewed several people who knew von Neumann, including his father, Freeman Dyson. The book received mostly positive reviews. Brian E. Blank noted in his review \"[e]xtensive biographical and institutional backgrounds\", and concludes it with:\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that ''Turing's Cathedral is an idiosyncratic, undisciplined, crazy quilt of a book. The reviewer had no preconceived notions about the sort of book that might be authored by a man who once lived for three years in a treehouse 95 feet above the ground, but the eccentricities of Turing's Cathedral do not seem inconsistent with what might be imagined. And yet, for all its flaws, shortcomings, and waywardness, it is a book that amply rewards its readers.\nMedia appearances\n* To Mars by A-Bomb: The Secret History of Project Orion (BBC, 2003)\n* The Starship and the Canoe (1986)\nBooks\n* Baidarka the Kayak\n* Darwin Among the Machines\n* Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957–1965\n* Turing's Cathedral\n* Analogia: The Entangled Destinies of Nature, Human Beings and Machines''\nPersonal life\nGeorge Dyson's parents were the theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson and mathematician Verena Huber-Dyson. He is the brother of technology analyst Esther Dyson, and the grandson of the composer George Dyson.\nGeorge Dyson and Ann Yow-Dyson have a daughter. He lives and works in Bellingham, Washington.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/gbd/ George Dyson's Flickr Photostream]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/gp/tellytomtelly/L4BqBR/ Dyson, Baidarka & Company (Flickr Photostream by Thomas Gotchy)]\n* [http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail454.html A lecture by George Dyson on \"von Neumann's universe\"]\n* [http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysong08/dysong08_index.html ''Engineers' Dreams'']\n*\n** [https://www.ted.com/talks/george_dyson_the_story_of_project_orion George Dyson: The story of Project Orion (TED2002)]\n** [https://www.ted.com/talks/george_dyson_the_birth_of_the_computer George Dyson: The birth of the computer (TED2003)]\n** http://zenbeat.t-galaxy.com/e2703892.html"
