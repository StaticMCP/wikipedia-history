Tujardon noted that the best part of this season is Cristal's character development. \"This season, she inherited her family's company, rebuilt her relationship with her husband, Blake, and gained the confidence she lost after losing her baby in season two, which made her a well beloved character in the series, and gave a nostalgia feel that the legendary Linda Evans did during the run of the original Dynasty.\" However, Tujardon criticized the inclusion of Sam, Michael, and Kirby as \"boring characters that no longer needed to be on the show,\" as well as the acting of Michael Michele as Dominique Deveraux, deemed disgraceful, \"because she portrays the character as cheap, crude, tacky, and a woman who has no class, as opposed to the Carroll's version.\"\nThe series finale received critical acclaim for the return of James Mackay as Steven Carrington.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
