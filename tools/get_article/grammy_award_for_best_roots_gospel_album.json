In the Gospel genre field, it will sit with other categories such as Best Gospel Album and Best Contemporary Christian Music Album.\nThe Grammy is awarded to the performer(s) on the winning recording. If there is no identifiable artist (e.g. in soundtrack or various artist albums), the award is given to the (compilation) producer(s).\nRecipients\nwas the first recipient of the award in 2015.]]\nwon in 2017.
