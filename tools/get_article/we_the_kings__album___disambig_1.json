The band's line-up consisted of vocalist Travis Clark, guitarist Hunter Thomsen, bassist Drew Thomsen, and drummer Danny Duncan. In summer, the group toured with Don't Die Cindy. PureVolume, a place where people could upload their music, helped the band's popularity.\nWe the Kings was produced by S*A*M and Sluggo, and recorded at Mission Sound, and Fresh Kills Music, both in New York City. Sean Gould and Scott Riebling acted as engineers. Lou Giordano mixed almost every track, save for \"Secret Valentine\", \"Check Yes Juliet\", and \"Stay Young\", which were done by Tom Lord-Alge and his assistant Femio Hernandez. Chris Gehringer mastered the album at Sterling Sound, also in New York City. According to Travis Clark, the album was \"really guitar driven, with those poppy catchy choruses\".\nRelease\nIn July 2007, We the Kings supported the White Tie Affair and Fireworks on the Act Like You Know Tour. In September, the group went on the School's for Fools tour across the US, alongside Valencia, Just Surrender and Metro Station. However, partway through the tour Valencia had to drop off the tour due to their vocalist Shane Henderson having strep throat. As a result, Just Surrender headlined the rest of the dates. The group supported Boys Like Girls on their US headlining tour, dubbed Tourzilla, from late September to late October. It was released on October 2, 2007. From mid-January to early March 2008, the band supported Cobra Starship on their North America tour. In April, the band appeared at the Bamboozle Left festival. In June, the band supported Cobra Starship on their US tour, dubbed Really Really Really Ridiculously Good Looking Tour Out to Warped Tour Tour.\nBetween June and August 2008, the band performed on the Warped Tour. In October and November, the band supported the Academy Is... on their headlining tour of the US. In October, a re-recorded version of \"Check Yes Juliet\" was posted online. The re-recording's lyrics were altered to include a reference to Tampa Bay Rays. On December 12, a music video was released for \"Secret Valentine\" through the band's Myspace profile. In February and March 2009, the group went on a headlining US tour, dubbed The Secret Valentine Tour, with support from the Maine, the Cab, There for Tomorrow and VersaEmerge. In April, the band performed on the Bamboozle Roadshow and appeared at The Bamboozle festival in early May. At the end of May, the band performed at the Slam Dunk Festival. In July, the band supported All Time Low on their US east coast tour.\nReception\n|rev2 = MusicOMH\n|rev2score =\n}}\nThe album peaked at No. 3 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, and at No. 151 on the Billboard 200.
