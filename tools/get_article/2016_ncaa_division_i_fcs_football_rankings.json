Unlike the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), college football's governing body, the NCAA, bestows the national championship title through a 24-team tournament. The following weekly polls determine the top 25 teams at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level of college football for the 2016 season. The STATS poll is voted by media members while the Coaches' Poll is determined by coaches at the FCS level.\nThe NCAA Division I FCS Selection Committee released its Top 10 beginning in Week 9, and continues up to the week of the announcement of the full playoff field on November 20.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|+ Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background:#bbffbb; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffbbbb; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| Italics\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n| (#–#)\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n| т\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nSTATS Poll\n|Week2Date =Sep 5\n|Week3Date =Sep 12\n|Week4Date =Sep 19\n|Week5Date =Sep 26\n|Week6Date =Oct 3\n|Week7Date =Oct 10\n|Week8Date =Oct 17\n|Week9Date =Oct 24\n|Week10Date=Oct 31\n|Week11Date=Nov 7\n|Week12Date=Nov 14\n|Week13Date=Nov 20\n|Week14Date=Jan 9\n|Week1-1   = North Dakota State 152\n|Week1-2   = Sam Houston State 2\n|Week1-3   = Jacksonville State 4\n|Week1-4   = Richmond\n|Week1-5   = Northern Iowa\n|Week1-6   = Chattanooga\n|Week1-7   = Charleston Southern\n|Week1-8   = South Dakota State\n|Week1-9   = William & Mary\n|Week1-10  = Illinois State\n|Week1-11  = McNeese State\n|Week1-12  = James Madison\n|Week1-13  = Montana\n|Week1-14  = Eastern Washington\n|Week1-15  = The Citadel\n|Week1-16  = Coastal Carolina\n|Week1-17  = Portland State\n|Week1-18  = Northern Arizona\n|Week1-19  = North Dakota\n|Week1-20  = Western Illinois\n|Week1-21  = Colgate\n|Week1-22  = New Hampshire\n|Week1-23  = Villanova\n|Week1-24  = Towson\n|Week1-25  = North Carolina A&T\n|Week2-1        = North Dakota State 137 (1–0)\n|Week2-1-Color  =\n|Week2-2        = Richmond 21 (1–0)\n|Week2-2-Color  = u\n|Week2-3        = Northern Iowa 5 (1–0)\n|Week2-3-Color  = u\n|Week2-4        = Sam Houston State (1–0)\n|Week2-4-Color  = d\n|Week2-5        = Jacksonville State 1 (1–0)\n|Week2-5-Color  = d\n|Week2-6        = Chattanooga (1–0)\n|Week2-6-Color  =\n|Week2-7        = Charleston Southern (1–1)\n|Week2-7-Color  =\n|Week2-8        = Eastern Washington 1 (1–0)\n|Week2-8-Color  = u\n|Week2-9        = South Dakota State (0–1)\n|Week2-9-Color  = d\n|Week2-10       = Illinois State (1–0)\n|Week2-10-Color =\n|Week2-11       = McNeese State (1–0)\n|Week2-11-Color =\n|Week2-12       = James Madison (1–0)\n|Week2-12-Color =\n|Week2-13       = William & Mary (0–1)\n|Week2-13-Color = d\n|Week2-14       = Montana (1–0)\n|Week2-14-Color = d\n|Week2-15       = The Citadel (1–0)\n|Week2-15-Color =\n|Week2-16       = Portland State (1–0)\n|Week2-16-Color = u\n|Week2-17       = Coastal Carolina (1–0)\n|Week2-17-Color = d\n|Week2-18       = Western Illinois (1–0)\n|Week2-18-Color = u\n|Week2-19       = Northern Arizona (0–1)\n|Week2-19-Color = d\n|Week2-20       = Youngstown State (1–0)\n|Week2-20-Color = npr\n|Week2-21       = Colgate (0–1)\n|Week2-21-Color =\n|Week2-22       = Villanova (0–1)\n|Week2-22-Color = u\n|Week2-23       = North Carolina A&T (1–0)\n|Week2-23-Color = u\n|Week2-24       = New Hampshire (0–1)\n|Week2-24-Color = d\n|Week2-25       = North Dakota (0–1)\n|Week2-25-Color = d\n|Week2Dropped   = 24.
