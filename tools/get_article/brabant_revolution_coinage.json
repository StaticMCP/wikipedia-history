After Austrian forces were defeated by the rebels at the Battle of Turnhout in 1789, Austrian forces withdrew from the country leaving the rebels in power. On 11 January 1790, with the signing of the Treaty of Union, the counties and dukedoms which had made up the Austrian Netherlands became one country: the United Belgian States.\nCoinage\nThe coinage was issued in eight denominations  divided into Liards, Sols, and Florins. It was only produced during the short one-year lifespan of the country meaning that all examples are dated 1790. Legends are rendered in Latin. The ten Sols & Florin coins were given a new legend after it turned out that VNIONE also meant \"onion\" in the locally spoken languages.\nThe types minted were:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the 3 Florin, this was represented by the individual display of all the coats-of-arms of the 11 states which had merged; on the 10 sols, it was represented by 11 arrows behind a two shaking hands.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ibertrand.be/pierre/monnaies/ibrabant/revolutionbrabanconne/index.html Révolution Brabançonne] at iBelgica\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053711/http://www.numismatica-herentals.be/Pdf/DeVerenigdeBelgischeStaten.pdf De Verenigde Belgische Staten] at Numismatica-herentals\n* [http://www.nbbmuseum.be/2008/05/lions-dor.htm The first \"Belgian\" coins: Lions d'or and lions d'argent of the United Belgian States] at the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) Museum\nfr:États belgiques unis#Les pièces de monnaies des États belgiques unis"
