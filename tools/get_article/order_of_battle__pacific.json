The game became free-to-play and was renamed to Order of Battle: World War II on June 14, 2016. The Pacific campaign became downloadable content (DLC) for World War II.\nGameplay\nOrder of Battle: Pacific is turn-based strategic wargame played on a hex grid. It is set in the Pacific War, a theater during World War II. Two campaigns focus on the Allied and the Japanese sides. The multiplayer supports hotseat and play-by-mail methods.\nRelease\nThe development of Order of Battle: Pacific began in early 2012. macOS port was released on July 23, 2015. Xbox One port of World War II was released on June 23, 2021, and PlayStation 4 port on August 19, 2021. Several DLC packs have been released for the game.\nReception\n| 4P = 70/100\n| GStar = 75/100\n| IGN = 9/10 (Italy)8/10 (Spain)\n| PCGN = 9/10\n| rev1 = Multiplayer.it\n| rev1Score = 8.5/10\n| rev2 = PC Invasion\n| rev2Score = 8/10\n}}\nOrder of Battle: Pacific received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to review aggregator Metacritic.\nRob Zacny of PCGamesN summarized: \"Once I start a scenario, I find it almost impossible to quit until I’ve seen it through to the end. Fast, approachable, and challenging, it is everything I want in a wargame.\"\nLuke Plunkett of Kotaku reviewed Pacific and said: \"By drawing on some of the best elements of Panzer General-style games and adding some welcome new additions of its own, OoB:P is a game anyone who likes taking turns to fight the Second World War should look into.\" Plunkett also reviewed World War II and summarized: \"Order of Battle is still a fantastic prospect for anyone down with the idea of turn-based warfare but without the inclination/time for the more serious side of the genre. This is a fast, smart strategy series, and even if some of the campaigns are a bit of a let-down, the beauty of it is that you can just ignore them and focus on the battles you want to fight.\"\nTim Stone of Rock Paper Shotgun wrote about World War II: \"OoB:WW2 encourages pocketing with an easily understood supply mechanic, and is, for my money, a more interesting Panzer General-like than Panzer Corps in consequence. The free base game is poorly provisioned scenario-wise. However, augment it with at least one paid DLC (necessary to unlock modability) and five years' worth of Erik Nygaard's free handcrafted campaigns and you finish up with a high-quality diversion that dwarfs Panzer Corps 2 the way a Jagdtiger dwarfs a Panzer II.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.the-artistocrats.com/order-battle-u-s-pacific/ Order of Battle: Pacific] at The Artistocrats\n*[http://www.the-artistocrats.com/oobp/ Order of Battle: World War II] at The Artistocrats\n*"
