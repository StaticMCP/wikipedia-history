Original members included Patty Wilson (alto), Jim Bluford (tenor), Gene McKinney (lead), Raymond Parker (bass), and a 13-year-old Gary Bilyeu (piano). Gary Arnold was added on bass guitar and 13-year-old drummer Jim Ford came close behind with Tom Bailey on rhythm guitar. The name Kingdom Heirs was chosen by the group from James 2:5.  After they began expanding their singing beyond local churches, Wilson, Parker, and Arnold left the group for various reasons, and Steve Gouge replaced Arnold on bass guitar in July 1971. Mike Shuemaker joined to sing baritone in August of that same year.\nAfter learning of a group from near Sparta, Tennessee who was using the name Kingdom Heirs, rather than checking legal availability for Kingdom Heirs, the group simply added New and became the New Kingdom Heirs.  In 1974 they incorporated as a non-profit under that name. That same year Larry Hutson joined the group on lead guitar, Duane Wyrick became Bass vocal and in 1975 after short stints by Johnny Trott and Mark Nipper, Buddy Mulkey took tenor vocal, while Tommy Rowe assumed baritone vocal. Larry's father, Bill Hutson, began managing the group. From 1972 to 1982 their ministry grew substantially and their booking schedule began to expand. Manager Bill Hutson arranged TV, radio, church and concert appearances from Michigan to Florida. Along the way, well known gospel music promoter and host of the widely syndicated ''Mull's Singing Convention'' television show Rev. J. Bazzell Mull took note and started using the New Kingdom Heirs in concerts and television.\nRev. Mull's recommendation in 1977 opened the door for an audition and their first performance and long association with Silver Dollar City in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, now Dollywood. They first sang at the October Craft Festival, then the spring Young Christians Day and mid-summer Mountain Music Festival, which all became annual appearances. In 1979, at the prompting of promoter Rev. J. Bazzell Mull, they secured a registered trademark for the name Kingdom Heirs, and dropped the word \"new\" from the group name and began recording and appearing as The Kingdom Heirs. The late'70s saw 3 new albums recorded on Trail Records and produced by Jim Hamell, of The Kingsmen, and Bobby All. By 1981, The Kingdom Heirs, with band, had expanded to a total of 12 members (including manager Bill Hutson) and recorded their 10th Anniversary Edition in Nashville, with acclaimed producer and musician Gary Prim.\nIn late 1982, after the departure earlier in the year of the band's bass singer of the previous eight years, Duane Wyrick, six more members of the band retired, including founding members Gene McKinney, Gary Bilyeu, and Jim Ford along with Steve Gouge, Buddy Mulkey and bass Jeff Crisp. With Wayne Mitchell who had replaced Tommy Rowe, Larry Hutson, George Beeler (who had replaced Jim Ford), steel player Ron Ward and manager Bill Hutson remaining, they brought in David McGill (lead), Steve French (baritone), Kreis French (bass guitar), and Randall Hunley (piano).\nMusical career\nThe Kingdom Heirs perform multiple shows daily at Dollywood during the months that the park is open. While the park is closed, they tour just like any other group. The group has been at the park since 1977, when it was known as Silver Dollar City. It is estimated that they sing to over 2 million people each year – more than any other Southern gospel group. Despite a short travel schedule, the guys always take time to join in the Gospel Celebration at the National Quartet Convention.\nThe Kingdom Heirs have also had many top ten songs, and currently have had 31 top 5 songs in a row and 10 number 1 songs including their latest number 1 song, \"I'll Know I'm Home\" along with \"The Borrowed Tomb\" and \"Just Beyond The Sunset\" which is off of the Redeeming the Time.  Many other number 1s include, \"Just Preach Jesus\", \"Tell Me Why\" and \"He Locked the Gates\". Over the past years they have had 26 songs nominated for Song of the Year, including songs like  - \"Just Beyond the Sunset\" \"Just Preach Jesus\", \"The Joys of Heaven\", \"That's Why I Love to Call His Name\", \"I Know I'm Going There\", \"Forever Changed\", \"What We Needed\". The Kingdom Heirs have been nominated many times for industry awards such as the SGMA Awards and Dove Awards. Winning Newcomer Group of the Year in 1989, the group has been a constant favorite. The latest award is 2016 Band of the Year, which the band also won in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013, and 2014.\nMembers\nThe current group consists of Joshua Horrell (tenor), Chris Bryant (lead), Andy Stringfield (baritone and piano), Brad Smith (bass), John Young (guitar and vocal), Dennis Murphy (drums), and Kreis French (owner and bass guitar).\nAlto\n* Patty Wilson (1971)\nTenor\n* Jim Bluford (1971–1974)\n* Johnny Trot (1974–1975)\n* Mark Nipper (1975)\n* Buddy Mulkey (1975–1982)\n* Wayne Mitchell (1982–87)\n* Rick Strickland (1987–92) (went on to sing for JD Sumner among others)\n* David Walker (1992–1994)\n* David Sutton (1994–2002) (went on to form Triumphant Quartet)\n* Jodi Hosterman (2002–2005)\n* Billy Hodges (2005–2011) (formerly of Florida Boys and Dixie Echoes)\n* Jerry A.
