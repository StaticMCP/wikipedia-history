      "text": "# Our Delaware\n\nOur Delaware is a poem written by George Beswick Hynson, published in 1904.  It comprises three verses, each honoring one of Delaware's three counties, with the fourth verse added by Donn Devine commemorating the American Revolution Bicentennial in 1976. It became the state song in 1925 by an act of the General Assembly.  The musical score was composed by Will M. S. Brown specifically for the poem.\nLyrics\nVerse 1\nOh the hills of dear New Castle,\nAnd the smiling vales between,\nWhen the corn is all in tassel,\nAnd the meadowlands are green;\nWhere the cattle crop the clover,\nAnd its breath is in the air,\nWhile the sun is shining over\nOur beloved Delaware.\nChorus\nOh, our Delaware!\nOur beloved Delaware!\nFor the sun is shining over\nOur beloved Delaware,\nOh! our Delaware!\nOur beloved Delaware!\nHere's the loyal son that pledges,\nFaith to good old Delaware.\nVerse 2\nWhere the wheat fields break and billow,\nIn the peaceful land of Kent,\nWhere the toiler seeks his pillow,\nWith the blessings of content;\nWhere the bloom that tints the peaches,\nCheeks of merry maidens share,\nAnd the woodland chorus preaches\nA rejoicing Delaware.\n(repeat chorus)\nVerse 3\nDear old Sussex visions linger,\nOf the holly and pine,\nOf Henlopen's Jeweled finger,\nFlashing out across the brine;\nOf the gardens and hedges,\nAnd the welcome waiting there,\nFor the loyal son that pledges\nFaith to good old Delaware.\n(repeat chorus)\nVerse 4\nFrom New Castle's rolling meadows,\nThrough the fair rich fields of Kent,\nTo the Sussex shores hear echoes,\nOf the pledge we now present:\n\"Liberty and Independence\",\nWe will guard with loyal care,\nAnd hold fast to freedom's presence,\nIn our home state Delaware.\n(repeat chorus)\nReferences"
