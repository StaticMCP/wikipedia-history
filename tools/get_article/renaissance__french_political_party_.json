The party was originally known as  (EM) In French, exclamation marks are preceded by a space. English-language media typically omit the space.}}  and later  (, LREM, LaREM or REM), before adopting its current name in September 2022. RE is the leading force of the centrist Ensemble coalition, coalesced around Emmanuel Macron's original presidential majority.\nThe party was established on 6 April 2016 by Macron, a former Minister of the Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs, who was later elected president in the 2017 presidential election with 66.1% of the second-round vote. Subsequently, the party ran candidates in the 2017 legislative election, including dissidents from the Socialist Party (PS) and the Republicans (LR), as well as minor parties, winning an absolute majority in the National Assembly. Macron was re-elected in the 2022 presidential election, but the party lost its absolute majority in the 2022 legislative election.\nMacron conceived RE as a progressive movement, uniting both left and right. RE supports pro-Europeanism and globalization and wants to \"modernise and moralise\" French politics. The party has accepted members from other political parties at a higher rate than other parties in France, and does not impose any fees on members who want to join. The party has been a founding member of Renew Europe, the political group of the European Parliament representing liberals and centrists, since June 2019.\nHistory\nFoundation\nLa Gauche Libre, the think tank for the movement, was declared as an organization on 1 March 2015. Afterwards, lesjeunesavecmacron.fr was registered as a domain on 23 June 2015. Eventually, two Facebook pages were created and an extra domain registered. Another organization was eventually created by Macron, declared as L'Association pour le renouvellement de la vie politique and registered as a micro-party in January 2016. This was following en-marche.fr being claimed as a domain. L'Association pour le renouvellement de la vie politique was then registered as EMA EN MARCHE in March 2016.\nEn Marche! was established on 6 April 2016 in Amiens by Emmanuel Macron, then aged 38, with the help of political advisor Ismaël Emelien. The initials of the name of the party are the same as the initials of Macron's name.\nThe announcement of En Marche! was the first indication by Macron that he was planning to run for President, with Macron using En Marche! to fundraise for the potential presidential run. The launch of the party was widely covered throughout the media and media coverage continued to peak as tensions rose among Macron and other government ministers as his loyalty was questioned. In the weeks following the creation of En Marche!, Macron soared in the opinion polls, coming to be seen as the main competitor on the left.\nThe creation of En Marche! was welcomed by several political figures including Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Pierre Gattaz, although it was also criticised by Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Christian Estrosi.\nIn an attempt to create the party's first campaign platform, Macron and head of operations Ludovic Chaker recruited 4,000 volunteers to conduct door-to-door surveys of 100,000 people, using the information gained to create a programme closer to the French electorate.\nLater that year, Chaker structured the movement and became the first general secretary of Emmanuel Macron's party En Marche! and its first official employee. He was then appointed as deputy general secretary and coordinator of Macron's campaign operations for the 2017 French presidential election.\n2017 legislative election\n]]\nLa République En Marche! ran candidates in most constituencies. At least half its candidates came from civil society, the other half having previously held political office and half were women. Candidates could not be selected for more than one constituency. In addition to those parameters, Macron specified in his initial press conference on 19 January that he would require that candidates demonstrate probity (disqualifying any prospective candidates with a criminal record), political plurality (representing the threads of the movement) and efficacy. Those wishing to seek the endorsement of LREM had to sign up online and the movement received nearly 15,000 applications.\nWhen dealing with nominations sought by those in the political world, the party considered the popularity, establishment and media skills of applicants, with the most difficult cases adjudicated by Macron himself. To present themselves under the label of La République En Marche!, outgoing deputies had to leave the Socialist Party (PS) or the Republicans (LR). Macron previously said the legislative candidates would have to leave the PS before they could join LREM, though on 5 May 2017 Macron waived this requirement. However, then-spokesperson of LREM Christophe Castaner later said they could stay in the PS as long as they supported Macron. Moreover, spokesperson Jean-Paul Delevoye said the members of civil society could be mayors or members of regional councils and departmental councils.\nAfter François Bayrou endorsed Macron in February, the Democratic Movement (MoDem), which he leads, reserved 90 constituencies for MoDem candidates (running under the label of La République En Marche!), of which 50 were reported by Le Figaro to be winnable.\nOn 15 May 2017, the secretary general of the presidency announced the appointment of Édouard Philippe, a member of LR, as Prime Minister.\nOn 18 June 2017, La République En Marche! won an absolute majority in the National Assembly, securing 308 seats (or 53% of the seats) while collecting only 28.21% of the vote on the first round, and 43.06% on the second round. Additionally, MoDem secured 42 seats. LREM became France's party of power, in support of the President.\n2017 Senate election and first party congress\nIn the 2017 Senate election, La République En Marche! lost seats, ending up with 21, seven fewer than before. While hoping to double its representatives in the Senate, party officials noted that due to the electoral system of indirect universal suffrage, where deputies, senators and regional councilors elect senators, the party had a disadvantage due to being new.\nIn the same month, it was announced that the first party congress was to be held in Lyon. The first gathering of party members and representatives, party spokesman, Christophe Castaner announced his candidacy on 25 October 2017 with the endorsement of President Macron, allowing him to run unopposed. The congress took place on the 19 November 2017 and Castaner was elected the Executive Officer and leader of the party by a council of 800 people, with a quarter being members of the party. Castaner was elected for a term of three years. The congress generated media attention for criticism surrounding it, including a walk-out by attendees of the congress where a hundred attendees resigned from the party citing a lack of internal democracy and corruption.\nThe first by-election of the 15th National Assembly of France in Val-d'Oise's 1st constituency, which was a La République En Marche! seat, was called after it was ruled that deputy Isabelle Muller-Quoy's replacement Michel Alexeef was ineligible under the electoral code. Muller-Quoy, who had won the first round by 18 percentage points in 2017, won the first round of the by-election by only 5 percentage points, and went on to lose the seat to the LR candidate Antoine Savignat. The race was the first loss the party had endured in the National Assembly. Several subsequent by-elections showed a 10% overall swing against La République En Marche! since the June 2017 legislative elections.\n2019 European Parliament election\nAhead of the 2019 European Parliament election, La République En Marche! was widely expected to formalise a cooperation agreement with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the main liberal-centrist group in the European Parliament. However, amid the domestic upheaval caused by the Gilets Jaunes protests and the broader rise of nationalist and populist forces across Europe, President Emmanuel Macron recalibrated his strategy. Rather than aligning LREM directly with the existing ALDE brand, Macron chose to lead a more autonomous, pro-European campaign under the banner of Renaissance, framing it as a call for continental political renewal.\nFollowing the election—during which the Renaissance list secured a strong second-place finish in France—LREM and its allies played a central role in the reorganisation of the ALDE parliamentary group. This process culminated in the launch of a new centrist and liberal alliance: Renew Europe, officially formed in June 2019. The group brought together Macron's Renaissance list, ALDE-affiliated parties, and other like-minded liberal and pro-European movements from across the European Union, making Renew Europe the third-largest political group in the European Parliament.\n2020 municipal elections\nFor the 2020 French municipal elections, La République En Marche! (LREM) set itself the ambitious objective of electing around 10,000 municipal councillors nationwide. Following the first round, party officials reported having already secured approximately 6,000 seats, mainly in small towns and rural communes. The party invested 592 lead candidates (têtes de liste) in municipalities with more than 9,000 inhabitants, of whom 289 were official LREM members.\nBetween the two rounds, LREM pursued a strategy of forging local alliances—76 with right-leaning lists and 33 with left-leaning ones—in towns over 9,000 residents. In several large cities, such as Bordeaux, Strasbourg, and Tours, the party aligned with centre-right incumbents to counter rising ecological or left-wing lists. According to party leadership, this skew toward the right was largely due to the political landscape inherited from the 2014 municipal elections, where the right had made significant gains. Marie Guévenoux, co-president of LREM's national investiture commission, justified the imbalance by saying that the party would have \"preferred to forge alliances with the left,\" but left-wing groups generally declined to cooperate.\nDespite the party's confident outlook following previous successes in the 2017 legislative and 2019 European elections, LREM ultimately failed to win any major city. It claimed 146 mayors invested or supported in municipalities with more than 9,000 inhabitants, and only three municipalities over 30,000 residents—all of which were victories by right-wing incumbents supported (but not officially labeled) by LREM.\nIn key symbolic cities such as Paris and Lyon, where the party had invested heavily, its candidates suffered heavy defeats, often finishing in third or fourth place. In Bordeaux, an alliance with the outgoing right-wing mayor failed to block a surge by the ecologists. Across the country, a “green wave” led by EELV swept through major urban centres, including Lyon, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux, dashing LREM's hopes of a metropolitan breakthrough.\nThe campaign also reflected deeper political tensions facing LREM. In many constituencies, candidates avoided displaying the party's logo due to widespread public dissatisfaction stemming from the Yellow vests movement, ongoing pension reform protests, youth-led climate strikes, and criticism over the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2022 legislative election\nIn May 2022, following Emmanuel Macron's re-election as President of France, La République En Marche! announced a major rebranding effort as part of preparations for the legislative elections. The party declared that its parliamentary group would adopt the name Renaissance, a term intended to symbolise political renewal and the continuation of Macron's reformist agenda. This move coincided with the creation of a broader electoral confederation uniting Macron-aligned forces, including François Bayrou's MoDem and Édouard Philippe's Horizons.\nIn September 2022, LREM formally changed its name to Renaissance, establishing it as the new identity of the party itself and not just the parliamentary group. The name change was part of an effort to consolidate the presidential majority into a single political force, in line with Macron's long-standing goal of transcending the traditional left-right divide (\"dépassement\"). However, this ambition met with limited success. While two smaller Macron-aligned parties—Agir and Territories of Progress—formally merged into Renaissance, key allies such as MoDem and Horizons opted to retain their independence within the wider Ensemble coalition.\n2024 legislative election\nFollowing a poor result in the European Parliament elections, Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly on 9 June 2024, triggering snap elections scheduled for 30 June and 7 July 2024. Renaissance led the centrist coalition known as Ensemble pour la République, which included MoDem, Horizons, UDI, and the Radical Party. However, internal tensions quickly arose, particularly with Édouard Philippe's Horizons party, which refused to fully campaign under the Renaissance banner and demanded more autonomy, leading to separate candidate declarations in several constituencies.\nRenaissance invested more than 200 candidates, including several ministers (such as Gabriel Attal, Gérald Darmanin), former ministers (Élisabeth Borne, Olivier Véran), and new faces like Stéphane Séjourné and Loïc Signor. In the first round on 30 June, the Ensemble coalition obtained only around 21% of the vote, trailing both the Rassemblement National (33.1%) and the left-wing Nouveau Front Populaire (28%). Only four Ensemble candidates were elected outright, and Renaissance was leading in just 70 constituencies before the run-off.\nIn the second round, held on 7 July 2024, no single bloc obtained a majority. The left-wing Nouveau Front Populaire became the largest force with approximately 182 seats, followed by Ensemble with around 163 seats, and the Rassemblement National with about 143. Renaissance alone dropped from 245 seats in 2022 to about 160–162, according to projections. The outcome prompted a political crisis within the centrist bloc. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal convened an emergency meeting to coordinate second-round endorsements and later was elected president of the Renaissance group in the National Assembly on 13 July.\nFollowing the election, discussions intensified over a possible alliance between Renaissance and the centre-right Republicans (LR) to form a working majority, though such a coalition would still fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority.\nIdeology\nAlthough Macron was a member of the PS from 2006 to 2009 and an independent politician from 2009 to 2016, La République En Marche! seeks to transcend traditional political boundaries to be a transpartisan organisation.\nVarious sources have described the party as being centrist, centre-right, or big tent. Historically, back in 2019, the party was also labelled by some sources as centre-left.}} Macron described the party in 2016 as being a progressive party of both the left and the right. In 2017, observers and political commentators have described the party as being culturally liberal, as well as socially liberal and economically liberal in ideology. The party has also been described as using anti-establishment, populist strategies and rhetoric, with discourse comparable to the Third Way as adopted by the Labour Party in the UK during its New Labour phase. The party has been described as supporting some policies close to centre-right classical liberalism.\nAccording to an Ipsos survey conducted in March 2018, some public perception of the party has moved to the right since March 2017, with 45% of respondents classifying the party as being centre-right (25%) to right-wing (20%). 21% of respondents place it in the centre, compared to 33% in March 2017.\nAssociate parties\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2| Name\n!

Unlike other political parties, it does not require members to make a monetary donation. Macron has indicated that it is possible to join  while remaining a member of another republican party.\nOn 10 April 2016, a few days after the movement's launch, Macron claimed 13,000 members.  accused him of inflating the figure and claimed that 13,000 was in reality the number of clicks that Macron had received on his website. , Macron's advisor, clarified that \"each member signs a charter of values and has a voice in the movement's general assembly\" and \"that has nothing to do with those who sign up for the newsletter, who are much greater in number\". , another of Macron's advisors, affirmed that the movement verifies the email addresses of members but conceded that \"the system relies on the honesty of each member\".\nIn October 2016, Macron affirmed that  was \"neck and neck with the Socialist Party\" in terms of membership after only seven months of existence. According to , this included many independents and executives, but few functionaries, farmers and unemployed people. Many of its members had never been engaged in politics. However, the majority had only shown interest by leaving their information on the party website.\ntakes inspiration from the participatory model of , 's movement and intends to rely on its member files, according to deputy  and former leader of .

Each of these committees is led by one or more adherents who organize the committee by planning local events, meetings and debates centered around the ideas and values promoted by the movement.  counted more than 2,600 of these committees in December 2016.\nFinance\nChristian Dargnat, former general director of BNP Paribas Asset Management, leads the La République En Marche! financial association. Since its creation, the association has raised funds for the party. In 2016, Georges Fenech, a deputy of the Republicans, alerted the National Assembly that the association had continued fund raising even during Macron's trip to London. This led Prime Minister Manuel Valls to issue an official denial even though En Marche! had already done so. Macron declared in May 2016 that 2,000 donors had already contributed financially to the party. In December 2016, he spoke of more than 10,000 donors from 1 euro to 7,500 euros. By the end of December 2016, he had collected between 4 and 5 million euros in donations. At the end of March, this figure exceeded 9 million euros from 35,000 donations, averaging 257 euros per donation. 600 donors made up half of the total amount donated, with donations upwards of 5,000 euros.\nIn the book ''Dans l'enfer de Bercy: Enquête sur les secrets du ministère des Finances'' (JC Lattès, 2017) by journalists Frédéric Says and Marion L'Hour, Macron was accused of using 120,000 euros from the state budget from 1 January to 30 August 2016 in order to fund his presidential campaign.\nEuropean representation\nIn the European Parliament, La République En Marche sits in the Renew Europe group with five MEPs.\nIn the European Committee of the Regions, La République En Marche sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with three full members and one alternate member for the 2025–2030 mandate. Anne Rudisuhli is Coordinator in the SEDEC Commission and Magali Altounian is the Chair of the CIVEX Commission and member of the Bureau of the Renew Europe CoR Group.\nElection results\nPresidential elections\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ |Presidency of the French Republic\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Election year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Candidate\n!colspan=\"3\"|First round\n!colspan=\"3\"|Second round\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Result\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Rank\n!Votes\n!%\n!Rank\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Emmanuel Macron\n|8,656,346\n|24.01\n| 1st\n|20,743,128\n|66.10\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n!2022\n|9,783,058\n|27.85\n| 1st\n|18,768,639\n|58.55\n| 1st\n|\n|}\nLegislative elections\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ National Assembly\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Election year\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n!colspan=\"2\"|First round\n!colspan=\"2\"|Second round\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Seats\n!rowspan=\"2\"|+/−\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Rank(seats)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Government\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n!rowspan=3 |2017\n|rowspan=3 |Richard Ferrand\n|rowspan=3 |6,391,269\n|rowspan=3 |28.21\n|rowspan=3 |7,826,245\n|rowspan=3 |43.06\n|rowspan=3 |}}\n|rowspan=3 | 308\n|rowspan=3 |1st\n| (2017−2020)\n|-\n| (2020−2022)\n|-\n| (2022)\n|-\n!2022\n|Élisabeth Borne\n|5,857,364\n|25.71\n|8,003,240\n|38.57\n|}}\n|175\n|1st\n| (2022−2024)\n|-\n!rowspan=5 |2024\n|rowspan=5 |Gabriel Attal\n|rowspan=5 |6,820,446\n|rowspan=5 |21.28\n|rowspan=5 |6,691,619\n|rowspan=5 |24.53\n|rowspan=5 |}}\n|rowspan=5 | 35\n|rowspan=5 |2nd\n|-\n|  (2024)\n|-\n|  (2024−2025)\n|-\n|  (2025)\n|-\n| (2025−present)\n|}\nEuropean Parliament\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ European Parliament\n!
