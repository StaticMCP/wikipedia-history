The United States of America was involved in the war in a number of ways, albeit they did not participate in the war itself. Diplomatic relations between Britain and the United States were influenced by the Boer War, and public opinion of the Boer War in the United States significantly affected American politics. American volunteers were present on both sides, albeit with more fighting for the British rather than for the Boers. Coverage of the war tended to vary, with some publications siding with the Boers, such as the Omaha World-Herald. Others, such as the New York Times, sided with the British cause. Some 300 Irish-Americans joined the Irish Transvaal Legion upon the outbreak of the war, with John Blake leading them. The American Scouts, a regiment of 80 strong, joined the Afrikaner side as well. Among many of the Americans who joined the British side was Frederick Russel Burnham, who aided the British during the campaign in the Orange Free State and Transvaal.\nReferences"
