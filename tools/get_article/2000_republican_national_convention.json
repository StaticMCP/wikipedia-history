The 2,066 delegates assembled at the convention nominated Texas Governor George W. Bush for president and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Richard B. \"Dick\" Cheney for vice president.\nBackground\n, was the site of the 2000 Republican National Convention]]\nBush, eldest son of the 41st president, was identified early as the party establishment's frontrunner and turned back a strong primary challenge from John McCain, a Vietnam War veteran and U.S. Senator from Arizona. At the convention, the party and campaign sought to showcase Bush's slogan of compassionate conservatism to persuade undecided voters.\nRoll call vote\nInstead of holding the roll call of states on one night, the Bush campaign arranged for the voting to take place over four nights, so that Bush would eventually build up support throughout the week, culminating with Cheney's home state of Wyoming finally putting him over the top on the final night. There were few defections, despite a large contingent of delegates having been elected to support McCain, who formally released them to Bush.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Republican National Convention presidential vote, 2000\n|-\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n|-\n| George W.

Cheney's nomination as vice president had also been approved by acclamation on Wednesday night, so Cheney could address the convention later that night as the official nominee.\nCheney's acceptance speech\nCheney's convention address was the first to include sustained attacks on Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee—whereas most of the speakers who came before him criticized the vice president only briefly, or without mentioning his name. (This was part of the Bush campaign's strategy to \"change the tone\" in national politics by moving beyond the division and bitterness of recent partisan discourse.) Cheney, however, was given latitude to lob various direct attacks on Clinton and Gore, and even reprised a line that Gore had used in his 1992 convention address attacking the first President Bush: \"It is time for them to go.\"\nThis was the first vice-presidential acceptance speech in recent memory to be held the night before the presidential nominee's address. The standard practice at the time was for both nominees to give their speeches the same night. Cheney's speech began a tradition of vice-presidential nominees headlining their own night at the convention; two weeks later, at the Democratic convention, that party's vice-presidential nominee, Joe Lieberman, also spoke on the third night as opposed to the final night.\nBush's acceptance speech\nIn his speech, Bush attacked the Clinton administration on defense and military topics, high taxes, underfunded schools, high pollution, and a lack of dignity and respect for the presidency. He attacked Clinton's military policies, claiming that American troops were \"not ready for duty, sir.\" He also claimed the Clinton administration had failed to provide leadership, saying, \"They've had their chance. They have not led. We will.\"\nSpeakers\nDay one: Monday, July 31\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Speaker\n!Position/Notability\n|-\n|\n|Colin Powell\n|Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989-1993)\n|-\n|\n|Elaine Chao\n|Former president of the United Way of America (1993-1996)\n4th U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation (1989-1991)\nWife of U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell from Kentucky\n|}\nDay two: Tuesday, August 1\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Speaker\n!Position/Notability\n|-\n|\n|John McCain\n|U.S. Senator of Arizona (1987-2018)\n2000 Republican presidential candidate\n|-\n|\n|Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.\n|Retired general\nAllied Commander during the Persian Gulf War\n|-\n|\n|Bob Dole\n|Former U.S. Senator from Kansas (1969-1996)\n1976 Vice presidential nominee\n1996 Presidential Nominee\n|-\n|\n|George Pataki\n|53rd Governor of New York (1995-2006)\n|-\n|\n|Condoleezza Rice\n|Professor of political science and former provost of Stanford University\n|-\n|\n|Laura Bush\n|40th First Lady of Texas (1995-2000)\nWife of George W.

They did this in objection to Philadelphia hosting the Republican National Convention. The protests resulted in the arrest of over 300 people.\nThe initial protest was not target to the Republican Party specifically, rather, it was a call to change from both Republican and Democratic parties. The protesters felt that both political parties for the most part, ignored the needs and issues surrounding the LGBT community.\nSee also\n*2000 Republican Party presidential primaries\n*History of the Republican Party (United States)\n*List of Republican National Conventions\n*United States presidential nominating convention\n*2000 Democratic National Convention\n*2000 United States presidential election\n*George W.
