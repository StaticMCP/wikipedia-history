Three were delivered to the Southern & Western Railway and one each to the Central (Rockhampton) and Great Northern (Townsville) Railways. The latter was transferred to the Central Railway without use. Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the 8D15 class, the 8 representing the number of driving wheels, the D that it was a tank locomotive, and the 15 the cylinder diameter in inches.\nTwo were converted to tender engines in 1890/91. All were later reboilered. The tank engines were written off in October 1922, while the tender locomotives, having spent their final years hauling limestone and water trains to Mount Morgan gold mine, followed in 1938.\nClass list\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Worksnumber\n!Southern & WesternRailway number\n!Central Railwaynumber\n!Queensland Railwaysnumber\n!In service\n!Notes\n|-\n|align=center|2010\n|align=center|75\n|align=center|\n|align=center|75\n|February 1885\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2011\n|align=center|76\n|align=center|\n|align=center|76\n|January 1885\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2012\n|align=center|77\n|align=center|\n|align=center|77\n|January 1885\n|\n|-\n|align=center|2013\n|align=center|\n|align=center|23 & 2\n|align=center|134\n|December 1884\n|entered service as no. 23, withdrawn for modifications, re-entered service as no. 2, converted to tender engine 1891\n|-\n|align=center|2014\n|align=center|\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|135\n|November 1884\n|delivered to Great Northern Railway as no. 13, transferred without use to Central Railway, converted to tender engine 1890\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
