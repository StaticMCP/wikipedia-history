It is located in what is now Gyeongju, South Korea. It is also known by the name Kwaerŭng (). On January 21, 1963, it was made Historic Site of South Korea No. 26.\nDescription\nThe tomb is among the finest extant Silla-era tombs. It is a tumulus tomb that is  in diameter and  in height. It is surrounded by twelve stones with animals of the zodiac carved in them. The carvings are considered to be among the best of its kind. It has a stone fence with 25 pillars surrounding it. The pillars are all original, but the railing between the pillars are recent restorations. Near the tomb are various original statues.\nIt is not known with certainty if the tomb belongs to Wonseong or not. It is widely believed to be his tomb because the Samguk sagi has it that his tomb was near the former temple Sungboksa, and this temple's site is indeed nearby.\nReferences"
