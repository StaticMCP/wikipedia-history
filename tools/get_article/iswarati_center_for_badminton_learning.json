The training center has been set up specially to train the youths of Assam and North-Eastern India. ICBL is a private non-profit association created by Bhattacharjee in 2004.\nIt started as an association in 2004 at Guwahati with the support of a few interested people morally backing Bhattacharjee in his efforts.\nBhattacharjee has unsuccessfully approached many sponsors, such as the prominent businesses in the region. However, he is continuously pursuing support from sponsors to make this effort successful.\nBhattacharjee coaches the students on a regular basis. The players are promised with bright future in the national and international badminton arena.\nBhattacharjee feels that this Academy for Badminton Learning is a very important step for the future of badminton in Assam, North-East India, and India as a whole. There are ongoing efforts by authorities of badminton like the International Badminton Federation (IBF) to popularize badminton and draw more sponsors and fans into it. Bhattacharjee also believes in these efforts and is working to contribute to the future success of badminton and making it a more entertaining and popular sport. He is constantly approaching potential sponsors in Assam and N.E. India as well as from other neighbouring states. He is optimistic that there will be growing attention towards Badminton and more interest from large companies who already advertise their brand through other sports like cricket and tennis in India.\nBhattacharjee was one of the first members at BPL Prakash Padukone Academy in Bangalore trained with Prakash Padukone. His association with Padukone gave him the hope to venture out to popularise badminton and train talented youths of the oft-neglected region of Assam and North-East India.\nOrganizational structure\nPresident:\n*Shri, P.
