In the , Gordonbrook had a population of 184 people.\nGeography\nGordonbrook mainly consists of grazing land, with irrigated crops growing close to the banks of the Stuart River. The Stuart River dissects the locality, with the large artificial lake, the Lake Gordonbrook damming the river in the northern part of the district.  Very little of the area is developed with most of the land covered by bush and grazing land.  Reedy Creek, a tributary of Stuart River downstream of Gordonbrook Dam, is another major waterway in the locality.\nHistory\nGordonbrook was one of the districts used for soldier settlements after World War I. In February 1920, an initial total of  were divided in 25 land parcels offered up for selection by returned soldiers and the general public. Although it was recommended that the settlers grow cotton, most took up dairying. By June 1923 there were 29 settlers in the scheme but by 1929 only 13 remained.\nGordon Brook Provisional School opened in 1924.  On 11 September 1928 Gordon Brook South Provisional School opened and both schools operated \"half time\" (the full-time teacher being split between them). In 1929, Gordon Brook Provisional School closed and Gordon Brook South Provisional School continued on a full-time basis.  On 1 October 1938 it became Gordon Brook South State School and then closed in 1945.\nIn 1941 Gordonbrook Dam was constructed to provide the town of Kingaroy and its former WWII airforce base, R.A.A.F Kingaroy with a reliable water supply. In 1986, the dam was extensively upgraded, including the raising of the dam wall and spillway by two metres.\nFormerly in the Shire of Kingaroy, Gordonbrook was included in the newly formed South Burnett Region following the local government amalgamations in March 2008.\nDemographics\nIn the , Gordonbrook had a population of 322 people.\nIn the , Gordonbrook had a population of 175 people.\nIn the , Gordonbrook had a population of 184 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Gordonbrook.
