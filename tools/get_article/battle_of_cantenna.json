The slave army was annihilated by Marcus Licinius Crassus' legions.\nDescription\nCrassus had built a -long ditch and a wall along the isthmus or Rhegium to trap Spartacus and his army. One night, a big storm happened, and Spartacus used this opportunity to escape north with most of his army. However, a force of about 20,000 slaves remained behind under Gannicus and Castus. So, Crassus decided to finish them first. He sent 2 legates to flank the rebels and distract them. When the force of a few thousand arrived, they were surrounded by the rebels. The Romans fought bravely, desperately trying to buy time for Crassus's main force to arrive. Soon after the main army arrived and surrounded the rebels, what followed was a slaughter in which most of the rebel army was killed or imprisoned.\nAfter the battle Crassus moved north to confront the main rebel force under Spartacus.\nReferences"
