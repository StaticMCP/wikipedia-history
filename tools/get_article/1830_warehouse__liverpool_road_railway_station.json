It was built in five months between April and September 1830, \"almost certainly [to the designs of] the Liverpool architect Thomas Haigh\". The heritage listing report attributes the work to George Stephenson and his son, Robert. It has been listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England since May 1973.\nThe warehouse is of \"red brick in Flemish bond, with sandstone dressings and slate roofs\". It is three storeys high, though only two storeys present to the level of the railway to allow for direct loading and unloading. At the ground floor at street level, carts could also gain direct access. \"The internal structure is of timber, but with cast-iron columns in the basement.\"\nThe processing of goods within the warehouse was originally a manual operation but \"steam-powered hoists [were] installed within a year as the manual system could not cope with the volume of goods\".  The steam system of 1831 was replaced with a hydraulic system between 1866 and 1880 to increase efficiency.\nRestoration of the warehouse was undertaken in 1992–96 by the Building Design Partnership.\nIn 2012, the Science and Industry Museum became custodians of the warehouse. , the museum is embarking on a phased programme of conservation work to the 1830 warehouse, having undertaken repairs to improve the structural integrity of the building and roof repairs.\nGallery\nFile:Almost 1830 - geograph.org.uk - 1445189.jpg|A view from the original 1830 platform of the Liverpool Road terminus, with the replica locomotive 'Planet' and carriages, and original 1830 warehouse behind, 2009\nFile:View of the Manchester Liverpool Road railway station, Manchester from a building under renovation to south of track 04.jpg|View of the western end of the warehouse, with a corner of Factory International in the background, 2023\nFile:View of the Manchester Liverpool Road railway station, Manchester from a building under renovation to south of track 05.jpg|The warehouse fronting the railway, 2023\nSee also\n*Grade I listed buildings in Greater Manchester\n*Listed buildings in Manchester-M60\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
