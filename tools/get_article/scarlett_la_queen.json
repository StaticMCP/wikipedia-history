She was born in a military family in Nalchik (Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria).\nCareer\nAt the festival in Nalchik, she met Artur Atsalamov, the founder of the music band «Мёртвые Дельфины» (Dead Dolphins), who later wrote several songs for her, including her hits «Бег по острию ножа» (The Run on the Edge of a Knife), «Паноптикум» (Panopticon) and «Мажь вазелином» (Use Vaseline).\nFor more than seven weeks her music video for the song «Между мной и тобой» (Between You and Me) was on the first place in MTV's chart \"TOP 20\".

Where then she met producer Sergey Izotov, in cooperation with whom she began her career as a singer. The peak of her popularity feld on 2000–2003 years. The producer created a legend for Oscar, according to which Oscar used to be trapped under the rubble, and as a result spent several years in a coma and then began singing.\nIn 2003, she had a conflict with Izotov and lost the rights for the stage name Oscar and for some of the songs. According to some reports, the reason for this was the song ″Не надо (Джихад)″ (Don't (Jihad)) in which Oscar spoke out against the Second Chechen War. Her music video for this song was composed of the military chronicle of the times of the Second Chechen War and Moscow theater hostage crisis.\nUnited States\nIn 2003 she moved to New York, where she was a film student.

Following the release of album a music-video for the song \"Lucky Number\" was filmed and broadcast via US music channels.\nReturn to Russia\nAt the end of 2008 she returned to Russia. In 2010, while performing for Russian music-award 'Night Life Awards 2010', she presented the new Russian-language single \"Gagarin\", created in-collaboration with Andrey Ivanov (member of the Triplex music project).\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"35\" |Year\n!Original title\n!Title in English\n!Stage name\n|-\n|2000\n|Бег по острию ножа|Бег по острию ножа\n|The run on the edge of a knife\n|Oscar\n|-\n|2001\n|Оскар II|Оскар II\n|Oscar II\n|Oscar\n|-\n|2001\n|Последний.
