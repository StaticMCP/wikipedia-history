The museum was established in 1986 by Chan Kim Lay, the fourth generation of his family to reside in the large house built by his great-grandfather in 1896 in Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, a street also known as \"Millionaire's Row\" for its luxurious houses. The museum is known for its elaborate woodwork, furniture, and porcelain.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Malacca\n* List of museums in Malaysia\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
