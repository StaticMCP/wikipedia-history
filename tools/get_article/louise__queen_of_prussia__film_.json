The film's art director was Franz Schroedter.\nIt depicts the life of Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1776–1810), the wife of Frederick William III of Prussia. It forms part of the Prussian film genre.\nThe film was produced by Porten's own production company, founded during the silent era when she was a dominant German star. The failure of the film led to the financial ruin of Porten's production company, and she appeared in far fewer films after this point.\nCast\nas Gräfin Voss\n* Paul Gunther as Napoleon\n*  as Knabe\n* Inge Landgut as Mädchen\n* Friedrich Ettel\n* Friedrich Gnaß\n* Bernhard Goetzke\n* Ferdinand Hart\n*\n* Aribert Mog\n* John Mylong\n* Veronika Nargo\n* Walter Steinbeck\n* Hugo Werner-Kahle\n* Paul Westermeier\n}}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*  | editor-last1 = Killy | editor-first1 = Walther | editor-last2 = Vierhaus | editor-first2 = Rudolf | title = Dictionary of German Biography | title-link = Deutsche Biographische Enzyklopädie | volume =8 | publisher = K.
