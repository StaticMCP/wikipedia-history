A total of 137 Palestinians were killed, 135 by Israeli forces and two by Israeli settlers. 28 children were killed, 26 boys and two girls. 33 civilians were killed as part of the Great March of Return demonstrations. Ten Israelis were killed by Palestinians and at least 120 were injured.\n341 attacks were carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians, in which two Palestinians were killed and 115 injured. Palestinian land and property were vandalized, including almost 8,000 trees. The Nablus Governorate was most affected by settler violence, followed by Hebron Governorate and Ramallah Governorate. In the West Bank, Israeli forces demolished 623 structures, of which 98 were EU funded humanitarian aid structures (valued at EUR 480,625), a doubling in the demolition of EU funded structures compared to 2018. Overall, 2019 saw a 35% increase in demolitions and a 95% increase in displacements, compared to 2018.\nFebruary\n7 February\n19-year-old Israeli teen Ori Ansbacher from Tekoa was raped and murdered by a Palestinian man, Arafat Irfaiya, while walking in the Ein Yael forest southwest of Jerusalem.\nMarch\n6 March\nA group of settlers escorted by Israeli soldiers stormed the Nabi Yunis Mosque in Halhul north of Hebron. Soldiers fired rubber bullets at unarmed Palestinian protestors, injuring two.\n17 March\n19-year-old Sgt. Gal Kaiden from Beersheba was stabbed and killed in an attack at the Ariel Junction. After stabbing him, the Palestinian assailant stole his weapon and shot him and two other people in separate locations.\nRabbi Achiad Ettinger, 47, a father of 12 from Eli, was critically wounded while driving past the scene of the attack. He succumbed to his wounds the following day.\n20 March\nAhmad Jamal Manasra, 23 or 26, from Wadi Fukin was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier at the al-Nashash checkpoint at the southern entrance to the al-Khader village near Bethlehem while trying to provide aid to a Palestinian family.\nAt around 9:00 pm the Ghayatha family were making their way home to Nahhalin after having visited relatives in Artas. Traveling in the car were 'Alaa, 38, his wife, Maysaa, 34, and their two daughters aged 5 and 8. A dispute developed between 'Alaa and another driver on the road. About 50 meters from the al-Nashash checkpoint he got out of his car to confront the driver. The driver, however, did not stop and kept going but 'Alaa was shot in the stomach by a soldier stationed at a nearby watchtower.\nAnother car driven by Ahmad Manasra, carrying three other young men, approached the checkpoint at about the same time. They saw Maysaa calling for help and got out of the car to help her. Three of them helped 'Alaa into their own car and took him to a hospital but Manasra stayed behind to comfort Maysaa and her daughters. As he went out of Maysaa's car, he was shot in both hands and in the chest by the same soldier that had shot 'Alaa. He later died of his wounds.\nThe Israeli military issued a statement saying that stones had been thrown at Israeli cars and the soldier in response shot Ghayatha and Manasra.
