He was Cabinet Secretary for Sports, Culture, and the Arts of Kenya from 2013 to 2018.\nArero hails from the Borana community.

He completed his PhD in anthropology at the University of East Anglia in 2013.\nAbuse of office charges\nWario was charged with corruption and theft during his tenure as a Minister of Sports. The offenses occurred during the 2016 Olympics. He was found guilty of misappropriation of $490,000 in taxpayer funds, by Milimani Anti-Corruption Courts in Nairobi on September 15, 2021. In what is described as a miscarriage of justice by the judiciary, he was surprisingly only fined $33,000; by paying the fine, he avoided a six-year prison term.\nReferences"
