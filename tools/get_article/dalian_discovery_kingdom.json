Opened in 2006, it is currently the largest amusement park in Liaoning.\nAttractions\nThe Discoveryland is divided into six themed areas: Crazy Town, Mysterious Desert, Metal Factory, Magic Forest, Legend Castle and Wedding Palace. As of 2014, the theme park features three sets of roller coasters, two water rides, a vertical drop tower and other attractions which make up approximately twenty rides in total. The most notable feature of the park is a giant stony-looking fortress built within a small lake in the centre. During the theme parks' opening season a parade roams through the internal paths at noon everyday, entertaining the visitors. At night fireworks are set off for the leaving visitors seeing their final exhibition. The theme park is closed during winter season.\nGallery\nFile:发现王国海盗船.JPG|Pirate Ship\nFile:发现王国疯狂剧场.JPG|Crazy Town\nFile:疯狂眼镜蛇过山车.JPG|Crazy Cobra Roller Coaster\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.discoveryland.cn/  Official Website]\n* [http://rcdb.com/5946.htm Roller Coaster Database on park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090614100550/http://www.dl766.com/LvyouJingdian/JingdianBH000180.html Additional Information on schedules, ticket prices, address, contact information and gallery.]"
