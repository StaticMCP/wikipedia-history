Swarm launched for iOS and Android devices on May 15, 2014. A spin-off from and former companion app to Foursquare City Guide, Swarm allows users to check-in to a given location, and see who is nearby. These check-ins are chronologically listed to create a personal lifelog for each user, which serves as a digital library for all the places they have been, in a searchable database that can be revisited and shared.\nLocation and check-in data collected in Swarm are used to improve a user's recommendations in Foursquare City Guide. Splitting check-ins and general location sharing into the separate Swarm app was designed to let the main Foursquare app focus on exploring and discovering information on locations in a Yelp-like fashion. Swarm supports checking in with photos or stickers attached and allows broadcasting of check-ins to other social networks including Facebook and Twitter. Swarm features include a shareable personalized map, unique stats like total lifetime check-ins, number of unique categories visited, and data on streaks and 'mayorships' (a feature of the platform's gamification elements).\nIn 2024, the Foursquare Labs company announced that the Foursquare City Guide app would be sunsetted, with remaining features being merged into the Swarm app.\nFeatures\nSwarm 5.0, released on iOS August 8, 2017, and on Android August 16, 2017, was the most significant update to the app’s core functionality since launching in 2014, focusing more on lifelogging.\nMajor features include check-ins, messaging, stickers, challenges, 'mayorships', history search, and merchandise.\nReception\nCNET described the app as a \"bold move\", and praised it for removing some of the \"clutter\" of Foursquare and focusing on letting the user \"quickly see where [their] friends are and make plans\". The redesign was unpopular with some existing Foursquare users, who complained about its lack of gamification elements, and the need to download two apps for what used to be contained in a single Foursquare app.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://support.foursquare.com/hc/en-us/articles/201908440-Swarm-by-Foursquare What is Swarm?], Foursquare Help Center"
