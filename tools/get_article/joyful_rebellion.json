It was released 13 August 2004 in Canada by EMI and 21 September 2004 in the United States by Virgin Records. It debuted at number 7 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and went platinum in Canada, selling over 100,000 units.\nAwards\n*The MuchMusic Video Awards (MMVA's)\n**2005 Best Pop Video (\"Crabbuckit\")\n**2005 MuchVibe Best Rap Video (\"Man I Used To Be\")\n*Juno Awards\n**2005 Single of the Year (\"Crabbuckit\")\n**2005 Rap Recording of the Year (\"Joyful Rebellion\")\n**2005 Video of the Year (\"B-Boy Stance\")\n*Canadian Urban Music Awards\n**2004 Hip Hop Recording of the Year (\"B-Boy Stance\")\n**2004 Music Video of the Year (\"B-Boy Stance\")\nAt the 2017 Polaris Music Prize, the album won the jury vote for the Heritage Prize in the 1996-2005 category.\nLyrics\nLike Exit, Joyful Rebellion primarily focuses on k-os's negative views of the music industry, supplemented by more metaphorical lyrics.\nThe track \"Man I Used to Be\" is about a man who wants to revert to his previous self. The tracks \"The Love Song\" and \"The Mirror\" are semi-autobiographical. The song \"One Blood\" is an anti-war message. The song \"Papercutz\" is k-os's denial that Exit was his last album. \"Commandante\" features the opening sample of a woman speaking in Spanish on a voice mail.\nTrack listing\n# \"EMCEE Murdah\" – 3:30\n# \"Crucial\" – 3:25\n# \"Man I Used to Be\" – 5:04\n# \"Crabbuckit\" – 3:48\n# \"B-Boy Stance\" – 4:00\n# \"Commandante\" – 3:45\n# \"The Love Song\" – 4:18\n# \"Hallelujah\" – 4:17\n# \"Clap Ur Handz\" – 1:20\n# \"Neutroniks\" - 3:51\n# \"Dirty Water\" (featuring Sam Roberts) – 4:14\n# \"One Blood (Jiggy Homicide)\" – 3:29\n# \"Papercutz\" (featuring Kamau) – 15:27\n#* \"The Mirror\" (Hidden track)\nNOTE: \"Neutroniks\" is only featured on the Canadian version of the album.
