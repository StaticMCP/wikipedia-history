During World War I, the Division remained in India for local defense, but was mobilized for action on the North West Frontier on several occasions.\nThe Division was a part of the Northern Army, later called the Northern Command. In 1919, the Division was mobilized for operations in Afghanistan during the Third Afghan War. Typical of most Indian Army formations, it contained a mixture of British and Indian units; but, unlike British Divisions, it contained a mixture of cavalry and infantry components.\nFormation in 1914\n1st (Risalpur) Cavalry Brigade\n:13th Duke of Connaught's Lancers\n:14th Murray's Jat Lancers\n:1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse\n:Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (Frontier Force) Lumsden's) Cavalry\n:21st Lancers\n:M Battery, Royal Horse Artillery\n:1st Guides Infantry.\n1st (Peshawar) Infantry Brigade\n:2nd Bn, King's (Liverpool Regiment)\n:1st Bn, Royal Sussex Regiment\n:14th Sikhs\n:21st Punjabis\n:72nd Punjabis.\n2nd (Nowshera) Infantry Brigade\n:1st Bn, Durham Light Infantry\n:24th Punjabis\n:46th Punjabis\n:82nd Punjabis\n:112th Infantry\nPeshawar Brigade\nFormed July 1918\n:1st Bn, Yorkshire Regiment\n:30th Lancers.\nDivisional Troops\n:2/1st Guides Rifles\n:38th Dogras\n:51st Sikhs.\nSee also\n* List of Indian divisions in World War I\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
