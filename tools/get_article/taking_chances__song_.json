It was written by Kara DioGuardi and former Eurythmics member, Dave Stewart for their band named Platinum Weird. The song was supposed to be released as a single in February 2007 from their unreleased self-titled album. However, after DioGuardi and Stewart recorded it, they played the track for Dion's husband René Angélil, who loved it and she recorded it.\nIt was released as the first single from Taking Chances in September 2007. \"Taking Chances\" is a pop ballad with a soft rock finish. Lyrically, it is about trusting and baring our souls to each other and committing to making something special. The line, \"So talk to me, like lovers do\" came from the Eurythmics song \"Here Comes the Rain Again.\" The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Dion for taking risks and called it a hopeful and heartfelt song.\nThe song was a success around the world, peaking inside the top ten in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy and Switzerland. It also peaked at number 40 on the UK Singles Chart, while on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it reached number 54. It also topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song was nominated for the Single of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2009. \"Taking Chances\" was covered on Fox's hit TV show Glee by Lea Michele's character Rachel Berry. Her version peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nBackground and writing\n\"Taking Chances\" was written by songwriter Kara DioGuardi and former Eurythmics member Dave Stewart. The record label manager Jimmy Iovine put them together to write for the Pussycat Dolls, but DioGuardi and Stewart quickly realized that the music they were writing was best suited for them to record together. Iovine agreed and signed them to Interscope Records where they recorded an album as Platinum Weird which was released in 2006. In The Dave Stewart Songbook Vol. 1, Stewart explains that he and DioGuardi wrote the song in about 10 minutes one afternoon when movers were bringing furniture into her new Los Angeles home.\n\"I could hear some windchimes just outside the open window where I was laying, so I picked up an acoustic guitar and was trying to play the same random pattern the chimes were making. Kara is a genius with melody and multitasking so as she's shouting to the movers she starts singing, 'Don't know much about your life,' much to the confusion of the workers. It was like a scene from a musical as the furniture was piling in, she was singing, 'What do you say to taking chances? What do you you say to jumping off the edge?' We literally were swapping lyrics, melodies and chords in real time while all this chaos was around us. The song was written about ourselves trusting and baring our souls to each other. About committing to making something special even though we knew we were this odd couple who had no other reason to do it other than we loved it.\"\nAfter DioGuardi and Stewart recorded the song, they played it for Dion's husband René, who loved it. Dion released it as the title track and first single from her ninth English studio album, which was also the name of her World Tour. John Shanks produced the song. He also produced five other songs on Taking Chances. Kara DioGuardi also wrote and co-produced with Emanuel Kiriakou \"Surprise Surprise\" for the Taking Chances album. She has already written few songs for Dion in the past, including \"One Heart\". The latter was co-written and co-produced by John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi, and released as a single in 2003.\nOn 9 September 2007, the members of her fan club had a 24-hour advance preview of \"Taking Chances\" and its accompanying in-studio video. Later, the video was available through Amazon.com and Sympatico / MSN Music Store the following day. The song premiered on the radio on 10 September 2007 and was released as a music download on 29 October 2007 in the United States and Europe. The track was included later on her 2008 greatest hits My Love: Essential Collection. A live version was included in the Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert CD/DVD.\nComposition\n\"Taking Chances\" is a pop song that begins with acoustic guitar, then expands into a fuller pop/rock instrumentation. Celine's vocals span from E3 to F♯5. The line, \"So talk to me, like lovers do\" came from the Eurythmics song \"Here Comes the Rain Again.\" In an interview with Dave Stewart, he explained why he recycled the lyric: \"Yeah, because Taking Chances is the same, me writing with Kara DioGuardi and deciding to enter into something together. So 'I don't know much about your life, don't know much about your world, but I don't want to be alone tonight on this planet they call Earth, right? So what do you say of taking chances?' And it builds up and builds up and gets more determined, which is Kara's personality, who's been through a lot, and she goes, you know, 'I've been beaten down' and all this kind of stuff. And then it flips into, 'So talk to me, talk to me like lovers do.' It's like pulling itself out of that, getting the strength, and actually nodding and tipping my hat to one of my own songs within the song.\"\nCritical reception\n\"Taking Chances\" received critical acclaim. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that \"Dion's vocals are commanding and powerful.\" He also said: \"The song opens the album and announces new directions in a truly exciting fashion,\" though he was disappointed with most of the following songs on the album. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote about the song that \"it is destined for AC's top 10.\" Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe wrote that \"it builds from an acoustic strum into the kind of pleasant radio-ready crunch that Michelle Branch would recognize.\" Tammy La Gorce of Amazon.com called it a \"hopeful, heartfelt track, which unfolds into an anthemic power ballad midway through, may be the best one.\" Nick Levine wrote a positive review for Digital Spy, describing the song: \"It begins in surprisingly restrained fashion, with Dion crooning softly over a near-acoustic musical backdrop, but the soft rock bombast kicks in soon enough. The guitars surge tastefully; the drums thump like they belong on a Phil Collins solo record and Dion plays the banshee to perfection.\"\nAbout.com's Bill Lamb listed as one of the Top 20 Pop Songs of 2007. He went to say that \"She moves into slightly more rocking territory in highly tasteful fashion. Some pop fans may take a second look at Celine after hearing this track.\" The song was nominated for the category Single of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2009. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic highlighted this song. Edna Gundersen from USA Today wrote, \"She dials back the bombast on the title track, a midtempo rocker.\" Also Edna Gundersen from USA Today and Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly have put this song on their \"Download this\" lists.\nCommercial performance\nIn Canada, the song debuted at number 82 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart issue dated 29 September 2007.
