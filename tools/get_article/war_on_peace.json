W. Norton & Company.\nReception\nPublishers Weekly wrote: \"Farrow doesn't quite demonstrate how diplomacy would succeed in quagmires like Afghanistan, but his indictment of the militarization of American foreign policy is persuasive.\"\nRosa Brooks, reviewing the book for The Washington Post, said:\nAlthough War on Peace doesn’t fully achieve its broadest ambitions, it offers lively writing, astute commentary and plenty of great stories, laced through with passion and outrage.\nSee also\n* Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power and Persistence\n* The Pragmatic Entente: Israeli-Iranian Relations, 1948-1988\nReferences"
