The Awards, without a host for the third consecutive year, were broadcast by NBC for the first time in 11 years.\nGeorge C. Scott, winner of Best Actor for Patton, became the first actor to decline an Oscar, having previously protested his nomination for Best Supporting Actor for The Hustler (1961) and quoted as saying that the Academy Awards were \"a two-hour meat parade, a public display with contrived suspense for economic reasons.\" He also maintained that it was \"degrading for actors to compete against one another.\" Co-star Karl Malden agreed, but felt that Scott could have made his denunciation more subtly.\nWith her Best Supporting Actress win for Airport, Helen Hayes became the first performer to win Oscars in both lead and supporting categories (having won Best Actress 39 years before for The Sin of Madelon Claudet). Her win set a record for the biggest gap between acting wins, subsequently broken by Katharine Hepburn (48 years between her first and last wins).\nThe documentary film Woodstock garnered three Oscar nominations, making it the most nominated documentary film in Oscar history (its record was later tied by Flee, 51 years later).\nThis was the only time since the 6th Academy Awards that all five nominees for Best Actress were first-time nominees, and was the last time that either lead acting category was entirely composed of new nominees until the 95th Academy Awards. It was also the first time since the 7th Academy Awards in which none of the nominees for the Best Actor had a previous nomination in that category.\nAs of 2024, this is the most recent ceremony in which the 4 highest-grossing films of the year were nominated for Best Picture (Love Story, Airport, M*A*S*H and Patton).\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on February 23, 1971. Winners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Patton – Frank McCarthy, producer'\n**Airport – Ross Hunter, producer\n**Five Easy Pieces – Bob Rafelson and Richard Wechsler, producers\n**Love Story – Howard G.
