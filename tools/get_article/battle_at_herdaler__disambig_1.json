The Saga of Olaf Haraldson tells how Olav raided the coasts of Finland and was almost killed in the battle.\nAfter this they sailed to Finland and plundered there, and went\nup the country.  All the people fled to the forest, and they had\nemptied their houses of all household goods.  The king went far\nup the country, and through some woods, and came to some\ndwellings in a valley called Herdaler, -- where, however, they\nmade but small booty, and saw no people; and as it was getting\nlate in the day, the king turned back to his ships.  Now when\nthey came into the woods again people rushed upon them from all\nquarters, and made a severe attack.  The king told his men to\ncover themselves with their shields, but before they got out of\nthe woods he lost many people, and many were wounded; but at\nlast, late in the evening, he got to the ships.  The Finlanders\nconjured up in the night, by their witchcraft, a dreadful storm\nand bad weather on the sea; but the king ordered the anchors to\nbe weighed and sail hoisted, and beat off all night to the\noutside of the land.  The king's luck prevailed more than the\nFinlanders' witchcraft; for he had the luck to beat round the\nBalagard's side in the night. and so got out to sea.  But the\nFinnish army proceeded on land, making the same progress as the\nking made with his ships.  So says Sigvat: --\n\"The third fight was at Herdaler, where\nThe men of Finland met in war\nThe hero of the royal race,\nWith ringing sword-blades face to face.\nOff Balagard's shore the waves\nRan hollow; but the sea-king saves\nHis hard-pressed ship, and gains the lee\nOf the east coast through the wild sea.\"\nThe location of \"Herdaler\" in Finland is not certain. The expedition's possible place could have been in Uusimaa in Hirdal in the present-day town of Inkoo. That makes it the first mentioning of a place located in present-day Finland in historical literature.\nSee also\n* Prehistoric Finnish wars\nReferences"
