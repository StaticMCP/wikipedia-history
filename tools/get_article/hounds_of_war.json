Darren said that \" Hounds of War isn't the complete success I initially hoped for, but it was still a worthwhile experience. Fans of Florentine will appreciate his action direction, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of his best works. Jayanty Nada Shofa of the Jakarta Globe wrote, \"Hounds of War sounds like the title of an action-packed movie, but the one-and-a-half-hour film starring Frank Grillo turns out to be a total snoozefest.\" He further noted that it \"lacks a well-established set-up,\" and much of the film feels like \"an excuse to grab some theater popcorn.\"\nWhile the movie features plenty of action scenes, Shofa criticized the editing, saying it fails to keep the excitement alive. Many combat scenes, especially those involving kicks, are fast-forwarded, detracting from their impact. The performances, including Grillo's, are described as unremarkable.\nRelease\nThe film was originally scheduled for release in 2023, but its release date was moved to September 2024.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
