The family were more than delighted to obtain a picture and it was then that the President, Bill Allan, came up with the concept of a Wall of Remembrance.\nHe solicited the support of the Secretary of the Unit and Past Presidents George Mannion, David Barker and members of Unit 57. They developed the plan, initiating meetings between the Corporation of Meadowvale Cemeteries and several government agencies to build the Wall of Remembrance. The committee raised $300,000.00 from the private sector.\nThe Wall of Remembrance (the Wall) was constructed of gray Barre granite, which matched the existing Veterans' Memorial. Approximately 200 feet in length, the Wall curves gently to follow the roadway which circles around the Veterans' Memorial. A low-profile retaining wall approximately two feet high, the Wall follows the natural topography which slopes gently towards the roadway. The Wall leans backwards at an angle of approximately 50 degrees.\nThe central feature of the Wall consists of three panels: a rectangular block flanked by two wings which slope down from the centre. They are four feet wide and approximately five feet high at the highest point. The rectangular block in the centre features the Korean Veterans Association insignia, the Canadian forces insignia, the United Nations insignia, and the names of the participating Canadian Forces.\nOn one wing is a poem by Jack LaChance, on the other, a verse from Laurence Binyon's famous poem \"For the Fallen\", information relating to the dedication of the memorial, and the names of the organizing committee responsible for getting this project off the ground.\nThe memorial, itself, consists of seven sections on each side of the central feature. Each section contains four rows of 6\" X 10\" bronze plaques, which are replicas of those gracing the graves of the comrades in Pusan.\nSee also\n* Korean War Memorial, Canberra, Australia\n* Korean War Veterans Memorial, Washington, D.C.\n* Philadelphia Korean War Memorial\n* United Nations Memorial Cemetery, in Pusan, Korea, where many Canadian war dead are buried\n* War Memorial of Korea, Seoul, Korea\nReferences\n* [http://www.kvacanada.com/wall_ofremembenglish.htm Korea Veterans Association of Canada]  Gives the story of the wall.\n* [http://www.dvdempire.com/Exec/v4_item.asp?userid=-1&item_id=1331914&searchID Test of Will] is a Canadian documentary by [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0012295 Richard Neilson]  in 2002 that covers the story of the Canadian involvement in the Korean War.
