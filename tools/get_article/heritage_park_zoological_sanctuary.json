Williams  Bob Matthews former board president, and several other volunteers who established a non-profit organization in 1985 called the Prescott Animal Park Association (PAPA).  Initially, the animal park was established in order to inherit the former Payson Zoo run by Randy Ferry but after the establishment of the association, Randy Ferry reconsidered and continued operations in Payson.  Today, this sanctuary's motto is \"Conservation through Education\" and is home to over 175 native and exotic animal with a focus on non-releasable wildlife, with no other place to live out their lives.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140529085025/http://depixation.com/index.php/photoblog/item/6-heritageparkzoo Photos of Heritage Park Zoo]"
