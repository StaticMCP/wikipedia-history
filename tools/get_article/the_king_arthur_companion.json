Subsequent editions expanded the contents, with the name changing in 2001 to The Arthurian Companion. In 2017, a new edition, renamed The Arthurian Concordance was funded as part of a crowdfunding campaign.\nContents\nThe King Arthur Companion is a guide to the world of Arthur Pendragon, and is divided into alphabetically-arranged sections for \"People\", \"Places\", and \"Things\".\nPublication history\nOriginating in the research for Greg Stafford's 1979 board game ''King Arthur's Knights, it eventually saw publication as a separate book in 1983 as an 8.5”x11” hardback with 174 pages.\nThe 1986 edition was an 8.5”x11” paperback with 174 pages.\nThe 1997 edition was a digest size paperback with 570 pages and an embossed cover. It was renamed The Arthurian Companion and was the first in the Pendragon fiction line.\nThe 2001 second edition by Green Knight had its page count increased by 20 pages to 590, and was published as a paperback and hardcover.\nAn updated edition of The Arthurian Companion will be published by Chaosium in 2022.\nReception\nDebye Pruitt reviewed King Arthur's Companion for Pegasus magazine and stated that \"I would recommend it to any with even the slightest interest in the romance of King Arthur, and if I, who have only a mild interest in the Arthurian legends, find this book fascinating, someone who is truly interested in the subject will find it absolutely riveting.\"\nBill Johnson reviewed The King Arthur Companion for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"The King Arthur Companion is an incredibly entertaining and useful work. It holds a wealth of information about an earlier time both real and imagined. As intriguing as the tales it describes, the Companion will find a place close at hand to any lover of Arthurian lore whether novice or expert.\"\nJ. Michael Caporula reviewed the Chaosium release of The King Arthur Companion in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 77. Caporula commented that \"The group of people I most heartily recommend The King Arthur Companion'' to are the literary 'browsers' of the world, such as myself, who would rather skim through reference works like these than read the actual works themselves. One will surely spend hours enraptured in this tome, given the chance. That a 'dictionary' can stand up to this kind of test is worthy praise indeed.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://greathall.chaosium.com/ Chaosium resources for Pendragon]"
