All Progressives Congress (APC) nominee Bola Tinubu defeated Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party and Peter Obi of Labour Party.\nParty's primary elections were conducted between 4 April and 9 June 2022; Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nominated Atiku Abubakar while All Progressives Congress (APC) chose Bola Tinubu as their nominee. The dominance of the two major parties began to fray as a revived party, the Labour Party (LP), nominated Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra State while another party, New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), nominated Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano State. The vice presidential candidates were announced some weeks later, and the nominees were Ifeanyi Okowa for PDP, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed for LP, Kashim Shettima for APC, and Isaac Idahosa for NNPP.\nCorruption, electoral malpractice, and insecurity, among others were issues during the election. Others include views for the reformation of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), who rather cumulated the results from the polling units manually after failing to upload them online through the result viewing portal as assured to the citizens.\nThe results were announced on 26 February at the National Collation Centre in Abuja, where INEC declared the presidential and vice presidential nominees for APC as the winner in 1 March. The result was rejected by some international bodies as well as the opposition parties who criticised the results and legally challenged it. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo also called for the re-run of the election, citing fraud and violence.\nBackground\nMuhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the 2019 Nigerian presidential election. He defeated Atiku Abubakar of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) with a margin of 3,928,869 votes. APC and PDP are the major dominating parties in Nigeria. However, APC mostly won the elections of the legislative elections; House of Representatives and the Senate. PDP held a convention at Abuja 30 October 2021 ahead of the 2023 presidential election after losing in 2015 and 2019.\nAhead of Buhari's second term, his promises included the completion of in-process rail lines, roads and other infrastructural projects, empowering of youths, improvement of schools and industrial parks as well as inclusion of women in government and creating anti-corruption initiatives. His first term was commended for improving, among others, the agricultural sector, infrastructures like the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, and rail lines. Meanwhile, he faced criticism for abandoning anti-corruption initiatives, poor economy and quality of life, insecurity, and terrorism Other events include censorship by banning Twitter after the site removed an abusive tweet he posted in reference to the Nigerian Civil War, handling of the October 2020 protest for End SARS especially the Lekki massacre in Lagos, where several peaceful protesters were killed by the Army.\nPrimary elections\nThe primaries election was previously scheduled between 4 April and 3 June 2022 but was later extended to 9 June. Since 1999, Nigeria's two major political parties–APC and PDP— have practiced presidential zoning, which sought for geographical balance between the president and his vice. It states that each cannot be from the same geographical location rather either south and the other north or viceversa. Hence a new president should be from the south. Both parties had series of internal debates over zoning and same religion tickets before the primary. Nevertheless, both parties declined zoning. PDP nominated a northerner Atiku Abubakar while APC nominated a southerner Bola Tinubu. APC nominee also chose a Muslim-Muslim ticket while PDP did not.\nAll Progressives Congress\n| home_state1 = Lagos\n| party1 = All Progressives Congress\n| popular_vote1 = 1,271\n| percentage1 = 60.5%\n| image2 = Chibuike Amaechi (cropped).jpg\n| colour2 = fdd696\n| nominee2 = Rotimi Amaechi\n| home_state2 = Rivers\n| party2 = All Progressives Congress\n| popular_vote2 = 316\n| percentage2 = 15.0%\n| image3 = Yemi Osinbajo 2017-05-27.jpg\n| colour3 = 084447\n| nominee3 = Yemi Osinbajo\n| home_state3 = Ogun\n| party3 = All Progressives Congress\n| popular_vote3 = 235\n| percentage3 = 11.2%\n| title = Presidential Nominee\n| after_election = Bola Tinubu\n| after_party = All Progressives Congress\n}}\nWith Muhammadu Buhari having been elected to the presidency twice, he was ineligible for renomination. In July 2021, then-national APC Caretaker chairman and Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni backed the consensus method of nominating a presidential candidate instead of the more common direct or indirect primary methods but the party did not come to a decision on the primary method at the time. During Buni's term as Caretaker chairman from 2020 to 2022, he campaigned heavily for prominent PDP members to defect to the APC, weakening the opposition's caucus in the National Assembly and gaining three governors—Ebonyi State's Dave Umahi, Cross River State's Benedict Ayade, and Zamfara State's Bello Muhammad Matawalle—in 2020 and 2021. However, the APC's electoral performance and party unity were more mixed as it came a distant third in the 2021 Anambra State gubernatorial election and was still beset by infighting. The APC primary was framed in the wider context of internal party feuds stemming from the APC's formation in 2013 and pre-2019 election party crises to the 2020 removal of party leadership and contentious 2021 state party congresses. The ability of the APC national caretaker committee to resolve state party factionizations and properly organize the 2022 national party convention was seen as vital for both the APC's presidential chances and its future as a party. After several postponements, the convention was successfully held on 26 March 2022 despite some controversy over the consensus method used for most party offices.\nIn terms of zoning, there was no announced formal zoning agreement for the APC nomination despite calls from certain politicians and interest groups such as the Southern Governors' Forum to zone the nomination to the South as Buhari, a Northerner, was elected twice. Countering its proponents were prospective candidates from the North and the Northern Governors' Forum, which did not oppose a southern presidency but initially disagreed with formal zoning. On the other hand, there were few proponents of a same religion ticket, mainly supporters and allies of eventual nominee Bola Tinubu who argued that there were few powerful Northern Christian APC politicians who could be his running mate. Allies of other potential candidates and groups like the Christian Association of Nigeria came out strongly against the idea of a same religion ticket on grounds of national unity and religious harmony.\nOn 20 April 2022, the APC National Executive Committee announced the party timetable for the presidential primary and that the primary would use the indirect primary method. The announcement set the party's expression of interest form price at ₦30&nbsp;million and the nomination form price at ₦70&nbsp;million with a 50% nomination form discount for candidates younger than 40 while women and candidates with disabilities get free nomination forms. Forms were to be sold from 26 April to 6 May until the deadline was later extended to 10 May then 12 May. After the submission of nomination forms by 13 May, candidates were to be screened by a party committee on 24 and 25 May but it was delayed several times to while the screening appeal process will take place afterwards. Ward congresses and LGA congresses were rescheduled for between 12 and 14 May to elect \"ad hoc delegates\" for the primary. Candidates approved by the screening process were to advance to a primary set for 30 May and 1 June but the party delayed the primary to 6–8 June.\nBefore the primary, controversy over the prospective electors emerged due to the legal ramifications of the amended Electoral Act. After years of debate and public pressure, Buhari signed a new Electoral Act in January 2022 that drastically reformed election and electoral systems for both primary and general elections. One of the reforms was the exclusion of ex officio \"statutory delegates\"—thousands of current and former officeholders—from voting in party primaries; National Assembly leadership said the exclusion was inadvertent and in May, NASS passed an amendment to the act to allow statutory delegates to vote in primaries. However, Buhari refused to sign the amendment into law, forcing the APC to suddenly prohibit statutory delegates from voting. Not only did the action prevent Buhari and other high-ranking officeholders from voting, it drastically reduced the number of delegates from over 7,800 to just the 2,322 elected \"ad hoc delegates.\"\nThe pre-primary period was dominated by questions about major candidates and Buhari's endorsement. Of the formally announced candidates, analysts viewed six as the major contenders: Rotimi Amaechi—former Minister of Transportation and former Governor of Rivers State, Kayode Fayemi—Governor of Ekiti State, Ahmad Lawan—Senate President, Yemi Osinbajo—Vice President, former science minister Ogbonnaya Onu, and Bola Tinubu—former Governor of Lagos State; however, two potential surprises emerged: former President Goodluck Jonathan and Governor of the Central Bank Godwin Emefiele. Groups purchasing forms on behalf of Emefiele and Jonathan coupled with months of speculation about their candidacies led to rumours of a plot to impose one of the two as nominee despite the legally-mandated nonpartisanship of Emefiele's office and Jonathan's membership in the PDP; neither candidacy came to fruition as Jonathan refused the forms, while Emefiele was forced to withdraw due to public pressure. The other main question was Buhari's endorsement; despite months of contending that he would not weigh in on the primary, about a week before the primary, Buhari held a meeting with APC governors where he asked them to support his preferred candidate. Reports emerged that while the vast majority of governors agreed, a few rejected the proposal or did not state their position. Another point of contention was the oft-postponed candidate screening, where a committee led by former APC National chairman John Odigie Oyegun cleared all twenty-three candidates but recommended only thirteen candidates continue their campaigns due to their perceived chances of victory.\nIn the days directly before the primary, the vast majority of northern APC governors released a letter in support of a southern nominee where they also asked northern candidates to withdraw; in response, one northern candidate withdrew from the primary. Later that day (4 June 2022), Buhari held a meeting with most APC candidates where he reportedly privately backed a nominee from the south and told the candidates to find a consensus nominee amongst themselves. However, on 6 June—the day before primary voting, national party chairman Abdullahi Adamu told northern APC governors that the party's (and Buhari's) consensus candidate would be Lawan; the announcement was met with opposition by governors and other members of the party's National Working Committee leading the party to backtrack and claim that Adamu was just expressing his personal opinion. The same day, Buhari stated that he had no anointed candidate in the primary. Then early on primary day, APC governors and the party NWC made a joint recommendation of five southern candidates—Amaechi, Fayemi, Osinbajo, Tinubu, and Governor of Ebonyi State Dave Umahi—to Buhari while asking all other aspirants to withdraw from the race. Seven other candidates released a joint statement rejecting the shortlist while all six southeastern candidates penned a letter to Buhari asking that the nomination be zoned to the South-East.\nOn the day of the primary, delegates gathered in Eagle Square, Abuja to be accredited and vote. The early part of the exercise was beset by logistical issues as there were significant delays in both delegate and journalist accreditation along with the deployment of tear gas by security to disperse crowds. Meanwhile, inside the Square, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission personnel took positions to prevent bribery before candidates gave their final speeches to the delegates before voting. During these speeches, six candidates—Godswill Akpabio, Ibikunle Amosun, Dimeji Bankole, Robert Ajayi Boroffice, Fayemi, and Uju Kennedy Ohanenye—stepped down in favour of Tinubu and one aspirant—Nicholas Felix—withdrew for Osinbajo while the remaining candidates issued promises and proposals for their prospective campaigns. After the candidate's speeches and an address by Buhari, voting began in the early morning of 8 June and after hours of voting, votes were publicly tabulated. When collation was completed, Bola Tinubu emerged as nominee after results showed him winning 60% of the votes with a margin of 45% over runner-up Amaechi. In his acceptance speech, Tinubu thanked his team while striking a conciliatory tone in regards to his former opponents. Post-primary analysis noted multiple potential reasons for Tinubu's victory, namely: other candidates' focus on a Buhari endorsement that never came, the failure of Buhari's succession plan, bribery, and the last-minute withdrawals. The week after the primary were based around the search for Tinubu's running mate, as Tinubu is a southern Muslim, it was expected that his running mate would be a northern Christian but controversy emerged as some prominent APC politicians stated their openness to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. As the deadline neared, the party submitted the name of Kabir Ibrahim Masari—a politician and party operative from Katsina State—as a placeholder vice presidential nominee to be substituted at a later date. On 10 July, Ibrahim Masari withdrew and Tinubu announced Kashim Shettima—a senator and former Governor of Borno State—as his running mate after a meeting with Buhari in Daura. Breaking the anti-same religion ticket convention, Tinubu argued in a statement that \"religion...cannot always and fully determine our path\" and that he picked \"the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation\" and compared the ticket to the last Yoruba Muslim-Kanuri Muslim ticket, the successful M. K. O. Abiola-Baba Gana Kingibe slate in 1993. Opponents, like the Christian Association of Nigeria and civil society groups, derided the pick as divisive in a trying time for Nigerian unity. Analysts noted the previous reports from before Tinubu was nominated said that his inner circle did not think a Northern Christian would help the party in the majority-Muslim states and thus a fellow Muslim should be picked.\nNominated\n* Bola Tinubu: former Governor of Lagos State (1999–2007) and former Senator for Lagos West (1992–1993)\n** Running mate—Kashim Shettima: Senator for Borno Central (2019–present), former Governor of Borno State (2011–2019), and son of former Governor of Northern Nigeria Kashim Ibrahim\nEliminated in primary\n* Rotimi Amaechi: former Minister of Transportation (2015–2019;

In the year prior to Ayu's election at the October 2021 PDP National Convention, the party had been beset by months of defections from prominent members, most notably of over a dozen National Assembly members and three governors—Ebonyi State's Dave Umahi, Cross River State's Benedict Ayade, and Zamfara State's Bello Muhammad Matawalle; the party also came a distant second in the 2021 Anambra State gubernatorial election and suspended then-national party chair, Uche Secondus. However, the PDP was able to hold its convention without controversy or violence in October, electing nearly all party officials by consensus and inaugurating the full National Working Committee in December.\nIn terms of zoning, the PDP did not have a formal zoning agreement for the nomination, however, there were calls from certain politicians and interest groups such as the Southern Governors' Forum to zone the nomination to the South as the APC's Buhari, a Northerner, was elected twice. Amid calls for zoning, the party set up an internal committee in March 2022 with a decision on the issue expected by April. However, the decision's release was delayed until May when the party announced that it would not zone its nomination.\nOn 16 March 2022, the national PDP announced its primary schedule, setting its expression of interest form price at ₦5 million and the nomination form price at ₦35 million with a 50% discount for candidates between 25 and 30. Forms were to be sold from 18 March to 1 April but the party later extended the deadline four times before reaching a final deadline of 22 April. After the submission of nomination forms by 25 April, candidates were screened by a party committee on 29 April while 2 May was the rescheduled date for the screening appeal process. Ward congresses were set for 29 April and LGA congresses were rescheduled for 10 May to elect \"ad hoc delegates\" for the primary; ex officio \"statutory delegates\"—thousands of current and former officeholders—will not be electors unlike previous primaries. Candidates approved by the screening process will advance to a primary set for 28 and 29 May.\nAt the party screening, a committee led by former Senate President David Mark cleared most candidates but disqualified two—Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Cosmos Chukwudi Ndukwe; The disqualifications were then upheld by a screening appeal committee led by Ayu. After the screening, the party's oft-postponed zoning decision was announced with the PDP National Executive Council choosing not to zone the nomination to any particular region, throwing the race open to all candidates. Of the candidates, analysts viewed five as the most likely to win: Atiku Abubakar—former Vice President and 2019 presidential nominee, Peter Obi—former Governor of Anambra State and 2019 vice presidential nominee, Bukola Saraki—former Senate President, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal—Governor of Sokoto State and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Nyesom Wike—Governor of Rivers State with a few other notable candidates seen as unlikely to have a chance. However, a few days before the primary, Obi suddenly withdrew from the primary and decamped to the Labour Party.\nIn the days before the primary, controversy over the prospective electors emerged due to the legal ramifications of the amended Electoral Act. After years of debate and public pressure, Buhari signed a new Electoral Act in January 2022 that drastically reformed election and electoral systems for both primary and general elections. One of the reforms was the exclusion of ex officio \"statutory delegates\"—thousands of current and former officeholders—from voting in party primaries; National Assembly leadership said the exclusion was inadvertent and in May, NASS passed an amendment to the act to allow statutory delegates to vote in primaries. However, Buhari refused to sign the amendment into law, forcing the PDP to suddenly barr statutory delegates from voting. Not only did the action prevent incumbent governors and other high-ranking officeholders from voting, it drastically reduced the number of delegates to just 810 then 774.\nOn the day of the primary, delegates gathered in the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium to be accredited and vote. Despite a few unexpected events, including the arrival of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission personnel meant to prevent bribery and the withdrawal of candidate Mohammed Hayatu-Deen in protest of the \"obscenely monetized\" race, the process continued as every candidate gave a final speech to the delegates before voting. Another surprise came after the speeches, when Tambuwal returned to the dais to withdraw from the primary and direct his delegates to vote for Abubakar. After the withdrawal, voting began and after over an hour of voting, the votes were publicly tabulated. When collation completed, Atiku Abubakar emerged as nominee after results showed him winning just under 50% of the votes with a margin of 18% over runner-up Wike. Later investigations into reported vote breakdowns stated that Abubakar won the majority of delegates from the North West and North East while delegates from the North Central and South West split Abubakar, Saraki, and Wike; delegates\nfrom the South East and South South also split, mainly between Abubakar and Wike but with Emmanuel winning a portion of the votes. In his acceptance speech, Abubakar vowed to carry the party to victory in the general election on a platform based on unity and economic growth while striking a conciliatory tone in regards to his former opponents. Post-primary analysis noted multiple potential reasons for Abubakar's victory, namely: Tambuwal's withdrawal, Abubakar's public office and campaign experience, the higher number of Northern delegates, and bribery. The weeks after the primary were dominated by the search for Abubakar's running mate, as Abubakar is a northern Muslim it was expected that his running mate would be a southern Christian with Wike, Emmanuel, and Governor of Delta State Ifeanyi Okowa being shortlisted as potential options. On 16 June, Abubakar announced that Okowa would be his running mate; observers noted that despite Okowa's South South origins, his Ika ethnicity could be a nod to southeastern clamours for an Igbo running mate.

On the primary date, the candidates contested an indirect primary that ended with Kachikwu emerging as the presidential nominee after results showed him winning just under 50% of the delegates' votes. A few days later, Moghalu left the party in protest amid allegations that Kachikwu's win was mainly due to bribes given to delegates. Kachikwu denied the allegations and claimed that it was Moghalu that attempted bribery; however, a few days later, American assets of Kachikwu were seized and a previous seizure related to the William J. Jefferson corruption case resurfaced leading to questions on his credibility. The party first nominated Ahmed Mani for the vice presidency as a placeholder before picking Malika Sani later in June; however, Sani's nomination fell through and about a month later, Kachikwu announced Ahmed Buhari—an oil and gas consultant from Niger State—as his substantive running mate.

After a number of delays, in May 2022, the group adopted the Labour Party as its platform with hopes of forming an alliance with a number of other smaller parties. The party received another boost when former Governor of Anambra State Peter Obi joined the party in May 2022 to continue his presidential campaign after leaving the PDP. Obi was welcomed into the party by its leadership which also used the announcement to attack the APC and PDP as well as commit to the party manifesto. However, the party had to contend with deep divisions as a factional crisis from 2018 is still in the courts.\nThe Labour Party initially scheduled its primary for 3 June but rescheduled it for 30 May. It set the price for expression of interest and nomination forms at ₦30 million. On the day of the primary, 104 delegates gathered in Asaba for the primary but no election was needed as three of four candidates—Utomi, Olubusola Emmanuel-Tella, and Joseph Faduri—withdrew in favour of Obi. Obi then won the primary unanimously with only a sole invalid vote not going for him. In his acceptance speech, he promised to revolutionize the nation economically and mobilize an effective general election campaign. A few days after the primary, the other Labour faction held its own parallel primary but INEC recognized the Obi-won election. On 17 June, the party submitted the name of Doyin Okupe—a physician and former PDP candidate who became the Director-General of the Obi Campaign Organisation—as a placeholder vice presidential nominee to be substituted for someone else at a later date. On 7 July, Okupe formally withdrew ahead of the announcement of Obi's substantive running mate. The next day, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed—a businessman who previously served as Senator for Kaduna North—was announced as the party's vice presidential nominee. Analysts noted the regional balance of the ticket as Baba-Ahmed is a northerner but questioned his electoral experience as he has not won an election since 2011; at the same time, pundits said his prominent Zaria-based family and technocratic image could help Obi. Peter Obi's running mate, Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, in November 2011, called for LGBTQ within the society to be killed, whilst debating the levity of punishment contained in the proposed bill to criminalise such relationships, in a Senate session\n| party = Labour Party (Nigeria)\n| votes = 96\n| percentage = 100.00%\n}}\nThe National Rescue Movement scheduled its primary for 1 and 2 June; setting its expression of interest form price at ₦1.5 million and nomination form price at ₦17.5 million with a 50% discount for women, youth, and candidates with disabilities.

However, when INEC released its provisional nominee list, Nwa-Anyajike had been substituted for Felix Johnson Osakwe—a withdrawn AA presidential candidate; Nwa-Anyajike and other party members allege that Osakwe colluded with a portion of NRM leadership to forge Nwa-Anyajike's withdrawal and substitute Osakwe as the nominee.

Ajadi's withdrawal left Kwankwaso unopposed in the primary. On 8 June, Kwankwaso won the nomination by voice vote at the primary in Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium. The party would later nominate Ladipo Johnson instead of Ajadi as a placeholder vice presidential nominee while negotiations with the Labour Party resumed.

The commission released the timetable in February 2022 with a final date of 3 June 2022 for party primaries; as this date neared, parties repeatedly asked INEC to extend the deadline by two months. After several refusals, INEC agreed to a shorter extension of six days to 9 June but the decision proved controversial as pundits noted that the PDP was about to hold its primary while the APC had not even screened its candidates. Further criticism arose because INEC initially did not also extend the voter registration deadline in kind.\nAfter the primaries, focus shifted to voter registration and the logistical issues surrounding it. Due to years of IPOB attacks on southeastern INEC offices, the commission's capacity in the region was low in 2022 while in Lagos, a registration drive by market traders in June 2022 that overwhelmed an INEC centre also drew the commission's registration capability into question as the deadline neared. In the wake of the incidents, INEC deployed extra registration machines to Lagos State, Kano State, and some southeastern states. Around the same time, INEC hinted at a potential extension of the registration deadline before a court ruling later in June pushed back the deadline anyway. In compliance with the ruling, INEC set the new deadline for 31 July while simultaneously extending daily registration hours from six to eight. Ahead of the deadline, eleven states declared public holidays for voter registration in an attempt to increase public participation in the political process. After the deadline passed, INEC announced that nearly 12.3&nbsp;million new voters registered during the exercise. 8.75&nbsp;million of the new voters were younger than 34, a percentage noted as a potential sign of increased youth participation ahead of the election. After the registration drive, the total registered voters number was about 96.2&nbsp;million with the North-West and South-West geopolitical zones having the most voters.\nAs the official campaign period neared, INEC focused on direct public communication and formed the Election Crisis Communication Team in late August. During the team inauguration, commissioner Festus Okoye stated that the group's formation was initiated by the Centre for Democracy and Development to combat misinformation and inform the public on key events to the public; Okoye also said that the commission was in the process of training staff to work polling units. Focus shifted back to registration afterwards, with INEC delisting over 1.1&nbsp;million invalid registrants in mid-September. Among the final pre-campaign period procedures was the 20 September release of the nominee list along with the reiteration of the timetable.\nCampaign period\nThe official campaign period began on 28 September 2022 and will end on 23 February 2023. At the start of the campaign period, reports noted the pressure placed on INEC from voters, misinformation, and political parties.\nIn late October, the commission again announced mass delisting of invalid registrants with 2.78&nbsp;million enrollees (including the prior 1.1&nbsp;million invalid registrants) being removed from the list due to double registration, underaged registration, and other issues. At the same event, INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu also revealed that the preliminary total valid registrant number was about 93.52&nbsp;million. In accordance with law, INEC posted registries in each local ward but also released the full registrant list online, asking for the public to help scrutinize the list. Amid the public clamor to inspect the list, thousands of public reports showed clearly underage children as registrants—in response, INEC thanked public investigators then vowed to remove ineligible registrants and prosecute complicit officials.\nAs campaigning escalated in late 2022, fears rose over electoral violence based on ethnic, regional, and religious sentiments as candidates and their surrogates began extensively using identity politics during campaigning. Similarly, fears rose over media campaign and election coverage and its effects on public discourse; while certain outlets were criticized for biases, other groups were praised for advancing election coverage as Stears Business published the first live election tracker in November.\nIn terms of election security, a series of attacks on INEC offices in Imo State in December 2022 led to further domestic and international concern despite assurances from security forces that the election would be nonviolent. In the wake of the attacks, the Centre for Democracy and Development called for conflict sensitive media reporting on the election to avoid further violence. In accompaniment with concern over violence, renewed fear of hate speech (especially online) began as the election neared and politicians increasingly employed it as a campaign tactic.\nAside from direct threats to the elections, INEC also raised the alarm about vote-buying to manipulate results as the practice had greatly impacted elections in 2021 and 2022. In a reported attempt to combat vote-buying, the Central Bank redesigned the 200, 500, and 1,000 naira notes in October 2022 and removed older notes from circulation. The move prevented parties from using pre-gathered cash that was attended to be distributed for vote-buying as the elections neared. However, the new policy and its sudden announcement was very controversial, especially as Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele—who fled into self-imposed exile in late 2022—refused to personally explain the move to the National Assembly. For the part of INEC, the commission vowed to prevent vote-buying despite previous failed reforms while civil society groups noted that vote-buying was just one of a number of potential manipulation tactics, with YIAGA Africa releasing a report detailing electoral malpractice risk factors by state.\nAs sporadic attacks on southeastern INEC offices continued into the new year, a commission official warned that the election could be forced into postponement if the attacks were not stopped. Although the comment was quickly retracted and the commission promised to hold the election as scheduled, concerns continued considering the deadly attacks—like previous southeastern attacks on INEC, experts stated that the attacks were most likely conducted by violent secessionist groups attempting to \"delegitimise the electoral process and boost their separatist agenda.\" The attacks continued until the election, as did concerns that the election would be postponed at the last moment.\nAmid swirling doubts over the election proceeding, INEC released new voter registration data in mid-January 2023. The statistics totaled to 93,469,008 eligible voters after the commission reviewed challenges to over 50,000 registrants in addition to removing more instances of double and underage registration. While there was data on occupation and disability plus a sizeable gender gap—over 4.6&nbsp;million more men registered than women, focus was mainly directed at the increased youth registration with nearly 40% of all voters being between the ages of 18 and 34. Geographic data showed fairly stark contrasts between regions as the North-West and South-West led in total voters while the North East and South East trailed behind. Around the same time, INEC twice extended the deadline for PVC collection in wake of public calls for an extension. A few weeks after the final deadline elapsed, the commission released Permanent Voter Card collection statistics on 23 February that showed a total of 87,209,007 voters (93.3% of all registered voters) had collected their PVCs. In the final days of the campaign period, INEC vowed that the election would be free, safe, secure, timely, and transparent with hundreds of thousands of security personnel, 229 foreign and domestic observer groups, and thousands of INEC staffers.\nElection day and collation period\nOn election day, widespread reports of delayed starts to voting emerged with YIAGA Africa estimating that only 41% of polling units had commenced voting by 9:30&nbsp;am, an hour after voting was scheduled to start. Similarly, SBM Intelligence reported that only 41.3% of polling units had opened on time while Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room data claimed less than 30% of units had started by 8:30&nbsp;am, with other reports claiming that the currency crisis had precluded INEC from paying cash to transporters prior to election day which led some drivers to refuse to convey INEC materials or personnel. SBM also noted that turnout was high and there were relatively few violent incidents nationwide while some groups observed newly adapted vote buying efforts due to the currency crisis like bribing using West African CFA francs or non-monetary inducements. However, there were notable reports of violence in certain areas, most notably in Lagos State where thugs alleged to be aligned with the APC targeted predominantly ethnic minority areas. Additionally, several attacks on journalists by unknown assailants or even security personnel occurred throughout election day. Although INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu acknowledged several problems at his 1&nbsp;pm briefing and called on voters to stay at polling units, civil groups called on INEC to extend voting past the 2:30&nbsp;pm deadline. The first announced postponements came later in the day when INEC suspended voting in 141 Bayelsa State units where there were disruptions, rescheduling the voting for 26 February. INEC later extended voting to the next day in parts of Cross River State and Kogi State as well.\nLater in the day, focus turned to turnout and results collation. On turnout, SBM Intelligence released a state-by-state turnout projection, estimating that overall turnout had risen compared to 2019 and that everywhere but Kwara and Ogun had turnout higher than 30%. Although INEC had announced that collation centres would only open at noon on 26 February, the commission had long promised to upload polling unit results to its INEC result viewing portal (IReV) on election day; however, no results were uploaded for most of the day, leading to protests by the civil society groups and online citizens. The Obi campaign also decried the lack of uploads, claiming the act drew the election's fairness into doubt and noting that legislative results had already been uploaded; Labour Party Chairman Julius Abure went as far to claim that compromised or threatened INEC officials were holding back results from Obi-supporting areas of Lagos and Delta states. Around 10:45&nbsp;pm on the night of 25 February, INEC finally began uploading data to the portal.\nBy 6 am on 26 February, only about 10% of polling unit results had been uploaded as journalists noted the rising potential for further doubt in election credibility due to the delay. Later in the morning, voting in rescheduled units commenced while newly released civil society reports commended voters but decried suppression and poor administration. By the opening of the national collation centre around 1&nbsp;pm, more results had been uploaded but no full state results were communicated at the centre yet. Meanwhile, INEC released a statement that blamed \"technical hitches\" for the delayed uploads of results in the wake of further protests by both the PDP and LP. By the end of the day, only Ekiti State results were announced at the national centre while the results in Osun and Ondo were announced at the state collation centres but did not reach the national centre before it closed for the day. On the other hand, voting was further postponed in some areas, with significant controversy surrounding the election in Abia State and its INEC administrators.\nOn 27 February, criticism of INEC continued with international observers and the Nigeria Labour Congress lambasting the commission's lack of transparency amidst the delays. Similarly, agents of political parties (notably including PDP and LP agents) at the national collation centre protested the prolonged delay in uploading results on iReV, even in states where final results had been announced along with discrepancies in result totals. Meanwhile, final results came in from Adamawa, Enugu, Gombe, Katsina, Kwara, Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, and Yobe by the afternoon. However, the collation centre protests culminated in an agent walkout by the representatives of the LP and PDP alongside multiple other parties' agents.\nBy the early morning of 28 February, more results were reported from Akwa Ibom, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Benue, Cross River, Delta, the Federal Capital Territory, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto, and Zamfara. However, criticism of the process from domestic and international observers continued, with the European Union observer mission noting \"lack of transparency and operational failures\" that \"reduced trust in the process\" while other groups echoed similar displeasure. These reports, along with further disputes over the process, led the campaigns of Abubakar, Obi, and Kwankwaso to fully reject the results of the election on 28 February and call for a new election to be conducted.\nRegardless of protests, Yakubu continued accepting state-by-state results throughout 28 February and into the early hours of 1 March; in this time, the remaining states reported vote totals: Abia, Anambra, Borno, Ebonyi, Edo, Imo, Kebbi, Kogi, and Taraba in addition to notably including the heavily disputed results from Rivers State. After the state results were reported and accepted by the national collation centre, Yakubu stated \"Tinubu Bola Ahmed of the APC, having satisfied the requirements of the law is hereby declared the winner and returned elected\" in the early morning of 1 March. All three major opposing campaigns rejected and vowed to challenge the results.\nCampaign\nIssues\nTimeline\nPre-campaign period\n*28 April 2021: The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announces 18 February 2023 as the election day.\n*10 November 2021: APGA nominee Charles Chukwuma Soludo is declared winner of the off-cycle Anambra State gubernatorial election that took place on 6 November; the PDP and APC nominees come distant second and third places, respectively.\n*28 January 2022: Then-aspirant Bola Tinubu goes to London, reportedly on a medical trip; the trip comes just a few months after Tinubu returned from a three-month medical stay in the United Kingdom.\n*26 February 2022: INEC revises the election date, moving the election to 25 February 2023 and releasing the rest of the electoral timetable.\n*16 March 2022: The Peoples Democratic Party announces its primary schedule, setting 28 and 29 May as its primary days.\n*20 April 2022: The All Progressives Congress announces its primary schedule, setting 30 May and 1 June as its primary days.\n*12 May 2022: In the wake of the Lynching of Deborah Yakubu, then-aspirant Atiku Abubakar is heavily criticized for deleting a tweet condemning the murder.\n*25 May 2022:\n**Then-aspirant Atiku Abubakar releases his five-point governance agenda along with his full policy document.\n**Major PDP aspirant—Peter Obi—withdraws from the party's primary and defects to the Labour Party.\n*27 May 2022: INEC slightly revises its electoral timetable, allowing parties an extra six days to conduct primaries.\n*28 May 2022:\n**The APC revises its primary schedule, delaying the primary to 6–8 June.\n**The PDP holds its primary in Abuja, nominating former Vice President Atiku Abubakar over Nyesom Wike, Bukola Saraki, and nine other candidates.\n*30 May 2022: The LP holds its primary in Asaba, nominating Obi unopposed.\n*7 and 8 June 2022: The APC holds its primary in Abuja, nominating former Governor of Lagos State Bola Tinubu over Rotimi Amaechi, Yemi Osinbajo, and eleven other candidates.\n*16 June 2022: Abubakar picks Ifeanyi Okowa—the Governor of Delta State—as the PDP vice presidential nominee.\n*17 June 2022:\n**Tinubu picks Kabir Ibrahim Masari—a party operative—as the APC placeholder vice presidential nominee to be substituted for someone else at a later date.\n**Obi picks Doyin Okupe—the Obi campaign manager—as the LP placeholder vice presidential nominee to be substituted for someone else at a later date.\n*18 June 2022: Rabiu Kwankwaso, the New Nigeria Peoples Party presidential nominee and the former Governor of Kano State, and Okupe both announce productive discussions between minor parties on forming a coalition for the elections.\n*19 June 2022: APC nominee Abiodun Oyebanji is declared winner of the off-cycle Ekiti State gubernatorial election that took place the day before; the PDP nominee comes a distant third place.\n*24 June 2022: Documentation submitted by Tinubu to INEC is released, revealing that he did not state the primary or secondary school he attended.

For Tinubu, the selection of Ibrahim Masari as a placeholder running mate in mid-June bought the APC several weeks to continue party reconciliation efforts as controversy swirled over the religious affiliation of Tinubu's potential running mates. On the other hand, Abubakar had to contend with a burgeoning party crisis as allies of Governor Nyesom Wike—first runner up in the PDP primary—began to publicly protest against the perceived disrespect towards Wike; their protests centered around Abubakar's disregard for a party committee recommendation of Wike for the vice presidential nomination but some PDP figures also objected to Abubakar in general due to the violation of zoning. The upheaval reached the point of Wike allies publicly questioning if they would support Abubakar and privately threatening to leave the party while national party chairman Iyorchia Ayu's neutrality was questioned and Abubakar himself spent weeks abroad in the midst of the crisis. As the PDP desperately attempted to reconcile Wike and Abubakar, Obi and Kwankwaso held meetings with Wike in an attempt to bring him into their respective parties. These meetings took place as representatives of Obi and Kwankwaso were also meeting in an attempt to form a NNPP-LP coalition; however, these negotiations were derailed in early July when Kwankwaso publicly refused to be Obi's vice presidential running mate on the grounds that northerners would not vote for a southeasterner. A few days later, Obi's campaign announced that the coalition discussions had failed and that the campaign had shifted towards the search for a vice presidential nominee which ended in the selection of Baba-Ahmed. As the LP ticket constituted, the PDP crisis continued as Wike publicly met with several APC governors on 8 July while Abubakar extended his stay abroad despite the party infighting, Eid al-Kabir, and the Osun gubernatorial election campaign in mid-July. For Tinubu, when he finally selected Shettima as his running mate on 10 July, immediate blowback confronted his campaign amid accusations of religious intolerance for the Muslim-Muslim ticket with even some other APC members condemning the ticket. Later in July, Abubakar returned to the nation while Tinubu was in a difficult position as backlash against the APC ticket continued and his relative—incumbent Osun Governor Gboyega Oyetola—lost to PDP nominee Ademola Adeleke in the Osun gubernatorial election; similarly, questions emerged over Labour's weak showings in both Osun and Ekiti. Takeaways from the gubernatorial election focused on the potential impact of the PDP's victory on the presidential race and the extremely successful election administration from INEC. To make matters worse for the Tinubu campaign, the appearance of people wearing liturgical garments of various Christian denominations at Shettima's nomination rally on 20 July led to further backlash since observers noted the group's lack of identification and the Christian Association of Nigeria publicly challenged the APC to name the supposed clergy.\nBy late July and early August, Tinubu and Abubakar continued to face high-profile dissent from within their own parties as prominent northern Christian APC members—like former Secretary to the Government of the Federation Babachir David Lawal and former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara—publicly condemned the same religion APC ticket while Wike and his allies continued their public criticism of Abubakar and PDP leadership. In response, Tinubu appointed Governor of Plateau State Simon Lalong—a northern Christian—as the Director-General of his Campaign Council while in early August, Abubakar and Wike finally met for the first time since Okowa's selection and agreed on a reconciliation framework. However, both the APC and PDP backslid into their respective crises as protests against the APC ticket drew thousands and it continued to come under fire from prominent northern Christians while the opposing camps within the PDP had returned to public squabbling by mid-August. Around the same time, voter registration ended with analysts noting its effect on the race as a whole. The rest of August was dominated by notable meetings as Wike meet with both Tinubu and Obi before another reconciliatory summit with Abubakar; while pundits speculated that Tinubu and Obi attempted to sway Wike to their camps, reporting on the series of Wike-Abubakar talks revealed some of Wike's demands with a focus on the resignation of PDP chairman Iyorchia Ayu. The location of these meetings in London, England sparked controversy as critics labeled the location as insensitive to the plight of Nigerians domestically. Around the same time, observers noted a potential opening for Kwankwaso but even his NNPP devolved into crisis in August as the PDP poached a key Kano State figure from the NNPP amid a threeway fight for the state's massive electorate. Further reporting began to focus on specific states and regions as ThisDay analysis surmised that the PDP was strengthening in previously pro-Buhari states in the North West, the APC was retaining its prime position in the South West but the LP was growing among urban youth, it was Obi vs. Abubakar in the South South and South East, and the North Central was a tossup region. In the weeks afterwards and as candidate profiles were released in preparation for the official campaign period's commencement at the end of September, the PDP desperately attempted to end its crisis by having two northerners holding prominent internal party positions be replaced by southerners but as Ayu remained in office as chairman, Wike continued his public indignation before he and his allies announced their withdrawal from PDP campaigning on 20 September until Ayu left office. Due to the PDP infighting, pundits looking ahead to the campaign period began to speculate on the potential benefits for Tinubu and Obi as several Wike allies are influential in key states. At the same time, the first public poll of the race was released with Obi in the lead; although the campaigns of Abubakar and Tinubu dismissed the results, analysts noted enthusiasm among Obi's base due to his active campaigning as a potential reason for his lead considering both Abubakar and Tinubu devoted more effort to intraparty reconciliation from May to September.\nCampaign period\nAt the end of September, the official campaign period began with the signing of a peace accord in Abuja by nearly all candidates along with parties' national chairmen; notably, Tinubu was absent with Shettima as his representative. During the week, Abubakar and Tinubu formed their campaign councils amid controversy for both as the Wike dispute continued in the PDP while the composition of the APC campaign council led to internal disquiet. For Obi, his campaign received another positive polling result as he led a Bloomberg News-commissioned poll by a massive margin; he was also buoyed by significant nationwide support rallies on Independence Day but faced difficulties in campaign organizing as his manifesto and campaign council were delayed. Overall, late September and early October was categorized similarly to the pre-campaign period time, with analysis repeatedly noting that Obi was solidifying support and enthusiasm while Abubakar and Tinubu were occupied trying to stop further intraparty rebellion.}} However, Obi promptly faced scandal due to the controversial initial makeup of his campaign council which forced a retraction and review after backlash from supporters and the LP. A few days later, the race was derailed by a video of Abubakar calling for northerners to reject Yoruba or Igbo candidates; the comment met with widespread condemnation by civil society organisations and opposing campaigns for stoking ethnic divisions. Meanwhile, Tinubu and the APC revised their campaign council to address internal objections before holding a formal campaign commencement on 21 October where Buhari unveiled Tinubu's manifesto before inaugurating the campaign council. Around the same time, campaigning focused on catastrophic nationwide floods with analysts noting that the floods had put more focus on climate change and wider environmental policy issues amid the campaign period. Obi preparations concluded near the end of the month, as the revised LP campaign council was inaugurated on 28 October and the campaign's commencement rally held the next day.\nAt the start of November, debates began with a series of multi-candidate town halls hosted by Arise News and the Centre for Democracy and Development commencing on 6 November; with a focus on security and the economy, the four most prominent candidates were invited—Abubakar, Kwankwaso, Obi, and Tinubu—but Abubakar sent Okowa as his proxy while Tinubu declined the invitation and was replaced by Kola Abiola, the nominee of the People's Redemption Party. Amid the town halls, controversy swirled for Tinubu as the publication of certified documents from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois detailing his 1993 forfeiture of alleged drug dealing proceeds led to attacks from Obi and Abubakar while the Tinubu campaign claimed that the money was tax-related and analysts speculated on the documents' effect on voting intentions. Meanwhile, Abubakar faced mixed news as the PDP crisis continued with Wike-led, anti-Abubakar PDP governors forming the \"Integrity Group\" and a rift forming with another incumbent governor in mid-November; on the other hand, a northern APC dissenter group led by former House Speaker Yakubu Dogara endorsed Abubakar on 2 December. Previously, Obi led another poll as a Nextier survey of rural communities released in mid-November showed him in the lead with over 40%. At the beginning of December, various state LP chapters entered crisis but Obi avoided involvement and instead released his oft-delayed manifesto with seven key policy areas. The manifesto release came just before another Arise-CDD town hall; however, Tinubu had announced his boycott of the event due to alleged media bias so only Abubakar, Obi, and Kwankwaso attended on 4 December.\nLater in December, the Obi campaign was hit by a court ruling against its Director-General—Doyin Okupe, convicting him of money laundering in connection to the 2015 Dasukigate scandal. Although Okupe appealed the judgment, the controversy led to his resignation from the campaign with journalist Akin Osuntokun replacing him. Meanwhile, the reporting revealed that \"Integrity Group\" were deliberating over which candidate to endorse at their London meetings in late December; a side attendee of the meetings—former President Olusegun Obasanjo—reportedly advised the group to endorse Obi, which Obasanjo himself later did in a public letter on New Year's Day. Into the new year, analysis shifted to review the chances of each major candidate as the prospect of a runoff looked increasingly possible. While pundits initially contended that Tinubu would benefit from the campaign support of Buhari and the \"federal might\" of his administration, questions arose over the relationship between Buhari and Tinubu after Buhari skipped several campaign events and defended the controversial new naira notes that Tinubu claimed were an attempt to disrupt his campaign. For Abubakar, reporting focused on two corruption scandals along with his nationwide campaigning (especially in the North). Observers reiterated that Kwankwaso had not appeared to make significant headway outside of his native North West while reports claimed Obi's chances were based on his campaign's ability to successfully turnout voters in the South East in addition to geographically broadening his support across the nation despite the lack of significant LP party structure.\nThe final month of the campaign period was dominated by the naira crisis and its political implications. The new banknote policy of Buhari and CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele was intended to curb vote buying ahead of the election but poor implementation led to shortages of the new currency. Tinubu and several prominent APC figures publicly broke with Buhari for some of the first times over the policy, first suing to stop its enactment then lambasting the administration after Buhari stood by the policy. For the PDP, the G5 failed to publicize their joint preferred candidate and appeared to split as Benue Governor Samuel Ortom endorsed Obi while Wike reportedly backed Tinubu. For his part, Abubakar focused on his economic plans and national unity in his final campaign stops rather than party divisions. Similarly, Obi rounded out the campaign with large rallies in Lagos that spotlighted his support of reforms to fight corruption and create jobs; however, the events were marred by violence as mass coordinated attacks on LP supporters before the rallies reinforced fears of further violence on election day. As the campaigns concluded, focus returned to polling as releases from Nextier, Stears, Premise Data for Bloomberg, NIO Polls for the Anap Foundation, and Redfield & Wilton Strategies all issued polls in the months of January and February that showed Obi in the lead and sparking discourse on the surge of polling compared to previous elections. In addition to polling, Stears notably created a predictive model that estimated that Obi would win by a significant margin if voter turnout was high while low turnout would lead to a Tinubu victory. To end the campaign, all candidates signed another peace accord at an Abuja event attended by Buhari, Abubakar, Obi, Kwankwaso, and Tinubu in addition to other candidates and major political figures on 23 February, the final day of the campaign period.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Polling organisation/client\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Fieldworkdate\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Samplesize\n!\n!\n!\n!\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Others\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Undecided\n! rowspan=\"3\" |None/No response/Refused\n|-\n!TinubuAPC\n!ObiLP\n!KwankwasoNNPP\n!AbubakarPDP\n|-\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n! style=\"background:\" |\n|-\n| [https://www.anapfoundation.com/press-releases/a-3-horse-presidential-race-and-a-lone-outsider NIO Polls for Anap Foundation]\n|September 2022\n|1,000\n|13%\n|21%\n|3%\n|13%\n|1%\n||32%\n|17%\n|-\n| [https://www.premise.com/blog/nigeria-electoral-sentiment/ Premise Data for Bloomberg]\n|5–20 September 2022\n|3,027\n|16%\n||72%\n|–\n|9%\n|4%\n|–\n|–\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:#CECECE;\" |Commencement of the official campaign period.

With a focus on security and the economy, the four most prominent candidates were invited—Abubakar, Kwankwaso, Obi, and Tinubu—but Abubakar sent Okowa as his proxy while Tinubu declined the invitation and was replaced by Kola Abiola, the nominee of the People's Redemption Party. The non-attendance sparked controversy as Abubakar and Tinubu were criticized for non-engagement with public debates by the Obi campaign which later vowed to boycott events without the presence of Abubakar or Tinubu. During the debate, Obi labeled poverty as a key source of violence and attacked the incumbent administration on security failures while vowing to remove fuel subsidies; Okowa backed the creation of state police forces along with targeted job creation methods; Kwankwaso identified educational failures as a cause of both insecurity and economic issues; and Abiola labeled poor leadership as a key factor in security failures.\nThe Arise-CDD series continued with a minor candidate town hall on 14 November where alternative security methods and the economy dominated discussion. Although a Nigerian Economic Summit Group-hosted economic debate was scheduled for the next day, it was canceled due to \"prevailing circumstances.\" Major candidates returned on 4 December to the Arise-CDD series with Obi, Kwankwaso, and Abubakar but Tinubu publicly declined the invitation and accused Arise of biased unprofessionalism. Despite Tinubu's absence, the town hall went ahead with a focus on education, healthcare, poverty, and human capital development—all three candidates lamented poor educational quality and brain drain with Obi targeting low investment in education as the source of the issue. Notably, when asked if they would commit to using Nigerian health services, Abubakar refused while Obi and Kwankwaso acceded. A few weeks later in January, a Nigerian Elections Debate Group-organized debate set for 26 January was postponed due to logistical problems; the debate was instead held on 12 February. Despite inviting all four major candidates, only Kwankwaso and Obi confirmed their attendance; however, technical issues with the Obi campaign airplane prevented him from attending and left just Kwankwaso to answer questions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ 2023 Nigerian presidential election debates and town halls\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Date\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Organisers\n! colspan=\"11\"|    &nbsp;}}   &nbsp;}}   &nbsp;}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| ADP\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| AAC\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| APC\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| APGA\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| LP\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| NNPP\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| PDP\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| PRP\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| SDP\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\"| Other parties\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n! style=\"background:;\"|\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| 6 November 2022\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| Arise News and the CDD\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#FF9090;\"| A\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| }}\n| }}\n| style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\"| S\n| style=\"background:#b2fad5;\"| R\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n|\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| 14 November 2022\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| Arise News and the CDD\n| }}\n| }}\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| }}\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| }}\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n|\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"|\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| NESG and NEDG\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#ffffdd;\"| N\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#ffffdd;\"| N\n| style=\"background:#ffffdd;\"| N\n| style=\"background:#ffffdd;\"| N\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n|\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| 4 December 2022\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| Arise News and the CDD\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#FF9090;\"| A\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n|\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| 12 February 2023\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; text-align:left;\"| NEDG\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#FF9090;\"| A\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#FF9090;\"| A\n| }}\n| style=\"background:#FF9090;\"| A\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n| style=\"background:#A2B2C2;\"| NI\n|\n|}\nProjections\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:92%; line-height:1.2; width:1em\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom\"\n!
