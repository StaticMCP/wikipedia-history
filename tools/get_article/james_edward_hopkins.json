In 1908, he was elected to the California State Assembly on a Democratic-Union Labor-Independence League ticket. He did not stand for re-election in 1910.\nIn 1910, Hopkins was made a Deputy Sheriff of San Francisco. On August 30, he accidentally shot and killed fellow Deputy Walter J. Bryant. He was arrested on murder charges, but was exonerated the next day after multiple witnesses came to his defense.\nHopkins continued his career in organized labor after leaving the Assembly, joining the executive board of the state Federation of Labor in 1912. He served in that position for twenty-four years before being elected President in March 1936.\nA self-described \"ultra-conservative\" dedicated to fighting radicalism within the ranks of organized labor, Hopkins nonetheless called for the repeal of the California Criminal Syndicalism Act. His term as President ended in September 1937.\nHopkins died of a heart attack at his San Francisco home on March 19, 1939.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.joincalifornia.com/candidate/11683 Join California James Edward Hopkins]"
