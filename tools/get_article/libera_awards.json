First hosted in 2012, the awards celebrate the independent music community. The capstone of A2IM's Indie Week, an annual music business conference, the ceremony has been able to be viewed by the public since 2020.\nThe top-billed awards are generally Record of the Year and Best Live Act, in addition to Label of the Year, Best Sync Usage, and Video of the Year, among others. In addition to the awards which are voted on, A2IM annually confers the Lifetime Achievement and Independent Icon Awards to industry leaders and artists, respectively.\nList of ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Overview of Libera Awards ceremonies\n!scope=\"col\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Venue\n!scope=\"col\"|Broadcast\n!scope=\"col\"|Host\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2012\n|June 21\n|Le Poisson Rouge\n| rowspan=\"8\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |John Ross Bowie\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2013\n|June 20\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Highline Ballroom\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2014\n|June 20\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2015\n|June 25\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2016\n|June 16\n|Manhattan Center\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ted Leo\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2017\n|June 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" |PlayStation Theater\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2018\n|June 21\n|Kate Wolff\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2019\n|June 20\n|Ziegfeld Theatre\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Chris Gethard\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2020\n|June 18\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |YouTube\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2021\n|June 17\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2022\n| June 16\n|Webster Hall\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2023\n| June 15\n| Town Hall\n| Hannibal Buress\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2024\n| June 10\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Gotham Hall\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|2025\n| June 9\n|-\n|}\nAward categories\nNote: the names of most categories have been tweaked overtime with the most significant name changes indicated below.
