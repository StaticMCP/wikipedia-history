It was first awarded following the inauguration of President Joe Biden in 2021.\nHistory\nIn response to the Capitol Hill riot on January 6, 2021, elements from the National Guard of all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia were mobilized to enhance security before, during, and after the 2021 Presidential Inauguration.[https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/05/guard-members-who-deployed-inauguration-are-getting-brand-new-award.html Guard Members Who Deployed for the Inauguration Are Getting a Brand-New Award | Military.com]\nCriteria\nThe ribbon is presently authorized for any National Guard personnel from any state, territory or the District of Columbia who deployed to the area before, during, or after the 59th U.S. Presidential Inauguration on Title 32 orders. Future periods of inaugural support will also establish eligibility for wear of the ribbon.
