As a player, he first came to prominence during the 1928/29 season. His record-breaking performances on the 1930 tour of England made him a national hero in Australia. Bradman was a private person who did not enjoy the adulation associated with his fame. In cricket, a batsman who enjoys an exceptional run of form over an extended period is sometimes called Bradmanesque.\nBradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world.\nCoins and stamps\nIn 1997, Australia Post issued two stamps depicting Bradman, the first living Australian to be so featured. The issue was part of a series entitled \"Australian Legends\". Another stamp featuring Bradman was issued in March 2001, after his death.\nIn 2001, the platypus was replaced by an image of Bradman on the obverse side of the Australia's common 20-cent coin, the first such change since the decimalisation of Australian currency in 1966. The Commonwealth Treasury issued three limited edition legal-tender coins in 2001 as a posthumous tribute to Bradman's career.\nFilm\nThe story of the Bodyline series was retold in the 1984 television miniseries Bodyline, in which Hugo Weaving played Douglas Jardine and Gary Sweet played Don Bradman.\nBradman appeared as himself in the 1936 film The Flying Doctor.\nIn 1996, journalist Ray Martin interviewed Bradman in a Channel 9 programme called Bradman: 87 Not Out, so named because Bradman was 87 at the time. It included his wife Lady Jessie Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar, and was later released on VHS.\nLandmarks\n*The Bradman Stand at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dedicated in 1974.\n*The Bradman Oval in Bowral was opened in 1976.\n*The Bradman Stand at the Adelaide Oval was dedicated in 1990. It was subsequently demolished as part of a redevelopment before 2014.

The ABC's mailing address in every capital city of Australia is PO Box 9994. There is some debate about whether the story is true, but ABC sports host Karen Tighe confirms that the number was in fact chosen in honour of Bradman, and the claim is also supported by Alan Eason in his book The A–Z of Bradman. However, the broadcaster was not assigned the box number until after Moses's successor, Sir Talbot Duckmanton, had retired. The ABC's national toll-free telephone number is 13 9994.\nIn 2000, the Australian Government made it illegal for the names of corporations to suggest a link to \"Sir Donald Bradman\", if such a link does not in fact exist. Other entities with similar protection are the Australian and foreign governments, the Royal Family, and ex-servicemen's organisations.\nDon Bradman Cricket 14, a video game for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows was released in 2014.\nReferences"
