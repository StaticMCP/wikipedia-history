The Queensland Steam Shipping Company was  formed by the British India Steam Navigation Company with Charles Parbury, James Burns and McIlwraith McEacharn & Company with headquarters in Brisbane. The company was registered in London in August 1881.\nInitially the company offers a service from Brisbane to Mackay, Townsville, Cairns, Port Douglas and Cooktown. In September 1882, the company spent £25,000 to purchase the Tasmanian Wharf in Sydney to extend their services to Sydney.\nLater the company extended their services to Normanton, Burketown, Thursday Island and New Guinea.\nOn 30 May 1884, two of the company's ships, the Archer and Taldora collided in Moreton Bay. Although it was a serious collision, fortunately there were no deaths or serious injuries. The Marine Board inquiry censured Captain Lowries of the Archer for making in error of judgement in navigation.\nThe shipping company was amalgamated with the Australasian Steam Navigation Company with their respective vessels in 1887 to form the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company.\nShips\nThe company's first ship was the SS Gunga (189 tons net).\nLater ships were:\n* SS Corea (606 tons gross, 382 tons net, built 1883)\n* SS Archer (694 tons gross,  440 tons net, built 1883)\n* SS Polly (194 tons gross, 89 tons net, built 1883)\n* SS Truganini (203 tons gross 130 tons net, built 1876)\n* SS Gympie (126 tons net, purchased 1883)\n* SS Warrego (1,552 tons gross, 857 tons net, built 1883)\n* SS Maranoa (1,505 tons gross, 805 tons net, built 1883)\n* SS Barcoo (1,505 tons gross, 745 tons net, built 1885)\n* SS Taldora (232 tons gross, 126 tons net, built about 1881–1882)\nReferences"
