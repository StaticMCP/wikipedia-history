Zimbabwe's largest ethnic group is Shona.\nHistory\nThe roots of Zimbabwean civilisation stretch far back in time, weaving a tapestry of cultural and political innovation. The tale begins with the Bantu-speaking farmers, who, during the Iron Age, traversed the Limpopo River, infusing the region with new agricultural techniques and ironworking skills (Beach, 1994). These migrants forged the foundation of early Zimbabwe, a cultural legacy evidenced today by the imposing stone walls of Great Zimbabwe, an architectural marvel that stood as the nerve centre of an influential precolonial state, flourishing between the 11th and 15th centuries (Fontein, 2006).\nGreat Zimbabwe, which gave the modern nation its name, was a political and economic powerhouse, its influence rippling throughout Southern Africa. The city was part of an extensive trading network, exchanging gold, ivory, copper, and iron for luxury goods from as far afield as China and the Persian Gulf, a testament to the globalised world of medieval commerce (Chirikure, 2018). Its ruins, which remain amongst the largest stone structures in Southern Africa, embody the zenith of precolonial Zimbabwean cultural and architectural sophistication.\nSource: Beach, D. N. (1994).

Springer International Publishing.\nThe arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century marked the beginning of foreign intervention in Zimbabwe. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries penetrated the hinterland, seeking gold and converts, respectively, but it was not until the late 19th century that European incursions had a seismic impact on the region. The advent of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company heralded a new era, as his charter with Queen Victoria granted the company comprehensive administrative and economic control over the region - a stark departure from the sovereignty known by the likes of Great Zimbabwe (Palmer, 1977).\nRhodes' legacy is fraught with controversy, emblematic of the era's imperialism and the grievous repercussions for indigenous populations. Land was appropriated, local governance structures undermined, and the native Shona and Ndebele peoples consigned to an existence of subjugation and exploitation (Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2009). The forced labour and taxation policies imposed by the British South Africa Company fomented discontent, culminating in the Chimurenga, or First War of Liberation, a vehement but ultimately vanquished resistance against colonial rule (Ranger, 1985).\nSource: Palmer, R.

Gweru: Mambo Press.\nFast forward to the 20th century, and Zimbabwe's quest for independence intensified. The 1960s and 70s were decades of convulsion, as African nationalist movements challeneged colonial rule throughout the continent. In Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was then known, two main liberation movements, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), orchestrated a protracted guerrilla warfare against the minority white government led by Ian Smith, who had unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 in a bid to prevent black majority rule (Meredith, 2002).\nThe Liberation War, or Second Chimurenga, was bitter and prolonged, with neighbouring countries providing sanctuary and support for Zimbabwean nationalists. The conflict wore on until the Lancaster House Agreement was signed in 1979, a negotiated settlement that finally paved the way for free elections and the establishment of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980, with ZANU leader Robert Mugabe assuming the mantle of Prime Minister (Sibanda, 2005).\nSource: Meredith, M.

Initially, Mugabe implemented policies of reconciliation, infrastructure development, and education, culminating in significant advancements and a burgeoning economy. However, in the subsequent years, political repression grew, economic mismanagement took its toll, and the controversial land reform program at the turn of the millennium led to international sanctions, hyperinflation, and a dramatic decline in living standards (Raftopoulos & Mlambo, 2009). Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans have demonstrated remarkable fortitude, contributing to the arts, sport, and academia with steadfast vigour.\nSource: Raftopoulos, B., & Mlambo, A. (2009).

Its early societies set the stage for a state that would withstand the test of time. The colonial experience, while devastating, did not obliterate the enduring spirit of the Zimbabwean people. Independence, hard-fought and dearly won, has meant navigating the complexities of self-governance, grappling with legacies of inequality, and contending with the pressures of global politics. As Zimbabwe continues to evolve, its history remains a mirror through which its future is both reflected and shaped.\nLanguage\nZimbabwe has 16 official languages, Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, \"Koisan\" (presumably Tsoa), Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, \"sign language\" (Zimbabwean sign languages), Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda, and Xhosa. Much of the population speaks Bantu languages, such as Shona (chishona) (76%) and Ndebele (18%). Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, Feso by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1957. English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas. Education in Zimbabwe is taught in English, Shona and Ndebele. Many rural primary schools teach in the native language until grade three; then, school is taught in English.\nFood\nLike in many African countries, a majority of Zimbabweans depend on staple foods. \"Mealie meal\", or cornmeal as it is known in other parts of the world, is used to prepare bota, a porridge made by mixing cornmeal with water, to make a thick paste. This is usually flavored with butter or peanut butter. Bota is usually eaten for breakfast. Cornmeal is also used to make sadza, which is usually eaten for dinner, and by many for lunch too. The process of making sadza is similar to bota; however, after the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste until it is firm. This meal is usually served with vegetables (spinach, chou moellier, or spring greens/collard greens), beans, and meat (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with boerewors (a sausage made from beef or pork), chicken, or curdled milk (sour milk), commonly known as \"lacto\" (mukaka wakakora or \"amasi\"). Rice and chicken with coleslaw salad is often served as the main meal. Graduations, weddings, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat, sheep, or cow, which will be braaied (or barbecued) for the gathered family.\nSince Zimbabwe was a British colony, they have adopted some English habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, but they will still have 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, which can be leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.\nArt\nTraditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery, basketry, textiles, jewelry and carving. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture in modern times has become a fusion of African folklore with European influences. It is widely respected across the globe and it itself has had an impact on the global sculpture scene since at least the 1980s. A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. Cartwark, M. is of the view that, A number of finely carved soapstone figures have been found which include eight representations of birds perched on monoliths over one metre (39 inches) in height. The bird is known as the Zimbabwe Bird and does not resemble any bird in nature; it appears on the flag of the country today. Such artefacts as the soapstone figures hint at the ritual nature of the Great Zimbabwe site. Other sculptures include cattle and nude highly-stylised female figures. Simple unglazed pottery of very good quality was produced - very often given a graphite covering and then polished. Forms include gourd-shaped vessels with distinctive hatched triangular decorations, small disks of uncertain purpose, and models of huts.\nAmong members of the white minority community, theatre has a large following, with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe's urban areas.\nThe country's art is admired by those that know of its existence, and several Zimbabwean artists have managed to gain a world audience. To name some world-famous Zimbabwean sculptors, we have Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi, and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly African Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists, including New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.\nZimbabwe's cultural wall is the durawall.\nSee also\n* Architecture of Zimbabwe\n* Balancing rocks of Zimbabwe\n* Education in Zimbabwe\n* Reps Theatre and Over the Edge (Zimbabwe Theatrical Companies)\n* Music of Zimbabwe\n* Rhodesiana\nReferences\n* Cartwright, Mark. \"Great Zimbabwe.\" World History Encyclopedia.
