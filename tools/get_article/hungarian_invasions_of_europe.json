The westward raids were stopped only with the Magyar defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, which led to the revival of the Holy Roman Empire in 962, producing a new political order in Western Europe. The raids into Byzantine territories continued throughout the 10th century, until the eventual Christianisation of the Magyars and the establishment of the Christian Kingdom of Hungary in 1000.\nHistory\nBefore the conquest of Hungary (9th century)\nThe first supposed reference to the Hungarians in war is in the 9th century: in 811, the Hungarians (Magyars) were in alliance with Krum of Bulgaria against Emperor Nikephoros I possibly at the Battle of Pliska in the Haemus Mountains (Balkan Mountains). Georgius Monachus' work mentions that around 837 the Bulgarian Empire sought an alliance with the Hungarians. Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote in his work On Administering the Empire that the Khagan and the Bek of the Khazars asked the Emperor Theophilos to have the fortress of Sarkel built for them. This record is thought to refer to the Hungarians on the basis that the new fortress must have become necessary because of the appearance of a new enemy of the Khazars, and no other people could have been the Khazars’ enemy at that time. In the 10th century, Ahmad ibn Rustah wrote that \"earlier, the Khazars entrenched themselves against the attacks of the Magyars and other peoples\".\nIn 860–861, Hungarians attacked Saint Cyril's convoy, but the meeting is said to have ended peacefully. (Saint Cyril was traveling to the Khagan at (or near) Chersonesos Taurica, which had been captured by the Khazars.)\nMuslim geographers recorded that the Magyars regularly attacked the neighboring East Slavic tribes in this period, and took captives to sell to the Byzantine Empire at Kerch. There are descriptions of Hungarian raids into the eastern Carolingian Empire in 862.\nIn 881, the Hungarians and the Kabars invaded East Francia and fought two battles, the former (Ungari) at Wenia (probably Vienna) and the latter (Cowari) at Culmite (possibly Kulmberg or Kollmitz in Austria). In 892, according to the Annales Fuldenses, King Arnulf of East Francia invaded Great Moravia, and the Magyars joined his troops. After 893, Magyar warriors were conveyed across the Danube by the Byzantine fleet and defeated the Bulgarians in three battles (at the Danube, Silistra, and Preslav). In 894, the Magyars invaded Pannonia in alliance with King Svatopluk I of Moravia.\nAfter the conquest of Hungary (10th century)\nAround 896, probably under the leadership of Árpád, the Hungarians (Magyars) crossed the Carpathians and entered the Carpathian Basin (the plains of Hungary, approximately).\nIn 899, these Magyars defeated Berengar's army in the Battle of Brenta River and invaded the northern regions of Italy. They pillaged the countryside around Treviso, Vicenza, Verona, Brescia, Bergamo and Milan, defeating Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia. In 901, they attacked Italy again. In 902, they led a campaign against northern Moravia and defeated the Moravians, whose country was annihilated. In almost every year of the 10th century, they conducted raids against the Catholic west and Byzantine east. However, in 905, the Magyars and King Berengar formed an amicitia, and fifteen years passed without Hungarian troops entering Italy.\nThe Magyars defeated three large Frankish imperial armies between 907 and 910, as follows. In 907 they defeated the invading Bavarians near Brezalauspurc, destroying their army, successfully defending Hungary and laying Great Moravia, Germany, France and Italy open to Magyar raids. On 3 August 908 the Hungarians won the Battle of Eisenach in Thuringia; Egino, Duke of Thuringia was killed in this battle, along with Burchard, Duke of Thuringia, and Rudolf I, Bishop of Würzburg. Finally, the Magyars defeated Louis the Child's united Frankish imperial army at the first Battle of Lechfeld in 910.\nSmaller groups of Magyars penetrated as far as Bremen in 915. In 919, after the death of Conrad I of Germany, the Magyars raided Saxony, Lotharingia, and West Francia. In 921, they defeated King Berengar's enemies at Verona and reached Apulia in 922. Between 917 and 925, the Magyars raided through Basel, Alsace, Burgundy, Provence, and the Pyrenees.\nAround 925, according to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea from the late 12th century, Tomislav of Croatia defeated the Magyars in battle; others question the reliability of this account, because there is no proof of this interpretation in other records.\nIn 926, they ravaged Swabia and Alsace, campaigned through present-day Luxembourg, and reached as far as the Atlantic Ocean. In 927, Peter, brother of Pope John X, called on the Magyars to rule Italy. They marched into Rome and imposed large tribute payments on Tuscany and Tarento. In 933, a substantial Magyar army appeared in Saxony (the pact with the Saxons having expired) but was defeated by Henry I at Merseburg. Magyar attacks continued against Upper Burgundy (in 935) and against Saxony (in 936). In 937, they raided France as far west as Reims, Lotharingia, Swabia, Franconia, the Duchy of Burgundy and Italy as far as Otranto in the south. They attacked Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire, reaching the walls of Constantinople. The Byzantines paid them a “tax” for 15 years. In 938, the Magyars repeatedly attacked Saxony. In 940, they ravaged the region of Rome. In 942, Hungarian raids on Spain, particularly in Catalonia, took place, according to Ibn Hayyan's work. In 947, Bulcsú, a chieftain of Taksony, led a raid into Italy as far as Apulia, and King Berengar II of Italy had to buy peace by paying a large amount of money to him and his followers.\nThe Battle of Lechfeld in 955, in which the Magyars lost approximately 5,000 warriors, finally checked their expansion, although raids on the Byzantine Empire continued until 970. (Lechfeld is south of Augsburg in present-day southern Germany.)\nBetween 899 and 970, according to the contemporary sources, the researchers count 45 (according to Nagy Kálmán) or 47 (according to Szabados György 38 to West and 9 to East) raids in different parts of Europe. From these campaigns only 8 (17.5%) were unsuccessful (901, 913, 933, 943, 948, 951, 955, 970) and 37 ended with success (82.5%).\nFile:Pál Vágó (1853-1928) painter The Hungarian at Kiev (1896-99).jpg|The Hungarians at Kiev'' (Pál Vágó, 1896–99)\nFile:Hungarian warrior.jpg|Fresco about a Hungarian warrior (Italy)\nFile:Europe around 900.jpg|Europe around 900\nFile:ArpadstatueHerosSquareBudapest.jpg|Grand Prince Árpád's sculpture in Budapest\nFile:Hungarian_warriors.jpg|Hungarian warriors (oil on canvas)\nTimeline of the Hungarian invasions\nBefore the Hungarian Conquest\n* 811: The Hungarians were in alliance with Krum of Bulgaria against Emperor Nikephoros I at the Battle of Pliska in the Haemus Mountains (Balkan Mountains).\n* 839: The Hungarians, who then lived east of the Carpathians, in Etelköz, fought in the Lower Danube at the request of the First Bulgarian Empire against Byzantine insurgents.\n* 861: Saint Cyril was attacked in Crimea by Hungarians \"screaming like wolves\", but seeing him praying, they became peaceful.\n* 862: First raid of the Hungarians in the Carpathian Basin at the request of Rastislav of Moravia against East Francia.\n* c. 870: al-Djayhani and Ahmad ibn Rustah wrote that the Hungarian tribes attacked the Slavs who lived near their borders, winning many small battles, and took many of them to Kerch in Crimea to sell to the Byzantines as slaves.\n* 881: Hungarian troops, helping the Moravians, fought two battles against the Germans.\n* 882: The Hungarian ruler met with Saints Cyril and Methodius on the Lower Danube.\n* 892: Hungarian troops attacked Great Moravia in alliance with the East Francian king Arnulf of Carinthia.\n* 894\n** In alliance with Svatopluk I of Moravia, the Hungarians attacked the East Francian province of Pannonia.

A Hungarian army, led by Liüntika, defeated the Bulgarian army in three battles (at the Danube, Silistra and Preslav), and forced Simeon to retreat to Silistra.\n* 895: Simeon allied with the Pechenegs to attack the Hungarians, forcing them to retreat west towards the Carpathian Basin. The Hungarians then conquered the eastern parts of the Carpathian Basin (those east of the river Danube). Then, the Hungarians defeated the Bulgarians in Southern Transylvania and Tiszántúl, ending their power in the Carpathian Basin.\nAfter the Hungarian Conquest\n* 899: Hungarians attacked the Italian Kingdom, and defeated the army of Berengar I of Italy on 24 September, in the Battle of Brenta, burning Modena, and attacking Venice.

After this he became a faithful ally of the Hungarians, paying them tribute, like his neighbour, Burchard II, Duke of Swabia.\n** Hungarians allegedly helped Simeon I of Bulgaria to defeat the Byzantines in the great Battle of Achelous, but their involvement was described by a single 11th-century source, Miracula Sancti Georgii, which is inconsistent with contemporary records.\n* 919–920\n** After the election of Henry the Fowler as the new king of East Francia, a Hungarian army entered Germany, and defeated Henry's forces in the Battle of Püchen, then headed west into Lotharingia and modern France. King Charles the Simple could not gather enough forces to face them in a battle, forcing him to retreat and allow them to plunder his realm.\n** Early in 920, this Hungarian army entered Burgundy from the west, then Lombardy, and defeated the forces of Rudolf II of Burgundy, who had attacked Berengar I of Italy, the ally of the Principality of Hungary. After that, the Magyars plundered those Italian cities which they believed had supported Rudolf: Bergamo, Piacenza and Nogara.\n* 921–922\n** In 921 a Hungarian army led by Dursac and Bogát entered Northern Italy, annihilating between Brescia and Verona, the forces of the Italian supporters of Rudolf II of Burgundy, killing the palatine Odelrik, and taking captive Gislebert, the count of Bergamo.\n** This army proceeded into southern Italy, where it wintered, and in January 922 plundered the regions between Rome and Naples.\n** February 4: The Magyar army assailed Apulia in Southern Italy, ruled by the Byzantines.\n* 924\n** Campaign in Italy and Southern France\n*** Spring: Rudolf II of Burgundy was elected king of Italy in Pavia by the Italian insurgents .

They returned home because a plague broke out among them.\n** Campaign in Saxony\n*** Another Hungarian army plundered Saxony. The German king Henry the Fowler retreated to the castle of Werla. A Hungarian noble happened to be captured by the Germans, which King Henry used as an opportunity to negotiate peace with the Hungarians, agreeing to pay tribute to the Principality of Hungary.\n* 926\n** May 1–8: Hungarian armies entered Swabia, as allies of the new Italian king, Hugh of Italy, besieged Augsburg, and then occupied the Abbey of Sankt Gallen, where they spared the life of the monk Heribald, whose accounts give a detailed description of their traditions and way of life. From the abbey they sent minor units to reconnoiter and plunder the surroundings, one of which killed Saint Wiborada who lived as anchoress in a wood nearby.\n** After May 8: The Magyars besieged Konstanz, burning its outskirts, then headed West in the direction of Schaffhausen and Basel. One group was defeated by the locals at Säckingen on the shores of the Rhine. However, the main Hungarian army crossed the Rhine into Alsace with captured ships, and defeated the forces of Count Liutfred.

Paul K. Davis writes, the \"Magyar defeat (at the Battle of Lechfeld) ended more than 90 years of their pillaging western Europe and convinced survivors to settle down, creating the basis for the state of Hungary.\" In the following centuries, the Hungarians adopted western European forms of feudal military organization, including the predominant use of heavily armored cavalry.\nSources\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://mek.oszk.hu/09100/09132/09132.pdf Hungary in the Carpathian Basin]"
