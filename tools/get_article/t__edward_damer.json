The book defines and explains 60 of the most commonly committed fallacies. It also gives specific suggestions about how to address or to \"attack\" each fallacy when it is encountered. The organization of the fallacies comes from the author's own theories that have accumulated through years of research and study, which defines a fallacy as a violation of one of the five criteria of a good argument.\nSee also\n*Argumentation\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ehc.edu/t-edward-damer Home page]"
