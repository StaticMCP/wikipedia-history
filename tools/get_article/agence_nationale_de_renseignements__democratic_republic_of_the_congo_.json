The role of the agency is to ensure \"internal security and external security\" of the state. The agency was strongly criticized for the disrespect of human rights by several organisations. Inzun Kakiak has led the agency since 2019.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn 1993 the administrative director of the Service national d'identification et de protection (SNIP) was Admiral Mavua Mudima, who became defense minister in the 1996-1997 Kengo wa Dondo government. In November 1993 Admiral Mavua was replaced by his assistant, Goga wa Dondo, a half-brother of prime minister Kengo wa Dondo. Goga wa Dondo was replaced in November 1995 by his assistant, Atundu.\nOn February 13, 1996, Zaire handed to the Rwandan government rusting artillery pieces, troop carriers, arms and ammunition seized from fleeing Hutu former Rwandan government troops at the end of Rwanda's 1994 genocide. Zairean Defence Minister Admiral Mavua Mudima handed over the weapons in a ceremony near the northwestern Rwandan border with Zaire. The weapons included two 105&nbsp;mm howitzers, one without its barrel, four anti-aircraft guns and six dusty French-made armoured personnel carriers with flat tyres and smashed windows.\nHistorically, the intelligence organisation in the DRCongo or Zaire from 1960 to 1997 was named:\n* Surêté Nationale (SN) (National security) – 1960–1970\n* Centre National de Documentation (CND) (National Documentation Center) – 1970 – November 1985\n* Agence Nationale de Documentation (AND) (National Documentation Agency) – November 1985 – August 1990\n* Service National d'Intelligence et de Protection (SNIP) (National Service for Intelligence and Protection) – August 1990 – 1996\n* Direction Générale de la Surêté Nationale (DGSN) – 1996 – May 1997\nFormation and early years\nThe ANR was created in the beginning of 1997 as an intelligence service of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL). In May 1997, the agency integrated the premises of the former Service national d'intelligence et de protection (SNIP), which had been renamed Direction générale de la sûreté nationale (DGSN) in 1996.\nOn 16 April 1997 Mudima accompanied by General Baramoto Kpama fled the collapsing Mobutu regime, flying to South Africa aboard Baramoto's private jet.\nOn 13 December 1997, three former senior Mobutu officers (Admiral Mavua Mudima accompanied by Baramoto Kpama, and Nzimbi Nzale) were briefly detained in South Africa after returning from Kahemba, an area still controlled by UNITA forces and awash with ex-FAZ and Hutu militiamen. Their arrest may have pre-empted a coup attempt.\nIn October 2002, Georges Leta Mangasa, the chairman of ANR, was sentenced to death with other persons in the course of Laurent-Désiré Kabila's assassination.\nBefore this, in 2001, the interim president, Joseph Kabila, appointed Kazadi Nyembwe for the chair of the ANR.\nHuman rights violations accusations\nThe agency has come under criticism under the tenure of Kalev Mutond (Mutondo). Human Rights Watch has accused it of being \"instrument of political repression against opposition leaders and human rights and pro-democracy activists during the country's protracted political crisis.\" Specifically they accuse Mutondo of using the organization to repress political dissent in 2016 around the time that then president Joseph Kabila was remaining in office beyond his constitutional limit. Accusations include those of harassment and torture.\nManagement\nThe National Intelligence Agency is headed by a General Manager (Administrateur Général), who directly depends on the president. He is assisted in his task by a Deputy General Manager and senior administrators.
