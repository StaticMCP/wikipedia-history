It was entered into the 30th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize.\nPlot\nFor the first time in a kindergarten in the Corticella district of Bologna, a male teacher starts working. Roberto, that’s his name, is an excellent educator who immediately establishes a great rapport with the children (who, by the way, greatly appreciate the unusual “non-maternal” presence in the teaching staff), as well as with his female colleagues. However, his educational methods, which are rather unconventional and inspired by a great sense of freedom, will lead him to encounter some problems with the authorities.\nRoberto starts a relationship with Isabella, the single mother of his student Michela, and the woman finds herself pregnant once again. He also forms a special friendship with Gianluigi, a child with behavioral issues who doesn't speak and eats very little, and because of this, he is removed from the kindergarten and placed in a care home. The following summer, Isabella, close to giving birth, expresses her intention to move to Sardinia, where she owns an abandoned cinema. Roberto, although not explicitly invited to join her, accompanies her along with a group of children, including Gianluigi. On the very day that Isabella gives birth to her second child, Gianluigi begins to show the first real signs of recovery.\nCast\n* Roberto Benigni as Roberto\n* Francesca De Sapio as Chiara\n* Dominique Laffin as Isabella\n* Luca Levi as Luca\n* Girolamo Marzano as Mario\n* Carlo Monni as Paolo\n* Chiara Moretti as Irma\n* Roberto Amaro as Robertino\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
