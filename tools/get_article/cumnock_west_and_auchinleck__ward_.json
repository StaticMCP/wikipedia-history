Originally created in 1984, the ward was initially within Cumnock and Doon Valley District Council before the local government reforms in the 1990s. The ward elected one councillor using the first-past-the-post voting electoral system.\nThe ward was a Labour stronghold as the party successfully held the seat at every election.\nIn 1999, the ward was abolished with the area represented by the ward placed into the new Cumnock West and Ochiltree, Skares, Netherthird and Craigens wards and the re-established Auchinleck ward.\nBoundaries\nThe Cumnock West and Auchinleck ward was created for the 1984 local elections by the Initial Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements in 1981 from part of the former Cumnock Burgh and Auchinleck wards. The ward took in the western part of Cumnock, most of Auchinleck and an area to the west of both towns. Following the Second Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements in 1994, the ward's boundaries in Cumnock were altered to transfer part of Holmhead to Cumnock East and minor changes were made to the boundary in the town centre. After the implementation of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, the boundaries proposed by the second review became the Formation Electoral Arrangements for the newly created East Ayrshire Council – an amalgamation of Cumnock and Doon Valley District Council and Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council. In 1999, the ward was abolished following the Third Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements with the area split between three wards – Auchinleck, Cumnock West and Ochiltree, Skares, Netherthird and Craigens.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=2|Councillor\n|-\n!1984\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|J.
