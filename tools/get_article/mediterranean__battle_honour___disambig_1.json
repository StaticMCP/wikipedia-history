This stated that battle honours awarded to former militia battalions were to cease to be borne: special reserve battalions could continue to carry colours with the old honours \"as a temporary measure\" if they chose, but only until they were presented with replacement colours.\nReferences\nNorman, C.B.: Battle Honours Of The British Army, From Tangier, 1662, To The Commencement Of The Reign Of King Edward VII.
