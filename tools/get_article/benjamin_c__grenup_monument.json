Washington, D.C. 1903) may have been born in Belgium and lived in Washington DC and designed many monuments and gravestones in the area including Congressional Cemetery. He may have received his education at the Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium. Very little documentation exists of his background.\nInformation\nBenjamin Grenup was one of the first firefighters killed in action in Washington, D.C. On May 6, 1856, the volunteer fireman was running with a hand engine, while pulling the engine he was run over en route to a call at Shreeve's Stable on 7th Street, NW. Grenup was part of Columbia Fire Company #1, now known as DCFD Engine Company #3.\nSee also\n*List of public art in Washington, D.C.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dcist.com/2011/01/the_peoples_art_public_art_in_the_d.php The People's Art about the Grenup Monument]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100816064542/http://www.3hose.com/index_files/Page365.htm Capitol Engine 3 History]\n*[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/19795 Washington, DC - Run-over Fireman Monument on Roadside America]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100915013835/http://www.buffaloheadfire.com/gpage145.html Grenup Monument on BuffaloHeadFire]\n*[http://www.dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0001920.htm On dcMemorials]"
