It was renamed in 1968 by the newly formed Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) after the federation between the Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University. The award continued until 1992, and was re-established in 2002. The award in its various forms is named for physics professor Albert A. Michelson (Case School of Applied Sciences) and chemistry professor Edward W. Morley (Western Reserve University) who carried out the famous Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887.\nRecipients\nMichelson Award\n*1963 – John Hasbrouck Van Vleck\n*1964 – Haldan Keffer Hartline\n*1965 – Luis W.
