Generally, the lowest ranking members of the crew are required to hot rack. Hot racking is sometimes used in jails and prisons to deal with overcrowding.\nDepending upon the watch system, two, or even three people may end up sharing the same bunk. The term comes from the military slang use of the term \"rack\" for a bed or bunk. With more than one crew member assigned to a rack, it is possible that a crew member returning from a duty shift will lie down on a rack immediately after it is vacated by another crew member about to start a shift. The rack is therefore said to be \"hot\", that is, still warm from the vacating crew member's body heat.\nSee also\n* List of established military terms\n* Hot desking\n* Seabasing\n* Work shift\nReferences"
