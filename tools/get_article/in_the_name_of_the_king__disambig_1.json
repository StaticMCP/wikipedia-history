It is inspired by the Dungeon Siege video game series, and was an international co-production between Germany, Canada, and the United States. It premiered at the Brussels Festival of Fantastic Films on April 11, 2007, and was released in theatres on November 29, 2007.\nUpon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only $13.1 million against a budget of $60 million.\nPlot\nIn the kingdom of Ehb, a man known only as Farmer is living a happy life with his wife, Solana, and their young son, Zeph, in the town of Stonebridge. One day, the town gets attacked by the Krug, creatures known to be primitive and animal-like. They surprise the people by taking up arms, donning armour and are fighting with courage, intelligence and ferocity. It is all because they are magically controlled by Gallian, a powerful Magus who has become sadistic and megalomaniacal, and seeks to conquer and rule Ehb. During the attack, Farmer, along with his friend, Norick and his brother-in-law, Bastian, fights off the Krug. He fails to save Zeph; who is killed by Gallian via a Krug avatar. Through a Krug, Gallian claims to be unable to read Farmer. Solana and other Stonebridge inhabitants are taken prisoner.\nKing Konreid, Commander Tarish and Ehb's soldiers arrive at Stonebridge to survey the damage and recruit others to join their army. Merick, another Magus who serves Konreid, tries to learn of Farmer's identity when he notices Norick, who he believes he has seen before. Farmer, Norick and Bastian set off on their own to find Solana. Meanwhile, Merick's daughter, Muriella, who fell in love with Gallian, ends her romance with him after seeing his dark nature and realizing that he only trained her power so he can take it away. She confesses to her father, who believes that her love for Gallian has created an imbalance of their powers in Gallian's favour. Meanwhile, Konreid's selfish and immature nephew, Duke Fallow is in league with Gallian and he seeks to take his uncle's place. Gallian attempts to poison Konreid, while at the same time, unwittingly poisoning Fallow, who is then healed as Fallow takes a company of Ehb soldiers for his own. Soon after, Konreid heals and leads his army to go and fight Gallian's forces.\nGoing through Sedgwick Forest, Farmer and his companions encounter the reclusive nymphs led by Elora, who leads them out of the forest. When they attempt to rescue Solana from the Krug, Farmer gets knocked out, and Norick and Bastian get captured. While Farmer is being hanged by another one of Gallian's avatars, he kills the avatar, frees himself and is rescued by Merick. Farmer is taken to Konreid and his army's camp, where Merick reveals that Farmer is Konreid's long lost son and his real name is Camden Konreid. He explains that many years ago, a young Farmer was present during a battle at a place known as Oxley Pass, where he was found by Norick. Norick was considered to be the adoptive father, but Farmer was cared for by Stonebridge's inhabitants and was kept safe from all the chaos that ravaged Ehb. Konreid and Farmer both disapprove of Merick's claims.\nKonreid catches Fallow, in his treachery, which leaves Fallow only his personal guard as the company turns from him and joins the rest of the army. Soon after, a battle erupts between Ehb's army and the Krug. Ehb's army, along with Farmer, eventually gain the upper hand and force the Krug to retreat, but Fallow succeeds in mortally wounding Konreid with an arrow. After the battle, Konreid and Farmer learn that they both share similar knowledge as Konreid declares Farmer his son, Camden, with his last breath and dies. Meanwhile, Tarish challenges Fallow to a duel. Tarish wins, yet Fallow still proclaims himself king until Camden, who arrives, is declared Konreid's son and now the new king. Fallow is arrested for treason and Camden readies everybody for the next battle.\nMeanwhile, Norick, Bastian, and Solana are taken to Gallian's lair at Christwind Hold. Norick is killed while he and Bastian fight the Krug. Solana is taken to Gallian, who can sense Camden within her, who reveals that Solana is pregnant with Camden's second child. Going on a mission to infiltrate Gallian's lair, Camden is joined by Merick, Muriella and Elora, who has sided with Ehb against Gallian, while Tarish and the remaining army hold off against the advancing Krug. Merick magically enters the lair and fights Gallian, who manages to outsmart and kill Merick. Camden and Muriella manage to go into the lair as well, but Elora stays behind.\nCamden finds Solana and fights Gallian in a sword battle. When Gallian resorts to using his magic to gain the upper hand, he prepares to kill him. Muriella arrives and tries to save Camden but Gallian defeats Muriella by weakening her magic. Suddenly, Solana stabs Gallian in the back. Wounded and enraged, Gallian tries to kill her, but Camden quickly saves her by slitting Gallian's throat and killing him. Gallian's magic influence goes away and the Krug go back to being primitive, saving Bastian and the prisoners, and Tarish and his battered forces. Having finally avenged his son, Camden and Solana are happily reunited as the kingdom is saved.\nCast\n* Jason Statham as Farmer / Camden Konreid\n* Leelee Sobieski as Muriella\n* John Rhys-Davies as Merick\n* Ron Perlman as Norick\n* Claire Forlani as Solana\n* Kristanna Loken as Elora\n* Matthew Lillard as Duke Fallow\n* Ray Liotta as Gallian\n* Burt Reynolds as King Konreid\n* Brian White as Commander Tarish\n* Mike Dopud as General Backler\n* Will Sanderson as Bastian\n* Tania Saulnier as Talwyn\n* Gabrielle Rose as Delinda\n* Terence Kelly as Trumaine\n* Colin Ford as Zeph\nProduction\nThe production budget was $60 million, making it Uwe Boll's most expensive film production to date.\n]]\nBoll has said that two versions will be produced due to length.
