Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 7, 1823, two weeks before the beginning of the year of the administration of Governor Joseph Haslet. He died June 20, 1823, and Governor Charles Thomas Jr. took administration.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not affect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Republican majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Charles Thomas Jr., New Castle County\nHouse of Representatives\n*George Clark Jr., New Castle County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Victor du Pont\n*Charles Thomas Jr.\n*William Weldon II\n|\n:Kent County\n*Thomas Clayton\n*Willard Hall\n*Maylove Hayes\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Jesse Green\n*Joseph Maull\n*Samuel Paynter\n|}\nHouse of Representatives\nRepresentatives were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Samuel H.
