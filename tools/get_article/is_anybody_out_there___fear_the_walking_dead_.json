It currently holds a 54% positive rating with an average score of 6.62/10 out of 13 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The critics' consensus reads: \"'Is Anybody Out There' proves to be a lukewarm midseason finale, underscoring the series' deflating stakes and tension, although viewers may be pleased by the promise of renewed focus and a change in scenery going forward.\"\nLiam Mathews of TV Guide praised the episode and wrote: \"The Walking Dead shows are at their best when they're exploring the gray areas of what people have to do to survive with morally ambiguous characters on both sides of the conflict. Fear the Walking Dead isn't that anymore.\" Writing for Forbes, Erik Kain gave it a negative review and wrote: \"Fear The Walking Dead is a pale shadow of its former self, almost a new show entirely, and barely worth watching.\"\nRating\nThe episode was seen by 1.60 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, above the previous episodes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.amc.com/shows/fear-the-walking-dead/episodes/season-5-episode-08-is-anybody-out-here--1299 \"Is Anybody Out There?\"] at AMC.com\n*"
