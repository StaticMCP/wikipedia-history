Jealousy amongst the other patients, all in love with Hamutal though receiving only professional care, soon begins to emerge.\nProduction\nThe film, financed by the  and developed at Herzliya Studios, stars inter alia , Mika Rottenberg, , , , Amos Lavi, Dov Navon, , and Sivan Shavit and has cinematography by , production by Enrique Rottenberg, and music by Ilan Virtzberg (in addition to the 1946/1948 song \"We Left Slowly\" performed by Shoshana Damari).\nCast\n* as Yoram\n* as Aaron\n* as Frangi\n*Alona Kimhi as Hamital\n*Amos Lavi as Marcos\n*Dov Navon as Assa\n* as Clara\n*Sivan Shavit as Ivria\n* as doctor\n*Ada Valerie-Tal\n*Ofer Shikartsi as Himmo\n*Avi Gilor\nReception\nIt was screened and won several prizes at the 1988 Toronto International Film Festival, San Francisco International Film Festival, Haifa International Film Festival, and 1988 Chicago International Film Festival, despite being a commercial flop with only 21,000 tickets sold.\nJournalist Meir Schnitzer dismissed the film for its \"lack of plot\" and \"visual ugliness\", and similar pontifications were voiced by other journalists such as , who dismissed its \"pretentiousness\" and called it a stain on the Israeli film \"industry\", and , who called it “miserable, tiring, heavy, a boring and slow film in which nothing happens” and complained that it utilized \"too much dialogue and too little action\".\nOutside Israel, where the film was distributed by the National Center for Jewish Film, TV Guide also dismissed the \"stagy, with a fair amount of speechmaking\" approach.
