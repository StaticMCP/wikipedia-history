The engagement resulted in a decisive Afghan victory, the death of Mir Alam Khan, and the subsequent capture of key strongholds in the region, including the fortress of Nun.\nBackground\nFollowing the capture of Herat by Ahmad Shah Durrani in his second campaign into Khorasan, the Shah turned his attention towards Mashhad and Nishapur. At this time, Mashhad was in a state of political turmoil. Shah Rukh, the blinded grandson of Nader Shah, was a nominal ruler with little authority. His general, Yusuf Ali, had been overpowered and blinded by Mir Alam Khan, who emerged as the de facto master of Mashhad.\nMir Alam Khan had begun preparations for a campaign against Nishapur when he received news of Herat’s fall and Ahmad Shah’s advance. He quickly abandoned the Nishapur operation, fortified Mashhad, and marched out to confront the Afghans.\nBattle\nAhmad Shah dispatched an advance force of around 5,000 chosen troops under Jahan Khan Popalzai, supported by Mir Nasir Khan of Kalat with 3,000 Baloch horsemen. The vanguard encountered Mir Alam Khan near Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam.\nThe Afghans initially surprised their opponent, but Mir Alam quickly rallied his men and counterattacked, pushing back Jahan Khan’s force. The tide of battle turned, however, when Mir Nasir Khan led a bold cavalry charge that broke the Persian lines. Mir Alam Khan was killed in the fighting, and his army collapsed in disorder.\nAftermath\nWith the death of Mir Alam Khan, Ahmad Shah’s main force advanced toward Mashhad. The fortress of Nun, commanded by Mir Masum Khan, Mir Alam’s brother, was the next obstacle. Despite strengthening his defenses, Masum Khan lost hope upon learning of his brother’s death. He surrendered the fort after a brief siege, personally delivering the keys to Ahmad Shah. The victory secured Durrani control over Mashhad and much of Khorasan, further consolidating Ahmad Shah’s authority in the region and weakening the already fragmented Afsharid state.\nReferences"
