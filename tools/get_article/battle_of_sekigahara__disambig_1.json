The Battle of Sekigahara is often regarded as the most Important battle in Japanse history.\nMitsunari's defeat in the Battle of Sekigahara is generally considered to be the beginning point of the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan for another two and a half centuries until 1868.\nBackground\nThe final years of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's reign were turbulent. At the time of Hideyoshi's death, his heir, Toyotomi Hideyori, was only 5 years old, causing a power vacuum in Japan.\nFeuding factions\nIn the years following the Imjin War and the death of Hideyoshi, factional disputes arose between Ishida Mitsunari and seven former Toyotomi generals including Katō Kiyomasa. After the subsequent death of Maeda Toshiie, a powerful and long-term ally of Hideyoshi and Oda Nobunaga, who had been sympathetic to Mitsunari’s posturing, the uneasy balance of power began to dissolve. Tokugawa Ieyasu gathered both Kiyomasa and Fukushima Masanori to his cause in a bid to challenge the opposition from Mitsunari, who claimed to fight on behalf of the Toyotomi clan.\nAt this time, political tensions were high in the capital; In 1599, when the relationship between Ieyasu and Maeda Toshiie became strained and rumors of an attempted of conspiracy to storm the Tokugawa residence spread, Yoshitsugu accompanied Fukushima Masanori and other military commanders of the Toyotomi clan to the Tokugawa residence to guard Ieyasu. Later, when rumor of a plot to assassinate Ieyasu by Maeda Toshinaga emerge, Yoshitsugu led an army to Echizen with the inner circle of Ishida Mitsunari, who had been ousted by Ieyasu.  Maeda Toshinaga, who was accused of being involved in such conspiracies and contentiously but peacefully made to marry into the Tokugawa clan. Uesugi Kagekatsu, one of Hideyori's regents, stood against Ieyasu by building up his army, which Ieyasu officially questioned, demanding answers from Kyoto about Kagekatsu's suspicious activity. Naoe Kanetsugu responded with a mocking letter highlighting Ieyasu's own violations of Hideyoshi's orders.\nMitsunari met with Ōtani Yoshitsugu, Mashita Nagamori and Ankokuji Ekei, conspiring to raise an anti-Tokugawa army, of which Mōri Terumoto was appointed to be the overall commander. This coalition formed what came to be referred to as the Western Army. Terumoto immediately marched and captured Osaka Castle while the main army of the Tokugawa were still on their way to suppress Kagekatsu.\nAt first, Mitsunari wanted to use Gifu Castle, which at that time was commanded by Oda Hidenobu (the grandson of Nobunaga), and Ōgaki Castle as choke points to impede the advances of the Eastern Army (the Tokugawa-led coalition). However, this plan was foiled by a number of campaign events:\n* Gifu Castle was captured by the Eastern Army under Fukushima Masanori and Ii Naomasa before the main forces of the Western Army arrived.\n* On October 19, Shimazu Yoshihiro's troops were beaten by Mizuno Katsunari in a battle outside Sone Castle, and breaking through two or three baileys, after which Katsunari razed the outer moat of Ōgaki Castle and forced Yoshihiro to retreat into Ise Province.}}\n* Mitsunari realized that the Tokugawa army was heading towards Osaka Castle.\nFollowing these failures and the threat against Osaka Castle, Mitsunari changed his plan and prepared his army for an open battle on the field of Sekigahara against the main body of the Eastern Army, led by Ieyasu. As preparation for this inevitable conflict, Ieyasu had purchased massive quantities of Tanegashima matchlocks.\nHowever, one day before the beginning of the battle, Kikkawa Hiroie, vassal of the Western Army-allied Mōri clan, colluded with the Eastern Army and promised that the Mōri clan would change sides during the battle, on the condition they would be pardoned after the war. Kuroda Yoshitaka and Kuroda Nagamasa served as representatives of the Eastern Army in this correspondence with Hiroie. Hiroie and his senior retainer Fukubara Hirotoshi presented hostages to the Tokugawa side as proof for their cooperation with the latter.\nBattle\nAt dawn on October 21, 1600, the Tokugawa advance guard stumbled into Ishida's army; neither side saw each other because of dense fog caused by earlier rains. Both sides panicked and withdrew, but each was now aware of their adversary's presence and location. Mitsunari placed his position in defensive formation, while Ieyasu deployed his forces south of the Western Army position. Last-minute orders were issued and the battle began. Traditional opinion has stated the battle began around 08:00. However, recent Japanese historians' research estimates that the battle actually began closer to 10:00.}}\nThe battle started when Ii Naomasa, previously heavily involved in the Battle of Gifu Castle, commanded his famed unit of 3,600 crimson-clad Ii no Akazonae (\"Ii's red devils\") to attack the center of the Western Army. According to historian Watanabe Daimon, by many indications of the battle records, the assignment of Naomasa as ichiban-yari (the first unit to engage the enemy) suggests the armies may have already been settled before the battle. Fukushima Masanori concurred with Naomasa's intention to lead the first attack, as Naomasa was appointed by Ieyasu as the supreme field commander and was therefore responsible for all commands and strategies during the battle.}}\nNaomasa charged forward with 30 spearmen and clashed with the ranks of the Western Army. Meanwhile, Fukushima Masanori advanced from his position, following Naomasa and immediately engaging with troops led by Ukita Hideie.\nAt this point, the battle entered a deadlock. Ōta Gyūichi, who was present at the battle, wrote in his chronicle that \"friends and foes are pushing each other\" and \"gunfire thunders while hails of arrows fly in the sky\". According to records from Spanish accounts, 19 cannons from the , a Dutch trading ship, were also used by the Tokugawa army in this battle. Kani Saizō, the forerunner of Fukushima Masanori's army, was recorded for taking the heads of 17 enemy combatants he personally killed during combat nearby Gifu Castle, and was noted by Ieyasu himself with praise after the battle concluded\nFamous swordsman Yagyū Munenori also reported being participated on the side of Eastern Army, where he later given 2,000 koku in Yamato Province as recognition for his merit in this battle.\nWestern Army defectors\nDuring the Battle of Sekigahara, several commanders of the Western Army changed sides, allying with the Tokugawa and changing the course of the battle. Perhaps the most notable of these defectors was Kobayakawa Hideaki, the nephew of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whose disgruntlement with his uncle was exploited by the Tokugawa to sway his loyalty. Two prevailing theories exist regarding the timeline of Hideaki's defection:\n* The conventional theory regarding Hideaki's defection suggests that the defection occurred partway through the battle. Although he had agreed to defect to the Tokugawa side beforehand, Hideaki was allegedly hesitant during the battle and remained neutral, reportedly only joining the battle around noon as a member of the Eastern Army. Some later historical accounts claim that as the battle grew more intense, Ieyasu finally ordered his arquebuses to fire at Kobayakawa's position on Mt. Matsuo to force a choice. This version allegedly originated from an anecdote about Hideaki dating to the Edo period.\n* Modern Japanese researchers of Sekigahara, such as Jun Shiramine and Junji Mitsunari, have advanced the theory that Hideaki had already defected to the side of Tokugawa by the start of the battle, based on correspondence documents between Hideaki and Kuroda Nagamasa before the battle, as well as Ōtani Yoshitsugu's army position at the start of the battle suggesting foreknowledge by the Western Army of Hideaki's betrayal. Historian Stephen Turnbull also argues that the sheer distance between the Eastern Army positions and that of Kobayakawa, far out of range of arquebuses and likely too far for a shot to even be heard, makes the \"story about Ieyasu ordering ‘cannon-shot’ into his ranks\" to force Hideaki's hand very unlikely. Furthermore, Masayuki Fujimoto argues  the notion of Ieyasu' shooting cannot be corroborated by reliable historical sources of that time. Similarly, another historian, Yūichi Goza explains that the story of Ieyasu shooting at Hideaki's location comes from secondary sources from the Edo period, suggesting it may have been the result of dramatization and embellishment from pro-Tokugawa shogunate historiography to aggrandize Ieyasu's success in Sekigahara.\n}}\nRegardless of what actually transpired, the turncoat Kobayakawa forces overwhelmed Yoshitsugu's position, as according to Nakatomi Yūhan-ki (臣祐範記), \"The armies of Kamigata (referring to Western Army) had the upper hand, until Kobayakawa Hideaki betrayed them and attacked them from behind with over 15,000 men.\". At the same time, Yoshitsugu's troops also engaged the units led by Tōdō Takatora, while subsequently Oda Nagamasu and Honda Tadakatsu moving forward and intercept the Toda Katsunari units which on their way attacking Madanori's flank, thus resulting in Katsunari's death in combat.\nFollowing the defection of Hideaki, Western Army leaders Wakisaka Yasuharu, Ogawa Suketada, Akaza Naoyasu and Kutsuki Mototsuna also changed sides, further turning the battle in the Eastern Army's favor. These four commanders are recorded to have established contact and concluded deals with Tōdō Takatora, one of the main commanders of the Eastern Army, several days before the battle.\nMōri Terumoto, then daimyō of the Mōri clan, also defected from the Western Army during the battle by keeping his forces entrenched at Osaka Castle rather than joining the battle, then sending his vassal Kikkawa Hiroie to quietly surrender to Ieyasu afterward. Professor Yoshiji Yamasaki of Toho University states that any neutrality-for-territorial-preservation agreement was ineffective at best and badly backfired for the Mōri at worst, as their domains were greatly reduced by the Tokugawa following the battle, and some Mōri troops notably did fight with the Western Army at Sekigahara rather than maintaining their neutrality. Sentiments of defection were divided among the Mōri; Mōri Hidemoto, cousin of and commander under Terumoto, genuinely attempted to meet and aid the Western Army, though his efforts were sabotaged by Hiroie, who, under the pretense of being busy eating his meal, stationed his troops in front of Hidemoto, obstructing them from advancing and relieving Mitsunari. Hiroie also obstructed another Western Army contingent led by daimyō Chōsokabe Morichika from marching and attacking the Tokugawa forces.\nCollapse of the Western Army\nin 1893. This depiction has since been deemed unreliable by historian Jun Shiramine.]]\nOne of the first and most notable weak points within the Western Army forces developed on Ukita Hideie's front. During the engagement, Hideie's forces began to wane and were steadily overcome by the forces of Fukushima Masanori due to the latter's superior troop quality. The disparity in combat effectiveness may have been attributable to the prior insurrection within the Ukita clan, which caused many senior samurai vassals of the Ukita to desert and join the Tokugawa faction. Hideie was thereby forced to enter Sekigahara with fresh recruits of rōnin mercenaries to fill the gap left within his army. This proved fatal over the course of long-term combat against the Fukushima clan's more disciplined and trained regular troops; the Ukita clan ranks began to break and finally collapse under pressure despite outnumbering the Fukushima.\nTo the south, Ōtani Yoshitsugu was outnumbered in a successful attack led by Kobayakawa Hideaki; Yoshitsugu committed suicide and his troops retreated shortly thereafter. Amidst the confusion within the Otani clan troops, Toda Katsushige was slain by the Tokugawa forces.}} The Ōtani retreat left the Western Army's right flank wide open, which Masanori and Hideaki then exploited to roll the flank of the Western Army. Mitsunari, realizing the situation was desperate, also began retreating his troops. Meanwhile, Western Army commander Shima Sakon was engaged by the troops of Kuroda Nagamasa, who had taken a detour on the north to flank the Mitsunari and Sakon positions. In the end, Sakon was shot and fatally wounded by a round from an arquebus.\nFollowing the capitulation of Sakon's unit, Shimazu Yoshihiro found his troops completely surrounded by Masanori and Honda Tadakatsu from the front, while Hideaki troops attacked his rear. The Shimazu troops only managed to break their encirclement after devastating casualties, escaping with only 200 soldiers remaining; even then, they were pursued by Ii Naomasa until the latter was incapacitated by a shot from a rifleman.\nThe Western Army forces continued to crumble without the arrival of reinforcements, further complicated by the waves of defections, until the battle had finally concluded. Historian Andō Yūichirō estimated that the battle in Sekigahara took place in its entirety over a mere two hours – from 10:00 to 12:00 – contrary to the Edo-period accepted theory of the battle lasting twice as long.\nLate arrivals\nThe combined Eastern Army forces of Tokugawa Hidetada and Sakakibara Yasumasa, who commanded as many as 38,000 soldiers, were at the time of the battle bogged down in the Siege of Ueda against Sanada Masayuki. At the same time, 15,000 Western Army soldiers were being held up by 500 troops under Hosokawa Yūsai in the Siege of Tanabe in Maizuru, many of the former refusing to advance out of their respect for the Hosokawa. Due to these incidents, large proportions of both armies' forces ultimately never participated in the clash at Sekigahara.\nAnother Western Army contingent that failed to reach the Sekigahara battlefield was led by Tachibana Muneshige, who had been stalled by Kyōgoku Takatsugu in the Siege of Ōtsu. As result, Muneshige was forced to remain at Osaka Castle after learning of the Western Army's annihilation at Sekigahara. However, when Mōri Terumoto (also at Osaka Castle) offered his surrender to the Eastern Army, Muneshige departed with his army and returned to his homeland in Kyushu.\nAftermath\nAs soon as the news of the Eastern Army's victory at Sekigahara reached Ogaki Castle, which at the time was still besieged by Mizuno Katsunari, Western Army-affiliated garrison commander Akizuki Tanenaga immediately surrendered and opened the castle for Katsunari. In response, Katsunari immediately wrote to Ii Naomasa asking that Ieyasu pardon Tanenaga, which Ieyasu accepted.\nThe most prominent political effect of the Eastern Army victory in Sekigahara was the shifting authority to assign military ranks and redistribute lands from the Toyotomi clan to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Immediately following the battle, Ieyasu redistributed domains worth 6.8 million koku, primarily as recompense for the allies instrumental in his victory:\n* Ikeda Terumasa was reassigned from Mikawa Province, Yoshida region to a 520,000-koku domain in Harima Province, Himeji region\n* Tōdō Takatora was reassigned to a 200,000-koku domain in Imabari, Ehime\n* Matsudaira Tadayoshi was reassigned from a 100,000-koku domain in Musashi Province, Yuki region, to a 520,000-koku domain in Echizen Province, Fukui region\n* Yūki Hideyasu was reassigned from a 101,000-koku domain in Shimōsa Province, Shinobu region, to a 569,000-koku domain in Owari Province, Kiyosu region\n* Gamō Hideyuki was reassigned from a 180,000-koku domain in Shimotsuke Province, Utsunomiya region, to a 600,000-koku domain in Mutsu Province, Aizu region\n* Maeda Toshinaga had his 835,000-koku domain in Kaga Province, Kanazawa region, expanded to 1,100,000 koku\n* Katō Kiyomasa had his 195,000-koku domain in Higo Province, Kumamoto region, expanded to 515,000 koku\n* Kuroda Nagamasa was reassigned from a 180,000-koku domain in Buzen Province, Nakatsu region, to a 523,000-koku domain in Chikuzen Province, Fukuoka region\n* Fukushima Masanori had his 200,000-koku domain in the area of contemporary Aki District, Hiroshima, expanded to 498,000 koku\n* Horio Tadauji had his domains in Matsue, Izumo, expanded to 240,000 koku\n* Ieyasu also bestowed increases of at least into 10,000 koku to many of his fudai daimyō (Tokugawa clan hereditary vassals) whose domain were less than 10,000 koku before the battle.\nNotably, Kobayakawa Hideaki, whose defection from the Western Army contributed greatly to Ieyasu's victory, was bestowed a domain which covered parts of Bizen Province and Mimasaka Province and which was worth 520,000 koku. This redistribution of domains was done verbally, instead of by formal letter of intent. Historian Watanabe Daimon suspected this was because Ieyasu was still wary of the existence of Toyotomi clan which had been inherited by Toyotomi Hideyori.\nPerhaps surprisingly, Ieyasu bestowed only meager domain increases to the three remaining Shitennō (Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, and Sakakibara Yasumasa), his closest high-ranking generals, as compared to those he offered to newer commanders and vassals. Some 20th-21st historians believed it is possible this perceived disparity was the result of those generals choosing to decline Ieyasu's offers of extensive compensation. However, althought Yasumasa was indeed declined Ieyasu's offer for 250,000 koku of Mito Domain, Arthur Lindsay Sadler recorded that Naomasa and Honda Tadakatsu expressed dissatisfaction due to their rewards from Ieyasu.\nKinoshita Katsutoshi became one of the two Eastern Army daimyo who was stripped from his domain despite siding with Ieyasu\" fur If Throne war. The perceived reason was because of his cowardice as he abandoned Fushimi castle during its siege, leaving Torii Mototada defend the castle alone. This enraged Ieyasu who decided to demote him. However, after his father, Iesada, died in 1608, through the intermediation of Kōdai-in, he was granted his estate (25,000 koku in Ashimori Domain,  at Bitchu Province) and was left to his discretion. Ieyasu had also decided to divide his estate between Katsutoshi and Toshifusa, but Kodaiin gave the entire estate to Katsutoshi as she favored him. Another Daimyo was Miyabe Nagafusa, who was demoted and stripped from his title, due to slander by Tanaka Yoshimasa that Nagafusa intended to defect to the Western Army, despite participating in the attack on Sawayama Castle as part of the Eastern Army.\nAs for the generals of the defeated Western Army, roughly 87 daimyō had their domains confiscated and their power stripped due to their support of Mitsunari in the battle. The long-standing Chōsokabe clan, headed by Chōsokabe Morichika, was stripped of its title and domain of Tosa Province, which was consequently given to Yamauchi Kazutoyo in recognition of his service to the Tokugawa. Several former Chōsokabe retainers resisted the forcible takeover by the Tokugawa and Kazutoyo; in response, Ii Naomasa sent military reinforcements to assist Kazutoyo in suppressing the rebellion of Chōsokabe vassals in Tosa. Suzuki Hyōe, vassal of Naomasa, relieved Kazutoyo with an army transported by 8 ships, ultimately pacifying the region in 5 weeks after killing about 273 enemies.\nOn September 17, Ieyasu dispatched his army, led by Kobayakawa Hideaki, to attack Sawayama Castle in Ōmi Province, the home base of Mitsunari. Most of the castle's troops had been sent to Sekigahara, leaving the castle's garrison with only 2,800 men. Despite Mitsunari's absence, the defense of the castle was initially successful under the leadership of Mitsunari's father Ishida Masatsugu and brother Masazumi. Following the defection of retainer Moritomo Hasegawa and other defenders, the castle was opened to the besieging army; most of Mitsunari's relatives, including Masatsugu, Masazumi, and Mitsunari's wife Kagetsuin, were killed in battle or committed suicide. However, as Naomasa has no intention to keep the castle, he immediately dismantle the structures of Sawayama Castle, while its materials were moved to renovate and expand Hikone Castle, the traditional castle belonged to the Ii clan.}}\nIn response to Shimazu Yoshihiro's support of the Western Army, Ieyasu prepared a massive punitive expedition to Kyushu, to be led by his son Tokugawa Hidetada. This force was to be composed of Eastern Army forces thereupon engaged in the West, including the armies of Katō Kiyomasa, Kuroda Yoshitaka, Nabeshima Naoshige, and the Tachibana clan. However, this operation was aborted once Shimazu Yoshihisa, the head of the Shimazu clan, entered negotiations with Ieyasu. Shimazu-Tokugawa deliberations continued until 1602 and were aided by the intercession of Kiyomasa, Yoshitaka, and Tachibana Muneshige; ultimately, the Shimazu clan avoided punishment, becoming the only Western Army-aligned clan to avoid losing territory after the defeat at Sekigahara.\nOn November 6, Ishida Mitsunari, Konishi Yukinaga and Ankokuji Ekei were captured and executed.\nIn 1603, Ieyasu was officially appointed as shōgun by Emperor Go-Yōzei;\nIn 1931, the location of the battle was registered as a Monument of Japan. The positions of Ieyasu and Mitsunari's armies, and that of the death of Ōtani Yoshitsugu, are commemorated therein.\nHistorical Analysis\nAs the conclusion of the Battle of Sekigahara has served as the de facto beginning of the Edo period, and more generally, of the return of stability to Japan, in 1664, Hayashi Gahō, Tokugawa historian and rector of Yushima Seidō, wrote: }}\n20th-21st century Japanese historians such as Kasaya Kazuhiko, Mizuno Goki, Watanabe Daimon and others  pointed that among major factors which influenced the end result of the battle of Sekigahara, it was the perceived unpopularity of Ishida Mitsunari and the resentment of many powerful daimyo lords of that time, particularly those who involved in the Japanese invasions of Korea, as they felt their achievements during the campaign was undermined by Mitsunari's report, or even Mitsunari's own mismanagement under Hideyoshi.\nOne notable example was in 1598, when several daimyo lords, which colloquially known as the \"Military Faction\" of Toyotomi government, such as Fukushima Masanori, Katō Kiyomasa, Ikeda Terumasa, Hosokawa Tadaoki, Asano Yoshinaga, Katō Yoshiaki, Kuroda Nagamasa, Hachisuka Iemasa, Tōdō Takatora, and Kuroda Yoshitaka brought their troops and entourage to storm Ishida's residence to confront Mitsunari. At first, those daimyo lords gathered at Kiyomasa's mansion in Osaka Castle, and from there they marched to Mitsunari's mansion. However, Mitsunari had learned of this from a report by a servant of Toyotomi Hideyori named Jiemon Kuwajima, and fled to  mansion together with Shima Sakon and others to hide. The heated situation forced Mitsunari to even flee and hid himself at the Satake Yoshinobu's residence, and then at Fushimi Castle, Before Tokugawa Ieyasu himself act as mediator of the dispute to calm those daimyo who resented Mitsunari.\nEven Kobayakawa Hideaki's fief of Chikuzen and Chikugo was confiscated due to the rumored Mitsunari's slander against him on the aftermath of Korean war. It was said that Hideaki held grudge towards Mitsunari as he thought the confiscation of his fief was because Mitsunari game him bad assessment During the siege of Ulsan. However, Watanabe Daimon warned that such rumor was baseless as Hideaku was not involced in the siege of Ulsan, and the rumor of Mitsunari influenced the confiscation of Hideaki's domains was\nprobably just because the political mood and historical bias during that time, where many tends to blame Mitsunari for everything goes wrong prior to Sekigahara battle. Nevertheless, Daimon still pointed out that Mitsunari already made too many enemies the moment he started hostility against Ieyasu, as according to the Keicho Kenbunsho, on the eve of the battle of Sekigahara, even his close ally Otani Yoshitsugu warned Mitsunari, saying, \"You are hated by the daimyos, so if you raise an army, those who sued you last year will become your enemies.\". Furthermore, Yoshitsugu also cited the difference in the amount of Koku, the number of soldiers, and the amount of material resources between Ieyasu and Mitsunari, as well as the difference in military experience and ability, and said that there was no way Mitsunari could defeat Ieyasu.\nYūichi Goza, Assistant Professor at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, concludes that Mitsunari naively overestimated the authority of Toyotomi clan, while in reality, many daimyo were pragmatic enough to prioritize following Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was viewed as extremely powerful figure of the time. Goza pointed out several indications one of them is the surprising letter of Mitsunari with the indication he believes he still could persuade Fukushima Masanori to join him to oppose Ieyasu. Similarly, Toshi Kohara, a Japanese anthropologist and professor emeritus of Rikkyo University, believed that despite those daimyo were originally vassals of Hideyoshi, they are convinced that fighting for Ieyasu and opposing Mitsunari was the best course for the interest of Hideyoshi's heir, Toyotomi Hideyori.\nKazuto Hongo, researcher from the University of Tokyo, remarked that Sekigahara campaign was essentially more of Ieyasu's politcal victory rather than military one. This took account from most political and factional advantages Ieyasu has secured that ultimately become critical factors for the outcome of this war, including the approval from the mother of Hidreyori, Ōmandokoro, for his operation.\nAccording to one historical record from Chikugo Province, Tschibana Muneshige was once advised by his senior retainer, Komono Masutoki, to side with the Eastern Army, saying that the Western Army had no chance of winning. However, Mneshige replied that he does not care about winning or losing.\nStatistics and chronology\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ Commanders\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Commanders of Eastern Army (Tokugawa Force)\n!
