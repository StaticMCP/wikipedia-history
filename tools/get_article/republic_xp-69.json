Manufacturers were encouraged to consider unorthodox designs; although the design was ordered as a prototype it was canceled because of delays with the engine that was to power it.\nDevelopment\nThe United States Army Air Corps began the R40-C fighter competition in February 1940. The competition encouraged manufacturers to propose unorthodox high-speed fighter aircraft that met the requirements of Type Specification XC-622.  The specification called for a single-engined high-performance fighter aircraft, with a maximum speed between , armed with both machine guns and cannons, and be capable of landing on a  long grass runway.\nRepublic was one of six companies selected for the competition, and one of the aircraft proposed to the USAAC by Republic was the AP-12 Rocket. As proposed, the AP-12 was to be powered by a 2,500 hp Wright R-2160-3 Tornado 42-cylinder liquid-cooled radial engine mounted in the mid-section of the aircraft's streamlined, cigar-shaped fuselage, behind the cockpit, which drove a pair of three-bladed contra-rotating propellers.  It was to be armed with four nose-mounted machine guns firing through the propeller arc, and a single 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub.  The AP-12 placed 13th out of 26 contestants, forcing Republic to go back to the drawing board to improve its proposal.\nIn July 1941, Republic submitted an improved design, the AP-18. The AP-18 had little in common with the AP-12. It retained the original aircraft's R-2160 engine, which was now mounted in the nose of a completely new small-cross section airframe.  The large radiator was to be mounted under the fuselage. The pressurized cockpit was to feature a bubble canopy, and an armament of four .50 in machine guns and two 37 mm cannons mounted in a laminar flow wing was planned.\nIn December 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (successor to the USAAC) ordered two prototypes of the AP-18 under the designation XP-69.  A mockup was built and was inspected by the USAAF in June 1942.  Construction of the first prototype began in November of that year.  However, due to development troubles and delays with the R-2160 engine, the XP-69 project was canceled in favor of a parallel development, the Republic XP-72, on May 24, 1943. By that time engineering on the project was 75% complete and the prototype was still in the early stages of construction, with the total program cost being $810,000.\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=15,595\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=18,655\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=26,164\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Wright R-2160-3 Tornado\n|eng1 type=42-cylinder turbo-supercharged liquid-cooled radial engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=2,500\n|eng1 shp=\n|eng1 note=\n|power original=\n|thrust original=\n|prop blade number=6\n|prop name=Hamilton Standard contra-rotating propellers\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=13.7\n|prop dia in=\n|prop dia note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=450\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed kmh=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed kts=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=1,800\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range nmi=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range nmi=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=48,900\n|ceiling note=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=2,750\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|disk loading kg/m2=\n|disk loading lb/sqft=\n|disk loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|guns=\n** 4 × .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns (1,280 rounds)\n** 2 × 37 mm cannons (80 rounds)\n|bombs=\n|rockets=\n|missiles=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences"
