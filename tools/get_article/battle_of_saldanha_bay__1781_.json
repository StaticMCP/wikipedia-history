A squadron of Royal Navy warships under the command of commodore George Johnstone captured five Dutch East India Company ships; her own crew destroyed a sixth. Casualties on the Dutch side were minimal if any, and there were no British casualties.\nBackground\nBritish Commodore George Johnstone was given secret orders to capture the Dutch Cape Colony. However, the French learned of his mission, and Admiral Pierre André de Suffren was sent to frustrate it. Suffren was en route to the Indian Ocean, but the French government had warned him so he sought to reach the Cape before Johnstone. After an indecisive chance encounter (Battle of Porto Praya), between the two fleets in the Cape Verde Islands on 16 April 1781, Suffren sailed for the Cape while Johnstone remained at Porto Praya for repairs.  As a result, Johnstone found the Dutch settlement well defended when he arrived there in July and decided against an attack.\nThe Dutch governor Joachim van Plettenberg had, as a precaution, directed the westbound merchant fleet, laden with goods, to anchor in Saldanha Bay and wait for French escort but where they would be concealed from the British fleet. They were under orders to ground and burn their ships if the British were to appear; however they were not vigilant in their watches.\nOne of Johnstone's frigates, flying French colours, intercepted a Dutch merchantmen that had left the bay several days earlier, heading east. The Dutch vessel was theHeld Woltemade, which had sailed from Saldanha Bay on 28 June carrying stores and £40,000 in bullion to Ceylon. She struck to  on 1 July. That prize money for Held woltenmade was paid suggests that Held woltenmade had arrived safely at a British port and had been condemned there.}} From Held Woltemade Johnstone learned of the whereabouts of the Dutch merchantmen.\nBattle\n]]\nBearing off Saldanha Bay Johnstone sighted the Dutch merchant ships, and entered the bay flying French colors. He then raised the British ensign and opened fire, totally surprising the Dutch. The Dutch could not escape and decided to destroy their ships rather than let them fall into British hands. The Dutch cut their cables, loosed their top sails, and drove the vessels on shore. Once this was done they attempted to torch the ships, and the British, now in their boats, attempted to extinguish the fires. The British were successful, taking as prizes Dankbaerheid, Paerl, Honcoop, and Hoogcarspel. Middelburg, however, burnt furiously and was left alone. She blew up after very nearly colliding with two of the prizes.\nRattlesnake surprised and captured a hooker (a type of coastal craft), laden with the sails of the captured ships and hidden away behind Schapin (Schaapen) Island. The Dutch had put the sails on board and hidden the hooker to make seizing the Indiamen more difficult. By the end of the day the British had captured another two hookers, which Johnstone could not easily remove. In order not to leave any marks of \"barbarity towards a settlement where our wants had so often been relieved\", he gave them back to the Dutch.\nAftermath\nAfter the British Royal Navy captured the Dutch East Indiamen, a boat rowed out to meet the British warships. On board were the \"kings of Ternate and Tidore, and the princes of the respective families\". The Dutch had long held these captives on Isle Robin, but then had moved them to Saldanha Bay.\nThe British sent their prizes back to England. Only two reached their destination, and that with difficulty and after some fighting in the English Channel. A French frigate attacked Hoogcarspel, but she succeeded in getting to Mount's Bay where she was escorted. Also, two French privateers attacked Paerl, which succeeded in escaping. Dankbaerheid and Honcoop were lost in January 1782 as the result of a gale at the mouth of the Channel. The prize crew on Dankbaerheid  were able to escape and reached Lisbon in safety. Honcoop disappeared and was believed to have foundered with all hands.\nOrder of battle\nDutch order of battle\nThe information below on the Dutch vessels captured at Saldhana Bay comes from ''Lloyd's List, van Niekerk, and Nieuwe Nederlandsche jaerboeken.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The total prize money for Paerl and Hoogcarspel'', which was divided between Johnstone's squadron and the Army under the command of General Sir William Meadows, amounted to £68,000.\nBritish order of battle\nWarships (per prize money announcements):\n* (74)\n* (64)\n* (50)\n* (50)\n* (50)\n* (36)\n* (32)\n* (28)\n* (16)\n* (16) (14-gun cutter), under Lieutenant Philippe d'Auvergne, was part of the squadron, not Lark.
