In September 1973, during his winning run, his debut single, \"Let There Be Peace On Earth (Let It Begin With Me)\", backed by the Alyn Ainsworth Orchestra and the Mike Sammes Singers, was released.  The single entered the UK singles chart at the end of the month, peaking inside the top 20 in late October and selling over 50,000 copies, earning him a place on Top Of The Pops.\nA debut album followed before the year's end, but after follow-ups failed to chart, Ward stepped back on his music career to focus on schoolwork.\nVarious comebacks after his voice broke did not lead to a recurrence of national success, but in the mid-1980s, on joining the actors' union Equity. he changed his name to Michael Sayzer (as there was already an actor of the same name registered with Equity),  and carved out a career in cabaret.\nDiscography (as Michael Ward)\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"170\"|Album and details\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" width=\"50\"|Peak positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | UK\n|-\n|Introducing Michael Ward\n*Released: 1973\n*Record label: Philips\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n|-\n|Michael Ward Sings\n*Released: 1974\n*Record label: Decca\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|–\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"20\"|Year\n!align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"170\"|Single\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\" width=\"20\"|Peak positions\n!align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"120\"|Album\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | UK\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1973\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"Let There Be Peace On Earth (Let It Begin With Me)\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Introducing Michael Ward\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1974\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\"He\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|–\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Michael Ward Sings\n|}\nExternal links\n* [https://michaelward7.wixsite.com/mysite Official website]\nReferences"
