Founded in 1854, it is the oldest state agency in Tennessee. The present Commissioner, Dr. Charlie Hatcher, is the 38th incumbent.\nHistory\nCreation of the Bureau of Agriculture\nThe agency was first established in 1854, by the Tennessee General Assembly as the Bureau of Agriculture. It was the first agency created in Tennessee. It was organized primarily to promote agriculture through fairs and livestock expositions. The original agency had a staff of nine, including the Governor and eight others who met twice a year to conduct state business. When Tennessee seceded from the Union in 1861, the Bureau was suspended.\nReorganization after the Civil War\nIn 1871, the Bureau was re-organized and re-constituted. It was structured as it had been before the war, and it was still composed of the Governor and eight others.\nIn 1875, the General Assembly passed an act creating the Bureau of Agriculture, Statistics, and Mines. This new agency had the same responsibilities as the former, but also had oversight of state statistical collection and regulation of mines. The head of agency was then known as the Commissioner of Agriculture, Statistics, and Mines.\nFor a brief time in the late nineteenth century, the agency was also responsible for immigration management in the state.\nModern Cabinet-level department\nIn 1923, the name of the agency was officially changed to the \"Department of Agriculture,\" and the agency's oversight of statistics and mines was removed to other state departments. The Commissioner's title was restored to \"Commissioner of Agriculture,\" and he was recognized, as the director of the State's oldest agency, as the Cabinet member with the greatest seniority.\nIn 1961, the commissioner and his department moved out of the State's downtown Nashville offices and into a new facility south of the city called the Elligton Agricultural Center. The facility is a working farm and named for Buford Ellington, the 40th Governor of Tennessee who also served as Commissioner of Agriculture in the late 1950s. The center sits on 200 acres, and the department's relocation there meant that Tennessee was the first State to locate its department of agriculture on a working farm.\nDuties and responsibilities of the Commissioner\nThe Commissioner is appointed by the Governor and serves at his pleasure. He directs the work of the Department of Agriculture. The Department is charged with promoting wise uses of Tennessee's agricultural and forest resources, developing economic opportunities for Tennesseans, and ensuring safe and dependable food and fiber for the State. The department also oversees food safety, pesticide use, and fuel quality and fairness for Tennessean consumers.\nThe Commissioner organizes the department into five divisions:\n* Division of Administration\n* Division of Forestry\n* Division of Consumer and Industry Services\n* Division of Animal Health\n* Division of Business Development\nList of commissioners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:right; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!County\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!colspan=2 |Governor(s)\n|-\n!style=\"background: ;\" |\n|Joseph Buckner Killebrew\n|Montgomery\n|1872\n|1881\n!style=\"background: ;\" |\n|John C.
