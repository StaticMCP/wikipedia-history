It was released on 29 October 2007 as a double CD, Blu-ray, DVD, and triple vinyl in the UK and the following day in the US. It was recorded in Montreal, Quebec, at the Montreal Forum on 24 November and 25 November 1981. AllMusic described Queen's performance as being \"deliberately theatrical and often majestic\".\nThis marks the first official release of the film soundtrack to the concert film We Will Rock You on an audio-only format. Unlike the original video release of We Will Rock You, which has been re-released as Queen Rock Montreal, this album features the full show (including \"Flash\" and \"The Hero\") fully remixed. Its soundtrack, Queen Rock Montreal, was released on double CD (by Hollywood Records for the US and Canada and by Parlophone Records for Europe and EMI for the rest of the world) and triple vinyl LP. A special double DVD Queen Rock Montreal & Live Aid included Queen's performance at Live Aid as well as never before seen interviews and rehearsal footage. HD-DVD and Blu-ray versions were released on 4 December 2007.\nIn November 2023 it was announced that the concert film will be released in IMAX from 18 January 2024 to 21 January 2024. Due to high demand, this limited theatrical run was extended through to 28 January 2024. The concert was remastered and given a limited theatrical release in January 2024 and released on all formats including 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray later the same year, giving the option to watch it in its original full-frame aspect ratio or cropped to 16:9 widescreen as per the 2007 release. This release is available on standard Blu-ray and UHD Blu-ray, the latter also featuring optional HDR for both aspect ratios.\nTrack listing\nAll lead vocals by Freddie Mercury unless noted. Since the video is a compilation of two nights, the performance from which a specific song comes from has been noted, with some exceptions.\nCD\nPreviously unreleased songs are written in italic, note that they are not available in video format.\nDVD/Blu-ray\nRock Montreal (Video)\nSome footage is a mixture of camera shots from one night and audio recordings from the other night.
