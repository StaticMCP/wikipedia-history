Abel Aganbegyan) and delivers professional degree programs including 113 bachelor's programs, 11 specialist programs, nearly 150 master's programs and 7 vocational/associate degree programs. It is a Consultative body under the Government of Russian Federation.\nHistory\nThe Academy of National Economy under the Government of the Russian Federation was established in 1977. It provided business and educational programs and trained civil servants, entrepreneurs, financiers, and lawyers. By 2010 it produced over 100,000 graduates, among them presidents of post-soviet countries, prime ministers and businessmen (including Sergey Kiriyenko and Alexey Gordeyev).\nIn 1995 with its Resolution, the Russian Government granted the academy with the official status of the leading educational, methodological and research center in the system of training and qualification upgrading of the federal and regional civil servants, as well as the leading educational institution that carries out training of specialists in the area of the higher professional, postgraduate and complementary training. In 2010 by the decree of the Russian president, the Russian Academy of Public Administration as well as some regional universities joined ANE to form the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. Academy holds membership with a number of international education associations. Since 2024 the Time of Heroes program is implemented on the basis of the Senezh management workshop of the Higher School of Public Administration of academy.\nPeople affiliated with the academy\n* Abel Aganbegyan\n* German Gref\n* Santiago Iñiguez de Onzoño\n* Paul Judge\n* Manfred F.R.
