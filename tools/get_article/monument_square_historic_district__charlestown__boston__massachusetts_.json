The location is notable as the site of the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill, early in the American Revolutionary War.  Monument Square was laid out in the 19th century, when the Bunker Hill Monument (a National Historic Landmark) was erected there.  The park is framed by predominantly residential buildings built in the mid-19th century.\nThe district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in northern Boston, Massachusetts\nReferences"
