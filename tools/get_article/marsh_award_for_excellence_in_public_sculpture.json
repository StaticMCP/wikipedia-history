However awards have also been made to restorations of historic sculpture and in 2011 an award was made to the town of Harlow in Essex for its work in creating an environment for sculpture in the town and promoting this as Harlow Sculpture Town.\nThe Award Ceremony is held annually at the PMSA headquarters in Cowcross Street, London, every November, although in 2009 it was held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, when it was presented by Boris Johnson.\nThe PMSA also organises a biennial award for public fountains in association with the Marsh Christian Trust.
