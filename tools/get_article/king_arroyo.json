Its main tributary is East Fork King Arroyo. The two streams join southeast of La Junta. King Arroyo then continues north along the east side of La Junta before passing under Highway 50 and emptying into the Arkansas.\nName\nThe stream was likely named for Colonel John Quincy Adams King who operated a ferry over a ford on the Arkansas River just east of La Junta's city limits, which matches the location of King Arroyo. King's Ferry, as it was called, ran until 1875 when it was made obsolete by the arrival of the railroad.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Colorado\nReferences"
