It operates Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft moving personnel and equipment in the Middle East, recently from Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait. Its current status and duty location is undetermined.\nThe squadron was first activated as the 737th Bombardment Squadron in June 1943. After training in the United States with the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, it deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, participating in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its combat operations. Following V-E Day, it returned to the United States for conversion as a very heavy bomber unit, but was inactivated instead.\nThe squadron was activated in the reserves in 1947, but was not fully manned or equipped before inactivating in 1949. In 1952 it was redesignated the 737th Troop Carrier Squadron and again activated in the reserve, but was inactivated the following year and its personnel and equipment transferred to another unit. It was converted to provisional status in 2002 and assigned to Air Mobility Command. It was reassigned to ACC in 2003.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe squadron was first activated at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico in mid-1943 as the 737th Bombardment Squadron, one of the four Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombardment squadrons assigned to the 454th Bombardment Group. The unit trained under Second Air Force. After training in the United States, the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations in late 1943 and was stationed at San Giovanni Airfield under Fifteenth Air Force.\nThe unit engaged in very long range strategic bombardment of enemy military, industrial and transportation targets. It initially flew some interdiction and ground support missions, participating in the drive to Rome. Most operations included attacks against such objectives as marshalling yards, aircraft factories, railroad bridges, and airdromes in Italy, Austria, and Romania. The squadron was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for an attack on an airfield at Bad Vöslau, Austria on 12 April 1944. It helped to prepare the way for and supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, during July and August 1944. At the same time, expanded previous operations to include attacks on oil refineries and storage facilities, locomotive works, and viaducts in France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, and in the Balkans. It earned a second Distinguished Unit Citation on 25 July when the 454th Group led the 304th Bombardment Wing through severe opposition in an attack on steel factories at Linz, Austria.\nThe squadron returned to the United States after VE Day  in May 1945. It began to reorganize as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment squadron. It began training under Second Air Force in August 1945, but was inactivated in October after VJ Day.\nAir Force reserve\nThe squadron was activated as a reserve unit under Air Defense Command (ADC) at McChord Field, Washington in July 1947, where its training was supervised by the 406th AAF Base Unit (later the 2345th Air Force Reserve Training Center). It was nominally a heavy bomber unit, but it is not clear whether it was fully manned or had any combat aircraft assigned.\nIn 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC. The 737th was inactivated when ConAC reorganized its reserve units under the wing base organization system in June 1949. The squadron's personnel and equipment were transferred to elements of the 302d Troop Carrier Wing, which was simultaneously activated at McChord. This reorganization was also impacted by President Truman's reduced 1949 defense budget, which required reductions in the number of units in the Air Force.\nThe reserve mobilization for the Korean War had left the reserve without aircraft, and the reserves did not receive aircraft again until July 1952. In preparing for the receipt of aircraft, in June 1952, ConAC activated the 454th Troop Carrier Wing at Portland International Airport, Oregon to replace the 922d Reserve Training Wing, the non-flying headquarters for reserve units there.  The 737th was redesignated the 737th Troop Carrier Squadron and activated with the 454th Wing. It began training with Curtiss C-46 Commando transports. It was inactivated on 1 January 1953 with its personnel and equipment being reassigned to the 64th Troop Carrier Squadron when the 403d Troop Carrier Wing was released from active duty and replaced the 454th Wing as Portland's air reserve unit.\nExpeditionary airlift\nThe squadron was converted to provisional status and redesignated 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron. It was activated as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules airlift squadron, made up of multiple detachments from airlift squadrons which constantly rotate. It appeared to be located at Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait as part of the 386th Air Expeditionary Wing.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 737th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 14 May 1943\n: Activated on 1 June 1943\n: Redesignated 737th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy c. 1944\n: Redesignated 737th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 5 August 1945\n: Inactivated on 17 October 1945\n* Activated in the reserve on 12 July 1947\n: Inactivated on 27 June 1949\n* Redesignated 737th Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium on 26 May 1952\n: Activated in the reserve on 13 June 1952\n: Inactivated on 1 January 1953\n* Redesignated: 737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron and converted to provisional status on 12 June 2002\nAssignments\n* 454th Bombardment Group, 1 June 1943 - 17 October 1945\n* 454th Bombardment Group, 12 July 1947 - 27 June 1949\n* 454th Troop Carrier Group, 13 June 1952 - 1 January 1953\n* Air Mobility Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 12 June 2002\n* Air Combat Command to activate or inactivate as needed, 19 March 2003\n:: 386th Expeditionary Operations Group\nStations\n* Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, 1 June 1943\n* Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 1 July 1943\n* McCook Army Air Field, Nebraska, 31 July 1943\n* Charleston Army Air Field, South Carolina, 3 October–December 1943\n* Torretto Airfield, Italy 16 January 1944\n* San Giovanni Airfield, Italy 24 January 1944 – July 1945\n* Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 1 August 1945\n* Pyote Army Air Field, Texas, 17 August – 17 October 1945\n* McChord Field (later McChord Air Force Base), Washington, 12 July 1947 – 27 June 1949\n* Portland International Airport, Oregon, 13 June 1952 – 1 January 1953\n* Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait, unknown\nAircraft\n* Consolidated B-24 Liberator, 1943-1945\n* Curtiss C-46 Commando, 1952-1953\n|award_image4=AF MUA\n|award_name4=Air Force Meritorious Unit Award\n|award_date4=1 June 2010-31 May 2011\n|award_notes4=737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n|award_image5=AF MUA\n|award_name5=Air Force Meritorious Unit Award\n|award_date5=1 June 2011-31 May 2012\n|award_notes5=737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n|award_image6=AF MUA\n|award_name6=Air Force Meritorious Unit Award\n|award_date6=1 June 2015-31 May 2016\n|award_notes6=737th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
