The law was enacted on January 17, 2022.\nHistory\nSince the law has been enacted, Indigenous artisans in Mexico have brought complaints against corporations for appropriating traditional Indigenous designs. In 2022, Indigenous Oaxacan artists, including Mixtec artists, accused the US corporations J. Marie Collections and Tuckernuck of appropriating traditional Oaxacan huipil designs.\nSee also\n*Cultural appropriation\n*Indian arts and crafts laws\n**Cherokee Nation Truth in Advertising for Native Art\n**Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990\n*Indigenous intellectual property\n*Pretendian\n*Visual arts of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://itsartlaw.org/2023/04/27/innovations-in-protecting-art-and-design-placing-mexicos-recent-ban-on-cultural-appropriation-in-greater-context/ Innovations in Protecting Art and Design: Placing Mexico’s recent ban on cultural appropriation in greater context], Center for Art Law\n*[https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/legislation/details/21258 The Federal Law for the Protection of Cultural Heritage of Indigenous and Afro-Mexican Peoples and Communities (published in the Official Journal of the Federation on January 17, 2022), Mexico], World Intellectual Property Organization"
