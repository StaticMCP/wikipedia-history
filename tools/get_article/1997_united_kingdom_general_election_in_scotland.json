This would be the last UK general election to be contested in Scotland before the Scottish Parliament was established on 1 July 1999  following overwhelming public approval in a referendum.\nThe eleventh consecutive victory for Scottish Labour, this election gained notoriety for the fact that the Conservatives, led by then Prime Minister John Major, lost every single Scottish seat they had previously held, leaving no Conservative MPs from Scotland for the first time in British history.\nMPs\nList of MPs for constituencies in Scotland (1997–2001)\nTop target seats of the main parties\nLabour targets\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:550px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Rank\n! style=\"width:225px;\"|Constituency\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:175px;\"|Winning party 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Swing to gain\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Labour's place 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Result\n|-\n|1\n|Ayr\n|\n|0.1\n|2nd\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|2\n|Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber\n|\n|0.45\n|2nd\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|3\n|Stirling\n|\n|0.75\n|2nd\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|4\n|Aberdeen South\n|\n|1.85\n|2nd\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|5\n|Edinburgh Pentlands\n|\n|4.8\n|2nd\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|}\nSNP targets\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:550px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Rank\n! style=\"width:225px;\"|Constituencee\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:175px;\"|Winning party 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Swing to gain\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|SNP's place 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Result\n|-\n|1\n|Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber\n|\n|0.65\n|3rd\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|2\n|Perth\n|\n|2.1\n|2nd\n|SNP Gain\n|-\n|3\n|Galloway and Upper Nithsdale\n|\n|2.75\n|2nd\n|SNP Gain\n|-\n|4\n|North Tayside\n|\n|4.6\n|2nd\n|SNP Gain\n|-\n|}\nConservative targets\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:550px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Rank\n! style=\"width:225px;\"|Constituency\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:175px;\"|Winning party 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Swing to gain\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Con place 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Result\n|-\n|1\n|Gordon\n|\n|0.2\n|2nd\n|LD hold\n|-\n|2\n|Angus East\n|\n|1\n|2nd\n|SNP hold\n|-\n|3\n|Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber\n|\n|1.7\n|4th\n|Lab Gain\n|-\n|4\n|West Renfrewshire\n|\n|1.85\n|2nd\n|Lab hold\n|-\n|5\n|Edinburgh Central\n|\n|2.7\n|2nd\n|Lab hold\n|-\n|6\n|Moray\n|\n|3.1\n|2nd\n|SNP hold\n|-\n|7\n|Strathkelvin and Bearsden\n|\n|3.1\n|2nd\n|Lab hold\n|-\n|8\n|Cunninghame North\n|\n|3.45\n|2nd\n|Lab hold\n|-\n|9\n|Argyll and Bute\n|\n|3.6\n|2nd\n|LD hold\n|-\n|10\n|North East Fife\n|\n|3.95\n|2nd\n|LD hold\n|-\n|11\n|Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale\n|\n|4.1\n|2nd\n|LD hold\n|-\n|12\n|Banff and Buchan\n|\n|4.45\n|2nd\n|SNP hold\n|-\n|13\n|Edinburgh South\n|\n|4.7\n|2nd\n|Lab hold\n|}\nLiberal Democrat targets\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:550px\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Rank\n! style=\"width:225px;\"|Constituency\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:175px;\"|Winning party 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Swing to gain\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|LD's place 1992\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Result\n|-\n|1\n|Edinburgh West\n|\n|0.6\n|2nd\n|LD Gain\n|-\n|2\n|West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine\n|\n|4.3\n|2nd\n|LD Gain\n|}\nResults\nBelow is a table summarising the results of the 1997 general election in Scotland.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party\n! colspan=\"5\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"5\" | Aggregate votes\n|-\n!Total !!

By contrast the Liberal Democrats won 13% of votes cast, but  won ten seats, a net gain of one on the previous election. The SNP finished second in terms of vote share with 22%, but only won six seats. Labour won 45.6% of the vote and 56 seats, a net gain of seven on 1992. The defeated Conservative included three cabinet ministers: the Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Forsyth lost Stirling to Labour, the Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind lost Edinburgh Pentlands, also to Labour,  while Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, lost Galloway and Upper Nithsdale to the SNP.\nNotes\nReferences"
