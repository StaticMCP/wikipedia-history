Amid some music industry criticism over the proposed competition of awards ceremonies, CRIA backed down from its own ceremonies in February 1974, about a month after the Maple Music Awards were announced. However, this situation forced Juno Awards founder Walt Grealis to prepare for television coverage of the 1975 Juno Awards.\nNominees and winners\nBest Female Vocalist\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Shirley Eikhard\n* Patsy Gallant\n* Susan Jacks\n* Ginette Reno\nBest Male Vocalist\nWinner: Terry Jacks\nOther nominees:\n* Keith Hampshire\n* Gordon Lightfoot\n* Bob McBride\n* Murray McLauchlan\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Cathy Young\nOther nominees:\n* Linda Brown\n* Donna Moon\n* Marie Claire Seguin\n* Donna Warner\n* Nancy White\nThere were a total of six nominees announced in this category, compared with the normal five nominees in other categories.
