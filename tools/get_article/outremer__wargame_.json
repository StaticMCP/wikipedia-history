Each fighter has four counters representing the character with full health, wounded, stunned and dead.\nScenarios\nRather than including predetermined scenarios in the game box, Outremer uses a scenario generation system.\nPublication history\nThe Cry Havoc system was designed by Gary Chalk and published by the British company Standard Games in 1981. This was followed by Siege (1983), which added rules for castle and town sieges; a medieval Japanese expansion, Samurai Blades (1984); and Outremer in 1985, which featured cover art by Peter Dennis.\nJeux Rexton and then Eurogames published a French-language edition of Outremer.\nReception\nIn Issue 85 of Dragon, Ken Rolston liked the Cry Havoc system, saying, \"The presentation is superb in every way, with the possible exception of the thin cardboard the counters are printed on. The rules are clear and\nunambiguous ... The value of is in the beauty of its presentation, the charm of its medieval atmosphere, and the appeal of its simple mass combat systems.\"\nIn Issue 27 of Fire & Movement, Peter Hatton commented, \"Strikingly beautiful graphics characterize this game of\nman-to-man combat ... a kit no medieval warrior should be without.\"\nIn a retrospective review in Issue 21 of Simulacrum, Joe Scoleri noted, \"The Cry Havoc series is a set of colorful and\nfast moving games in which large doses of Hollywood and heroism take precedence over strict historical accuracy ... The counters and the maps immediately distinguish the series with their stellar artwork.\"\nReferences"
