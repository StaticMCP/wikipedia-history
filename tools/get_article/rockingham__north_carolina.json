The population was 9,243 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Richmond County.\nDowntown Rockingham is currently being revitalized as a part of a ten-year plan named \"Shaping Our Future: 2023\". The city is currently experiencing an economic boom, with new businesses opening in the downtown area.\nHistory\nThe city was named for Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, British Prime Minister from 1765 to 1766 and again in 1782.  Rockingham's administration was dominated by the issue of the Thirteen Colonies. Rockingham wanted to repeal the Stamp Act 1765 and won a Commons vote in 1766 on the repeal resolution by 275 to 167.  As a result, he was a popular figure among British colonists in America (who would later become known simply as \"Americans\"). People in North Carolina were still sympathetic toward him in the years following the United States gaining independence.\nDuring the early 19th century, numerous families from here migrated to Middle Tennessee, settling in what is now Nolensville. They quickly established their new community.\nIn 1950, the town fielded a professional minor league baseball team in the Class D Tobacco State League, the Rockingham Eagles. The club won the playoff title in their only season before disbanding with the entire league.\nRockingham has a number of historic buildings which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since the late 1970s: the Bank of Pee Dee Building, Covington Plantation House, Alfred Dockery House, Hannah Pickett Mill No. 1, Manufacturers Building, Richmond County Courthouse, Roberdel Mill No. 1 Company Store, Rockingham Historic District, U.S. Post Office and Federal Building, and H.
