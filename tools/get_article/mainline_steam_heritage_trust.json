Regular day excursions and multi-day tours are operated over rail lines throughout New Zealand. Excursions are operated by the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch branches.\nAbout\nThe Trust began in October 1988 after the Ferrymead 125 events in Christchurch. Based around the collection of steam locomotives that were privately owned by Ian Welch, the first of which had just begun operating on the mainline with J 1211 with an excursion to Timaru and Arthurs Pass double-heading with the Glenbrook Vintage Railway's JA 1250.\nDepots operated by the Mainline Steam Trust included Parnell, (Auckland) Middleton and later Plimmerton. The Auckland depot used to be based in the former Parnell diesel depot. It was in the past the organisation's primary restoration base and most of Mainline Steam's currently active locomotives were restored there. It was closed in 2015. Mainline Steam are developing a new depot at Mercer.\nThe Wellington depot, located at Plimmerton, is a purpose-built building that replaced the formerly leased Upper Hutt goods shed. It has now become the primary restoration base for the organisation. The depot in Christchurch is a former industrial building that used to be located at Studholme, it was relocated to land on the premises of CWF Hamilton. As of 2021, the trust was given notice to vacate the current Christchurch depot and is now building a new site at Midland Rail Heritage Trust's own lines and land in Springfield.\nMainline Steam is notable for having imported a number of African steam locomotives from South Africa and Zimbabwe (including a GMA/M Garratt), with more South African locomotives still overseas. It has also imported former British Rail Mark 2 carriages for use on its steam-hauled excursions and is in the process of overhauling them for New Zealand use. The organisation regularly operates excursions out of Auckland and Christchurch, the latter operating excursions primarily along the highly scenic Midland Line. Mainline Steam also has a number of diesel and electric locomotives in its care.\nHeritage locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Key:\n|bgcolor=#F5D26C|In service\n|bgcolor=#89E579| In service, Main Line-certified\n|bgcolor=#f4a460| Under overhaul/Restoration\n|bgcolor=#DED7B6|Stored\n|bgcolor=#B7A4EB|Static display\n|bgcolor=#cecece|Scrapped\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

In September 1996 it was steamed for two  open days at Parnell. Further work commenced with a conversion from a coal to oil fuel and the fabrication of a new air brake stand. This work was stalled due to the restoration of 24 class 3260 and no work has been done since that time because of the reality that it is too large for the New Zealand railway loading gauge. The locomotive actually comprises the front engine unit of GMA/M 4126, the rear engine unit of GMA/M 4088 and the boiler unit of GMA/M 4083.

These wagons are largely of the UC class, although there is one example of each of the UCA and URK wagons preserved. The group also has a number of KP, ZA, and ZL class box wagons for use as secure storage for locomotive and carriage parts, along with several other general-use goods wagons.\nWagons\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Key:\n|bgcolor=#F5D26C|In service\n|bgcolor=#89E579|In service, Mainline Certified\n|bgcolor=#f4a460|Under overhaul/restoration\n|bgcolor=#DED7B6|Stored\n|bgcolor=#B7A4EB|Static display\n|bgcolor=#cecece|Scrapped\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
