The compilation focuses on Steppenwolf’s Dunhill recordings, with the bulk of material coming from their Steppenwolf through At Your Birthday Party albums.  While generally regarded as a solid representation of Steppenwolf’s early-period proto-metal work from the 1960s, there were no new tracks or previously unreleased songs included.  It includes liner notes by Joseph Laredo and was digitally remastered by Erick Labson (MCA Music Media Studios, North Hollywood, California).  It was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 29, 2004, the first output by Steppenwolf to earn such a designation since 16 Greatest Hits went gold on April 12, 1971.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*John Kay&nbsp;– lead vocals, guitar\n*Jerry Edmonton&nbsp;– drums, vocals\n*Goldy McJohn&nbsp;– organ, vocals\n*Michael Monarch&nbsp;– guitar, vocals\n*Rushton Moreve&nbsp;– bass, vocals\n*Nick St. Nicholas&nbsp;– bass, vocals\n*Larry Byrom&nbsp;– guitar, vocals\n*George Biondo&nbsp;– bass, vocals\n*Kent Henry&nbsp;– guitar, vocals\nReferences"
