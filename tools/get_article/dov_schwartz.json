In 2015, he was awarded the Emet Prize in Jewish Thought, and he received the Israel Prize in Jewish Thought for the year 2023.\nBiography\nSchwartz was born and raised in Haifa as the only child of Holocaust survivors. He attended both Yavne High School () and the Reali School () alternately, and was an active member of the Bnei Akiva youth movement. He continued his studies at Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh, where he authored several articles on the thought of Rabbi David Cohen (known as \"The Nazir\").\nCareer\nIn 1986, Schwartz began his studies at Bar-Ilan University. During his second year, he was unexpectedly appointed to teach three courses in place of an ailing lecturer. Approximately four years after commencing his academic studies, he completed his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of Professor Abraham Noriel, entitled \"The Philosophical–Religious Thought of Rabbi Samuel ibn Seneh Zarza\". He later served as the head of the Department of Jewish Philosophy at Bar-Ilan University and as the dean of its Faculty of Humanities.\nSchwartz has authored over 30 books and around 200 articles. His work spans a wide range of periods in Jewish thought—from medieval thinkers to modern Jewish philosophy and postmodern perspectives. His primary research interests include medieval Jewish philosophy, the thought of Religious Zionism, and Chabad Hasidism, among others.\nSome of his innovative ideas initially sparked controversy but were later embraced in academic circles. For example, his assertion that Rabbi Kook’s thought should be understood as part of an intellectual circle—including his close disciples (his son Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook, Rabbi David Cohen, and Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlap)—challenged the prevailing view at the Hebrew University, which maintained that Rabbi Kook's ideas should be considered separately from those of his followers. In his writings, Schwartz generally seeks to identify a common ideological denominator among various thinkers and eras to better understand their contributions.\nIn his books and articles on Religious Zionism, Schwartz argues that a deep understanding of the movement requires familiarity with its theological roots and early thinkers. He has also extensively examined the thought of Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik and currently heads the chair for teaching his thought at Bar-Ilan University.\nPersonal life\nSchwartz lives in Givat Shmuel with his wife, Gila, and their six children.\nAwards\nand Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu]]\n* 1999: Aminoah Award of Hapo`el Hamizrahi, for The Theology of the Religious Zionist Movement.
