The ceremony was held on 31 May 2025 at the Hackney Empire theatre in Hackney, London, and was broadcast on ITV1, ITVX and STV on 5 June 2025. After ITV cancelled the 2024 ceremony for undisclosed reasons, this marked the return of the awards after two years. Jane McDonald returned as presenter, having previously replaced disgraced former presenter Phillip Schofield in 2023.\nThe publicly voted categories were announced on 7 April 2025, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Leading Performer accolade, which included four cast members from each respective soap. The British Soap Award for Best Comedy Performance was also turned to a publicly-voted accolade for the first time. The shortlist, including panel nominations, were released on 1 May 2025. Despite falling within the eligibility period, transmitting its final episode in November 2024, the ceremony marks the first since 2002 that BBC the medical soap opera Doctors was not considered for the awards.\nEastEnders dominated the ceremony with eight wins, including Best British Soap, as well winning the other publicly-voted awards and four panel-voted awards. Hollyoaks won three panel-voted awards, while David Neilson won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for 30 years of playing Roy Cropper in Coronation Street. The Tony Warren Award was given to Emmerdale cameraman Mike Plant.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Award\n! Winner\n! Shortlisted\n!
