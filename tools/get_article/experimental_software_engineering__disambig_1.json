A number of [https://shape-of-code.com/2021/10/24/evidence-based-se-groups-doing-interesting-work-2021-version/ research groups] primarily use empirical and experimental techniques.\nThe term empirical software engineering emphasizes the use of empirical studies of all kinds to accumulate knowledge.  Methods used include experiments, case studies, surveys, and using whatever data is available.\nEmpirical software engineering research\nIn a keynote at the [http://www.esem-conferences.org/ International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement] Prof. Wohlin recommended ten commitments that the research community should follow to increase the relevance and impact of empirical software engineering research. However, at the same conference Dr. Ali effectively argued that solely following these will not be enough and we need to do more than just show the evidence substantiating the claimed benefits of our interventions but instead what is required for practical relevance and potential impact is the evidence for cost-effectiveness.\nThe [http://isern.iese.de/ International Software Engineering Research Network (ISERN)] is a global community of research groups who are active in experimental software engineering. Its purpose is to advance the practice of and foster university and industry collaborations within experimental software engineering. ISERN holds annual meetings in conjunction with the [http://www.esem-conferences.org/ International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM)] conference.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Victor Basili, Richard W.
