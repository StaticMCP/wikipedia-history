      "text": "# Queen Emma Bridge\n\n}}\nThe Queen Emma Bridge (; ) is a pontoon bridge across St. Anna Bay on Curaçao island in the Dutch Caribbean. It connects the Punda and Otrobanda quarters of the capital city, Willemstad. It was named after Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, who was queen consort of the Netherlands during its construction. The bridge is hinged and opens regularly to enable the passage of oceangoing vessels. On the opposite end from the hinge is a small shelter where an operator controls two diesel engines turning propellers. The propellers are mounted perpendicular to the length of the bridge and allow it to swing parallel to the shore. The process only takes a few minutes to complete.\nFile:De Emmabrug in Willemstad, Curaçao, met zicht op Otrobanda, Bestanddeelnr 252-3106.jpg|The bridge, closed and with car traffic\nFile:De Emmabrug in Willemstad, Curaçao, met zicht op Otrobanda, Bestanddeelnr 252-3109.jpg|The bridge, beginning to open\nFile:Uitzicht over de St. Annabaai in Willemstad.

The lighting arches were installed in 1955, to celebrate the royal visit of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard.\nOriginally a toll bridge from 1901-1934, individuals without shoes were permitted to cross the bridge without paying the toll. When the bridge swings open, two ferries spring into action to bring pedestrians across the water. The ferries are also free of charge. Motor vehicle traffic ceased in 1974 when all such traffic was diverted to the newly opened Queen Juliana Bridge, and the bridge became pedestrian-only.  Locally, the bridge is known as the \"Swinging Old Lady\" because of how it literally swings open to the Otrabanda side of Willemstad.\nGallery\nFile:Historical marker for the construction of Queen Emma Bridge.jpg|Historical marker for the construction of Queen Emma Bridge\nFile:Historical marker for the restoration of Queen Emma Bridge.jpg|Historical marker for the restoration of Queen Emma Bridge\nFile:Queen Emma Bridge signals.jpg|Queen Emma Bridge signals explanation\nFile:Queen Emma Bridge operator's cabin.jpg|Queen Emma Bridge operator's cabin\nFile:View of ferry station and Queen Emma Bridge.jpg|View of ferry station and Queen Emma Bridge with operator's cabin on the left\nFile:View of Otrobanda, Willemstad, Curaçao - February 2020.jpg|View of Otrobanda from Queen Emma Bridge\nFile:Queen Emma Bridge and Handelskade, Willemstad, Curaçao - February 2020 - 01.jpg|View of Punda with Queen Emma Bridge\nFile:Queen Emma Bridge and Handelskade, Willemstad, Curaçao - February 2020 - 02.jpg|View of Handelskade with Queen Emma Bridge\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
