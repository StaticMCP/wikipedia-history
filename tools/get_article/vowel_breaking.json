It may be triggered by the presence of another sound, by stress, or in no particular way.\nAssimilation\nVowel breaking is sometimes defined as a subtype of diphthongization, when it refers to harmonic (assimilatory) process that involves diphthongization triggered by a following vowel or consonant.\nThe original pure vowel typically breaks into two segments. The first segment matches the original vowel, and the second segment is harmonic with the nature of the triggering vowel or consonant. For example, the second segment may be  (a back vowel) if the following vowel or consonant is back (such as velar or pharyngeal), and the second segment may be  (a front vowel) if the following vowel or consonant is front (such as palatal).\nThus, vowel breaking, in the restricted sense, can be viewed as an example of assimilation of a vowel to a following vowel or consonant.\nUnconditioned\nVowel breaking is sometimes not assimilatory and is then not triggered by a neighboring sound. That was the case with the Great Vowel Shift in English in which all cases of  and  changed to diphthongs.\nStress\nVowel breaking sometimes occurs only in stressed syllables. For instance, Vulgar Latin open-mid  and  changed to diphthongs only when they were stressed.\nIndo-European languages\nEnglish\nVowel breaking is a very common sound change in the history of the English language, occurring at least three times (with some varieties adding a fourth) listed here in reverse chronological order:\nSouthern American English\nVowel breaking is characteristic of the \"Southern drawl\" of Southern American English, where the short front vowels have developed a glide up to [j], and then in some areas back down to schwa: pat , pet , pit .\nGreat Vowel Shift\nThe Great Vowel Shift changed the long vowels  to diphthongs, which became Modern English .\n* Old English  > Modern English ice\n* Old English  > Modern English house\nMiddle English\nIn early Middle English, a vowel  was inserted between a front vowel and a following  (pronounced  in this context), and a vowel  was inserted between a back vowel and a following  (pronounced  in this context).\nThat is a prototypical example of the narrow sense of \"vowel breaking\" as described above: the original vowel breaks into a diphthong that assimilates to the following consonant, gaining a front  before a palatal consonant and  before a velar consonant.\nOld English\nIn Old English, two forms of harmonic vowel breaking occurred: breaking and retraction and back mutation.\nIn prehistoric Old English, breaking and retraction changed stressed short and long front vowels i, e, æ to short and long diphthongs spelled io, eo, ea when followed by h or by r, l + another consonant (short vowels only), and sometimes w (only for certain short vowels):\n* Proto-Germanic  > Anglo-Frisian  > Old English  \"fall\"\n* PG  > OE  \"earth\"\n* PG  > OE  \"learn\"\nIn late prehistoric Old English, back mutation changed short front i, e, æ to short diphthongs spelled io, eo, ea before a back vowel in the next syllable if the intervening consonant was of a certain nature. The specific nature of the consonants that trigger back umlaut or block it varied from dialect to dialect.\nOld Norse\nProto-Germanic stressed short e becomes ja or (before u) jǫ regularly in Old Norse except after w, r, l. Examples are:\n* PG  \"I\" → (east) ON , Swedish , Danish and Norwegian Bokmål , and Icelandic  →  (but Jutlandic æ, a, Nynorsk ).\n** Faroese has both. The standard form is , while the dialects of Suðuroy have .\n* PG  \"heart\" → ON , Swedish , Faroese , Norwegian Nynorsk , Danish\n* PG  \"earth\" → Proto-Norse  → ON , Swedish, Danish, Norwegian , Faroese\nAccording to some scholars, the diphthongisation of e is an unconditioned sound change, whereas other scholars speak about epenthesis or umlaut.\nGerman and Yiddish\nThe long high vowels of Middle High German underwent breaking during the transition to Early New High German:  → . In Yiddish, the diphthongization affected the long mid vowels as well:  →\n* MHG  → NHG ,  (\"eternal\")\n* MHG  → NHG ,  (\"high\")\n* MHG  → NHG ,  (\"nice\")\n* MHG  → NHG ,  (\"to cut\")\n* MHG  → NHG ,  (\"friend\")\n* MHG  → NHG ,  (\"skin\")\nThis change started as early as the 12th century in Upper Bavarian and reached Moselle Franconian only in the 16th century. It did not affect Alemannic or Ripuarian dialects, which still retain the original long vowels.\nIn Yiddish, the diphthongization applied not only to MHG long vowels but also to  in words of Hebrew (in stressed open syllables) or Slavic origin:\n*  →  (\"Pesach\")\n*  →  (\"menorah\")\n* Old Czech: chřěn →  (\"chrain\")\n*  →  (\"basket\")\nScottish Gaelic\nVowel breaking is present in Scottish Gaelic with the following changes occurring often but variably between dialects: Archaic Irish  → Scottish Gaelic  and Archaic Irish  → Scottish Gaelic   Specifically, central dialects have more vowel breaking than others.\nRomance languages\nMany Romance languages underwent vowel breaking. The Vulgar Latin open vowels e  and o  in stressed position underwent breaking only in open syllables in French and Italian, but in both open and closed syllables in Spanish. Vowel breaking was mostly absent in Catalan, in which  and  became diphthongs only before a palatal consonant: Latin coxa 'thigh', octō 'eight', lectum 'bed' > Old Catalan , , . The middle vowel was subsequently lost if a triphthong was produced: Modern Catalan cuixa, vuit, llit (cf. Portuguese coxa, oito, leito). Vowel breaking was completely absent in Portuguese. The result of breaking varies between languages: e and o became ie and ue in Spanish, ie and uo in Italian and ie and eu  in French.\nIn the table below, words with breaking are bolded.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

B śāw-, śāy- (but Skt. jīvá-, Lat. vīvus)\n* PIE  →  \"front side\" → Gk.  prósōpon \"face\", Toch. B pratsāko \"breast\" (but Skt. prátīka-)\n* PIE  →  \"long\" → Gk.  dērós, Arm. *twār → erkar (Skt. dūrá-, Lat. dūrus).\nHowever, the hypothesis has not been widely adopted.\nAustronesian languages\nSome languages in Sumatra have vowel breaking processes, almost exclusively in syllable-final position. In Minangkabau, the Proto-Malayic vowels *i and *u are broken to ia and ua before word-final *h, *k, *l, *ŋ, *r (*təlur > *təluar > talua \"egg\"). In Rejang, the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian vowels *ə, i, and u are broken to êa, ea, and oa before any of word-final consonants above except *k and *ŋ (*tənur > *tənoar > tênoa \"egg\"). This process has been transphonologized by loss of *l and *r and merging of several word-final consonants into a glottal stop (*p, *t, *k in Minangkabau, or *k, *h in most dialects of Rejang except Kebanagung).\nWord-final Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *-i and *-u were also broken in Sumatra. In Rejang, these vowels are broken into -ai and -au in Pesisir dialect, or into -êi and -êu elsewhere.\nAlthough Acehnese is also spoken in Sumatra, the entire Chamic family has undergone vowel breaking separately. Final open *-i and *-u were broken in Proto-Chamic into *-ɛy and *-ɔw. However, they remained when closed by another consonant (final *-r was lost in native words). The following are the outcomes for the diphthongs:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Acehnese\n! Rade\n! Jarai\n! Chru\n! Northern Roglai\n! Tsat\n! Western Cham\n!

In Acehnese, *a: normally became ɯə, but when preceded by a nasal, it became ɯ instead.\nSee also\n*Smoothing (phonetics)\n*Unpacking (linguistics)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Crowley, Terry.
