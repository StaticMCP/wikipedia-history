It is located in the Central Business District, adjacent to the Caesars Superdome. The arena opened in 1999 as New Orleans Arena and has been home to the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA) since 2002. The New Orleans VooDoo of the Arena Football League played their home games in the arena from 2004 until the team disbanded in 2008. The VooDoo resumed play at the arena in March 2011, until after the 2015 AFL season when the franchise folded.\nArena information\nThe arena was completed in 1999 at a cost of $114 million and officially opened on October 19, 1999. The arena seats 17,805 for concerts, 16,867 for Pelicans games, 18,500 for college basketball and Pelicans playoff games, and 16,900 for ice hockey and arena football. It has 2,800 club seats and 56 luxury suites.\nThe arena as a concert venue can seat 7,500 for half-stage shows, 17,221 for end-stage shows and 17,805 for a center-stage shows.

The ceiling is 65 feet (20 m) to beam and roof, 70 feet (21.5 m) to the top of the arena.\nHistory\nLogo as New Orleans Arena, 1999–2014\nIn 1999, the arena's first tenant, the New Orleans Brass ice hockey team of the ECHL played their first home game in the arena. The team played their final three seasons in the arena.  When the New Orleans Hornets arrived in 2002, they persuaded the state government to demand that the Brass foot the cost of converting the arena between basketball and hockey configurations.  That expense was more than the Brass were willing to pay, and they were forced to fold due to the lack of another suitable arena.\nThe Hornets played their first game at the Smoothie King Center versus the Utah Jazz on October 30, 2002. The Jazz had called New Orleans home from 1974 to 1979.\nThe New Orleans VooDoo, of the Arena Football League (AFL), began playing their home games in the arena in February 2004.\nFollowing Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, medical operations that had previously been housed in the Superdome were moved to the Arena. Medical personnel had been working in an area of the Superdome with poor lighting, leaking ceilings, and soggy carpet. The Arena's design was tested in 1996 by CPP, a wind engineering consulting firm, so it fared far better than the Superdome during the storm and was in better condition to house sensitive medical operations.  Thus, unlike the Superdome, the Arena reopened to activities only one month after the storm. On March 8, 2006, the Hornets played their first home game at the arena since Hurricane Katrina and the start of the 2005–06 season. A sellout crowd of 17,744 watched the Los Angeles Lakers defeat the Hornets, 113–107.\nIn 2006, the arena installed an LED centerhung video and scoring system from Daktronics. The centerhung installation is made up of two ring displays and eight video displays, as well as scoreboards. This installation is fully integrated with the more than  of ribbon display technology that was installed in the arena in 2002. In the summer of 2008, new Daktronics \"see-through\" shot clocks were installed, replacing the existing box units.\nThe New Orleans VooDoo of the Arena Football League resumed play at the arena in March 2011.\nIn 2013, the arena underwent a significant upgrade. The 2013 renovations were primarily focused on the gameday experience inside the arena. These upgrades include updates to the suites and club levels, expanding the club levels, creating new Loge Boxes, and a new Party Perch. Other upgrades include upgraded concession stands, upgraded LED boards, and other in-house amenities for the teams and performers that use the arena.[https://www.bourbonstreetshots.com/2013/10/21/tour-of-the-renovated-new-orleans-arena/ Tour of Renovated New Orleans Arena | New Orleans Pelicans | BourbonStreetShots.com]\nOn February 5, 2014, it was announced that a 10-year agreement was reached to rename New Orleans Arena the Smoothie King Center prior to the 2014 NBA All-Star Game.\nIn September and October 2014, exterior renovations were made to the Smoothie King Center, including new entrances, painting the center from bluish green to light gray, and a new outer LED lighting system similar to the Mercedes-Benz Superdome's own.
