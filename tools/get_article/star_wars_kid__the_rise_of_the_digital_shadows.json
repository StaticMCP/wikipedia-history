The film explores the concept of the digital shadow, or the traces of a person's past internet activity that can be recovered to follow them around for years or even decades later, through revisiting the story of Ghyslain Raza, a Canadian man who unwittingly became one of the first-ever viral videos as the \"Star Wars Kid\".\nThe film received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Biography or Arts Documentary Program or Series at the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
