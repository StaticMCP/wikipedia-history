It was led by liberal sectors and merchants opposed to the dictatorial regime of President Buenaventura Báez, who had centralized political and economic power in the capital, Santo Domingo. The revolution culminated in the establishment of a provisional government in Santiago and later with the fall of Báez.\nThe insurgent movement was notable for its defense of democratic and federal principles, while promoting a redistribution of political power among the country's different regions. It had the support of important civilian and military figures from the Cibao, including José Desiderio Valverde and Benigno Filomeno de Rojas, who played fundamental roles in the organization and leadership of the insurrection.

Although short-lived, its impact was decisive in the evolution of the national political system, as it led to the fall of an authoritarian regime and set a precedent for future regional conflicts and debates over the structure of the Dominican Republic.\nReferences"
