He was one of the few U.S. Army officers who was a veteran of both the American Revolution and the War of 1812. He was a Federalist.\nBiography\nHe was born in the West Farms Society of Norwich, Connecticut, on July 6, 1756, to Nathaniel and Sarah Hill Kingsbury.\nAmerican Revolutionary War\nAged 19, he enlisted in the 8th Connecticut Regiment on July 11, 1775. The 8th Connecticut Regiment was part of the Continental Army during the Siege of Boston. Kingsbury was promoted to corporal prior to the Regiment's disbandment on December 16, 1775.\nKingsbury remained in the Continental Army when it was reorganized in January 1776. He was promoted to sergeant and then was commissioned an ensign in Webb's Additional Continental Regiment on April 26, 1780. He served until the Continental Army was disbanded on November 3, 1783. After the war, he became an original member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati.-\nPost Revolution\nAfter a break in service of almost four years, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the First American Regiment (today known as the 3rd Infantry Regiment) on October 15, 1787. He served in the ill-fated campaigns of Colonel Josiah Harmar in 1790 and General Arthur St. Clair in 1791 against the Miami Tribe in what is modern-day Ohio.\nOn January 10 and 11, 1791, Kingsbury distinguished himself at the Siege of Dunlap's Station, where he led a detachment of only 12 soldiers, along with a few settlers, in defending a small outpost against a far superior force of Native Americans. Following St. Clair's Defeat in November 1791, he was promoted to captain in April 1792 retroactive to December 28, 1791.\nKingsbury was assigned to the 1st Sub-Legion when the army was re-organized in 1792 and commanded the 3rd Sub-Legion of the United States in the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, which decisively defeated the Native Americans in Ohio.Gaff, Alan D (2004), ''Bayonets in the Wilderness: Anthony Wayne's Legion in the Old Northwest. Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press. p. 304.- Winkler, John F (2013), Fallen Timbers 1794: The US Army's First Victory, Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing. p. 20, 49.  When the army was re-organized in 1796, the 1st Sub-Legion reverted to being designated as the 1st Infantry Regiment.\nKingsbury was promoted to major of the 1st Infantry Regiment in 1797 and lieutenant colonel of the Second Infantry Regiment in 1803.\nEarly in 1802, he was assigned to command Fort Wilkinson in Georgia, where he was under the command of Brigadier General James Wilkinson.\nIn 1805, he established Fort Belle Fontaine on the Missouri River and was there until he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of the 1st Infantry in 1808.\nIn 1807, Kingsbury was elected to membership in the United States Military Philosophical Society, which was the first professional association of officers of the United States Army.\nWar of 1812\nDuring the War of 1812, Kingsbury was appointed to command the defenses of Newport, Rhode Island. He was inspector general for Military District No. 2 (comprising the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island) from April 8, 1813, to October 31, 1814. He was among the American officers leading the American defense in Lyme, Connecticut during the April 9, 1814 raid on Essex, Connecticut.  While serving as inspector general, command of Connecticut's military forces temporarily devolved onto him in May 1814 after Brigadier General Henry Burbeck was removed from command of District No. 2. Kingsbury was succeeded in command of the district in July 1814 by Brigadier General Thomas Humphrey Cushing.\nAt the end of the war, Colonel Kingsbury was discharged from the Army on June 15, 1815, after 36 years of service.\nHe died on July 1, 1837, at his home in Franklin, Connecticut.
