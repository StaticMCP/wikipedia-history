Trade unions developed during colonialism. After Congo became independent, three trade union confederations formed:\n* Congolese Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CCSL; ) – socialist\n* General African Confederation of Workers (CGAT; ) – communist\n* African Confederation of Worker Believers (CATC; ) – Christian\nIn 1960, leaders of the communist CGAT were arrested for attempting to form a revolutionary party. The first president of Congo, Fulbert Youlou wanted a single trade union confederation that was aligned with his political party. When Youlou declined the trade union confederations' suggestion of a Trade Union Merger Committee as an interim solution, the trade unions organized a 3-day general strike in August 1963, leading to the downfall of the Youlou government. The provisional government of Alphonse Massamba-Débat carried out the original plan, merging the political parties into the MNR and consolidating the confederations into the provisional Congolese Trade Union Confederation (CSC; ). After Débat was elected president, leaders of CATC and CGAT were given prominent political posts in the MNR party.\nShortly before the inaugural congress of the CSC, CATC dropped out and subsequently was not represented on the executive. The executive consisted of 3 representatives from CGAT, 3 from CCSL, 1 from the civil servant association and 1 from the postal workers' federation. The CATC president was imprisoned and its general secretary went into exile.\nSee also\n* Trade unions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences\nExternal links"
