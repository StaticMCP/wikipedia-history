There were suggestions to rebuild the 1928 Nicola Street Crystal Pool before the Games committee decided that the University of British Columbia (UBC) would benefit from a new $300,000 open air pool. The pool was constructed on time to host the British Empire and Commonwealth Games aquatics programme.\nThe pool was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and remained as the University's primary swimming venue for the swim team known as the Thunderbirds. In 1978 when the Aquatic Centre opened, it continued to host swim meetings concurrently with the Aquatic Centre.\nIn 2014, it no longer met modern requirements, being too shallow and requiring continual maintenance it was closed and demolished shortly after its 60th anniversary, making way for a new $38.5-million Aquatic Centre that opened in 2017.\nReferences"
