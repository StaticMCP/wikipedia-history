The committee, founded in Fuzhou on August 14, 1968, received permission from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, replacing the Fourth Fujian Provincial People's Congress.\nThe committee was a tripartite entity consisting of representatives from the military, local officials, and the populace. It amalgamated the roles of the CCP and the state, exercising centralized control over administration, law, and the judiciary within a framework of \"unified leadership.\"\nHistory\nIn March 1971, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recommenced its operations, signifying a delineation between Party and governmental tasks. The Revolutionary Committee originally consisted of 147 members. Han Xianchu held the position of director, while Pi Dingjun, Lan Rongyu, Wu Hongxiang, Ye Song, Huang Yaguang, Zhuang Zhipeng, Tian Yumin, Hong Xiuzong, Zheng Huopai, and Wang Yunji served as deputy directors. The provincial military control commission was disbanded upon its creation.\nThroughout the years, the committee's leadership had multiple transitions. In November 1969, Pi Dingjun was reassigned, and Zhuo Xiong was designated as deputy director. In August 1972, Ye Song was dismissed from his role. In December 1973, Han Xianchu was transferred to the Lanzhou Military Region, and in November 1974, Liao Zhigao was designated as the committee director. In January 1975, the First Session of the 4th National People's Congress revised the Constitution, designating provincial revolutionary committees as both permanent entities of the people's congress and provincial governments.\nIn June 1975, the central authorities designated Li Mintang, Jia Jiumin, Liu Yongsheng, Wei Jinshui, and Chen Jiazhong as deputy directors. In August, Wang Yunji was dismissed for counter-revolutionary offenses and subsequently arrested and sentenced in March 1979. In November, Jin Zhaodian, Xu Ya, and Liang Lingguang were designated as deputy directors, whilst Huang Yaguang, Zhu Yaohua, and Zhuo Xiong were terminated from their positions.\nSubsequent to the dissolution of the Gang of Four in October 1976, the Revolutionary Committee persisted in its collaborative operations with the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, with Liao Zhigao, the Party Secretary, simultaneously holding the position of director. In that same month, Zhuang Zhipeng and Chen Jiazhong were dismissed and subsequently convicted of counter-revolutionary offenses in November 1977.\nIn October 1977, Zhang Gexin was designated as deputy director, while Liang Lingguang was removed from his position. The First Session of the Fifth Fujian Provincial People's Congress convened in Fuzhou from December 28, 1977, to January 3, 1978, resulting in the election of a new committee leadership: Liao Zhigao as director, with Ma Xingyuan, Jin Zhaodian, Wu Hongxiang, Xu Ya, Lan Rongyu, Bai Zhimin, Liu Yongsheng, Wang Yan, Zhang Gexin, Bi Jichang, and Zheng Huopai as deputy directors. In September 1978, Zhang Yi and Wen Fushan were designated as deputy directors. In July 1979, Bai Zhimin was reassigned, and in August, Guo Chao was appointed to the position.\nIn December 1979, the Revolutionary Committee of Fujian Province was dissolved, and the Fujian Provincial People's Government was reinstated.\nSee also\n*Politics of Fujian\nReferences"
