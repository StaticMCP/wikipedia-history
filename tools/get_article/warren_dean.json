He featured prominently in the Elimination Final win over North Melbourne with three goals and four behinds.

At times inaccurate in front of goals, he kicked six behinds for no goals in a game against Sydney the following season. He was a Western Australian State of Origin representative and played in the 1988 Adelaide Bicentennial Carnival.\nDean was traded to West Coast in the 1990 Preseason Draft but could not break into their seniors.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Holmesby, Russell; Main, Jim (2007).
