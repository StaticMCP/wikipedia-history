Conway became a member of the Irish Privy Council in 1660 and was a confidant of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society on 2 January 1668, became governor of Charlemont Fort in 1671 and served as Master of the Ordnance in Ireland from 1679.\nOn 3 December 1679, Conway was created Earl of Conway. On 2 February 1681 he joined the Privy Council of King Charles II and became Secretary of State for the Northern Department. He resigned in January 1683 amid allegations that he was complicit in \"crimes and misdemeanours ... either in relation to the King's person or his public negotiations or transactions with foreign ambassadors, or in not rightly pursuing the King's instructions to ambassadors abroad\". He also served as Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire from 1682 to 1683.\nMarriages\nHe married three times, but had no children who survived infancy:\n*Firstly on 11 February 1651 to the philosopher Anne Finch (died on 23 February 1679), daughter of Sir Heneage Finch. They had one son, Heneage, who died of smallpox in infancy. Following Anne's death, Conway retired to his family's seat, Ragley Hall in Warwickshire.\n*Secondly he married Elizabeth Booth (died in July 1681), daughter of George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer.\n*Thirdly he married Ursula Stawell (died 13 August 1697), daughter of George Stawell, who survived him and remarried to John Sheffield, later 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby.\nDeath and burial\nHe died on 11 August 1683 and was buried in Arrow, Warwickshire.\nSuccession\nAs he died with no children, his titles became extinct. He appointed by his will as heir to his estates, including Ragley Hall, his eight-year old first cousin once removed Popham Seymour (1675–1699), eldest son of Laetitia Popham (a daughter of his uncle Alexander Popham (1605–1669), MP, of Littlecote) by her husband (to whom she was his second wife) Sir Edward Seymour, 4th Baronet (died 1708) of Berry Pomeroy in Devon. His bequest stipulated that Popham Seymour should adopt the arms and additional surname of Conway, and thus he became known as Popham Seymour-Conway. The latter's nephew and eventual heir was Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford, (1718–1794), whose seat became Ragley Hall, where his descendant the 9th Marquess is still seated in 2015.\nReferences\n*"
