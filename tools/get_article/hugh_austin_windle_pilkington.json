Innovative methods of glass manufacture developed by the company resulted in the company earning great income, and members of the Pilkington family became beneficiaries of company trusts. Hugh Pilkington's father, Roger Windle Pilkington (b. 17 January 1915, died 5 May 2003) became president of the London Missionary Society in 1962. Hugh, while still young, accompanied his father on travels overseas, including to East Africa.\nEducation and early working life\nHugh was educated at Cambridge University in the 1960s and upon graduation was named the top classical scholar in his graduation year having gained a double first degree and was awarded a number of university prizes.\nHe then worked for the family firm, Pilkington Glass. In Germany and elsewhere but came to realise that he was not suited to the world of commerce. He travelled to Africa to translate the Bible and in 1972 he joined the Theology and Philosophy Department of the University of Nairobi, eventually becoming a naturalised Kenyan citizen. He became interested in the book of Proverbs and its early manuscripts of Coptic origin. This launched him on an Oxford doctoral degree, and also required him to read manuscripts in Ge'ez, the almost extinct church language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. To learn Ge'ez, Hugh found two young Ethiopian refugees to teach him the language in exchange for board and lodging in his Nairobi home.\nIn 1979 Hugh was awarded a doctorate from Oxford. His doctoral thesis on the Ethiopic version of the Book of Proverbs remains the only scholarly record of this topic.\nInterest in education and refugees\nThrough his contact with the two Ethiopian refugees who assisted him in his doctoral studies, he became increasingly involved with supporting other young refugees to continue their studies at universities in Africa and overseas. In 1977, he set up the [https://windle.org/ Windle Charitable Trust] in Kenya to support needy Kenyan students.\nReferences"
