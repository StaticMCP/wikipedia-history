      "text": "# Good Rocking Tonight (album)__disambig_1\n\nGood Rocking Tonight is a compilation album by the blues musician Roy Brown.\nReleased by Route 66 Records in 1978 in mono as KIX-6, and is a follow-up to an earlier release titled Laughing But Crying (KIX-2). This album's subtitle is \"Legendary Recordings, Vol 2 (1947–1954)\". The cover features a portrait of Roy Brown, courtesy of Roy Brown, taken in 1950.\nSome reviewers state that Brown's version of \"Good Rocking Tonight\" released in 1947, or Wynonie Harris' version from 1948, (depending on the source), is one of the contenders for the title of \"first rock and roll recording\". The label of the 45 RPM record by Brown included the words \"Rocking blues\".\nThe back cover includes extensive liner notes, and biographical and autobiographical information attributed to:\n* John Broven: \"Roy Brown\", Blues Unlimited 123–124\n* Jonas Bernholm: unpublished interview\n* Staffan Solding: Swedish Radio Broadcast, 1978\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! #\n!
