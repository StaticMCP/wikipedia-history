Her career spanned seven decades. Ward trained in England and Australia, and worked in both countries.\nWard during the outbreak of World War II, was in high demand as a stage actress in England, before returning to Australia where she worked in local theatre, and became one of the first female radio announcers at the ABC in Australia, billed as the Forces Sweetheart on Radio Australia.\nAt ABC Television, she appeared in a number of filmed stage plays, as well as featuring in Australian films, both made-for-television and theatrical, including the film Amy.\nShe is perhaps best known—both locally and internationally for her stints as an actress in two television soap opera roles, portraying elderly characters including  Prisoner, as \"Mum\" Jeanette Brooke, who was an original cast member in 1979 and appeared sporadically in the series until 1981. Ward subsequently featured briefly in soap opera Sons and Daughters in 1983 as Dee Morrell, in which she was classified as a recurring guest role (season 2 - Episodes 305–337).\nWard post-Sons and Daughters, continued to have small guest roles in serials like The Young Doctors, Neighbours and Blue Heelers and retired in 2000, and in 2020, residing in Melbourne, turned 105 years old, and was at the time stated as being  \"possibly Australia's oldest living actress\".\nBiography\nEarly life and career in Britain\nWard was born in Fremantle, Western Australia on 6 March 1915, her father was a pearler, who later became the town publican.\nWard attended boarding school and began acting professionally shortly after leaving high school, and later studied at the Perth drama school, where she befriended mining magnate Lang Hancock. She also studied in Britain, and worked as a teacher of elocution and meeting Lionel Logue who was a speech therapist who helped King George VI, overcome his stutter. Ward travelled to England in 1933, where she worked in England repertory, with contemporaries Trevor Howard and John McCallum and also in television and film, before returning to Australia in 1940, working at the Minerva Theatre and became alongside Dorothy Crawford (the sister of television impresario Hector Crawford) one of the first female radio announcers for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (then Commission) during the war, where she was billed as \"The Forces Sweetheart\", whilst also appearing radio play productions.\nShe returned to England in 1948, to pursue work in radio, stage, television and film, and appeared in the first televised serial production at ITV and featured in television commercials doing sewing demonstrations, sponsored by Vogue, while also performing parts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and appeared in a cameo role in the 1949 film, Eureka Stockade.\nWard made her first television appearance as a minor character in detective series The Vise - originally titled Saber of London - in 1954, and in the television movie The High-Flying Head the following year. She had starring roles in the television movies Marriage Lines and The Tower.\nCareer: television, stage and film\nShe began working in television full-time in Australia after having returned in 1956, firstly working at the ABC, whilst continuing a successful media career, and being the first woman to present fashions on the field, in the 1960s at the annual Melbourne Cup spring racing carnival.\nWard featured at commercial stations, in serials from 1970s with Andrew McFarlane, Robert Bettles and Tom Farley (actor) in 1977. Harness Fever would later appear as a two-part episode, Born to Run, on Wonderful World of Disney in 1979. She continued her stage work in the 1970s with the Melbourne Theatre Company, remaining with the company until 1983, and performing in a David Williamson stage production.\nPrisoner and Sons and Daughters\nIn 1979, Ward first appeared in one of her best known roles, \"Mum\" (Jeanette) Brooks, on the popular soap opera  Prisoner. She portrayed an elderly institutionalised inmate, serving an eighteen-year prison sentence for the euthanisation of her terminally-ill husband Jim Brooks. When the filming schedule for the series increased from one to two hours per week in 1979, she and co-star Carol Burns decided to leave the series. However, her character remained a popular one during the show's early years, and she reprised her role occasionally until her character died off-screen in 1983. She starred with a number of her fellow Prisoner co-stars in the 1981 television movie I Can Jump Puddles as a character called Mrs. Birdsworth.\nShe was given the prominent role as scheming Dee Morrell in Sons and Daughters during 1983.\nThe Hendersons\nWard starred in the 1985 television series The Henderson Kids and its 1987 follow-up series The Henderson Kids II.\nLater film and TV\nDuring the late-1980s, she had supporting roles in films Jenny Kissed Me and Backstage as well as appearing in more soap guest roles including G.P. and Neighbours in 1989. After starring in the 1989 television movie Darlings of the Gods, she returned again to the theatre, with the exception of an appearance in the television series The Damnation of Harvey McHugh in 1994, and appearing in the film Amy in 1997. In 1991, she appeared in the play Alive and Kicking.\nBetween 1999 and 2000, she played the recurring character Betty Withers in the police drama Blue Heelers.
