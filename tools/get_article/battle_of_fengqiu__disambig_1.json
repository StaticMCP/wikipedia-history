Cao Cao emerged victorious against Yuan Shu's forces.\nBattle\nCao Cao's army was stationed in Juancheng (鄄城). Liu Biao, the Governor (牧) of Jing Province, cut off Yuan Shu's supply route. As a result, Yuan Shu led his army into Chenliu (陳留), garrisoning at Fengqiu (封丘), where the remnants of the Heishan Bandits and the Xiongnu chieftain Yufuluo provided him support. Yuan Shu sent his general Liu Xiang (劉詳) to garrison at Kuangting (匡亭).\nWhen Cao Cao attacked Liu Xiang, Yuan Shu reinforced Kuangting, where the latter was badly defeated. Yuan Shu retreated to defend Fengqiu. Cao Cao subsequently moved to surround the town before Yuan Shu could complete the movement, Yuan Shu fled to Xiangyi (襄邑). Cao Cao pursued to Taishou (太壽) and diverted the waters of the Qu River (渠水) from Xiangyi, cutting off the canal supplying water to the city. After, Yuan Shu fled to Ningling (寧陵) and Cao Cao pursued Yuan Shu's retreat towards Jiujiang (九江). In summer, Cao Cao finally withdrew with his army to Dingtao (定陶).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Chen Shou. Records of the Three Kingdoms."
