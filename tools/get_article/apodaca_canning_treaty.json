In this treaty, Britain was given trade facilitation in the Spanish domains, in exchange for military supplies to support the armies and guerrilla troops of Spain.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001407/http://yourdemocracy.newstatesman.com/parliament/treaty-with-spain/HAN26609 Your Democracy - Treaty With Spain]"
