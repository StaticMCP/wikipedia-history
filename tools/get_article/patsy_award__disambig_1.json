They decided to honor animal performers after a horse was killed in an on-set accident during the filming of the Tyrone Power film Jesse James. The letters are an acronym, and stand for Picture Animal Top Star of the Year. A later acronym was also included: Performing Animal Television Star of the Year.\nThe very first recipient of a PATSY was Francis the Talking Mule in 1951, in a ceremony hosted by Ronald Reagan at Hollywood's Carthay Circle Theater. The award later covered both film and television and was separated into four categories: canine, equine, wild and special. The special category encompassed everything from goats to cats to pigs &ndash; Arnold Ziffel of TV's Green Acres was a two-time winner. Arnold's trainer, Frank Inn, was the proud owner of over 40 PATSY awards, thanks to his work with Orangey, the cat from Rhubarb (1951) and ''Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961); Higgins, the dog (who played the lead in the Benji movies and \"Dog\" on Petticoat Junction); Cleo the Basset Hound; and Lassie, and Tramp the dog from My Three Sons to name a few. Lassie was retired to the PATSY Hall of Fame after receiving many awards over the years.\nThe Craven Award was named in honor of Richard C. Craven, the first director of the Hollywood AHA. It recognized animals that would normally have had no opportunity to appear in a starring role. The TV and Movie Animal Walk of Fame was established in front of the Burbank Animal Shelter, honoring certain early recipients of the PATSY Awards.\nBy the 1970s, the awards were being presented in a televised ceremony, with animal recipients selected by the general public who voted in ballots which appeared in Associated Press newspapers. The first network presentation was on CBS in 1973.\nOver the years the PATSY Award ceremony was hosted by various celebrities, including Betty White, Allen Ludden, and Bob Barker. Barker has stated he eventually resigned in protest of the cruel methods some trainers use when training animals for films.\nThe awards ended in 1986 due to lack of funding. That year the Genesis Awards were established to honor individuals in the major news and entertainment media for producing outstanding works which raise public awareness of animal issues. In 2011 the American Humane Society announced the creation of the Pawscars, described as, \"an unofficial, animal-centric spin on the Oscars.\"\nThe American Humane Association is the organization responsible for the disclaimer at the end of many films and television programs that \"No Animals Were Harmed\" in the production.\nPATSY Award Winners (partial listing)\nSource, 1951–1973:\n1951\nMotion Pictures\n# Francis the Talking Mule (Francis)\n# California the horse (The Palomino)\n# Pierre the chimp (My Friend Irma Goes West)\nAward of Excellence\n* Flame the dog (My Pal)\n* Lassie the dog (Challenge to Lassie)\n* Black Diamond the horse (Black Midnight)\n* Jackie the Lion (Samson and Delilah)\nCraven Award\n* Jerry Brown the horse &ndash;
