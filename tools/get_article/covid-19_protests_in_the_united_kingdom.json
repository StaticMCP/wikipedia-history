These overlapped with anti-vaccination protests, which continued after the start of the UK's vaccination programme in December 2020. Several media outlets blamed online COVID-19 misinformation, denialism and conspiracy theories as driving factors in the protest movement. The Economist described the protests as \"countercultural\" and attracting people from a variety of demographics and political leanings. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested for violating lockdown restrictions, social distancing measures and other public health laws.\nUnrelated protests were held by or in support of National Health Service staff involved in the frontline health response to demand for pay rises and improved working conditions.\nBackground\nThe UK's first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on 31 January 2020. As the number of cases and deaths increased in the subsequent few months, the government enacted emergency powers on 19 March to introduce public health measures in an effort to control the spread of the virus. On 23 March, with the death toll increasing and UK's hospital capacity at risk of being reached, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the first of three nationwide lockdowns or stay-at-home orders in response to rising daily cases, hospitalisations and deaths. After the first nationwide lockdown ended, the government introduced localised tier regulations in England in areas with higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mandated face masks in certain settings across the country. A second national lockdown began in November 2020, ending in early December and being replaced with tiered regulations. Due to rapidly increasing cases, a third national lockdown began in January 2021, and began to be eased in March 2021. Additional restrictions across the UK include social distancing measures and face masks being mandatory in certain settings.\nWith health being devolved between the nations of the United Kingdom, authorities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have also introduced localised restrictions, including lockdowns, at different times throughout the pandemic.\n2020\nApril 2020\n, a conspiracy theorist and the brother of Jeremy Corbyn, has spoken at many anti-lockdown protests since the first lockdown in the United Kingdom]]\nOn 20&nbsp;April, two anti-lockdown protesters had a stand-off with police on the roof of Shrewsbury College; they were then arrested.\nOn both 25&nbsp;April and 1&nbsp;May, Piers Corbyn was present at an anti-lockdown protest in Glastonbury. On 25&nbsp;April, Corbyn made a speech to the 30 to 100 other protesters, where he denied the pandemic was occurring, and criticised public health measures. A police spokesperson said they encouraged protesters to adhere to social distancing guidance, and that the protest ended within an hour.\nMay 2020\nA group of around 20 people, which included some young children, held a peaceful protest and defied social distancing rules outside New Scotland Yard on 2&nbsp;May. Another protest was held by a group of between 40 and 50 people on Lambeth Walk, near Westminster Bridge, on 9&nbsp;May. A number of people were arrested and fixed penalty notices were issued by the police.\nProtests against the United Kingdom's COVID-19 lockdown, to be held across the country in the weekend of 16&nbsp;May, in cities such as Manchester, Bristol, Leicester and Southampton, were advertised online, produced by the UK Freedom Movement, an online group. On 15&nbsp;May, former leader of the far-right group Britain First Jayda Fransen was associated with that apparent anti-lockdown movement circulating online due to her registration as director of Freedom Movement Ltd with Companies House, but Fransen has denied any involvement. On Saturday, 16&nbsp;May, 50 anti-lockdown and anti-vax protesters defied social-distancing rules at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, including Piers Corbyn. There were further smaller protests on the same day in Manchester, Glasgow, Belfast and other cities across the country.\nA small anti-lockdown protest took place along Hove seafront on 18&nbsp;May. A protest the next day was held at Hampstead Heath, who demanded the reopening of its ponds as council had refused to reopen them. This was followed by another protest on 23&nbsp;May that was held on Clapham Common, with around 20 protesters calling for the lockdown to come to end and for children to only return to school if there is \"no social distancing\". Another protest was held at Hyde Park on 30&nbsp;May.\nAugust 2020\nOn 8 August 2020, more than 30 protests across the UK took place in support of National Health Service staff in response to the government not extending a planned pay rise to nurses.\nThousands gathered in London's Trafalgar Square on 29&nbsp;August as a part of the Unite for Freedom movement to protest against lockdown restrictions and the possibility of a mandatory vaccine.

After marching from Hyde Park to Westminster, the protest ended in Trafalgar Square. Key speakers were Louise Creffield and Piers Corbyn. Shortly before 4 pm, the police decided to break up the protest because the protesters \"failed to comply with the terms of their risk assessment, government guidelines and were not maintaining social distancing\". The police officer in charge \"determined their protest is no longer exempt from the regulations and is an illegal gathering\". The police arrested at least 18 people during the protest.\nNovember 2020\nRichard Tice, chairman of the Brexit Party, and a few dozen others led a small protest at an official wreath-laying ceremony at the Royal Artillery Memorial on Hyde Park Corner on Remembrance Sunday in defiance of regulations.\nOn 28 November anti-lockdown demonstrators marched through London chanting \"freedom\", in a day of protests that resulted in more than 60 arrests.

The video appeared to show empty hospital corridors suggesting that the covid pandemic was not affecting hospitals as much as the government had been suggesting. The hospitals show in the video were the Queen Alexandra Hospital and St Richard's Hospital. The hospitals responded to stress that \"pictures of empty corridors do not mean our wards and intensive care units are empty.\"\nMarch 2021\nOn 20 March, up to 30,000 people gathered in central London, walking from Hyde Park to Westminster. Although the protest was largely in relation to the government's stance on peaceful protests during lockdown, many were seen carrying anti-lockdown placards with slogans such as \"Stop Destroying Our Kids’ Lives\" and chanted for restrictions to be lifted.

Many protesters threw tennis balls with messages over the perimeter of 10 Downing Street.\nOn 26 June, group of protesters gathered outside the home of Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, shouting \"murderer\" and \"traitor\" through megaphones.

The protesters were reported to have mistaken the building as the headquarters of the BBC, although the corporation's operations had moved out of the building in 2013. ITV's Loose Women was being broadcast in the building at the time, although the protests did not disrupt this. Protesters clashed with police and a police helicopter was dispatched.\nDecember 2021\nThousands of protesters gathered in London on 18 December, many of whom opposed the introduction of vaccination passports for large venues in response to the highly contagious Omicron variant spreading across the UK.

Two people, a man and a woman, were arrested after a traffic cone was thrown at police officers. Johnson tweeted that it was \"absolutely disgraceful\" and thanked the police for acting swiftly.\nShayan Sardarizadeh for BBC Monitoring said that the protest was an attempt to recreate the Ottawa \"freedom convoy\" protests in the UK, and noted that the activists' references to Magna Carta indicated that the protesters were members of the sovereign citizen movement, which Tim Hume in Vice UK says \"has become a key strand of the UK's anti-lockdown movement\". Julian Smith, the former chief whip, and Simon Hoare were among Conservatives who called for Johnson to apologise. MP Kim Leadbeater and Brendan Cox, the sister and husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, warned against politicians lending credence to far-right conspiracy theories. The following day, a Downing Street source said that Johnson still would not apologise for the slur against Starmer.\nMarch\nCancellation of COVID measures\nOn 18 March 2022, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson lifted most of the COVID measures after two years in place.\nOther\nSecondary school protests\nProtests at secondary schools were conducted in the summer of 2021, particularly by artist Remeece performing his \"Dont Tek Di Vaccine\" rap song on a portable speaker to children as they left school for the day.
