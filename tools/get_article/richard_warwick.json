Subsequent films included If...., Nicholas and Alexandra and the first film by Derek Jarman, Sebastiane.\nOn television, he was best known for his roles in the sitcom Please Sir!, as one of the main character's teaching colleagues, and in the London Weekend Television comedy A Fine Romance, as the brother-in-law of Judi Dench's character. He also played Uncas in the television series The Last of the Mohicans (1971). His last role was as John (the servant) in Zeffirelli's 1996 adaptation of Jane Eyre.\nHe died in 1997 aged 52 from an AIDS-related illness. In an obituary, The Daily Telegraph quoted If... director Lindsay Anderson: \"I never met a young actor like Richard! Without a touch of vanity, completely natural yet always concentrated, he illumines every frame of the film in which he appears.\"\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n!
