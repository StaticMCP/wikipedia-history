His professional career includes publicly covered roles at Google and HackerRank, notably his work organizing Google Code Jam and helping to build HackerRank’s large-scale developer engagement systems.\nThese contributions have been documented by Business Insider, HackerRank’s official publications, and other verifiable archives, demonstrating both independent recognition and lasting impact within the global software engineering and competitive programming communities.\nAhmed Aly is a software engineer and computer scientist best known as the creator of A2 Online Judge (A2OJ) and for his contributions to large-scale software systems and competitive programming platforms. Over his career, he has worked at several major technology companies, including Google, HackerRank, Facebook, Airbnb, LinkedIn, and Mapbox. Aly is widely recognized within the global programming community for his influence on algorithmic training and developer engagement platforms.\nEarly life and education\nAly earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science from Cairo University in 2009.\nDuring his university years, he became active in competitive programming and participated in regional and international contests such as the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), which influenced his later work building tools for programmers.\nCareer\nA2 Online Judge (A2OJ)\nAly founded A2 Online Judge (A2OJ), a popular online platform that aggregated competitive programming problems from multiple sources and allowed users to track their progress and rankings.\nA2OJ became widely used by programmers around the world for its structured training ladders and rating lists and remained a cornerstone tool for algorithmic-practice communities for over a decade.\nGoogle\nAly joined Google as a software engineer, where he worked on search infrastructure and was part of the team behind Google Code Jam, the company’s annual global programming competition.\nHis work combined distributed-systems engineering with community-driven programming initiatives.\nHackerRank\nIn 2015, Aly left Google to join HackerRank as a software engineer, where he focused on building and scaling the company’s hackathon and coding-challenge infrastructure.\nThe move was covered by several technology publications that noted his transition from organizing Google Code Jam to developing HackerRank’s developer-engagement systems.\nLater roles\nAfter his tenure at HackerRank, Aly held senior engineering roles at Facebook, Airbnb, LinkedIn, and Mapbox, where he contributed to backend systems, developer infrastructure, and large-scale data platforms.\nHis technical focus has spanned distributed computation, system scalability, and developer-productivity tooling.\nContributions and influence\nAly is recognized in the global competitive-programming community for making algorithmic practice more accessible. His platform A2OJ has been referenced by thousands of programmers as a training resource, and through his work at Google and HackerRank he helped expand the reach of large-scale programming contests serving millions of developers.\nSee also\n* Competitive programming\n* Google Code Jam\n* HackerRank\nReferences\n:Category:Living people\n:Category:Computer scientists\n:Category:Software engineers\n:Category:Competitive programmers\n:Category:Cairo University alumni\n:Category:Google employees\n:Category:HackerRank\n:Category:LinkedIn people\n:Category:Facebook employees\n:Category:Airbnb people\n:Category:Mapbox employees"
