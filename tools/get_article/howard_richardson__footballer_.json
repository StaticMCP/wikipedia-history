He made sporadic appearances over the next couple of seasons and, after not playing at all in 1918, he crossed to Melbourne. Richardson took the field only once at Melbourne and finished his league career with 20 games and 14 goals.\nAt Hobart in 1924, Richardson played his only first-class cricket match with Victoria taking on Tasmania. He was his state's best bowler in the first innings when he took 4/34 and also contributed an unbeaten 29 with the bat.\nSee also\n* List of Victoria first-class cricketers\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7468.html Cricinfo: Howard Richardson]"
