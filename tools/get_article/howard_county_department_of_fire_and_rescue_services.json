On August 24, 1888, authorization was granted to purchase a hand-drawn ladder wagon from the Charles T. Holloway Company, Baltimore, Maryland. The wagon arrived on October 5, 1888, and was based in the old foundry. The first firehouse built in Ellicott City was constructed in 1896 with a cupola to house a firebell donated by the B&O railroad to summon firemen.\nIn 1924, the Howard County Volunteer Fireman's Association was formed operating out of a new combination firehouse and transit terminal on Main street in Ellicott City with an $10,500 600 gallon American LaFrance triple combination engine. Insurance agent Benjamin Mellor became the first fire chief serving until 1934. In April 1940, a new fire station was dedicated in Ellicott City.\nOn 18 April 1959, the Central Alarm went into operation in an office above the Ellicott City Jail.\nIn 1991, the department implemented a customer service program, more commonly found in the commercial industry. In 1996, Fire Chief Joseph Herr is replaced by Bill Goddard. In 2014 the criteria for contingent firefighters that supplement volunteer stations without benefits changed to require the same qualifications as career staff, promoting the departure of 33 of 34 contingent staff primarily from Lisbon and West Friendship.\nStations & Apparatus\n]]\nThere are a total of 14 stations under the umbrella of the department, 7 of which are fully county staffed. The remaining 7 are career/volunteer combination stations. These firehouses are staffed with a combination of both paid personnel and volunteers. The volunteer departments, which are marked below with a V are as follows:\n*Elkridge Volunteer Fire Department - Station 1\n*Ellicott City Volunteer Fire Department - Stations 2 & 8\n*West Friendship Volunteer Fire Department - Station 3\n*Lisbon Volunteer Fire Company - Station 4\n*Fifth District Volunteer Fire Department Clarksville - Station 5\n*Savage Volunteer Fire Department - Station 6\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Fire Station Number\n!City\n!Engine Companies or Engine-Tanker Company\n!Squad Company, Tower Company, Truck Company or Rescue Engine Company\n!Paramedic, Ambulance or EMS Units\n!Brush Units\n!Chief Units\n!Special Units\n!\n|-\n! 1V\n| Elkridge || Engine 11, Engine 12\n|| Tower 1 || Paramedic 15Ambulance 16||  Brush 18 ||Chief 1, Chief 1A, Chief 1B|| Utility 1, Utility 1A, Utility 1B, ATV1S, ATV1M\n||\n|-\n! 2V\n| Ellicott City|| Engine 21, Engine 22\n|| Tower 2Truck 21 || Paramedic 25Ambulance 26|| Brush 27  || Battalion Chief 2, Chief 2, Chief 2A, Chief 2B || Utility 2, Utility 2A, Utility 2B, Water rescue 2, Boat 2\n||\n|-\n! 3V\n| West Friendship||Engine 31, Engine 32\n|| Tower 3|| Paramedic 35Ambulance 36||Brush 37, Brush 38|| Special Units:Utility 3, Utility 3A, Utility 3B   |Chief 3, Chief 3A, Chief 3B\n|Tankers 3, Tanker 34\n||\n|-\n! 4V\n|Lisbon|| Engine 41, Engine 42, Engine-Tanker 44\n||  Rescue Engine 4  || |Paramedic 45,\nAmbulance 46\n| Brush 47, Brush 48||  Chief 4, Chief 4A, Chief 4B\n|Utility 4, Utility 4A, Utility 4B\n||\n|-\n! 5V\n| Clarksville ||Engine 51, Engine 52\n|| || Paramedic 55Paramedic 56|| Brush 58|| ||Tanker 5, Utility 5, Dive 5, Boat 5, Bariatric 5\n||\n|-\n! 6V\n| Savage||Engine 61, Engine 62\n||Truck 6, Squad 6||Paramedic 65Ambulance 66\nEMS 1\n|  Brush 68||  Chief 6, Chief 6A, Chief 6B ||  Utility 6, Canteen 6\n||\n|-\n! 7\n|Columbia|| Engine 71\n||Truck 7|| Paramedic 75, Ambulance 76\n|||||Utility 7\n||\n|-\n! 8V\n| Bethany|| Engine 81, Engine 82\n|\n||  Paramedic 85, Ambulance 86,\nEMS 2\n|| Brush 87  || Chief 8B || Air Unit 17, Utility 8, MAB 13,\nMAB Support Trailer\n||\n|-\n! 9\n|Long Reach|| Engine 91\n||| | Paramedic 95,Ambulance 96|| Brush 97\n| ||Safety 1, Utility 9, Public Education Unit\n||\n|-\n! 10\n| Rivers Park|| Engine 101\n|| Tower 10 || Paramedic 105, Reserve Ambulance 106\n|\n|Special Operations\nBattalion Chief 10\n| Transport 10, Transport 12, Utility 10,\nWater Rescue 10, Boat 10, ATV10\n||\n|-\n! 11\n| Scaggsville|| Engine 111\n|||  |  Paramedic 115\n|  ||          || Tanker 11, Boat 11, Decon 13, Utility 11\n||\n|-\n!12\n|Waterloo\n|Engine 121\n|\n|Paramedic 125\n|Brush 128\n|Battalion Chief 1\n|\n|\n|-\n! 13\n| Glenwood|| Engine 131\n|||  | Paramedic 135\n| Brush 137 ||EMS/Battalion Chief 3||Tanker 13, Utility 13\n||\n|-\n! 14\n| Merriweather|| Engine 141\n|||  |  Paramedic 145\n|  ||          ||Utility 14, ATV14\n||\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.howardcountymd.gov/fire-and-rescue-services Howard County Department of Fire and Rescue]\n*[http://www.elkridgevfd.org/ Elkridge Volunteer Fire Department]\n*[http://www.ellicottcityvfa.com/ Ellicott City Volunteer Fire Department]\n*[http://www.wfvfd.org West Friendship Volunteer Fire Department]\n*[http://www.lisbonvfc.org/ Lisbon Volunteer Fire Company]\n*[http://www.fdvfd.com/ Fifth District Volunteer Fire Department, Clarksville]\n*[http://www.savagevfc.org/ Savage Volunteer Fire Company]"
