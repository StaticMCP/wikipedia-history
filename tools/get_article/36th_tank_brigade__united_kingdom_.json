The brigade remained in the United Kingdom for its service and did not serve overseas, being disbanded in July 1943.\nOrigins\nThe 36th Army Tank Brigade was created in the Second World War on 1 December 1941 by the conversion of the Headquarters of the 205th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). The regiments in the brigade were all converted from infantry battalions that had been transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps, but they still maintained their own infantry cap badges on the black beret of the Royal Armoured Corps.\nOn 12 August 1942 the brigade dropped the 'Army' from its title and was redesignated 36th Tank Brigade. Throughout its existence the brigade remained in Eastern Command and in the United Kingdom until 30 July 1943 when the regiments were broken up and the day after, the brigade Headquarters was disbanded.\nOrder of battle\n36th Tank Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:\n* 154th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (previously 9th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment)\n* 156th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (previously 11th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry)\n* 157th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (previously 10th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment)\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded 36th Tank Brigade during the war:\n* Brigadier R.
