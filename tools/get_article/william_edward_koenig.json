Koenig grew up in East Meadow, New York, attending St. Raphael's Elementary School. Deciding to become a priest, he entered St. Pius X Preparatory Seminary in Uniondale, New York, the minor seminary in the New York City area.\nKoenig progressed to Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Douglaston, New York, in 1975. Four years later, Koenig started studying at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, New York. He received a Master of Divinity degree from that seminary in 1983.\nPriesthood\nOn May 14, 1983, Koenig was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Rockville Centre by Bishop John R. McGann at St. Agnes Cathedral in Rockville Centre, New York.\nAfter his ordination, the diocese assigned Koenig in 1983 as parochial vicar at St. Edward the Confessor Parish in Syosset, New York. Three years later, he was transferred to Setauket, New York, to serve as parochial vicar at St. James Parish.  During his time in Setauket, Koenig also worked in the Campus Ministry Program at the State University at Stony Brook in Stony Brook, New York. Bishop John R. McGann named Koenig as director of vocations in 1989 and director of ministry to priests in 1990.\nIn 1989, Koenig became diocesan director of vocations at the cathedral residence of the Immaculate Conception in Douglaston, New York, helping in the formation of seminarians.  In 1990, he also became diocesan director of ministry to priests. He held both positions for the next six years.\nIn 1994, Koenig obtained a Master of Social Work degree from Fordham University in New York City. In 2000, the diocese appointed him to his first position as pastor at St. William the Abbot Parish in Seaford, New York. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI named Koenig as chaplain to his holiness.Bishop William F. Murphy appointed Koenig as rector of St. Agnes Cathedral in 2009.  He left that position in 2020 when Bishop John Barres appointed him vicar for clergy for the diocese.\nBishop of Wilmington\nOn April 30, 2021, Pope Francis appointed Koenig as bishop for Wilmington. Koenig was consecrated by Archbishop William E. Lori on July 13, 2021, at the Church of St. Elizabeth in Wilmington, Delaware, with Bishops Barres and W. Francis Malooly serving as co-consecrators.\nKoenig was asked in 2021 if he would give the eucharist to President Joe Biden, who maintained a residence in Delaware.  Some American prelates had stated they would refuse communion to Biden due to his support for abortion rights for women and same-sex marriage.  Koenig said that he would discuss Catholic teaching with him.\nIn March 2023, Koenig expressed his opposition to a proposed bill in the Delaware House of Representatives that would require priests to violate the seal of the confessional to report admission of sexual abuse crimes to police.\nSee also\n* Catholic Church hierarchy\n* Catholic Church in the United States\n* Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States\n* List of Catholic bishops of the United States\n* Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cdow.org/ Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Official Site]\n*[https://www.drvc.org/ Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre Official Site]\nEpiscopal succession"
