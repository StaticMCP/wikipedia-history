The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nThe standard deviation of the continuously compounded returns of a financial instrument  is called volatility.\nThe (yearly) volatility in a given asset price or rate over a term that starts from t_0=0 corresponds to the spot volatility for that underlying, for the specific term. A collection of such volatilities forms a volatility term structure, similar to the yield curve. Just as forward rates can be derived from a yield curve, forward volatilities can be derived from a given term structure of volatility.\nDerivation\nGiven that the underlying random variables for non overlapping time intervals are independent, the variance is additive (see variance). So for yearly time slices we have the annualized volatility as\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_{0,j}^2\n&= \\frac{1}{j}(\\sigma_{0,1}^2 + \\sigma_{1,2}^2 + \\cdots  + \\sigma_{j-2,j-1}^2 + \\sigma_{j-1,j}^2)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\sigma_{j-1,j}\n&=\\sqrt{j\\sigma_{0,j}^2-\\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\\sigma_{k-1,k}^2},\n\\end{align}\nwhere\n:j=1,2,\\ldots is the number of years and the factor \\frac{1}{j} scales the variance so it is a yearly one\n:\\sigma_{i,\\,j} is the current (at time 0) forward volatility for the period [i,\\,j]\n:\\sigma_{0,\\,j} the spot volatility for maturity j.\nTo ease computation and get a non-recursive representation, we can also express the forward volatility directly in terms of spot volatilities:\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_{0,j}^2\n&= \\frac{1}{j}(\\sigma_{0,1}^2 + \\sigma_{1,2}^2 + \\cdots  + \\sigma_{j-1,j}^2)\\\\\n&= \\frac{j-1}{j}\\cdot\\frac{1}{j-1}(\\sigma_{0,1}^2 + \\sigma_{1,2}^2 + \\cdots  + \\sigma_{j-2,j-1}^2) + \\frac{1}{j}\\sigma_{j-1,j}^2\\\\\n&= \\frac{j-1}{j}\\,\\sigma_{0,j-1}^2 + \\frac{1}{j}\\sigma_{j-1,j}^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{j} \\sigma_{j-1,j}^{2} &= \\sigma_{0,j}^2-\\frac{(j-1)}{j}\\sigma_{0,j-1}^{2}\\\\\n\\sigma_{j-1,j}^{2} &= j \\sigma_{0,j}^2-(j-1)\\sigma_{0,j-1}^{2}\\\\\n\\sigma_{j-1,j} &= \\sqrt{j \\sigma_{0,j}^2-(j-1)\\sigma_{0,j-1}^{2}}\n\\end{align}\nFollowing the same line of argumentation we get in the general case with t_0 for the forward volatility seen at time t_0:\n\\sigma_{t,T}=\\sqrt{\\frac{(T-t_0)\\sigma_{t_0,T}^2-(t-t_0)\\sigma_{t_0,t}^2}{T-t}},\nwhich simplifies in the case of t_0=0 to\n\\sigma_{t,T}=\\sqrt{\\frac{T\\sigma_{0,T}^2-t\\sigma_{0,t}^2}{T-t}}.\nExample\nThe volatilities in the market for 90 days are 18% and for 180 days 16.6%. In our notation we have \\sigma_{0,\\,0.25} = 18% and \\sigma_{0,\\,0.5} = 16.6% (treating a year as 360 days).\nWe want to find the forward volatility for the period starting with day 91 and ending with day 180. Using the above formula and setting t_0=0 we get\n\\sigma_{0.25,\\,0.5}=\\sqrt{\\frac{0.5\\cdot 0.166^2-0.25\\cdot 0.18^2}{0.25}}=0.1507\\approx 15.1\\%.\nReferences"
