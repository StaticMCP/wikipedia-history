Modern scholarly sources place it in Cappadocia instead.\nThe first of these battles is the subject of two notable artworks, and in the context of art it is usually referred to as the Battle of Alexander at Issus or simply the Battle of Alexander.\n*The Alexander Mosaic of Pompeii depicts a battle between Alexander and Darius. It is commonly believed to be the battle of Issus rather than the Battle of Gaugamela, another in which Darius was Alexander's adversary.\n*The Battle of Alexander at Issus (1528–9) by Albrecht Altdorfer."
