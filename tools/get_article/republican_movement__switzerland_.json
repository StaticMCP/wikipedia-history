It received 4.3% of the vote in the elections that year, winning seven seats. However, in the 1975 elections the party's share of the vote fell to 3% and it was reduced to four seats. The 1979 elections saw the party lose the majority of its support as it was reduced to 0.6% of the vote and won only one seat. It saw another fall in its vote share to 0.5% in the 1983 elections, but retained its single seat. In 1987 its vote share fell to just 0.3% and it lost its only seat. The party was subsequently dissolved on 22 April 1989. Most of its members joined the Federal Democratic Union.\nPlatform\nThe Republican Movement supported anti-immigrant and anti-establishment policies, as well as fundamentalist Protestant Christian views.\nAffiliations\nIn 1972 the Republican Movement officially associated itself with the anti-immigrant Vigilance, which was founded in 1964 and based in the Canton of Geneva. They presented themselves as an electoral alliance three years later.\nElection results\nFederal Assembly\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Votes\n!%\n!Rank\n!Seats\n|-\n|1967\n|1,696\n|0.17%\n|11\n|0\n|-\n|1971\n|84,700\n|4.25%\n|6\n|7\n|-\n|1975\n|57,192\n|2.96%\n|6\n|4\n|-\n|1979\n|11,587\n|0.63%\n|11\n|1\n|-\n|1987\n|6,769\n|0.35%\n|15\n|0\n|}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
