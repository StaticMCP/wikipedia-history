The British Army prior to World War I traced its origins to the increasing demands of imperial expansion together with inefficiencies highlighted during the Crimean War, which led to the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century. These gave the British Army its modern shape, and defined its regimental system. The Haldane Reforms of 1907 formally created an Expeditionary force and the Territorial Force.\n.]]\nThe British Army was different from the French and German Armies at the beginning of the conflict in that it was made up of professional soldiers who had volunteered, rather than conscripts. It was also considerably smaller than its French and German counterparts.\nThe outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 saw the bulk of the changes in the Haldane reforms put to the test. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) of six divisions was quickly sent to the Continent.\nThis order of battle includes all combat units, including engineer and artillery units, but not medical, supply and signal units.\nCommanders are listed for all formations of brigade size or higher, and for significant staff positions.\nPlans for the Expeditionary Force\nUnder pre-war plans, an expeditionary force was to be organised from among the Regular Army forces in the United Kingdom, with a strength of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division (72 infantry battalions and 14 cavalry regiments), plus support units.\nIt was planned that the seven divisions would be centrally controlled by General Headquarters and as such no plans were made for intermediate levels of command. One corps staff was maintained in peacetime, but the decision was made on mobilisation to create a second (and later a third) in order to better conform with the French command structure; both of these had to be improvised.\nAt the time of mobilisation, there were significant fears of a German landing in force on the English east coast, and as such the decision was taken to hold back two divisions for home defence, and only send four, plus the cavalry division, to France for the present. The 4th was eventually despatched at the end of August, and the 6th in early September.\nGHQ\ncentre left ]]\nThe initial commander-in-chief of the BEF was Field-Marshal Sir John French. His chief of staff was Lieutenant-General Sir A. J. Murray, with Major-General H. H. Wilson as his deputy. GSO 1 (Operations) was Colonel G. M. Harper, and GSO 1 (Intelligence) was Colonel G. M. W. Macdonogh.\nThe adjutant-general was Major-General Sir C. F. N. Macready, with Major-General E. R. C. Graham as deputy adjutant-general and Colonel A. E. J. Cavendish as assistant adjutant-general. The quartermaster-general was Major-General Sir W. R. Robertson, with Colonel C. T. Dawkins as assistant quartermaster-general. The Royal Artillery was commanded by Major-General W. F. L. Lindsay, and the Royal Engineers by Brigadier-General G. H. Fowke.\nGHQ Troops, Royal Engineers\nGeneral Headquarters Troops controlled the army group engineers.

An infantry battalion contained four companies and two machine-guns.\nA Royal Horse Artillery battery contained six 13-pounder guns, whilst a Royal Field Artillery battery contained six 18-pounder guns, or six 4.5-inch howitzers. A heavy battery of the Royal Garrison Artillery contained four 60 pounder guns and a siege battery contained four 6-inch 30 cwt. howitzers. Each battery had two ammunition wagons per gun, and each artillery brigade contained its own ammunition column.\nEach division received an anti-aircraft detachment of 1-pounder pom-pom guns in September, attached to the divisional artillery.\nThe Cavalry Division had a total of 12 cavalry regiments in four brigades, and each infantry division had 12 battalions in three brigades. The strength of the Cavalry Division (not counting 5th Cavalry Brigade) came to 9,269 all ranks, with 9,815 horses, 24 13-pounder guns and 24 machine-guns. The strength of each infantry division came to 18,073 all ranks, with 5,592 horses, 76 guns and 24 machine-guns.\nUnits not employed in the Expeditionary Force\nIn broad numeric terms, the British Expeditionary Force represented half the combat strength of the British Army; as an imperial power, a sizeable portion of the army had to be kept aside for overseas garrisons. Home defence was expected to be provided by the volunteers of the Territorial Force and by the reserves.\nThe total strength of the Regular Army in July was 125,000 men in the British Isles, with 75,000 in India and Burma and a further 33,000 in other overseas postings. The Army Reserve came to 145,000 men, with 64,000 in the Militia (or Special Reserve) and 272,000 in the Territorial Force.\nHome service\nThe peacetime regular establishment in the British Isles was eighty-one battalions of infantry&nbsp;— in theory, one battalion of each line regiment was deployed on home service and one on overseas service at any given point, rotating the battalions every few years&nbsp;— and nineteen regiments of cavalry.\nAside from those earmarked for the Expeditionary Force, there were three battalions of Guards and eight of line infantry (including those in the Channel Islands) – roughly a division's worth. In the event, six battalions of these regulars were deployed to the Continent along with the Expeditionary Force, to act as army troops. The Border Regiment and Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment) had the unusual distinction of being the only two regular infantry regiments not to contribute troops to the Expeditionary Force; both would first see action with 7th Division, which landed in October.\nGiven the rioting that had occurred during the national strikes 1911–12, there was concern that there would be unrest in London at the outbreak of war. Consequently, three cavalry regiments&nbsp;— the 1st Life Guards, 2nd Life Guards, and Royal Horse Guards – were stationed in the London District and not earmarked for the Expeditionary Force; these each provided a squadron for a composite regiment, which served with the 4th Cavalry Brigade. In addition, there were three Royal Field Artillery brigades, and a number of Royal Horse Artillery batteries, not earmarked for overseas service.\nAfter the Expeditionary Force had departed, this left a total regular establishment of three cavalry regiments (somewhat depleted) and five infantry battalions – less than a tenth of the normal combat strength of the home forces, and mostly deployed around London. This defensive force would be supplemented by the units of the Territorial Force, which were called up on the outbreak of war&nbsp;— indeed, many were already embodied for their summer training when mobilisation was ordered&nbsp;— and by the Special Reserve.\nThe Territorial Force was planned with a mobilisation strength of fourteen divisions, each structured along the lines of a regular division with twelve infantry battalions, four artillery brigades, two engineer companies, &c. – and fourteen brigades of Yeomanry cavalry. It was envisaged that these units would be used solely for home defence, though in the event almost all volunteered for overseas service; the first battalions arrived on the Continent in November.\nOverseas service\nForty-eight battalions of infantry were serving in India – the equivalent of four regular divisions&nbsp;— with five in Malta, four in South Africa, four in Egypt, and a dozen in various other Imperial outposts. A further nine regular cavalry regiments were serving in India, with two in South Africa and one in Egypt.\nThe forces in the rest of the British Empire were not expected to contribute to the Expeditionary Force. A sizeable proportion of these were part of the ten-division Army of India, a mixture of local forces and British regulars; planning had begun in August 1913 to arrange how the Indian forces could be used in a European war, and a tentative plan had been made for two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade to be added to the Expeditionary Force; these were dispatched, in the event, but did not arrive in France until October.\nIn the event, most of the overseas garrison units were withdrawn as soon as they could be replaced with Territorial battalions, and new regular divisions were formed piecemeal in the United Kingdom. None of these units arrived in time to see service with the Expeditionary Force.\nSee also\n*British infantry brigades of the First World War\nNotes\nReferences\n*Appendix 1: Order of battle of the British Expeditionary Force, August 1914.
