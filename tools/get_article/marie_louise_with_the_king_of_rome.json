A double portrait, it depicts Marie Louise, the second wife of Napoleon, with her son the  King of Rome. Napoleon had divorced his fist wife Josephine in 1809 in order to marry Marie Louise, the daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria. On 20 March 1811 she gave birth to the son and heir he craved.\nThe painting was displayed at the Salon of 1812 held at the Louvre in Paris. The last Salon to be held before Napoleon\"s downfall, it featured many works celebrating the Bonaparte dynasty of which this painting is typical. It was purchased from the Salon by Napoleon for theElysée Palace. Today it is in the collection of the Palace of Versailles.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Maison, Françoise.
