A total of ten athletes, seven men and three women, were selected to the team across five different sports, with two of them returning from London 2012. Table tennis player Suraju Saka, who competed at his third Games, was the oldest (aged 40) and most experienced member of the squad. Meanwhile, shot putter and reigning All-African Games champion Franck Elemba served as the nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.\nCongo narrowly missed out on its first ever Olympic medal in Rio de Janeiro, as Franck Elemba placed fourth in the men's shot put.\nAthletics (track and field)\nCongolese athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event):\n;Track & road events\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Quarterfinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Cecilia Bouele\n|align=left|Women's 100 m\n|11.98\n|2 Q\n|12.18\n|8\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\n;Field events\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Qualification\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Distance\n!Position\n!Distance\n!Position\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Franck Elemba\n|align=left|Men's shot put\n|20.45\n|11 q\n|21.20 NR\n|4\n|}\nBoxing\nCongo entered two boxers to compete in each of the following weight classes into the Olympic competition, signifying the nation's return to the sport for the first time since 1980.
