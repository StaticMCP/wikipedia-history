The peak is visible from Smith-Dorrien Road (742), and Alberta Highway 40 in the Kananaskis Lakes area. Mount Warspite's nearest higher peak is Mount Black Prince, located  to the northwest.\nLike many of the mountains in Kananaskis Country, Mount Warspite is named after figures and ships involved in the 1916 Battle of Jutland, a significant naval engagement of the First World War. Mount Warspite was named in 1917 for the British battleship HMS Warspite, one of the most decorated and revered ships in Royal Navy history that fought during the Battle of Jutland and survived to also serve in World War II. The mountain's name was  officially adopted in 1922 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada.\n__NOTOC__\nGeology\nMount Warspite is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Warspite is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below  with wind chill factors below . Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Kananaskis River, thence into the Bow River.\nSee also\n}}\n* List of mountains in the Canadian Rockies\n* Geography of Alberta\nReferences\n}}\n;Notes\nExternal links\n* Mt.
