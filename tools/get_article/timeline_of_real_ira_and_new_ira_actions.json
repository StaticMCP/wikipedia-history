The Real IRA was formed in 1997 by disaffected members of the Provisional IRA. Since July 2012, when Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and other small republican groups merged with it, the group has been called the New IRA; although it continues to call itself simply \"the Irish Republican Army\".\nIt has been the largest and most active of the dissident republican paramilitaries waging a campaign against the British security forces. The other main republican paramilitary groups are the group which calls itself Óglaigh na hÉireann, and the Continuity IRA. All actions listed took place in Northern Ireland unless stated otherwise.\n1998\nNote: for some of the incidents in 1998, it is unclear whether the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA, or both organisations were responsible.\n* 6 January: A 500&nbsp;lb car bomb was defused by the security forces in the centre of Banbridge, County Down.
