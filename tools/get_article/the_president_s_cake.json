Nine-year-old Lamia must gather ingredients to bake a mandatory cake to celebrate the president's birthday, or face punishment at her school. She is poor, and lives with her grandmother Bibi and her cockerel Hindi in the Mesopotamian Marshes. Groceries are expensive and scarce. She obtains a shopping list of flour, eggs, and sugar from Bibi, but Bibi, old and sick, takes Lamia by taxi to meet a woman who is to be her foster mother. Lamia takes flight, and is joined at the river by her friend Saeed to source the ingredients for the cake in the city, taking her father's watch to sell to buy the goods. Almost everyone else they encounter in the city are bad characters, and they survive a few scrapes. The taxi driver, Jasim, encounters Bibi again and joins the hunt for the little girl, as the police are not very interested in helping, being more preoccupied with the president's birthday.\nCast\n* Baneen Ahmad Nayyef as Lamia\n* Sajad Mohamad Qasem as Saeed\n* Waheed Thabet Khreibat as Bibi\n* Rahim AlHaj as Jasim\nProduction\nThe film is the feature directorial debut of Hasan Hadi, who co-wrote the script with Eric Roth.

He writes that the film is \"both entertaining and compelling, but only if you know little about Iraq... the film rehearses known stereotypes and corresponds to little that is real. Instead, it fulfills misconceptions of morbid Oriental cities reduced by despotic regimes to decadent theaters for the corrupt\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | Cannes Film Festival\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 24 May 2025\n| Directors' Fortnight Audience Award\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Hasan Hadi\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| Camera d'Or\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\" | Miskolc International Film Festival\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 13 September 2025\n| Emeric Pressburger Prize\n| rowspan=\"6\" | ''The President's Cake''\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| CICAE Jury Award\n|\n|-\n| FIPRESCI Jury Award for Best International Film\n|\n|-\n| International Ecumenical Jury Award\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hamptons International Film Festival\n| 13 October 2025\n| Best Narrative Feature\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Stockholm International Film Festival\n| 16 November 2025\n| Best Debut\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Asia Pacific Screen Awards\n| 27 November 2025\n| Best Youth Film\n| Hasan Hadi and Leah Chen Baker\n|\n| align=\"center\" |\n|}\nSee also\n* List of submissions to the 98th Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film\n* List of Iraqi submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
