After hearing a disturbing tape of a rabbi preaching \"hatred\" of non-Jews, Daum attempts to raise an outcry in his Brooklyn Orthodox community. When ignored by the media and community leaders, Daum decides to fly to Israel to discuss the matter with his two sons, concerned with the \"ethical legacy\" he is responsible for leaving them.\nHiding and Seeking was produced, written, and directed by Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky and aired on PBS's Point of View series in 2005. It has been met with high critical praise, receiving a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190903232540/http://www.pbs.org/pov/watch/hidingandseeking/ P.O.V.
