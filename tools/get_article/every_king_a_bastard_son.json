It was released on October 16, 1992. It was described by reviewer Benjamin Harper as \"alternatingly demonic, melancholic and tragic.\" He described \"The Evil Ones\" as a track \"of special note\". Authors for alternative music magazine Trouser Press described the album's lyrics as \"the most hair-raising poetry likely to be encountered outside a satanic cult read-in\", calling the album a \"deliberately horrific creation\" featuring \"sickening\" sound effects.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Donato Canzonieri - Arrangement, bass, guitar and album text\n*Erik Christides - Artwork and cover design\n*Ace Farren Ford - Arrangement, cello and musette\n*Wayne James - Engineering and mixing\n*Paris Sadonis - Arrangement and keyboards\n*Rozz Williams - Arrangement, artwork, collage, keyboards, vocals, production and slide guitar\nReferences\n*[http://www.allmusic.com/album/every-king-a-bastard-son-mw0000618705 Every King a Bastard Son].
