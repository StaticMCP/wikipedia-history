This was a battle between King of Vizianagaram led by Vijayram Raj II and East India Company Madras Presidency Forces led by Colonel Pendargast under the command of British Governor of Madras, Sir Charles Oakly. The British emerged victoriously and the King was shot dead in the middle of battle.\nAs a consequence of the war, Vizianagaram was occupied by East India Company and became a tributary estate or Zamindari.\nThe causes of war\nBy 1768, the tribal areas such as Parlakimidi, Ganjam, Mohiri, Gunsuru, and Pratapagiri were ruled by 20 Zamindars. They have 34 forts and maintained approximately 35,000 armed troops. Many of these jamindars revolted against the English East India Company. Some of the castles were located in the hills of the manyam. Therefore, the defeated rebel Zamindars retreated into the Hill fortress\nAfter the death of Ananda Gajapatiraju, Vijayaramaraju became Rajah of the Vizianagaram Zamindari. Still, he was a boy. So Sitaramaraju was appointed as divan, the step brother. When Rajah came to age, he removed Sitaramaraju from Diwani. Diwan was angered by this action, he formed an alliance with the English.\nThe British attempted to increase payment of peskas from Vijayanagara Zamindar and to reduce the strength of his army and ordered him to pay his dues of 8,50,000 peskas. Rajah argued that he had no dues, the British had captured Vijayanagara on 2 August 1793. British ordered that Vijayaramaraju must go to exile Masulipatnam with the pension of Rs 1200 per month. However, Vijayaramaraju refused these orders and he went to Padmanabham located between the Bhimunipatnam and Vizianagaram with 1000 troops. The British troops defeated the Vizianagaram army and Chinavijayaramaraju died due to bullet injury in the battle. The battle only lasted one and a half hours and the British lost 13 soldiers.\nAftermath\nAfter the death of Vijayaramaraju, his son Narayanababu found shelter in Makkuva village. The konda doras and sardars supported him. In the end, he made a treaty with the British and agreed to pay 5 million peskas.\nAfter that British occupied Vijayanagara Town. But they returned Zamindari to  Narayanababu. They renewed the zamindars lands and deprived them of their unique venture of Rebellion. By 1802, Britishers implemented the permanent tax system for zamindaris.\nA book on the battle written by Challapragada Satyanarayana Murthy and published by the Telugu Academy was released in 2003 by Ashok Gajapathi Raju.\nReferences\n*ఆంధ్రప్రదేశ్ సమగ్రచరిత్ర, పి.వి.కె.ప్రసాదరావు, ఎమెస్కో, విజయవాడ, 2007."
