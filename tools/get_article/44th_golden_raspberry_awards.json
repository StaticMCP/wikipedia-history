These awards are based on votes from members of the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation (1,179 movie buffs, film critics and journalists from 49 US States, and two dozen foreign countries). The nominations were announced on January 22, 2024. Additionally, with four nods, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania earned the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) its first-ever Razzie nominations, breaking the franchise's 16-year streak without a single Razzie Award nomination.\nIn August 2023, a statement by John J. B. Wilson and Maureen \"Mo\" Murphy announced that the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation was considering the possibility of setting a new precedent by awarding Walt Disney Studios the Barry L. Bumstead Award to an entire studio for the first time ever (and not just an individual theatrical film). This is due to Disney's centennial anniversary releases (ex. Peter Pan & Wendy, Elemental, Wish, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Little Mermaid, Haunted Mansion, The Marvels, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, etc.) causing \"the once phenomenally profitable Walt Disney Pictures [to suffer] failure after failure at the box office\" when \"corporate honchos had hoped to spend th[e] entire year celebrating a century of success\". Ultimately the award was not presented.\nUpon hearing of Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey sweeping every award it was nominated for, the film's director, Rhys Frake-Waterfield reacted in an interview for Variety, \"I'm surprised our micro-budget film is being compared to Hollywood, but nevertheless I don't mind the dubious honor as it places me in the same pool as directors whose work I admire so much.\" Producer, Scott Chambers, also chimed in with his reaction being “I think it is something to celebrate. But yeah, I’m always a little bit protective of Rhys because obviously he’s so early on in his career where the others, David Gordon Green and stuff that were in his category, they’ve got a solid career whereas Rhys is so early,” expanding with “And I feel like the director one was probably the one I disagree with the most, but the others, I’m like, ‘Yeah, whatever.’ Do you know what I mean? It is what it is it’s, and it’s fine.”\nWinners and nominees\n, Worst Director and Worst Screenplay winner and Worst Picture co-winner]]\n, Worst Actor winner]]\n, Worst Actress and Worst Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Worst Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Razzie Redeemer Award winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n* Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey (Altitude Film Distribution) – Scott Jeffrey and Rhys Frake-Waterfield\n** The Exorcist: Believer (Universal) – Jason Blum, David C.
