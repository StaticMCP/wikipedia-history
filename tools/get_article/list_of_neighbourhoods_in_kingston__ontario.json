Different from the city's twelve electoral districts, the neighbourhoods as defined by the City all share common socio-demographic characteristics.. Detailed socio-demographic information on the city can be found in the Kingston Community Profile, 2009: A Socio-Demographic Analysis of Kingston, Ontario Canada. The profile is published by the Social Planning Council of Kingston and District (SPCKD). While some of these neighbourhoods have established their own business improvement area, others are simply a designation given by the City of Kingston in recognition of their distinct attributes and characteristicsMap of Kingston, Ontario.\nThe divisions are arbitrary; they follow census boundaries but often chop existing, recognised neighbourhoods (including the central business district) in two.\nDowntown and inner suburbs\nThese points (and a few others, including Polson Park, Rideau Heights and Alcan), if not part of the original city, were annexed to Kingston from Kingston Township or the former village of Portsmouth no later than the 1950s.\n{|\n|-\n|width=\"160px\"|Sydenham|| width=\"160px\"|Queen's||width=\"160px\"|Inner Harbour||width=\"160px\"|Alwington\n|-\n|Sunnyside||Williamsville||Kingscourt||Kingston Penitentiary\n|-\n|Portsmouth Village||Calvin Park||Hillendale\n|}\nKingston - West\nMost (but not all) of these points were in the former Township of Kingston, annexed on January 1, 1998.
