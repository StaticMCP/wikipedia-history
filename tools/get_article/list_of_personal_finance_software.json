Some software differs by feature support, software code and development transparency, mobile app features, import methods, Monetization model, privacy and data storage practices.\nRisks\nThe use of expense tracking, budgeting, and other personal finance software carries some risk, most notably is due to the disclosure of a username, password, or other account credentials used to automatically synchronize banking information with an expense tracking application. Another significant area of risk is due to sensitive personal information that is stored anytime data is digitized. This risk may be compounded based on the security the software vendor has implemented as well as the availability of the data and where specifically it is stored (online or a local application). An often overlooked form of risk is due to the monetization model and privacy practices of the vendor or software provider, whether the application is \"free\" or fee based. Open source software is one way of potentially minimizing the risks of privacy and monetization related risks of data exposure.\nThe following is a list of personal financial management software. The first section is devoted to free and open-source software, and the second is for proprietary software.\nFree and open-source personal financial management software\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
