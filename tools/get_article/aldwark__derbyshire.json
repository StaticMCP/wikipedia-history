Close by are a number of Neolithic burial sites, the most notable being tree-crowned Minninglow, visible for many miles around.\nThe village is just within the boundaries of the Peak District National Park. The 2001 census recorded a population of just 39 for the parish; over 100 years ago, the township's inhabitants numbered 40. At the 2011 Census the population had increased to 180. In the 18th century Aldwark was probably busier, being a stopping point on the stagecoach route from Buxton to Derby.\nThere are three listed buildings in the village – Green Farmhouse, Ivy Cottage and Lidgate Farmhouse – all designated at Grade II.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Aldwark, Derbyshire\nReferences\nExternal links"
