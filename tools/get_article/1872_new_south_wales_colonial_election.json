This election was for all of the 72 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 52 single-member constituencies, six 2-member constituencies and two 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult white males. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 3 February 1872 by the Governor, Lord Belmore, on the advice of the Premier, Sir James Martin.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
