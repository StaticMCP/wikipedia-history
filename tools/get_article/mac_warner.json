Warner also previously served as the West Virginia secretary of state from 2017 to 2025. He announced his candidacy for Governor of West Virginia in 2024 on January 10, 2023.\nEarly life and education\nWarner graduated from United States Military Academy at West Point and later with a J.D. from West Virginia University School of Law and LL.M. from JAG School and University of Virginia School of Law in International Law.\nCareer\nWarner served in the United States Army in the U.S. Army JAG Corps. He retired from military service and became a United States Department of State contractor.\nWarner was elected West Virginia secretary of state in 2016 and reorganized the office upon taking control of it, resulting in the firing of 16 staffers. All employees of the secretary of state are hired at the \"will and pleasure\" of the elected officeholder and have no civil service status. The Warner layoffs included staff members who had served multiple administrations—Republican and Democratic.\nIn January 2018, the secretary of state's office announced that it had processed 45,000 new voter registrations in 2017, including 13,995 high school students, while over 86,000 registrations were cancelled due to deaths, out-of-date information, duplication, or felony status.\nWarner and Attorney General of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sided with the Ohio secretary of state in a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case regarding a state's right to purge voter registration rolls. The court ruled 5-4 in Ohio's favor.\nAfter Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and made false claims of fraud, Warner defended Trump's claims and participated in \"Stop the Steal\" protests.\nWarner opposes the For the People Act, which would expand voting rights. He opposes automatic voter registration, mail-in voting, and same-day voter registration.\nIn January 2025, Warner was appointed as acting United States assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.\nPersonal life\nHe lives in Morgantown, West Virginia. He is brothers with Kasey Warner, former United States attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia and fellow former J.A.G. Corps officer. His other brothers are Kris Warner, former chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party and his successor as Secretary of State, and Monty Warner, the 2004 Republican nominee for Governor of West Virginia.\nHe is the father of four children, who are all current or former Army officers. He is married to Debbie Warner, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates for district 82.\nReferences\n|-"
