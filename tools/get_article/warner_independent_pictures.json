Entertainment. Established on August 7, 2003, its first release was 2004's Before Sunset, the sequel to the 1995 film Before Sunrise. The division financed, produced, acquired and distributed feature films largely budgeted under $20 million. The division closed on November 12, 2008.\nCompany History\nWarner Independent Pictures was established on August 7, 2003, at Burbank, California. Mark Gill was the division's first president. After a controversial departure, Gill was replaced by former Warner Bros. production executive Polly Cohen, who served as president of this division until fall 2008, when the division was officially shut down. While well versed in big-budget motion picture production, it was widely believed Cohen did not have strong enough backgrounds in independent film, or in the marketing/publicity aspects of film distribution, to hold that role. This led to a lackluster slate and output, after a successful initial run under Gill.\nIn February 2008, Time Warner announced that it would merge New Line Cinema into Warner Bros. New Line's \"independent\" group Picturehouse was expected to be merged into Warner Independent as part of this process. On May 8, 2008, however, it was announced that both of these specialty divisions would be shut down.\nIn 2013, Picturehouse was relaunched under separate ownership.\nFilms\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
