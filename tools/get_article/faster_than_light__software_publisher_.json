The aim was for FTL to publish arcade-style games, while Gargoyle would concentrate on its core business of adventure games.\nGames\n*Light Force (1986) was a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with a large main ship. The player had to survive alien attacks in four different sectors of the planet Regulus.\n*Hydrofool (1987) was an isometric 3D game set in a giant aquarium, and a sequel to the similar (though drier) ''Sweevo's World. The player had to avoid fish and collect objects with the ultimate aim of pulling out enough plugs to drain the aquarium.\n*Shockway Rider'' (1987) was set in the future, where gangs of thugs roamed the moving walkways built around a huge city. The player had to collect weapons and bonus objects, and go \"full circle\" by surviving the perilous journey through the eight districts.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
