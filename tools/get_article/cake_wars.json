Jonathan Bennett hosted the competition, where four bakers face off to have their cakes featured in a special event, in addition to a $10,000 prize. Star pastry chefs Waylynn Lucas, Ron Ben-Israel and Richard Ruskell judge which cakes are worthy of headlining parties for pop culture media such as The Simpsons, The Sound of Music, DC Comics, and more. The first and fifth seasons of the show ran for eight episodes and later seasons of the show ran for thirteen episodes. There was also an annual Christmas-themed spin-off of the show called Cake Wars: Christmas, which made its debut the same year as Cake Wars.\nIt was announced on December 2, 2015, that Cake Wars was renewed for a second season. The new season featured themes that included Star Wars, Dr. Seuss, and Willy Wonka cakes.\nPremise\nThe show is almost identical to Cupcake Wars, except that the contestants design their creations out of regular cakes instead of cupcakes and there are two rounds instead of three. The first round is called \"Batter Up,\" and the contestants are required to choose a certain number of ingredients that go with the episode's theme. One contestant is eliminated after the first round, and in the second round (called \"Cake Off\"), each of the teams is given two more assistants to help them make their biggest creations and improve any mistakes they may have made in the first round. Before the winner is announced, one person of the three remaining contestants is eliminated, and the winner is chosen from the two remaining contestants.\nTheme\nThe show invites cake bakers from all over the United States to compete. Each episode is centered on the theme or event; past themes include a birthday party for baby hippo from the Los Angeles Zoo, a party for the forty-fifth anniversary of the classic film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and a film festival, etc.\nJudges\nJust like in Cupcake Wars, almost every episode of Cake Wars has three judges (some have four judges), two of whom are permanent judges. The guest judge(s) is usually someone who has something to do with the event for the episode, or at least someone who fits in with the theme of the episode. All the judges have the opportunity to constructively critique the cake competitors after each round of battle. The three permanent judges are:\n*Ron Ben-Israel: Owner of Ron Ben-Israel Cakes in New York City and the former host of Sweet Genius (Seasons 1–3). In the \"Garfield\" and \"Where's Waldo\" episodes, Cupcake Wars judge Florian Bellanger filled in for Ron.\n*Waylynn Lucas: With voice actress-turned-baker, Nancy Truman, Waylynn Lucas was the former co-founder of \"Fonuts,\" a healthier spin on the traditional coffee-and-donut shop. In the \"Sound of Music\" episode, Amy Berman filled in for Waylynn.\nEpisode guide\nSeason 1 (2015)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n! width=2% | No.\n! width=15% | Title\n! width=32% | Theme/Event\n! width=35% | Guest judges\n! width=8% | Air date\n|-\n|1\n| \"The Simpsons\"\n| Event celebrating the success of The Simpsons\n| Matt Selman, show writer\n| June 29, 2015\n|-\n|2\n| \"DC Comics\"\n| Opening of a new DC Comics headquarters\n| Dan DiDio, Jim Lee, and Geoff Johns, artist, executive editor, and writer, respectively\n| July 6, 2015\n|-\n|3\n| \"The Knot\"\n| theknot.com wedding\n| Samantha Carisch and Taylor Sinclair (couple)\n| July 13, 2015\n|-\n|4\n| \"Nintendo\"\n| Promotional event for Wii U's Super Mario Maker video game\n| Krysta Yang, Assistant Manager of Public Relations for Nintendo of America\n| July 20, 2015\n|-\n|5\n| \"Hello Kitty\"\n| Launch of ''Hello Kitty's North American tour\n| Katherine McNamara, actress\n| July 27, 2015\n|-\n|6\n| \"LEGO\"\n| LEGO flagship store event\n| Michael McNally, Senior Director of Brand Relations for The Lego Group\n| Aug 3, 2015\n|-\n|7\n| \"The Sound of Music\"\n| 50th anniversary of The Sound of Music''\n| Angela Cartwright and Kym Karath, actresses from the film\n| Aug 10, 2015\n|-\n|8\n| \"Girl Scouts\"\n| 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts' Gold Award\n| Katherine Hightower, Girl Scouts\n| Aug 17, 2015\n|-\n|}\n2015 Christmas special\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n! width=2% | No.\n! width=15% | Title\n! width=32% | Theme/Event\n! width=35% | Guest judges\n! width=8% | Air date\n|-\n|1\n| \"Christmas: Ultimate Christmas Lights\"\n| Inspired by Frozen and Christmas lights\n| Chris Buck, film director\n| Nov 9, 2015\n|-\n|2\n| \"Christmas: Who's Coming Down the Chimney?\"\n| Inspired by ugly Christmas sweaters\n| Chanda Bell and Christa Pitts, founders of The Elf on the Shelf\n| Nov 16, 2015\n|-\n|3\n| \"Christmas: Santa's New Ride\"\n| Inspired by Christmas elves and Santa's sleigh\n| Joy Cho, founder and creative director for Oh Joy!\n| Nov 23, 2015\n|-\n|4\n| \"Christmas: Holiday Song\"\n| Inspired by outer space and Christmas carols\n| Devin Ratray, actor who played Buzz in Home Alone\n| Nov 30, 2015\n|-\n|5\n| \"Christmas: Charlie Brown Celebrates\"\n| 50th anniversary of A Charlie Brown Christmas\n| Lindsey Schulz, author and granddaughter of Peanuts creator Charles M.
