Amtrak's Southwest Chief trains stop at the Kingman station once daily in each direction.  Kingman is also the transfer point for dedicated, guaranteed Amtrak Thruway service to/from Laughlin, Nevada and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThis station has an enclosed waiting room, but is unstaffed. There are no ticket agents or Quik-Trak kiosks on site.\nOf the eight Arizona stations served by Amtrak (in 2020), Kingman was the third-busiest in fiscal year 2020, boarding or detraining 5,536 passengers in 2020.\nHistory\nThe Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) built the depot in 1907.  The station's elevation is  above sea level. The station has been a contributing property to the Kingman Commercial Historic District, which has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1986. Like many depots constructed by the ATSF, the building exhibits characteristics of the Spanish Colonial Revival style of architecture, particularly in the roofline's curvilinear gables. In early 2011, the city of Kingman finished a multi-year restoration of the depot. The work was funded in part through a $471,500 federal Transportation Enhancements grant and approximately $150,000 in federal Community Development Block Grants. Following the rehabilitation, the depot houses a passenger waiting room and a railroad museum.\nThe depot is the third station in Kingman, and is built of poured concrete.  The first station was destroyed by fire, as was the 1901-built \"fire proof\" one, which burned to the ground in 1906.\nIt is served by Amtrak's Southwest Chief's  route from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California, with one eastbound and one westbound stop daily.\nSee also\n*Kingman Santa Fe Depot, Kingman, Kansas\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/kingman.htm Kingman Amtrak Station (USA RailGuide – TrainWeb)]\n* [http://www.kingmantourism.org/kingman-info/schedules/amtrak.php Kingman, Arizona Tourism]"
