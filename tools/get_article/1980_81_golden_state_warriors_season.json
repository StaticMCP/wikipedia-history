Late in the season, they were still in a playoff hunt with a 36–34 record before losing 7 of the next 9 games as the Houston Rockets and the Kansas City Kings got red hot and passed the Warriors. Golden State still had a chance to qualify for the playoffs on the last day of the season, but a 96–92 loss in Seattle combined with the Kings' 113–104 win vs. Dallas left the Warriors as the odd team out.\nNotes\n* z, y – division champions\n* x – clinched playoff spot\nGame log\nPlayer statistics\nSeason\nAwards and records\n* Larry Smith, NBA All-Rookie Team 1st Team\n* Joe Barry Carroll, NBA All-Rookie Team 1st Team\nTransactions\nReferences\nSee also\n* 1980-81 NBA season"
