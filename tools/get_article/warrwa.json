Their inland extension reached as far as the upper Logue River. Their presence on the Fitzroy River was thought to run only as far as Yeeda. They were also present in the area of Derby, and north of Meda, inland to roughly . To their north lay the Umiida, on their eastern flank were the Unggumi, while the Nyigina were on their southern frontier.\nPre-contact times\nAccording to Tindale, in pre-contact times, the Warrwa were affected by the movement of the Nyigina down the Fitzroy river, which effectively drove a wedge between Warrwa clans, that were subsequently cut off from each other. The incoming Nyigina distinguished thereafter the western Warwa ('little Warrwa') from the eastern Warrwa around Derby and Meda ('big Warrwa').\nAlternative names\n* Waruwa\n* Warwai, Warrwai\n* Kolaruma (an Unggumi exonym for them meaning 'people of the coast')\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n}}\n*\n| access-date = 1 December 2017\n| archive-date = 8 March 2016\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160308145114/https://www.daa.wa.gov.au/globalassets/pdf-files/maps/state/tindale_daa.pdf\n| url-status = dead\n}}\n*\n*\n*"
