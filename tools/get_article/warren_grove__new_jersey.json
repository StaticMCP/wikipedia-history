Its location in the heart of the Pine Barrens makes it one of the most secluded and remote corners of the state.\nWarren Grove is the namesake of the nearby Warren Grove Gunnery Range, though the range is actually located in adjacent Bass River Township. Warren Grove is also home to the Pygmy Pine Plains, populated by dwarf pitch pine and blackjack oaks.\nReferences"
