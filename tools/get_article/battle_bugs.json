A PlayStation port was published in Japan in 1997.\nGameplay\nThe game details a war of one group of insects battling against another. The battlefields are common household places such as the kitchen floor or the backyard. The player must navigate their bugs, each with special skills, and engage the enemies’ bugs.\nThe main objective of each battle is to either eradicate all of the enemy bugs or 'capture' every piece of food on the battlefield. This is achieved by positioning your bugs on the food long enough to raise a flag. When all pieces of food bear your team's flag, the battle is won. However, the enemy bugs will attempt to do the same thing and can reclaim captured food.\nThe game develops the logical skills of the player. Different bugs are stronger and weaker versus other types of bugs so the player must combine different strategies to go to the next mission.\nThere is also a multiplayer mode that can be played. It involves hot-seating between two players by pressing 'pause' on a virtual stopwatch, similar to the way that competitive chess is played.\nReception\n}}\nRobert L. Hayes Jr. of Computer Gaming World wrote, \"No one will lose their jobs or spouse to an overdose of Battle Bugs playing, but plenty of gamers will have many enjoyable evenings of conquering cheese wedges and slaughtering spiders.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
