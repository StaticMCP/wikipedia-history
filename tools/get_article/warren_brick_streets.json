The sections include blocks of Cedar, Myrtle, Chestnut, 1st, Walnut, Elm, and Cypress Streets, and include nearly  of pavement.  The bricks are laid out in a running bond pattern up to intersections, where a diamond pattern is used, partly to maintain the position of the bricks.   The bricks measure 4 by 8.5 inches, and are probably 2 inches thick.  The streets are  wide, with 2 feet of concrete gutter and curbing.  It is surmised that the bricks were laid on a concrete substrate, in part because the condition of the surviving sections is very good.\nThe street sections were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Bradley County, Arkansas\nReferences"
