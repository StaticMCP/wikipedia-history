Grant of Illinois and his running mate Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts. Grant and Wilson defeated the Liberal Republican and Democratic nominees, former Congressman Horace Greeley of New York and his running mate former Senator and Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown of Missouri by a margin of 9.04%.\nThis was the first time the Republicans won all the electoral votes of New Jersey, (see 1860 election in New Jersey for more information) as well as the popular vote.
