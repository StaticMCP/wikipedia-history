      "text": "# Early Experiences of Colonial Life in South Australia\n\nEarly Experiences of Colonial Life in South Australia is a book by John Wrathall Bull originally published as \"Early Experiences of Colonial Life by An arrival of 1838\" as weekly instalments in The Advertiser, repeated in its associated Chronicle and Weekly Mail.\nAfter the Advertiser issue of 29 September 1877 the articles were only published in the Chronicle, and the last few were a week or two late. All may accessed via Trove, a service of the National Library of Australia.\nThe book is only part memoir; much of the narrative was contributed by the protagonists, whom Bull knew personally, and much of the content reflects his pragmatic view of history.\nThe issues\n*[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article90882099 No. I.
