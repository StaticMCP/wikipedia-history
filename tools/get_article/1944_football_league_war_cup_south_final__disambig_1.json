The match took place at Wembley Stadium on 15 April 1944 and was won by Charlton Athletic, who beat Chelsea 3–1. Charlton later contested a play-off against the winners of the equivalent North final, Aston Villa.\nMatch summary\nChelsea took an early lead with a penalty from Joe Payne. Charlton equalised through Charlie Revell and took the lead on 36 minutes when a defensive mix-up enabled Don Welsh to score. Revell scored Charlton's third a minute later to put the game beyond Chelsea's reach. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied forces, presented the cup to victorious captain Welsh. The match produced a record gate of £26,000, of which £12,000 was recouped by the Government in Entertainment Tax.\nMatch details\n|goals2=Revell  Welsh\n|stadium=Wembley Stadium, London\n|attendance=85,000\n|referee=\n}}\n}}\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|||1 || Vic Woodley\n|-\n|||2 || George Hardwick\n|-\n|||3 || Eric Westwood\n|-\n|||4 || William Russell\n|-\n|||5 || John Harris\n|-\n|||6 || Dick Foss\n|-\n|||7 || Llew Ashcroft\n|-\n|||8 || Jimmy Bowie\n|-\n|||9 || Joe Payne\n|-\n|||10|| Willie Fagan\n|-\n|||11|| Charlie Mitten\n|-\n|colspan=3|Manager:\n|-\n|colspan=4| Billy Birrell\n|}\n|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n{| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|||1 || Sam Bartram\n|-\n|||2 || John Shreeve\n|-\n|||3 || Joe Jobling\n|-\n|||4 || George Smith\n|-\n|||5 || Jackie Oakes\n|-\n|||6 || Allenby Chilton\n|-\n|||7 || George Robinson\n|-\n|||8 || Sailor Brown\n|-\n|||9 || Charlie Revell\n|-\n|||10|| Don Welsh\n|-\n|||11|| Chris Duffy\n|-\n|colspan=3|Manager:\n|-\n|colspan=4| Jimmy Seed\n|}\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
