The etymology is the same as that of Warbreck (Lancashire). The place-name was recorded as Varebrikke in 1035.\n1980 boundaries\nThe ward boundary was changed for the 1980 elections. A report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England published in November 1978 set out proposals for changes to the wards of Liverpool City Council, maintaining the number of councillors at 99 representing 33 wards. Warbreck ward was represented by three councillors.\nThe report describes the boundaries of Warbreck ward as \"Commencing at a point where Breeze Hill meets the northwestern boundary of the City, thence generally northeastwards along said boundary to Roosevelt Drive, thence southeastwards along said drive to Helling Road, thence southwestwards along said road to the road known as Warbreck Moor, thence southwards along said road to Albany Road, thence eastwards along said road to Goodacre Road, thence southeastwards along said road to Longmoor Lane, thence southwestwards along said lane to Long Lane, thence southeastwards along said lane to Stopgate Lane, thence southeastwards along said lane to Charnock Road, thence southwestwards along said road to its end being the northeastern boundary of the Factory, thence northwestwards along said boundary and southwestwards along the northwestern boundary of said factory and in prolongation thereof to the northern boundary of Walton Hall Park, thence westwards and southwestwards along said northern boundary to a point due north of the northernmost corner of Hetherlow Towers, thence due south to said corner, thence generally southwestwards along the northern, and western boundaries of Hetherlow Towers, the northwestern boundary of the Corporation Yard and the northwestern boundary of the Builder's Yard to Moor Lane, thence southwestwards along said lane to the road known as Queens Drive Walton, thence westwards along said road, North Breeze Hill and Breeze Hill to the point of commencement\".\n2004 boundaries\nA review by the Boundary Committee for England recommended that the council was formed of a reduced number of 90 members elected from 30 wards. The ward was retained as a smaller ward, gaining a small part of the former Pirrie ward and losing small areas to the new County and Fazakerley wards. The ward was part of the Liverpool Walton Parliamentary constituency.\nThe ward boundaries followed the boundary of the city with Sefton, the former Southport and Cheshire Lines Extension Railway, the Liverpool to Manchester Lines#Northern route, Long Lane, Stopgate Lane, the northern property boundary on Pirrie Lane, the western property boundary on Torrisholme Road, Walton Hall Avenue, the northern boundary of Walton Hall Park, Moor Lane, Rice Lane, the southern boundary of Walton Hospital.\nThe ward contained HM Prison Liverpool, Hartley Village and was close to the Netherton area of Bootle. There is also a \"Warbreck\" public house within the ward's boundaries situated on Orrell Lane.\nThe population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 16,481, and at the 2021 Census was 15,398.\n2023 elections\nFollowing a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors, the ward was split up into the new Orrell Park, and Walton wards\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Jean Seddon (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Richard Roberts (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Elsie Lang (LD)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Jean Seddon (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard Roberts (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Elsie Lang (LD)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jean Seddon (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jean Seddon (LD)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Maria McEvoy (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Maria McEvoy (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Maria McEvoy (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Cheryl Harrison (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Cheryl Harrison (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Cheryl Didsbury (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Cheryl Didsbury (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Cheryl Didsbury (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Richard McLinden (Lab)\n|-\n| 2020\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Cheryl Didsbury (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: #fff\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| vacant\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Cheryl Didsbury (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Alan Gibbons (Lab)\n|-\n| 2022\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Sam East (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ann O'Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Alan Gibbons (Lab)\n|-\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\n*Cllr Elsie Lang (Lib Dem, 2004) died of tubercular meningitis in July 2007.\n*Cllr Richard McLinden (Labour, 2016), died of Covid in November 2020.
