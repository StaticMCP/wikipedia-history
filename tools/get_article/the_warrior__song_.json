Written by Holly Knight and Nick Gilder, the song was included on their debut and sole studio album, Warrior (1984). The song reached number seven in the United States and number one in Canada, as well as number one on the US Billboard Rock Top Tracks chart, and won a BMI Airplay Award in 1984. It was also a hit in Australia, where it peaked at number six, and in New Zealand and South Africa, reaching number 11 in both countries. The music video for the song was directed by David Hahn.\nBackground\nCo-writer Holly Knight said, \"I think that idea of being a warrior had been inside me for a long time. I grew up in a somewhat 'dysfunctional' family where there was a lot of drama and fighting. I was always more interested in fighting FOR something rather than fighting with someone, and without being cognizant of it, it was a constant theme in my psyche, and hence, my songs.\"\nTrack listings\n7-inch single\n:A. \"The Warrior\" – 3:35\n:B. \"Less Than Half\" – 4:18\n12-inch picture disc\n:A1. \"The Warrior\"\n:A2. \"Hands Tied\"\n:B1. \"Goodbye to You\"\n:B2. \"Love's Got a Line on You\"\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1984–1985)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|6\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n|11\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1984)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|62\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n|22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|46\n|}\nCertifications\nIn popular culture\nThe song was used as the opening theme to both the 2017–2019 Netflix television series GLOW, and the 2024 Sonic the Hedgehog spin-off television series Knuckles.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47y5bo8wtqM Music video]"
