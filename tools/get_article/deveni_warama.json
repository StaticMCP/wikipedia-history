It is the 1281st Sri Lankan film in the Sinhala cinema.\nPlot\nKusal Karaliyadda is a young man who doesn't like young girls. He wants to take the hand of a rural girl.\nBut Kusal does not belong to a rural generation. His father was a prominent minister in the country. The mother also belongs to the bourgeoisie. In spite of that, Samanmalee is the beauty who finds the merits of a rural rubber girl who falls for the simple countryside.\nIn the face of this arbitrary Kusal's quarrel, Kusal's father's father is adamant in his decision to marry a friend's daughter to Kusal. That proposed ruby also makes a lot of sacrifices to change Kusal's mind.\nAmisha, Kusal, Samanmalee love story takes a different dimension as the magical third joins between the two who turn the bilateral love into a love triangle that meets Samanmalith while enjoying the series of films that revolve around different rural and urban environments.\nCast\n* Pubudu Chathuranga as Kusal Karaliyadde\n* Rishi Anjela as Samanmali / Ameesha\n* Tennyson Cooray as John, the chef\n* Rex Kodippili as Wickrama Karaliyadde, Kusal's father\n* Cletus Mendis as Somaratne\n* Gayathri Dias as Receptionist\n* Kumari Munasinghe as Samanmali's mother\n* Samudra Hikkaduwa as Surangi Karaliyadde, Kusal's mother\n* Premadasa Vithanage as Atapattu, security officer\n* Chinthaka Peiris as Priyantha, Kusal's friend\nReferences"
