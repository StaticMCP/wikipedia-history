By 1991, the company was the third largest hotelier in the United Kingdom, after Forte Group and Mount\nCharlotte. On 31 March 1993, trading in its shares was suspended after an accounting scandal. The company was subsequently investigated under Section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985. In 1997, the company sold 25 hotels. The company was bought by Goldman Sachs in August 2005 and renamed QMH Limited. In October 2005, 9 hotels were sold for approximately £100m. In February 2013, 20 German hotels were sold to Fattal Hotels, an Israeli company. In 2014, 11 hotels were sold to Marathon Asset Management.\nReferences"
