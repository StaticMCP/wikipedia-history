Founded in 1967 after a successful campaign by the local Darling Downs community, the university is a founding member of the Regional Universities Network.\nThe main Toowoomba campus occupies a large area of south-western Toowoomba in the suburb of Darling Heights. Campuses in Ipswich and Springfield also exist alongside a Brisbane City industry hub. The university owns and operates the Mount Kent Observatory, which is the only professional astronomical research observatory in Queensland. The Ravensbourne Field Studies Centre, which acts as a research centre for environmental science, is also operated by the university. The university has partnered with the Canterbury Institute of Technology to offer the Sydney Education Centre.\nThrough twelve schools, the university offers a variety of associate, bachelor, master, doctoral, and higher doctorate degrees The university operates three research institutes and nine research centres which focus on a wide range of business, agricultural, scientific, environmental, and technological issues. Recent notable research includes the discovery of Gliese 12 b, an Earth-like planet 40 light years away making it the closest located to date.\nThe University of Southern Queensland consistently ranks among the top 400 universities worldwide. In the 2026 US News Best Global Universities rankings, it is positioned at 278th. In the 2025 QS World University Rankings, the University of Southern Queensland holds the 396th spot. In the 2023 Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings, it is placed within the 301-350 range.\nHistory\n1960 to 1966: Darling Downs University Establishment Association (DDUEA)\nAfter a meeting of over 200 members of the Toowoomba community on 2 December 1960, the Darling Downs University Establishment Association (DDUEA) was founded with the purpose of establishing a university in the Darling Downs region. Chaired by former mayor of Toowoomba Dr. Alex McGregor, the association successfully lobbied the local, state, and federal government for the establishment of an Institute of Technology located in Toowoomba. After the establishment of the Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs), the association became known as the Darling Downs Association for Advanced Education (DDAAE), and later Darling Downs Unilink Limited. Darling Downs Unilink Limited went into receivership in 1996, with a subsequent auction of the organisation's art collection.\n1967 to 1971: Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) (QITDD)\nThe Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) [QITDD] opened on 2 February 1967 in Toowoomba with 140 enrolled students.\n1971 to 1989: Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE)\nIn 1971, the institution was renamed to the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE). Managed by its own College Council, DDIAE educated 75% of offshore international students in the 1986-1987 school year.\nOn the evening of 11 April 1979, a fire destroyed the Administration Building (B Block). This resulted in the loss of the mailroom and switchboard. The cause of the fire was a staff member activating a bank of light switches which, unbeknownst to them, were also connected to a wall strip heater obscured by computer printout paper. While the damage was significant, student academic records were not affected and the institute was able to continue operating.\nFrom 1980 to 1990, DDIAE grew significantly from 1,000 to 8,000 full-time student equivalents (EFTSL).\n1990 to 1991: University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ)\nIt became the University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) in 1990, under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland.\n1992 to present: University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ, formerly USQ)\nIn 1992, the institution became the University of Southern Queensland when it gained full university status.\nThe university was a founding member of the Regional Universities Network that was launched in 2011. The Network's research in 2013 showed that the university generated $411.7 million into the economy of Queensland every year as well as household income of $255.4 million and 3,313 jobs in the communities of Toowoomba, Fraser Coast, and Springfield.\nIn 2012, the university's archaeologists discovered the oldest Australian rock art of 28,000 years old in the Northern Territory, and in 2018, the university's astronomers discovered a new planet that orbits an ancient star almost 2 billion years older than the sun. It has been recognised for its efforts in preventing violence against women and was cited as employer of choice for gender equality by the Federal Government's Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).\nIn June 2022, the university announced it was changing its branding from USQ to UniSQ, accompanied by a change in logo.\nIn June 2025, the Queensland College of Wine Tourism reached a funding deal and transferred away from university operations after the university withdrew funding from the college.\nMilestones\n* 2004, 8 July: Groundbreaking was held at Springfield campus.\n* 2006, 11 August: Springfield campus was officially opened by Minister for Education and Science Julie Bishop.\n* 2007, Semester 1: The first students started their studies at Springfield campus.\n* 2014, 5 March: Health & Recreation Club worth of $1.2 million and Engineering Laboratory were opened at Springfield campus.\n* 2015, 7 January: Ipswich campus was formally transferred to from the University of Queensland.\n* 2015, 10 August: Clinical simulation labs worth of $1.7 million were opened at Ipswich campus.\n* 2015, 26 August: Building B (Awarded 6 Star Green Star by Green Building Council of Australia) worth of $45 million was opened at Springfield campus.\n* 2016, Semester 1: Bachelor of Aviation was launched at Springfield campus and Bachelor of Midwifery was launched at Ipswich campus.\n* 2016, 20 June: Psychology and Counselling Clinic was opened at Ipswich campus.\n* 2017, 1 March: Midwifery Simulation Centre and Paramedic Simulation House were opened at Ipswich campus.\n* 2017, 27 October: Boeing 737 flight simulator worth of $1 million went into operation at Springfield campus.\n* 2017, Semester 2: The first students of Bachelor of Paramedicine were farewelled at Ipswich campus.\nOrganisation and administration\nGovernance\nThe fourteen-member council is the governing body of the University of Southern Queensland.\nThe council is made up of the following people:\n* Chancellor\n* Vice-chancellor\n* Chairperson of the academic board\n* Five members appointed by Governor in Council\n* One elected member of general staff\n* One elected member of academic staff\n* One elected member of the student body who is not also a staff member\n* One additional members who cannot be a student or staff member, with at least one being a graduate\nAcademic schools\nThe university has twelve schools that support teaching and research:\n* School of Agriculture and Environmental Science\n* School of Business\n* School of Creative Arts\n* School of Education\n* School of Health and Medical Sciences\n* School of Humanities and Communication\n* School of Law and Justice\n* School of Engineering\n* School of Nursing and Midwifery\n* School of Psychology and Wellbeing\n* School of Mathematics, Physics and Computing\n* School of Surveying and Built Environment\nThe University of Southern Queensland uses multiple academic calendars depending on the academic course studied, with the most common being a Trimester academic calendar.\nStudent life\nSports and athletics\nIn the 2015 Northern Uni Games, student-athletes won a gold medal in women's tennis, both gold and silver medals in lawn bowls, and bronze medals in both men's and women's basketball.
