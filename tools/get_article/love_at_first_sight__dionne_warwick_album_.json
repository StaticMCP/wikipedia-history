Records.\nOverview\nThe album was produced by Michael Omartian and Steve Barri. The sound of the longplay resembled the previous works of the artist in the Scepter Records period. The track “Early Morning Strangers,\" was co-written by Hal David, who co-wrote Warwick's '60s and early-'70s hit classics with Burt Bacharach. “Early Morning Strangers” had music by Barry Manilow who would produce her first Arista album in 1979.\nThe album failed to chart and was Warwick's last album with Warner Bros. The next album would be released on Arista Records.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2score =\n|rev3 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n|rev3score =\n}}\nThe Globe and Mail wrote that Warwick \"is floundering right now, wasting her talents on humdrum material, still looking for the challenge Bacharach offered with his slinky, tricky melodies.\"\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 3:20\n| title2          = Love in the Afternoon\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 3:12\n| title3          = A Long Way to Go\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 3:25\n| title4          = Do I Have to Cry\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 3:01\n| title5          = Don't Ever Take Your Love Away\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 5:40\n}}\n| length1         = 3:25\n| title2          = Early Morning Strangers\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 3:48\n| title3          = Livin' It Up Is Starting to Get Me Down\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 3:40\n| title4          = Since You Stayed Here\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 2:41\n| title5          = Do You Believe in Love at First Sight\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 3:06\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
