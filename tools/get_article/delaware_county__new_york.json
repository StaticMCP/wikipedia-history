As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 44,308.  The county seat is Delhi. The county is named after the Delaware River, which was named in honor of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, appointed governor of Virginia in 1609. The county is part of the Southern Tier region of the state.\nHistory\nWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present area of Delaware County was divided between Albany and Ulster Counties.\nAlbany County was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, British colonial governor of New York.\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of Tryon.\nDuring the late 1780s, New York State governor De Witt Clinton issued land grants to military officers, doctors and other veterans of the American Revolutionary War, which brought many patriot veterans to settle in the area.\nIn 1789, Montgomery County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.\nIn 1791, Otsego was one of three counties that were split off from Montgomery (the other two being Herkimer and Tioga Counties).\nUlster County was an original county of New York State, considerably larger than the present Ulster County, and at the time that Delaware County was created it still contained most of its original area.\nDelaware County was formed in 1797 by combining portions of Otsego and Ulster counties.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.7%) is water. It is the fifth-largest county in New York by land area.\nDelaware County is located in the southern part of the state, separated from the state of Pennsylvania by the Delaware River. It is east of Binghamton and southwest of Albany. The county contains part of the Catskill Mountains. The county is within a region called the Southern Tier of New York State.\nThe highest point is an approximately  summit of Bearpen Mountain along the Greene County line. The lowest point is along the Delaware River. The county is drained by the headwaters of the Delaware. It has a hilly surface, and the soil in the valleys is exceedingly fertile. The Delaware and Susquehanna rivers are here navigable by boats.\nAdjacent counties\n* Otsego County – north\n* Schoharie County – northeast\n* Greene County – east\n* Ulster County – southeast\n* Sullivan County – south\n* Wayne County, Pennsylvania – southwest\n* Broome County – west\n* Chenango County – northwest\nNational protected area\n* Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River, (part)\nDemographics\n1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010–2020\n|2020=44308}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Delaware County, New York – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 1980\n!Pop 1990\n!Pop 2000\n!Pop 2010\n!style=\"background-color: #ffffb3;\" | Pop 2020\n!% 1980\n!% 1990\n!% 2000\n!% 2010\n!style=\"background-color: #ffffb3;\" |% 2020\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|45,975\n|45,930\n|45,693\n|44,706\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |38,821\n|98.19%\n|97.26%\n|95.08%\n|93.18%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |87.62%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|279\n|447\n|529\n|691\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1,003\n|0.60%\n|0.95%\n|1.10%\n|1.44%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |2.26%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|88\n|111\n|134\n|102\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |93\n|0.19%\n|0.24%\n|0.28%\n|0.21%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.21%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|124\n|183\n|253\n|363\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |480\n|0.26%\n|0.39%\n|0.53%\n|0.76%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1.08%\n|-\n|Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|x\n|x\n|6\n|6\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |7\n|x\n|x\n|0.01%\n|0.01%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.02%\n|-\n|Other race alone (NH)\n|65\n|18\n|42\n|31\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |154\n|0.14%\n|0.04%\n|0.09%\n|0.06%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.35%\n|-\n|Mixed race or Multiracial (NH)\n|x\n|x\n|415\n|521\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1,765\n|x\n|x\n|0.86%\n|1.09%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.98%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|293\n|536\n|983\n|1,560\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1,985\n|0.63%\n|1.13%\n|2.05%\n|3.25%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |4.48%\n|-\n|Total\n|46,824\n|47,225\n|48,055\n|47,980\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |44,308\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |100.00%\n|}\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 48,055 people, 19,270 households, and 12,737 families residing in the county.
