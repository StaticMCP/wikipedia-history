The ceremony, attended by 1,200 people, was hosted by broadcaster Fred Davis.\nAs a result of 1968's selection process controversy, the judging process was revamped again. The pre-selection committees were dropped and one jury composed of an appointed member from each participating industry organization selected three nominees in each category, with the exception of Feature Films and Feature Crafts, which were chosen by an international jury.\nThe most unusual characteristic of this year's competition was that no theatrical feature film was awarded. Several films whose directors had intended to submit them were not completed by the submission deadline, the few features which were submitted were deemed not of award-worthy quality. There were many other Canadian features which could have been eligible but, due to cynicism, apathy and politics, they were not entered.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar - National Film Board of Canada, John Kemeny and Barrie Howells producers, Peter Pearson director\n*Feature Film: Not awarded\n*Film Under 30 Minutes: At Home - Allan King Associates, Martin Lavut director\n*Film Over 30 Minutes: Vertige - National Film Board of Canada, Gilles Boivin and Clément Perron producers, Jean Beaudin director\n*Documentary Under 30 Minutes: Juggernaut - National Film Board of Canada, Walford Hewitson producer, Eugene Boyko director\n*Documentary Over 30 Minutes: Good Times Bad Times - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Donald Shebib producer and director\n*Animated: Walking - National Film Board of Canada, Ryan Larkin producer and director\n*TV Drama: The Best Damn Fiddler from Calabogie to Kaladar - National Film Board of Canada, John Kemeny and Barrie Howells producers, Peter Pearson director\n*TV Information: The Style Is The Man Himself - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Cameron Graham producer\n*Sports and Recreation: Les canots de glace (Ice Rally in Quebec) - Office du Film du Québec, Jean-Claude Labrecque producer\n*Public Relations: Rye on the Rocks - Westminster Films, Don Haldane producer\n*Sales Promotion: More Logs Follow the Leader - Peterson Productions, S.
