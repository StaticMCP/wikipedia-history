All F-series trucks are cab over designs and the cabin comes fully built from the factory. Most models come with a diesel engine; but, some markets get CNG derivatives as well. The F-series is available a variety of cab styles, engines, 4WD or 2WD depending on the market it is sold. While Isuzu's main plant is in Japan, these trucks are locally assembled from CKD kits in numerous countries.\nMost mid-size and big-size models of the truck are distinguishable by a front 'Forward' badge; but the common Isuzu badge is usually used on the rear. Confusingly, the smaller Isuzu Elf (N-Series) has been sold as the \"GMC Forward\" in the United States and other markets.\nThe Isuzu Forward is among the commercial grade trucks used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force for rear line duties.\nIsuzu TY (predecessor)\nIsuzu released the  TY-series in May 1966. This semi-cabover design was Isuzu's first medium-duty truck. The original engine fitted was the D370, a  inline-six diesel engine with . The types were TY20, TY30, and TY40 depending on the length of the chassis. That engine was later replaced by the  D400 engine with , accompanied by a change in model codes to TY21/31/41. In August 1967 two  models, TY31(S) and TY41(S), were added. There was also an extra long wheelbase model (available with an extended cab) called the TY51. The TY range received a light facelift in March 1968, including a redesigned grille.\nFirst generation (1970)\nThe first generation Forward (TR) was launched in April 1970, replacing the original TY-series. All of the original models came equipped with Isuzu's D500 diesel engine, a  inline-six with . In July 1971 this engine was upgraded to produce . In September 1972 the Forward received a facelift and a new model code (SBR). The D500 engine was largely replaced with the new  6BB1 direct injection inline-six producing . Only certain lighter duty versions, such as the fire truck, retained the smaller D500 engine. The glowplug equipped 6BB1 had the smallest displacement per cylinder of any direct injection diesel engine in the world at the time and went on to power a large number of the Forward, the Elf, and many other Isuzu vehicles for the coming decades.\nA variety of weight ranges, bodies, and types were on offer, including a tractor unit and dumpers, on wheelbases ranging from . While most of the first generation Forward range was replaced in August 1975, the lighter short cab versions continued in production as the \"Forward S\" until replaced by Forward Juston in 1986.\nSecond generation (SBR/JBR/FBR) (1975)\nThe Second Generation Forward (SBR-series) was released in August 1975. The original range could carry between  and was powered by the same Isuzu 6BB1 diesel engine that had been used in most of the first-generation Forwards, a  diesel inline-six with . The SBR was later complemented with new heavier-duty versions (J- and F-series) equipped with the larger 6BD1, 6BD1T, and 6BF1 engines.\n* JBR/JCR/JDR (6-7t)\n* FTM (10t)\nSemi-tractor\n* VDR (4.5t, 5t)\n4WD\n* SCS (4t)\nThird generation (JCR/FTR/FVR/FSR/FRR/FVZ) (1985)\nThe third generation Forward was launched in June 1985, with a cab design based on that of the 810. It was the first truck to win the Good Design Award.\nThe FTR, FVR, FSR and FRR are all equipped with naturally aspirated and turbocharged Isuzu 6BG1 and 6HE1 engines mated to the six-speed manual or NAVi6 six-speed automatic gearbox with an optional ABS. A 1992–1994 Isuzu Forward truck appears in a scene of Studio Ghibli's 1994 animated movie Pom Poko.\nFourth generation (1994)\nThe fourth generation Forward was released in February 1994 with all SOHC engines starting with the naturally aspirated or turbocharged 6HE1 until 1999 and replaced with the new 8.2 litre 6HH1 and 7.8 litre 6HK1-TC (also shared with the American-developed Isuzu H-series) engines mated to the six-speed manual or Isuzu's 'Smoother F' automatic gearbox, with Power Shift and HSA are standard equipment, only the ABS/ASR are optional.\nFor the Chilean and Peruvian markets, the trucks were shipped from Japan as CKD kits to Huechuraba, Chile, where up to two a day could be assembled by a team of 13 workers.\nBeginning in 1998, this generation of the Forward was sold in the United States and Canada with Chevrolet and GMC badging. They were called the T-series, followed by a four-digit number indicating the weight rating. Models included the T6500, T7500, and the T8500. The range received an updated 6H engine in 2008 but sales of this model ended in 2009.\nModels\n*FTR (8 t)\n*FRR (4 t)\n*FSR (5 t, 6.5 t, 7 t)\n*FVR (9 t)\n*FVZ (10 t)\n*FRD (4 t)\n*FSD (5 t, 7 t)\nFifth generation (2007)\nThe fifth generation Forward was launched in May 2007; all models are equipped with Isuzu 4H/6H engines. A new 6x6 variant was exhibited at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show in 2013.\nIn North America, it was introduced in 2017 for the 2018 model year.\nIn Thailand, the 2022 model year saw the LED projector headlight and interior updates for some models, and they also introduced the FRR 210 Max Torque as well.\nSixth generation (2023)\nThe sixth generation Forward was launched in March 2023 and went sale in August 2023. The 6th generation Forward also has powertrain updates to meet the upcoming fuel efficiency regulations.\nIt shares the same cab as the Elf but it has a different side fenders. It adopted the company's first common architecture strategy called I-MACS or Isuzu Modular Architecture and Component Standard that standardizes the key modules such as the engine, transmission, fuel tank, axles and safety features to allow flexibility and diverse needs worldwide.\nInterior\nThe new Forward features new 7 inch display similar to the Elf, a smaller steering wheel and upgraded seats with full recline.\nSafety\nSafety features were enhanced across four main packages:\nBASIC: mandatory safety equipment (standard on smaller models)\nSTANDARD: adds adaptive headlights, speed sign recognition, and driver monitoring\nADVANCE: adds adaptive cruise control, emergency stop system (EDSS), and electronic parking brake\nPREMIUM: offers lane-keep assist, enhanced EDSS, and blind spot monitoring\nEngine\nEngine options are the 4HK1 engine now uses DPD with Urea SCR emission treatment, the inline six options for the heavier version are the all new Cummins co-developed D6BA-TCN and D6BA-TCC producing 260 and 300 PS respectively, mated to either a 9 speed manual or isuzu's Smoother-Fx Automated manual transmission.\nForward Juston\nThe lighter duty version of the Forward was offered in 1986 as the replacement for the Forward S. It uses the cab from the Isuzu Elf and it has shorter length with less than 8 tons of GVW.\nCurrent lineup\nJapan/Worldwide\n*FRR\n*FSR\n*FSA\n*FTR\n*FVR\n*FVM\n*FVZ\n*FSS\n*FTS\n*GSR\n*GVR\nAustralia\nIsuzu is the market leader in Australia and makes models unique to that market.

Wheelbases range from 152 to 248 inches accommodating truck body lengths from 14 to 30. A Chevrolet-badged variant was launched as the LCF 6500 XD.\nIn 2022 the class-7 FVR was launched in addition to the FTR. Both the FTR and FVR now use the Cummins B6.7 engine featuring 260hp and 660 lb-ft of torque.
