Kasi. The soundtrack album was released by Satyam Audios on 3 January 2018. Dijo Jose Antony and Arun Nandakumar choreographed the songs \"Saare Njangal\" and \"Podi Parane\" respectively.\nRelease\nThe film was released on 12 January 2018 across 84 theaters in Kerala.\nReception\nCritical response\nArjun R Krishnan from Malayala Manorama has written that 'Queen', the debut work by director Dijo Jose Antony, presents quite a few contemporary issues in a titillating cinematic wrap and rated the movie 3.5 out of 5.\nThe film, however, was not received well by some critics. Anna MM Vetticad of Firstpost refused to rate the film, calling it a 'non-film', and was outraged by the fact that this 'nondescript' film managed to get released not only in Kerala, but outside it as well, when far superior films were struggling to find theaters. Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute wrote that the film does a disservice to rape survivors by suggesting that the rape and murder of the female protagonist in the film is tragic only because she was an orphan, a cancer patient, and blameless in all respects. She also criticized the film's concluding message that men should see women as their responsibility and assume the role of their protectors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
