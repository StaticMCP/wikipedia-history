The conflict took place in southern Lebanon, near the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh, and pitted Palestinian militias led by Fatah against the Shiite Amal Movement. The battle was one of several clashes in the broader Lebanese Civil War and reflected growing tensions between various Lebanese and Palestinian factions.\nBackground\nBy late 1986, tensions between the Amal Movement and Palestinian factions, especially Fatah, had escalated significantly. The War of the Camps, which began in 1985, had already led to widespread violence and displacement. Amal, with support from the Syrian government, sought to curtail the armed Palestinian presence in Lebanon, particularly in the south, while Palestinian factions resisted attempts to limit their autonomy.\nEast Saida and the nearby town of Maghdousheh became strategic targets due to their proximity to the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp, a stronghold of Palestinian fighters.\nEvents\nFighting began in November 1986, when Fatah and its allies launched coordinated attacks on Amal positions in East Saida and Maghdousheh. Heavy clashes ensued, involving small arms, artillery, and sporadic tank fire. Reports indicated intense urban combat as both sides vied for control of key positions.\nAmal initially held ground but faced stiff resistance and eventual counterattacks from better-organized Palestinian units. Over the course of several weeks, Fatah forces made strategic gains, capturing most of East Saida and encroaching on Maghdousheh. Civilian populations in both areas suffered due to shelling and the destruction of infrastructure.\nAftermath\nThe battle concluded in December 1986 with a nominal Palestinian victory. While Fatah secured significant territorial gains, the conflict led to widespread destruction and further inflamed sectarian and political tensions in southern Lebanon. The clash weakened Amal's influence in the region temporarily, though the broader conflict continued into 1987.\nThis battle underscored the fragmentation of authority in Lebanon during the civil war and highlighted the intense rivalry between Palestinian groups and Shiite militias. It also demonstrated the limitations of Syrian influence, as Damascus was unable to fully control its allied militias.\nSee also\n* War of the Camps\n* Lebanese Civil War\n* Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp\n* Amal Movement\n* Fatah\nReferences\nWorks\n* [https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/1201/imag.html \\\"Palestinians battle for a southern base.\\\" *The Christian Science Monitor*, Dec 1, 1986]\n* Middle East International, Issues No. 289 (Dec 5, 1986) and No. 290 (Dec 19, 1986)\n* [https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/255/oa_monograph/chapter/3295446 \\\"Beyond the Lines.\\\" Project MUSE]\n* [https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/404521 Reuters Archive footage, Nov 24, 1986]\n* [https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/375817 Reuters Archive footage, Dec 1, 1986]\n* [https://moulahazat.com/2015/04/11/the-war-files-part-xi-the-palestinian-muslim-clashes-of-1985-and-1986/ Moulahazat Blog, “The War Files Part XI”, April 2015]\n* Maghdouché – Wikipedia https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/12/23/palestinians-victories-in-lebanon-mark-arafats-resurging-influence/fd2130f5-7795-423a-8707-a2f28c19fada/'\n*\n*\nhttps://muse.jhu.edu/pub/255/oa_monograph/chapter/3295446"
