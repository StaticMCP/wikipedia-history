As with many neurodivergent people and conditions, the popular image of autistic people and autism itself is often based on inaccurate media representations. Additionally, media about autism may promote pseudoscience such as vaccine denial or facilitated communication.\nSince the 1970s, fictional portrayals of autistic people (and now-defunct autism subtypes, such as Asperger syndrome) have become more frequent. Public perception of autism is often based on these fictional portrayals in novels, biographies, movies, and television series. These depictions of autism in media today are often made in a way that brings pity to the public and their concern of the topic, because their viewpoint is never actually shown, leaving the public without knowledge of autism and its diagnosis. Portrayals in the media of characters with atypical abilities (for example, the ability to multiply large numbers without a calculator) may be misinterpreted by viewers as accurate portrayals of all autistic people and of autism itself. James McGrath writes that the stereotype of autistic individuals as successful in math and science, along with disliking fiction, is widely overrepresented in literature.\nFiction\nSince the 1960s, characters have appeared in film, television, and print that could be qualified as \"on the autism spectrum\". Characters have been described as openly autistic in canon or have been designed with autism in mind.\nNon-fiction\n* Children of the Stars (2007) is a documentary about autistic children in China. The film examines hardships experienced by parents of autistic children and the lack of international resources for these families.\n* Autism: The Musical (2007) is a documentary about the lives of autistic children and their families, while the children write and rehearse a stage production. The film won several awards, including two Emmy Awards.

Burry believes himself to have Asperger's syndrome. During the course of the film, this is never revealed but rather it is strongly implied. However, a scene was filmed that showed the diagnosis process of Burry and his young son, but the scene never made it in the final cut of movie. It is possible to see the deleted scene since it is published. Some promotional material of the movie also has shots from the deleted scene.\n* Chicos de otro planeta (2013) is a documentary about young adults with Aspergers in Chile.

This book challenges several myths about autism.\n* Free Solo (2018) The movie doesn't explicitly diagnose Alex Honnold with autism, but it raises the possibility due to his father's undiagnosed Asperger's and Alex's own traits of intense focus, emotional detachment and blunt communication.\n* Love on the Spectrum (2019–2021) an Australian reality television show that follows autistic people as they explore the dating world.\n* Journal of Best Practices (2012) is a memoir written by autistic engineer David Finch about his marriage to his neurotypical wife.\n* The Rehearsal (TV series) (2025) In Season 2, Episode 5 Nathan ingratiates himself with Doreen Granpeesheh of the Center for Autism and Related Disorders to position himself as a \"thought leader\" in the autism field, though he tries to deflect any implication that he himself may be autistic.\nAutism in popular culture from 2010\nThe 2010s and 2020s have seen numerous publications of popular books related to autism as well as autism-related TV-series and movies, contributing to increased awareness and understanding of autism in popular culture.

In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\"; the research was declared fraudulent in 2011 by The BMJ.\nA March 2007 article in BMC Public Health postulated that media reports on Wakefield's study had \"created the misleading impression that the evidence for the link with autism was as substantial as the evidence against\".  Earlier papers in Communication in Medicine and British Medical Journal concluded that media reports provided a misleading picture of the level of support for Wakefield's theory.\nPRWeek noted that after Wakefield was removed from the general medical register for misconduct in May 2010, 62% of respondents to a poll regarding the MMR controversy stated they did not feel that the media conducted responsible reporting on health issues.\nA New England Journal of Medicine article examining the history of antivaccinationists said that opposition to vaccines has existed since the 19th century, but \"now the antivaccinationists' media of choice are typically television and the Internet, including its social media outlets, which are used to sway public opinion and distract attention from scientific evidence\".\nThe role of the media in the sensationalization of the MMR vaccination issue was discussed by The BMJ:\nConcerns were also raised about the role of journalists reporting on scientific theories that they \"are hardly in a position to question and comprehend. Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for The Montreal Gazette labeled the controversy a \"failure of journalism\" that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that 1) The Lancet should not have published a study based on \"statistically meaningless results\" from only 12 cases; 2) the anti-vaccination crusade was continued by the satirical Private Eye magazine; and 3) a grapevine of worried parents and \"nincompoop\" celebrities fueled the widespread fears. The Gazette also reported that:\nFacilitated communication and rapid prompting\nA number of books and films exist that promote the scientifically discredited techniques of facilitated communication and rapid prompting as legitimate, such as:\nFilms\n* ''Annie's Coming Out\n* Autism Is a World\n* Deej\n* Wretches & Jabberers\nBooks\n* The Reason I Jump\n* Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8''\nNotable individuals\nSome notable figures such as American animal handling systems designer and author Temple Grandin, American Pulitzer Prize-winning music critic and author Tim Page, and Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg are autistic. Thunberg, who in August 2018 started the \"School strike for climate\" movement, has explained how the \"gift\" of living with Asperger syndrome helps her \"see things from outside the box\" when it comes to climate change. In an interview with presenter Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4's Today, the then-16-year-old activist said that autism helps her see things in \"black and white\". She went on to say:\nBillionaire Elon Musk announced on Saturday Night Live in May 2021 that he has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, although it was later revealed that he has never been medically diagnosed. This announcement drew criticism from the autistic community. Other websites (for example) have lists of famous persons identified as autistic, though not all have been formally diagnosed. Additionally, media speculation of contemporary figures as being on the autism spectrum has become popular in recent times. New York magazine reported some examples, which included that Time magazine suggested that Bill Gates is autistic, and that a biographer of Warren Buffett wrote that his prodigious memory and \"fascination with numbers\" give him \"a vaguely autistic aura\". The magazine also reported that on Celebrity Rehab, Dr. Drew Pinsky deemed basketball player Dennis Rodman a candidate for an Asperger's diagnosis, and the UCLA specialist consulted \"seemed to concur\". Nora Ephron criticized these conclusions, writing that popular speculative diagnoses suggest autism is \"an epidemic, or else a wildly over-diagnosed thing that there used to be other words for\". Thomas Sowell has criticized Time diagnosis of Gates, saying that the people diagnosing him have not seen him personally.\nSee also\n* Societal and cultural aspects of autism\n* History of autism\nReferences\nExternal links"
