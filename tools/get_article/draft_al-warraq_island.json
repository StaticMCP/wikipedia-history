The island is primarily agricultural and has become the focus of national attention due to disputes over land ownership and urban redevelopment projects.\nGeography\nWarraq Island lies in the Nile within the Al-Warraq district of the Giza Governorate. It covers an area of approximately 4.2 km² (420 hectares) and sits at about 17 metres above sea level.\nThe island’s land use is dominated by small-scale agriculture, producing bananas, maize, potatoes, alfalfa, and other crops. Livestock rearing—including cows, buffalo, and dromedaries—is also common.\nPopulation\nAccording to various estimates, the island’s population ranges from 90,000 to 120,000 inhabitants.\nThe majority of residents are long-term inhabitants whose families have lived on the island for generations. Housing is mostly informal, and infrastructure—such as sewage, health services, and road connections—has historically been underdeveloped.\nHistory and development\nLand classification and disputes\nIn the late 1990s, Egyptian authorities sought to reclassify several Nile islands, including Warraq, as public property or nature reserves. Presidential decrees in 1998 and 2001 triggered resistance from islanders who considered the land privately owned and legally registered.\nIn 2017, the government launched a campaign to reclaim land it described as illegally occupied, leading to confrontations with residents. Security forces entered the island to remove allegedly unauthorized buildings, and clashes resulted in casualties and arrests.\nRedevelopment projects\nSince 2017, the government has promoted a plan to transform Warraq Island into a modern residential and commercial zone as part of broader urban renewal projects around Cairo.\nOfficial statements describe the project as a “new urban community” intended to improve infrastructure and attract investment. However, critics—including civil society organizations and residents—view it as a form of forced displacement that benefits real-estate interests.\nAs of 2024, government sources claim to have acquired most of the island’s 4.2 km² and compensated residents through housing or cash settlements. Independent observers report that many families continue to resist relocation and contest compensation terms.\nCivic mobilization\nResidents have organized numerous protests and legal challenges against eviction. In 2019, groups blocked construction materials and filed court appeals opposing redevelopment.\nThese mobilizations have attracted support from rights groups arguing that Warraq symbolizes broader struggles over land, housing, and urban equity in Egypt.\nAdministration\nAdministratively, Warraq Island belongs to the Al-Warraq district of Giza, which includes both mainland neighborhoods and the island itself. The district is bounded by the Nile to the north, the Ring Road and Warraq Bridge to the west, and Imbaba district to the south.\nIssues and challenges\n* Land rights and displacement: Thousands of residents face eviction amid redevelopment plans.\n* Infrastructure: The island has long suffered from limited public services.\n* Environmental pressure: Construction threatens agricultural land and local ecosystems along the Nile.\n* Urbanization: Warraq’s proximity to central Cairo makes it a target for investment and high-value housing projects.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Ele_d%27Al-Warraq Île d’Al-Warraq (French Wikipedia)]\n* El Warraq (district)\n:Category:Islands of Egypt\n:Category:Giza Governorate\n:Category:Populated places on the Nile\n:Category:Urban planning in Egypt\nReferences"
