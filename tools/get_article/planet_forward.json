The most inventive and creative ideas are featured online.\nBackground\nAbout\nPlanet Forward is inspired by the combined power of user-generated media and the tools of journalism to discover innovations that can change the world. This initiative challenges the conventional top-down format of traditional media and rewards contributors who are working to solve these problems by exposing them to the public to ignite a competition to find the best ideas to move the planet forward.\nPlanet Forward has created a dynamic public square, curating the best ideas and innovations from scientists, business leaders, advocates, students and government leaders. Planet Forward engages with students and faculty from the university as well as others across the country and the world. Planet Forward collaborates with a diverse group of organizations in order to find the best ideas and bring them to the world.\nOperation\nOn the Planet Forward website, members can submit videos or written descriptions of their innovative solutions tackling today's toughest energy challenges , former governor of Michigan, and Andrew Revkin.]]Members can comment, discuss and share the best ideas with other Planet Forward members as well as \"like\" (i.e. vote for) their favorite innovations. Experts in clean energy and climate then look at the ideas and evaluate them on terms of viability, impact and technical merit.\nHistory\nCreated and hosted by Frank Sesno, Planet Forward launched its website in March 2009 and appeared on PBS on April 15, 2009.\nIn December 2009, Planet Forward began producing weekly, online webisodes showcasing some of the best innovative solutions from Planet Forward members across the country. Each webisode was centered around a specific energy or environment-related topic, ranging from hybrid vehicles to smart grids.\nIn October 2010, Planet Forward began producing monthly segments for PBS's Nightly Business Report. Like the webisodes, the Nightly Business Report segments focused on a particular green topic and featured ideas submitted by Planet Forward site members. Planet Forward aired its second PBS special, The Energy of Innovation, on April 8, 2011.\n2011 marked Planet Forward's continued breakout into the public sphere. Teaming up with universities and big-name environmental contributors like the United States Department of Agriculture and National Geographic, the project generated a strong following—online and in the environmental community.\nOn April 17, 2012, Planet Forward and The George Washington University's Office of Sustainably hosted a \"Turning Innovation into Action\" symposium. Thought-leaders from government, industry and academics joined to highlight solutions to the challenges of a changing planet. The half-day conference highlighted \"Innovation Challenges\" offered by participants to demonstrate their commitment to moving the planet forward. Panelists included Former Chief Technology Officer of the United States, Aneesh Chopra, then-Mayor of the District of Columbia, Vincent C. Gray and Vice President of GE Ecomagination, Mark Vachon.\nIn 2013, Planet Forward narrowed their focus toward food, more specifically, toward the effort to feed a growing world population. The initiative set out to identify, celebrate and connect innovators within the sustainable food production community. It kicked off with the project's inaugural Feeding the Planet summit where CEOs, farmers, college students and policy makers met to discuss challenges and opportunities in the sustainable food sector. The event engaged over 400 attendees, over 1,000 online participants and several students from over ten colleges and universities. It also generated 24 million Twitter impressions and over 3,000 tweets by using #FoodFWD. Throughout the year, Planet Forward hosted salons and webinars, placing themselves firmly within the sustainability world.\nAside from 2014, Planet Forward has hosted a summit each year since the inaugural year. Students, sustainability professionals, and leaders come to the summit to discuss sustainability, storytelling, and solutions over the two-day summit hosted at George Washington University.\nPlanet Forward founder Frank Sesno and director Dan Reed teach an undergraduate sustainability reporting class at GW University's School of Media and Public Affairs to help student reporters build environmental journalism knowledge and skills.\nIn July 2013, Planet Forward implemented the \"Planet Forward Explorers\" program. Explorers traveled with professor Imani Cheers to Kenya and Tanzania in order to study agricultural technology. Four of their videos were featured in the project's weekly segment on Bloomberg Television's, Bloomberg West, a program in which Planet Forward founder Frank Sesno presented ideas about moving toward a more sustainable planet. In the spring of 2014, students traveled to Guatemala in order to research child nutrition. The team presented their work during the Latin American & Hemispheric Studies Capstone Symposium at the George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. All of the Explorers created videos on their findings which were featured on Planet Forward's website as well as the second Feeding the Planet Summit in 2015.\nIn the spring of 2014, the project launched the Planet Forward University Consortium, a program that allowed other universities from across the country to join the conversation to help address sustainability challenges through storytelling. Middlebury College, Roger Williams University, the University of Arizona and the University of California, Berkeley are some of the current participants.\nPlanet Forward carried their keystone initiative, Feeding the Planet, through the next two years, hosting another summit in the spring of 2015 called \"Feeding the Planet Summit: The Story of Food in the Age of Climate Change.\"\nBeginning in 2015, Planet Forward began holding an annual contest called Storyfest. Students can submit up to three stories (videos, photograph projects, written stories, audio projects, etc.) for consideration. The grand prize is a sustainability reporting trip to a destination like the Amazon (2017), Alaska (2018), the Galapagos Islands (2019), and Iceland (2020). Planet Forward also takes several students on a trip to Rome each October to attend the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Committee on World Food Security.\nSocial media\nPlanet Forward has a well-founded social media campaign, with active Twitter and [https://www.facebook.com/planetforward.org Facebook] accounts which are updated daily. As of June 2015, Planet Forward had over 13,900 Twitter followers and 6,620 Facebook fans.\nSeasons\nSeason 1: Energy Future\nHosted by creator Frank Sesno, the original pilot television special featured a panel style discussion that addressed the question: can we move rapidly away from fossil fuels in the near future?. The panelists for the pilot were James L. Connaughton, Hunter Lovins, and Shai Agassi. Viewers were encouraged to visit the website to submit their ideas about fossil fuels to the panel of experts. Those who submitted the most engaging and thought provoking ideas were selected to appear before Carol Browner, the senior advisory to President Barack Obama on Energy and Climate Change.\nSeason 2: Carbon Footprint\nSince the pilot phase of the project, Planet Forward relaunched its website, began producing a series of weekly webisodes and began producing [https://web.archive.org/web/20101023225652/http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/features/special/environment_planet_forward/ monthly special segments] for the PBS business series Nightly Business Report.
