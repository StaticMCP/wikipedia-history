It will also grant Australia expanded access to a number of Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) bases such as Lombrum Naval Base and Port Moresby International Airport. In addition, it will set a mutual-defence framework, requiring consultation from either partner if the other experiences an armed attack.\nNotes"
