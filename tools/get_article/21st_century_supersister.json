It was subsequently re-worked with new lyrics and featured in the 2011 film The Power of Three, in which Willcox starred. The original version was included as the B-side of the digital single and was added to the album for its 2013 reissue.\n\"21st Century Supersister\" and its parent album In the Court of the Crimson Queen are both references to King Crimson, the band formed by Willcox's husband Robert Fripp. King Crimson's most well-known track \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" appeared on the band's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King.\nTrack listing\n* Digital single\n# \"21st Century Supersister\" – 3:40\n# \"21st Century Supersister\" (Original Demo) – 3:36\nPersonnel\n* Toyah Willcox – vocals\n* Simon Darlow – all instruments, backing vocals, producing, mixing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd9bMbi13L8&list=OLAK5uy_k2ZD-QUpBvTpXu1k16J6Cevs3yHSKX86M&index=9 Official audio stream] at YouTube\n* [https://toyahwillcox.com/ The official Toyah website]"
