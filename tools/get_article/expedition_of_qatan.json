They were a powerful tribe connected with the Quraysh. They resided near the hill of Qatan in Nejd, the site of one of the many of Muhammad's ghazwa in order to spread Islam. So he dispatched a force of 150 men under the leadership of Abu Salama `Abd Allah ibn `Abd al-Asad to make a sudden attack on this tribe on the first day of Muharram.\nRaid\nWhen the Muslims arrived at the site, the tribe members fled and the Muslims found three herdsmen with a large herd of camels and goats. Then the booty, along with the three captives, was brought to Medina.\nOn the rule on Ghanimah (plunder), the Dictionary of Islam writes, \"If the Imam, or the leader of the Muslim army, conquers a country by force of arms, he is at liberty to leave the land in possession of the original proprietors, provided they pay tribute, or he may divide it amongst the Muslims; but with regard to movable property, it is unlawful for him to leave it in possession of the infidels, but he must bring it away with the army and divide it amongst the soldiers\". Being movable objects, the goats were therefore taken back to Medina.\nAbu Salamah had an inflammation from a previous wound, and he died.\nThe 2nd raid of the Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah tribe took place almost 3 years later.\nIslamic sources\nBiographical literature\nThis event is mentioned in Ibn Sa’d's biography of Muhammad. The Muslim jurist Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya also mentions the event in his biography of Muhammad, Zad al-Ma'ad. Modern secondary sources which mention this, include the award-winning book, Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum (The Sealed Nectar)\nHadith literature\n, ,  and  all mention that Muhammad sent some Muslims on a Military expedition to Nejd. This is where the raid took place.\nstates:\n}}\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\n*Muslim–Quraysh War\nReferences\nNotes\n*"
