Together with the adjacent hamlets of Horsleys Green, Beacon's Bottom and Studley Green, it is in an area known collectively as 'Studley Green'. It is within the Chiltern Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nIt featured in a 1987 episode of the BBC motoring magazine show Top Gear, which looked at safety on rural roads. Waterend was chosen for the abnormally high accident rate in both the hamlet itself and the surrounding roads."
