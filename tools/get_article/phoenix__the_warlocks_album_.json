It was released in 2002 by record label Birdman, the band having been signed to this label following the success of their previous album, Rise and Fall.\nThe UK version was released by Mute in 2003, and featured a slightly different track listing and ordering, as well as an alternative cover. This version was accompanied by the release of \"Shake the Dope Out\" and \"Baby Blue\" as singles.\nReception\n|rev1 = AllMusic\n|rev1score =\n|rev2 = Drowned in Sound\n|rev2score = 9/10\n|rev3 = The Guardian\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = Pitchfork\n|rev4score = 2.0/10\n|rev5 = Rolling Stone\n|rev5Score =\n|rev6 = Spin\n|rev6Score = 8/10\n|rev7 = Uncut\n|rev7Score = 4/5\n}}\nThe album received a largely positive critical response, being much compared to bands of the 1960s, such as the Velvet Underground.
