      "text": "# 2005 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2005 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 45th in the National Football League (NFL), and Mike Tice's fourth and final season as head coach. The Vikings finished the season with a 9–7 record and missed the playoffs despite going 8–3 over the final 11 weeks. Quarterback Daunte Culpepper was injured after seven games, resulting in Brad Johnson taking over as starter. The loss of Culpepper and the departure of Randy Moss to the Oakland Raiders resulted in the Vikings dropping from 2nd in passing offense in 2004 to 20th in 2005.\nDuring the team's bye week in week 5, a scandal arose surrounding an alleged sex party aboard a pair of boats on Lake Minnetonka.\nOffseason\nIn February 2005, Vikings owner Red McCombs agreed to sell the team to Arizona-based entrepreneur Reggie Fowler; however, Fowler was unable to prove his finances sound enough to complete the purchase and his application to buy the team was rejected by the league. He brought in various partners, including New York-based real estate developer Zygi Wilf, who took over as the lead owner, with Fowler as one of the minor partners. The deal to install Wilf as owner was concluded in May 2005.\nAcquisitions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Additions\n|-\n!Player!!Position!!Status (previous team)\n|-\n|Darren Sharper||S||Free agent (GB)\n|-\n|Pat Williams||DT||Free agent (BUF)\n|-\n|Fred Smoot||CB||Free agent (WAS)\n|-\n|Brad Johnson||QB||Free agent (TB)\n|-\n|Travis Taylor||WR||Free agent (BAL)\n|-\n|Koren Robinson||WR||Free agent (SEA)\n|}\nDepartures\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Additions\n|-\n!Player!!Position!!Status (new team)\n|-\n|Brian Russell||S||Free agent (CLE)\n|-\n|Chris Hovan||DT||Free agent (TB)\n|}\nTrades\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Vikings started positively, forcing a fumble from the Saints' return man Aaron Stecker on the opening kickoff. On the first play from scrimmage, Daunte Culpepper found Travis Taylor for a 24-yard touchdown, and the Vikings did not look back. Culpepper threw two more first-half touchdown passes, and stayed mistake free. The Vikings also found a running game, going for 146 yards, led by Mewelde Moore's 101 yards. Defensively, the Vikings held Aaron Brooks to just 12 completions on 32 pass attempts, intercepting him twice (Antoine Winfield and Keith Newman).

The Vikings marched down the field on their opening drive, only to botch a fake field goal attempt from the 18-yard line. After trading several punts, the Vikings put together a 13-play drive that resulted in a 23-yard field goal by Paul Edinger, who was making his first return to Chicago, for whom he had played for the last five years. However, those were to be the Vikings' only points of the game as they failed to get any further than the Bears' 30-yard line, while Daunte Culpepper added another two interceptions to his total for the season. The Bears' offense was limited by rookie quarterback Kyle Orton, who threw for 117 yards, but did find Desmond Clark for two touchdowns. The Bears were also held to 95 yards, led by 89 yards by Thomas Jones, who did find the end zone twice in the fourth quarter to close out the game.\nWeek 7: vs. Green Bay Packers\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 7: Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 23\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT\n|Road=Packers\n|R1=0|R2=17|R3=0|R4=3\n|Home=Vikings\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=10|H4=13\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|stadium=Hubert H.

After a scoreless first quarter, Brett Favre started to find success against the Vikings defense, leading the Packers on two-second-quarter touchdown drives in a row, culminating in touchdown passes to Donald Driver and Antonio Chatman. After the Chatman touchdown, Koren Robinson returned the ensuing kickoff 72 yards to the Packers' 30-yard line, only for Mewelde Moore to fumble on the Vikings' first play from scrimmage. Favre then led the Packers downfield, and set up a 53-yard Ryan Longwell field goal as time expired in the first half, giving the Packers a 17–0 lead. The Vikings mounted a comeback in the second half; starting with a field goal on their opening drive, the Vikings defense then forced a three-and-out, before Daunte Culpepper capped the next drive with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Robinson. After a missed field goal by Longwell, Paul Edinger made a field goal of his own before Culpepper again led the Vikings down the field, finding Mewelde Moore for a 14-yard touchdown to give the Vikings a 20–17 lead with three minutes left. Favre then led the Packers down the field, resulting in a 39-yard Ryan Longwell field goal, to tie the game with 28 seconds left. Daunte Culpepper then completed back-to-back passes to Mewelde Moore and Marcus Robinson to set up a game-winning 56-yard field goal by Edinger as time expired.\nWeek 8: at Carolina Panthers\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 8: Minnesota Vikings at Carolina Panthers&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 30\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EST/12:00&nbsp;p.m. CST\n|Road=Vikings\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=6\n|Home=Panthers\n|H1=7|H2=17|H3=7|H4=7\n|weather=Sunny,\n|stadium=Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, North Carolina\n|attendance=73,502\n|referee=Scott Green (19)\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-panthers-2005-reg-8 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/28627/CAR_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*CAR – Stephen Davis 7-yard run (John Kasay kick), 10:19.

On the final play of the first quarter, Daunte Culpepper tore his ACL, MCL and PCL in a low tackle by Panthers cornerback Chris Gamble following an 18-yard run. Brad Johnson replaced Culpepper at quarterback, but he was unable to prevent the Panthers from increasing their lead in the first half, going into the halftime interval with the score at 24–0. The Vikings did find the end zone twice in the second half, first with a Mewelde Moore touchdown to bring the score to 24–7, then a five-yard touchdown reception by Marcus Robinson with two minutes to go; however, the Panthers scored twice themselves to nullify the Vikings' attempted comeback.

Joey Harrington then fumbled on a Brian Williams sack, leading to a touchdown run by Ciatrick Fason. Harrington then compounded the Lions' problems, throwing an interception to Antoine Winfield three plays later, leading to a 15-yard touchdown pass from Johnson to Nate Burleson, giving the Vikings a 24–0 lead.

The Vikings were unable to capitalize on a fumble by Willie Ponder on the opening kickoff, as Paul Edinger missed a 40-yard field goal after the Vikings failed to earn a first down. After trading punts, Eli Manning was intercepted by Darren Sharper, only for Edinger to have a 32-yard field goal attempt blocked on the ensuing possession. After the scoreless first quarter, Sharper intercepted Manning a second time, this time returning it 92 yards for his second touchdown of the season. The Vikings offense was unable to add to the scoreboard in the first half, and a pair of field goals from Jay Feely meant the Vikings went into the halftime break with a 7–6 lead. To start the second half, Koren Robinson returned the opening kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown, giving the Vikings a 14–6 lead. The Giants responded immediately, with Manning finding Amani Toomer for a 23-yard touchdown pass to again reduce the Vikings' lead to a single point. The Vikings punted on their next possession, before forcing the Giants to do the same, with Mewelde Moore returning Jeff Feagles' kick 71 yards to give the Vikings a 21–13 lead; the score made the Vikings the first team in NFL history to return an interception, kickoff and punt for a touchdown in the same game. Manning was intercepted two more times, including a third for Sharper; however, a non-existent Vikings offense (including 12 yards rushing on 21 carries) meant the Giants still had a chance. Following the two-minute warning, Manning put together a drive in which he completed 5 out of 7 pass attempts, leading to a three-yard touchdown run by Tiki Barber; Barber then ran in the two-point conversion to tie the scores. With 1:21 left, Johnson was sacked by Osi Umenyiora on the first play of the ensuing drive.

The Ravens' defense forced two consecutive punts and a Brad Johnson fumble, which resulted in two field goals by Stover to give the Ravens a 30–20 lead with just over a minute to play. Edinger cut the Ravens' lead to 7 points with 15 seconds remaining, but the Ravens recovered the ensuing onside kick, giving the Ravens the win, and eliminating the Vikings from the playoffs.\nWeek 17: vs. Chicago Bears\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 17: Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=January 1\n|time=3:15&nbsp;p.m. CST\n|Road=Bears\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=0|R4=7\n|Home=Vikings\n|H1=0|H2=17|H3=7|H4=10\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|stadium=Hubert H.
