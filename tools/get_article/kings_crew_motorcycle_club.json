Where it would become one of the provinces most dominant clubs, participating in the Alberta Biker Conflict, until eventually joining the Hell's Angels in the late 1990s.\nAlberta Biker conflict\nAlong with the Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club, Warlords Motorcycle Club, and Rebels Motorcycle Club, the Kings Crew became one of the four dominant outlaw motorcycle clubs operating in Alberta prior to 1997. By the late 1990s, the Kings Crew became part of the Hells Angels in a patch-over ceremony held in Calgary, Alberta, Throughout the 1970s the Rebels had multiple violent exchanges with their main rivals in the province the Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club, most of the clashes occurred off of the authorities' radar and received little media attention The 1970s would prove to be an extremely dominant period for the Rebels, the club held an \"iron fisted territorial policy\" which saw them battle for dominance in the province against several other groups and since the clubs creation in 1968, it has either defeated or absorbed 13 separate clubs in Alberta. Their \"cuts\" were taken and displayed upside down on the walls of the Rebels Mother Chapter clubhouse\nIn 1975, the Rebels gained a certain level of notoriety (respect in some circles) due to their publicised conflicts with Francophone unit of Canadian Airborne Regiment known as \"One Commando\". In one of these infamous clashes, about 40 members of the Airborne showed up with nunchaku, steel bars, baseball bats, and blackjacks, and ambushed 23 Rebels at the club bar in Edmonton. After a skirmish, the bruised and battered paratroopers retreated and the Rebels went back to their business. This event came to be known as \"Battle of the Kingsway\" in Rebel Folklore.\nIn the early eighties, as the Reapers grew more powerful and the Rebels less so, the Rebels were warned by the Reapers not to fly the \"Alberta\" lower rocker on threat of club warfare, so members of the Rebel's Calgary chapter used \"Southern Alberta\" for the lower rocker and Edmonton members flew \"Northern Alberta\". King's Crew, meanwhile, were tolerated in their use of \"Calgary\" as the lower rocker, while the Saskatchewan Rebels, at that point being the dominant club in that province, flew \"Saskatchewan\" as their lower rocker.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s (the golden era in western Canada for independent one-percenter clubs), the Rebels were the dominant club in the Edmonton area, while the Reapers were the largest club in Red Deer and Calgary.\nIn 1977, the Kings Crew was established and quickly became a major player in Alberta, especially Calgary. During this time they would align themselves with the Rebels Motorcycle Club, who had also become an enemy of the Grim Reapers Motorcycle Club. In the 1980s they would become much more involved in the Alberta biker conflict.\nNote: see Criminal allegations and Incidents for Kings Crew involvement in conflict\nThe conflict would ultimately come to an end when all major parties patched over to the Hells Angels in the late 1990s.\nCriminal activities and incidents\nIn February, 1983.
