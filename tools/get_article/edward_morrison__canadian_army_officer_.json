In 1899 he volunteered for service with D' Battery, Royal Canadian Artillery', in South Africa during the Second Boer War, where he fought at Belfast and Leliefontein, receiving the Distinguished Service Order for bravery at the latter battle. He published a book With the Guns in South Africa'', a memoir of his service and the service of the Canadian Artillery during the Boer War.\nDuring the First World War, Morrison served with the Canadian Expeditionary Force, commanding the 1st Brigade, Canadian Field Artillery, from 1914 until 1916, including during the Second Battle of Ypres and the Battle of the Somme. In December 1916, he was appointed to command all the artillery of the Canadian Corps, and commanded all the artillery at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. He continued to command the artillery through the Hundred Days' Offensive and was promoted to major general in July 1918.\nAfter the war, he continued to serve with the Canadian Army until he retired in 1924.\nHe was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in January 1918 and a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1919.\nReferences\nSources\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/morrison_edward_whipple_bancroft_15E.html Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]\n*"
