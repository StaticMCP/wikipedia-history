Each version features different game mechanics and playable characters.\nThe Nintendo 64 version of the game, known as Transformers: Beast Wars Metals 64}} in Japan, was developed by Locomotive Corporation. It contains arcade mode endings for all characters and several mini-games. In North America, this version was a Blockbuster Video exclusive that was initially only available for rental.\nThe PlayStation version of the game, known as Transformers Beast Wars Metals: Gekitotsu! Gangan Battle}} in Japan, was developed by WAVEDGE. It features alternate story campaigns for the Maximal and Predacon factions.\nGameplay\nIn both games, players take control of one of the Maximals or Predacons in a 1-on-1 battle and attempt to deplete their opponent's life through the use of projectile and melee attacks. Each character can change between three different modes: a Beast Mode, a Vehicle Mode, and a Robot Mode. Players can battle against CPU opponents in each game's single player mode, or against a second player in versus mode.\nIn the Nintendo 64 version, gameplay takes place in a flat 3D arena. Each of the three character modes has different strengths and weaknesses: Robot Mode is the strongest, but usage depletes an \"energon resistance gauge\" that will prevent the character from attacking when fully depleted. Beast Mode recharges the gauge and has high defense, but its attacks are less effective. Vehicle Mode has higher mobility and does not charge or drain the gauge, but has low defense and uses projectile attacks that are easily avoided. The game features a single-player arcade mode, with unique text-based endings for each character. A versus mode, team battle mode and several mini-games are also available for play. The Japanese version is compatible with the Transfer Pak accessory; connecting different Game Boy games will positively or negatively affect the player character's maximum health and energon resistance gauge consumption rate.\nThe PlayStation version features a top-down viewpoint. Characters move around 3D battlefields, each of which features various interactable objects and environmental hazards that can deal additional damage to the combatants. Dealing and receiving damage will also build up each character's super meter, allowing them to use powerful super attacks. The game features a single player story mode, in which each faction attempts to move across a map to reach the opposing faction's base, participating in battles along the way. Story mode is split between Maximal and Predacon campaigns, and features FMV cutscenes. The game also includes versus, survival and training modes, while various images and videos can be unlocked in an in-game gallery.\nPlayable characters\nThe original Japanese releases each feature eight playable characters, including three characters exclusive to each version. This was expanded to 12 each for the North American releases through the addition of four secret characters, all of which are palette-swapped versions of existing characters given unique voice lines. The Nintendo 64 version features an original character, Megatron X, who appears as a secret boss in the arcade mode. In the Japanese release, Megatron X can be unlocked as a playable character by connecting to Kettō Transformers Beast Wars: Beast Senshi Saikyō Ketteisen via the Transfer Pak. In addition to the playable cast, the Maximal Rhinox appears as a non-player character in the PlayStation version's story mode.\n* Airazor\n* Blackarachnia\n* Cheetor\n*Megatron\n*Megatron X\n*Optimus Primal\n*Quickstrike\n*Rampage\n*Rattrap\n*Ravage\n*Silverbolt\n*Starscream\n*Tarantulas\n*Terrorsaur\n*Tigatron\n*Waspinator\n*Windrazor\nPlot\nTransformers: Beast Wars Transmetals is set in an alternate version of the second season of the animated series, following the introduction of the Transmetals and Fuzors. While being transported back to the planet Cybertron after his defeat, as depicted in the final episode of Beast Wars, Megatron sends a message through time to his past self, warning him of his own defeat. This action creates a divergent timeline in which several Maximals and Predacons gain new Transmetal forms and resume their battles on prehistoric Earth.\nThe Nintendo 64 version features unique story endings for each character, detailing their actions after defeating the opposing faction leader. The PlayStation version features two story campaigns: the Maximal campaign, in which Optimus Primal leads a team to infiltrate the Predacon ship and retrieve the stolen Golden Disk; and the Predacon campaign, in which Megatron and his henchmen lure the Maximals out of their ship in an attempt to finish them.\nReception\n| GameFan_N64 = 55%\n| IGN_N64 = 3/10\n| IGN_PS = 3/10\n| NP_N64 = 6.1/10\n| OPM_PS = 1/5\n| Fam_N64 = 23/40\n| Fam_PS = 23/40\n| Play_PS = 10%\n}}\nThe game was met with negative reception upon release, with the Nintendo 64 version receiving a score of 48.67% from review aggregator GameRankings.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals (PS) at TFWiki.net: The Transformers Wiki\n*Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals (N64) at TFWiki.net: The Transformers Wiki"
