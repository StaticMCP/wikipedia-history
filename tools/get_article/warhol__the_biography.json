The book traces Warhol's life from his childhood to his rise as a central figure in Pop Art, as well as the evolution of the Factory scene and the circumstances surrounding his 1987 death.\nThe original Frederick Muller Ltd edition was published in the UK, while the Bantam Books edition, published in the US under the title The Life and Death of Andy Warhol, was released in an abridged form. Later Penguin Books and Da Capo Press editions—often titled Warhol—restore the full manuscript and are regarded as the comprehensive version intended by the author.\nSynopsis\nWarhol traces Andy Warhol's trajectory from his upbringing in Depression-era Pittsburgh to his emergence as one of the most influential and enigmatic figures in 20th-century art. Drawing on interviews with friends, collaborators, and lovers, Bockris reconstructs Warhol's evolution from commercial illustrator to Pop Art pioneer, exploring how he transformed everyday consumer culture into high art and built a persona defined by detachment, curiosity, and relentless self-reinvention.\nThe book delves into the creation and chaos of the Factory—Warhol's New York studio—highlighting the artists, misfits, musicians, and superstars who orbited him, as well as the darker currents of drug use, exploitation, and fame that ran through the scene. Bockris gives particular attention to pivotal moments in Warhol's life, including the 1968 assassination attempt by Valerie Solanas, which left lasting physical and psychological scars and dramatically altered his work and public presence.\nAs Warhol reinvents himself in the 1970s and 1980s—moving from avant-garde provocateur to society portraitist and cultural celebrity—Bockris examines the tensions between art and commerce, vulnerability and performance, and the loneliness beneath Warhol's public façade. The biography concludes with an account of Warhol's unexpected 1987 death following routine gallbladder surgery, exploring the controversies surrounding his medical care and the legacy he left behind.\nBoth intimate and critical, Bockris' study presents Warhol as a complex, contradictory figure: visionary artist, shrewd businessman, voyeur, outsider, and ultimately a defining mirror of American culture.\nEditions\nWarhol: The Biography was first published in 1989 by Frederick Muller Ltd, an imprint of Century Hutchinson Ltd, in the United Kingdom. Later that year, The Life and Death of Andy Warhol was released by Bantam Books in the United States, but the publisher edited it down into a shorter version of Bockris' manuscript. A more complete edition was published by Penguin Books in the United Kingdom in 1990, and later reprints by Da Capo Press restore the material cut from the Bantam release. Later editions include expanded material, additional chapters, and a more detailed account of Warhol's life and work compared to the abridged Bantam texts.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nCritical reception\nPublishers Weekly praised Bockris' biography as \"detailed and absorbing,\" describing Warhol's life as a kind of \"sinister fairy tale.\"\nStephen Birmingham's Washington Post review calls The Life and Death of Andy Warhol a sharply critical but well-researched biography. Bockris depicts Warhol as emotionally detached and more a voyeur than a participant, someone who prompted others to perform while keeping his distance. Birmingham concedes that Warhol's art retains a haunting quality: \"there is something haunting … that suggests the terrible blankness … that this Peeping Tom apparently saw at the core of everything.\"\nReferences"
