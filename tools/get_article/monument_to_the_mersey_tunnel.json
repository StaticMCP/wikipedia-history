It consists of shaft with a light on the top, and originally had the dual purpose of being a monument and of illuminating the entrance to the tunnel.  It was designed by Herbert James Rowse, and was one of a pair, but the monument that was on the Liverpool side of the River Mersey no longer exists, however a modern replica is now being installed.  The monument is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade&nbsp;II listed building.\nHistory\nQueensway Tunnel, the first road tunnel under the River Mersey linking Liverpool with the Wirral, was built between 1925 and 1933.  Two identical structures were designed by Herbert James Rowse to be placed near the entrances to the tunnel, one on each side of the River Mersey.  They had two purposes, both to act as monuments, and to illuminate the area around the entrances to the tunnels.  Their design was approved in June 1933, and this was exhibited at the Royal Academy Exhibition in 1934.  The monuments were built by McAlpine and Sons, and the decorative metal work was carried out by H.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Lloyd of H. H. Martyn & Co.  The construction of the monuments was complete by the date of the official opening of the tunnel by King George V on 18&nbsp;July 1934.  The Birkenhead entrance to the tunnel was redesigned in the 1960s, and the monument was moved to its present position between carriageways.  The original monument on the Liverpool side no longer exists after it was placed into storage and subsequently lost or destroyed, however a replica has recently been created and erected on the Liverpool side\nDescription\nThe monument stands on a white ashlar base. It consists of a shaft about  high surmounted by a lighting bowl.  The core of the shaft is reinforced concrete, which is overlaid with fluted and polished black granite.  The lighting bowl is in gilded bronze and glass.  The shaft tapers, and is also slightly curved \"to correct the optical illusion of being less in diameter in the centre than at the top of the shaft\".  There are two bands around the shaft decorated with chevrons and acanthus.  At the top of the shaft is a fluted glass bowl.  Arising from this is a ribbed cap bearing a spherical-shaped lamp.  On the base of the shaft is an inscription reading as follows.\nAlso inscribed on the base of the shaft are names of members and officers of the Mersey Tunnel Joint Committee, and the engineers, contractors, architect, and valuer who were responsible for the tunnel.\nAppraisal\nThe monument was designated a Grade II listed building on 10 August 1992. Grade&nbsp;II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \"buildings of national importance and special interest\".  The National Recording Project comments that it now \"merely serves as a memorial\".\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Birkenhead\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*Hartwell, Clare; Hyde, Matthew; Hubbard, Edward; Pevsner, Nikolaus: The Buildings of England: Cheshire (1971: reprinted 2011) Yale University Press New Haven and London\n*Morris, Edward;  Roberts, Emma: Public Sculpture of Britain, vol.15: Public Sculpture of Cheshire and Merseyside (excluding Liverpool) (2012) Liverpool University Press, Liverpool\n*\n*Historic England [http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/ Listed Buildings] retrieved 3 April 2015\n*Mersey Tunnel Users Association [http://www.tunnelusers.org.uk/history.htm History]; retrieved 16 January 2014\n*National Recording Project [https://web.archive.org/web/20140117000330/http://www.pmsa.org.uk/pmsa-database/5037/ Column - Queensway Tunnel]; retrieved 16 January 2014"
