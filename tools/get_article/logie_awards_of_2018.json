Public voting for the Most Popular Award categories ran from 5 March to 1 April 2018, with the shortlist of nominees revealed on 27 May. Voting reopened for the Popular Award categories on 29 June and remained open until the start of the ceremony, with each person given one extra vote in each category.\nThe red carpet arrivals was hosted by Karl Stefanovic and Georgie Gardner.\nEach network is restricted in the number of personalities and programs they can submit for consideration in the publicly voted category, including up to 10 names in both the Most Popular Actor and Actress categories, 15 names for Most Popular Presenter and 5 programs for Most Popular Drama. These restrictions often lead to controversy over those who are not listed in the voting form, and as a result, they are not eligible to be nominated for an award.\nNominees\nNominees were announced on 27 May 2018.\nGold Logie\n{| class=wikitable width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\"| Most Popular Personality on Australian Television\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Grant Denyer in All Star Family Feud (Network Ten) and Family Feud (Network Ten)'\n**Amanda Keller in The Living Room (Network Ten)\n**Andrew Winter in Selling Houses Australia (Foxtel – Lifestyle) and Love It or List It Australia (Foxtel – Lifestyle)\n**Jessica Marais in Love Child (Nine Network) and The Wrong Girl (Network Ten)\n**Rodger Corser in Doctor Doctor (Nine Network)\n**Tracy Grimshaw in A Current Affair (Nine Network)\n|}\nActing/Presenting\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\"| Most Popular Actor\n! width=\"25%\"| Most Popular Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Ray Meagher in Home and Away (Seven Network)'\n**Aaron Jeffery in Underbelly Files: Chopper (Nine Network)\n**Erik Thomson in 800 Words (Seven Network)\n**Luke McGregor in Rosehaven (ABC)\n**Rodger Corser in Doctor Doctor (Nine Network)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Jessica Marais in Love Child (Nine Network) and The Wrong Girl (Network Ten)'\n**Asher Keddie in Offspring (Network Ten)\n**Celia Pacquola in Rosehaven (ABC) and Utopia (ABC)\n**Deborah Mailman in Cleverman (ABC)\n**Julia Morris in House Husbands (Nine Network)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Actor\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Hugo Weaving in Seven Types of Ambiguity (ABC)'\n**Damon Herriman in Riot (ABC)\n**Ewen Leslie in Safe Harbour (SBS)\n**Lachy Hulme in Romper Stomper (Stan)\n**Rodger Corser in Doctor Doctor (Nine Network)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Pamela Rabe in Wentworth (Foxtel – Showcase)'\n**Elisabeth Moss in Top of the Lake: China Girl (Foxtel – BBC First)\n**Kate Atkinson in Wentworth (Foxtel – Showcase)\n**Kate Box in Riot (ABC)\n**Leeanna Walsman in Safe Harbour (SBS)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Supporting Actor\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Supporting Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Hazem Shammas in Safe Harbour (SBS)'\n**Aaron Pedersen in A Place To Call Home (Foxtel – Showcase)\n**Alex Dimitriades in Wake in Fright (Network Ten)\n**Anthony Hayes in Seven Types of Ambiguity (ABC)\n**David Wenham in Romper Stomper (Stan)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Jacqueline McKenzie in Romper Stomper (Stan)'\n**Celia Ireland in Wenworth (Foxtel – Showcase)\n**Elsa Cocquerel in Wolf Creek (Stan)\n**Jenni Baird in A Place to Call Home (Foxtel – Showcase)\n**Nicole Chamoun in Safe Harbour (SBS)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Graham Kennedy Award for Most Popular New Talent\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Popular Presenter\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Dilruk Jayasinha in CRAM!

Publicly voted awards also reverted to being named \"Most Popular\" rather than \"Best,\" which was introduced at the 2016 ceremony.\nWith the ceremony being held later in the year than previous events to avoid clashing with the 2018 Commonwealth Games also being held on the Gold Coast, the nomination eligibility was extended, meaning shows airing before 31 March 2018 could qualify for nomination. This marked the first Logie Awards to be held on the Gold Coast, after the Government of Victoria stopped providing funding for the event.\nPresenters\n*Dave Hughes\nPerformers\n*Kelly Rowland with Sam Perry\n*Jess Glynne\n*Conrad Sewell\n* Kate Ceberano\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
