However, his plans included expansion to all of Dagestan.\nIn 1614-1617, Shah Abbas made an expedition to Kartli and Kakheti, these expeditions were quite successful for the Safavids.\nThe reason for the campaign was the desire to enter the territory of Circassia and from there go to Dagestan, however, the Shah's troops, not finding a road to Dagestan, attacked the mountainous part of Ossetia.\nInvasion\nIn 1614 the Shah arrived in the Georgian village of Nikozi and from there his troops went to Ossetia.\nThe Shah's troops invaded Ossetia from 2 directions. One group crossed the  and, moving through the Dargavs and  gorges, headed towards the . The second group crossed the Mamison Pass and, moving through the Mamison Pass and Alagir gorges, headed towards the Ursdon fortress. There were clashes between the Shah's troops and the local population.\nThe Shah's troops unsuccessfully stormed the  fortress in the Kurtat gorge. After the Shah's army invaded the Kurtat gorge, the gorge's inhabitants took refuge in the . This fortress was located at the beginning of the Kurtat Gorge, at the foot of the Rocky Range. The fortress covered a large cave, which allowed a large number of people to hide behind its walls.\nAfter the failure to storm the fortress of Dzhivgisa, the Safavid troops went to the high-mountain village of . Despite the resistance of the locals, the village was captured, after which Shah's army moved towards the village of . While the Safavid troops were approaching the  through the forest, they were noticed by the Ossetians who set the forest on fire.\nThe Shah's troops attacked the fortress with cannons but this was not successful.

From the village of , the troops headed to the village of Arkhon. However, the Ossetians managed to ambush the Shah's troops in the forest.\nAftermath\nDue to the geographical position, which was reflected in the mountainous terrain, the Safavids were unable to capture Ossetia and from there reach Circassia.\nThe invasions of Shah Abbas are preserved in many Ossetian legends, and the term Shah's road was used for a long time in relation to the road that was built by the Safavids during the invasion.\nIn 1617, the Ossetians arrived in Kakheti to help the Georgians in their fight against the Safavids.\nDespite the fact that the Ossetians, like the Georgians, suffered from constant raids by the Ottoman and Persian invaders, by the beginning of the 18th century the Ossetians managed to maintain their independence."
