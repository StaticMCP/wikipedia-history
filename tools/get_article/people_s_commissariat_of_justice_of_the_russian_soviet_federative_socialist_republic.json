The People's Commissariat of Justice was entrusted with the responsibility of building a new legal system and a new justice system, as well as replacing the abolished Governing Senate in terms of judicial control on a nationwide scale.\nAt the same time, the duties of the State Council of the Russian Empire, its Special Department and the Senate for the preparation and publication of decrees and for the codification of laws passed to the People's Commissariat of Justice.\nIn the Soviet Union, in accordance with the [https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/Конституция_СССР_(1924)_первоначальная_редакция Constitution] until 1936, only the republican People's Commissariats of Justice operated: the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and the People's Commissariats of Justice of the Union and Autonomous Republics supervised the judicial practice of all judicial bodies of this republic, challenging and directing the supervision through the prosecutor's office wrong sentence or decision made by any court on the territory of the republic.
