Her musical career began when she was five, performing solo in a relative's wedding reception. She gradually transformed into an artiste, launching her debut at the age of eight. Famous for releasing Chinese New Year albums over the last two decades, Queenzy also performed across other genres, from classical music to musical theatre and pop.\nFollowing the success of her albums, Queenzy collectively formed M-Girls (四个女生) in 2001 with three other emerging artistes: Angeline Khoo, Cass Chin and Crystal Ong. The M-Girls' debut album and subsequent releases won multiple awards, and M-Girls was quickly dubbed the S.H.E of Malaysia. Their albums were not only the fastest-selling albums in the history of Malaysian Chinese New Year albums, but also in the Asian region. To date, M-Girls have released more than 17 albums.\nIn 2017, Queenzy collaborated with Taiwanese model Tom Chang (張瀚元) to release the single titled \"Don't Be Shy\" (愛). The single was recorded in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and filmed in Taipei, Taiwan. On 9 October 2017, Queenzy announced on her Facebook page that she would be releasing her 2018 Chinese New Year album solo, since M-Girls were taking a break. She also invited her fans to participate by submitting their lyrics to be part of that year's album. Queenzy revealed that she was releasing the 2018 You Are The Best! album with guest celebrities including Wei Wei (⼩薇薇), John Wee (黄俊源) and Tedd Chan (曾国辉) on 15 November 2017.\nIn 2018, Queenzy collaborated with Crystal Ong to reproduce an online single similar to their 1995 album 双星报喜 (Double Stars Bring Luck). They reproduced the song \"招财进宝\" (\"Lucky Fortune\") with almost identical costumes, composition and filming methods. On 15 October 2018, Queenzy announced that she would release her album Queenzy and Friends in 2019 with guest celebrities including Chan, Veron Lin (练倩汶) as well as PongPong (碰碰), Jeii Pong (庞捷忆), and Gaston Pong (庞圭武).\nOn 28 November 2023, Queenzy was found dead from a ruptured brain aneurysm at age 37 while filming a video for a short-form social media channel called \"Squad Sekawan\". She was cremated at Prestavest Memorial Park, Pokok Sena near Alor Setar.\nDiscography\nEarly albums (Folk / Chinese New Year)\n*1995 – 卖馄饨 Selling Wontons (Queenzy's Solo Album)\n*1995 – 神奇电脑 Magic Computer (Queenzy's Solo Album)\n*1995 – 金童玉女 First Timers (Queenzy & Su Li Da)\n*1995 – 双星报喜 Vol.1 Double Stars Bring Luck (Queenzy & Crystal's CNY Album)\n*1995 – 雅歌群星龙狮会 Ya-Ko Stars Lion Dance (Queenzy, Crystal & Ya-Ko Stars' CNY Album)\n*1996 – 双星报喜 Vol.2 Double Stars Bring Luck (Queenzy & Crystal's CNY Album)\n*1996 – 雅歌群星贺新年 Ya-Ko Stars Celebrate the New Year (Queenzy, Crystal & Ya-Ko Stars' CNY Album)\n*1996 – 花花絮絮 Highlights (Crystal & Queenzy)\n*1998 – 新春嘉年华 Chinese New Year Carnival (Queenzy & Chen Jia Lin's CNY Album)\n*1998 – 三星报喜 Three Stars Bring Luck (Queenzy, Winnie & Chingy's 1998 CNY Album)\n*1999 – 兔气扬眉庆丰年 Tu Qi Yang Mei Qing Feng Nian (Queenzy, Cassandra, Crystal & Ya-Ko Stars' CNY Album)\n*1999 – 山歌黄梅调 Huang Mei Diao Mountain Songs (Queenzy, Cassandra & Crystal's Album)\n*2000 – 三星拱照庆龙年 Three Stars Celebrate the Year of the Dragon (Queenzy, Cassandra & Crystal's CNY Album)\n*2000 – 民谣 Folk Songs 2 in 1 (Queenzy, Cassandra & Crystal's Album)\nPop albums\n*2001 – Dance With Me (2001)\n*2003 – 耍花样 Playful Tricks\n*2004 – 笨金鱼 Silly Goldfish\n*2004 – 爱情密码 Love Code (MV collection)\n*2005 – 尼罗河 Nile River\n*2013 / 2014 – My Way\n*2017 – 愛 ''Don't Be Shy\nChinese New Year albums\n*2001 – 開心迎接豐收年 Happily Welcoming the Harvest Year\n*2002 – 飛跃新年 Leaping New Year\n*2003 – 新年 YEAH!
