It is the home of Kingussie Camanachd and has been a shinty venue for almost 150 years.\nLocation\nThe park is situated beside the River Spey on the outskirts of Kingussie, in an area known as the Dellmore of Kingussie which is situated along the road to Ruthven.\nHistory\nThe first shinty match recorded as being played at the Dell was on 30 January 1866.\nSince then, it has hosted 5 Camanachd Cup finals, the most recent in 1999. The stadium was one of the first in shinty to have crowd control barriers in place.\nThe park was owned by Dochfour Estates but Kingussie Camanachd purchased the ground in 2010 and marked this historic transfer of ownership with a ceremony with a reception. This has allowed the club to make improvements to what was already one of the best playing surfaces in shinty.\nThe club recently constructed a stand which was flood proofed in 2017 to allow the holding of the Camanachd Cup final in Kingussie again. A Camanachd Cup Final was to have been held at the Dell in September 2020.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713152707/http://www.kingussieshinty.com/news Kingussie Shinty Club]\n*[http://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/5925/Celebrations_as_Kings_come_home.html The Dell changes hands]"
