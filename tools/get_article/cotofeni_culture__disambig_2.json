Schuster in 1865 from the Râpa Roșie site in Sebeș (present-day Alba County, Romania). Since then, this culture has been studied by a number of people to varying degrees. Some of the more prominent contributors to the study of this culture include C. Gooss, K. Benkő, B. Orbán, G. Téglas, K. Herepey, S. Fenichel, Julius Teutsch, Cezar Bolliac, V. Christescu, Teohari Antonescu, and Cristian Popa.\nGeographic area\nThe Coțofeni culture area can be seen from two perspectives, as a fluctuation zone, or in its maximum area of extent. This covers present day Maramureș, some areas in Sătmar, the mountainous and hilly areas of Crișana, Transylvania, Banat, Oltenia, Muntenia (not including the North-East), and across the Danube in present-day eastern Serbia and northwestern Bulgaria.\nChronology\nAbsolute chronology\nBronze Age in Romania\nUnfortunately, most of the Coțofeni culture chronology is based on just three samples collected at three different Coțofeni sites. Based on these radiocarbon dates, this culture can be placed between roughly 3500 and 2500 BC.\nRelative chronology\nCultural synchronisms have been established based on mutual trade relations (visible as imported items) as well as stratigraphic observations. There is an evident synchronicity between:\nCoțofeni I - Cernavoda III - Baden A - Spherical Amphorae;\nCoțofeni II - Baden B-C Kostolac;\nCoțofeni III - Kostolac-Vučedol A-B.\nRelations with contemporary neighbouring cultures\nDuring the evolution of the Coțofeni culture, there were clearly relationships with other neighbouring cultures. The influence between the Coțofeni and their neighbours the Baden, Kostolac, Vučedol, Globular Amphora culture as well as the Ochre Burial populations was reciprocal. The areas bordering these cultures show cultural traits that have mixed aspects, for example Coțofeni-Baden and Coțofeni-Kostolac finds. These finds of mixed aspects suggest a cohabitation between related populations. It also supports the idea of well established trade between cultures.\nGallery\nFile:Alba Iulia National Museum of the Union 2011 - Cotofeni Culture Vessels, Stone and Bone Tools.JPG|Ceramic vessels, stone and bone tools, Romania\nFile:Aiud History Museum 2011 - Cotofeni Culture Pottery.JPG|Pottery, Romania\nFile:Alba Iulia National Museum of the Union 2011 - Cotofeni Culture Vessels, Stone and Bone Tools-1.JPG|Pottery from Ighiu, Tăuți and Unirea, Romania.\nFile:Aiud History Museum 2011 - Cotofeni Culture Cups-1.JPG\nFile:Spiral ornament 1.png|Metal spiral ornament\n|Copper spiral ornament\nSee also\n* Bronze Age in Romania\n* Yamnaya culture\n* Basarabi culture\n* Otomani culture\n* Pecica culture\n* Wietenberg culture\n* Prehistory of Transylvania\n* Prehistoric Romania\nNotes\nReferences\n* J.
