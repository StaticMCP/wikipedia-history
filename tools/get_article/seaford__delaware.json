According to the 2010 Census Bureau figures, the population of the city is 6,928, an increase of 3.4% from the 2000 census. It is part of the Salisbury, Maryland-Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nIt is the largest city fully within Sussex County.\nHistory\nSeaford, Delaware, is named after Seaford, East Sussex, in England. The area has a rich history, with land that is now part of western and southern Sussex County originally settled as part of Maryland. Seaford was included in Dorchester County, Maryland, along with nearby towns like Bridgeville, Greenwood, and Middleford, while Blades, Laurel, and Concord belonged to neighboring Somerset County. An error in the delineation of boundary lines led to Delaware's east-west border being inaccurately established between Delmar and Fenwick rather than the intended location at Cape Henlopen. Had this original agreement been honored, Seaford would be situated in Maryland today. The definitive boundary was finally established by surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon in 1763 after lengthy legal disputes in London.\nThe first recorded settlement surrounding Seaford involved a large parcel known as \"Martin's Hundred,\" a 1,750-acre tract granted to Jeremiah Jadwin of Virginia on January 22, 1672. Throughout this early period, the river served as major transportation, with roads only beginning to appear in official records around 1720. The area was primarily agricultural and focused heavily on tobacco cultivation, reflective of a plantation lifestyle. Archaeological evidence also suggests that the region east of contemporary Seaford was significant for bog iron production.\nCity seal\nThe City Seal of Seaford was originally designed in 1961 by Gary R. Blake, a patrolman in the Seaford Police Department. Each component of the seal represents significant aspects of Seaford's history and the overall heritage of Delaware:\nShip: Symbolizes Seaford’s former name, \"Hooper's Landing,\" and its shipping activities on the Nanticoke River.\nFigure One: Represents Delaware, known as the first state.\nSheaf of Wheat: Signifies the region's agricultural heritage.\nCorn: Represents the milling industries based in Seaford.\nHolly: Depicts Delaware's state tree.\nNylon: Acknowledges the significance of the nylon industry.\nDiamond: Reflects Delaware's nickname, the \"Diamond State.\"\nChicken: Symbolizes the poultry industry.\nFarmer: Represents agricultural interests.\nIndian: Honors the Nanticoke Tribe.\nIn 2003, the City Council slightly modified the original seal, adding the year \"1865\" to indicate the date of Seaford's incorporation and correcting the spelling of \"Capitol\" to \"Capital,\" adhering to proper terminology.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which   is land and   (1.14%) is water.\nClimate\nSituated on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, Seaford's weather is moderated by the Atlantic Ocean.
