Awards are given out in visual, literary and performing arts, and there is also a Joe Devaux Lifetime Award. The Cultural Development Foundation assumed responsibility in 2004, when M&C handed it over after twenty five years of successful recognising the contribution of individuals and groups to the artistic-scape of St. Lucia.\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210644/http://www.stlucia.gov.lc/pr2003/CDF_to_Assume_the_Reins_of_M_C_Fine_Arts_Awards_Scheme.htm CDF to Assume the Reins of M&C Fine Arts Awards Scheme]"
