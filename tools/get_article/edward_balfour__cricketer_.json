He was educated at Westminster School, before going up to Christ Church, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Oxford University against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Oxford in 1852. Balfour played first-class cricket for Oxford until 1854, making nine appearances. Playing as an all-rounder, he scored 152 runs for Oxford at an average of 11.69 and a high score of 62. With his roundarm slow bowling, he took 35 wickets for Oxford, taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions and taking ten wickets in a match once. In addition to playing for Oxford, Balfour also played first-class cricket for the MCC on seven occasions in 1853–54, scoring 129 runs with a high score of 36. His best batting return came for the Gentlemen of England, for whom he made five first-class appearances from 1852&ndash;54, scoring 185 runs at an average of 23.12. Balfour's other first-class appearances included three each for England and the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players, in addition to one match for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club.\nHis father, a merchant, had business at Genoa in the Kingdom of Sardinia with his company Grants, Balfour & Co. Balfour joined his father in Genoa in 1856, where he died in August \"after a few days' illness\". His brothers, Robert and Archibald, both played first-class cricket.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
