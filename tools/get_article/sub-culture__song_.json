It was released as the second and final single from their third studio album, Low-Life (1985) on 28 October 1985 by Factory Records.\nRelease\nThe single release, remixed by John Robie, is a drastic departure from the album version of the track. Robie's 12\" and 7\" single mixes feature more club-oriented, electronic instrumentation and prominent soulful female backing vocals.\nThe B-side is an instrumental remix titled \"Dub-vulture\". An alternate seven-inch edit of the Robie remix taken from the Benelux version of the \"Sub-culture\" single appears on the group's 1987 compilation, Substance.  This version also appears on the US 12\" alongside the longer mixes.\nA collection of Razormaid remixes of the track were released in 1986, which include additional vocals by Deborah Iyall of Romeo Void.\nArtwork\n\"Sub-culture\" has only a regular black sleeve. A long-standing rumour held that graphic designer Peter Saville reportedly deemed the mix of the song unworthy of his talents, with Saville's input present only in a P/S/A (Peter Saville Associates) credit for typography.\nHowever this rumour was debunked in 2017 when Saville stated, \"I never had the authority to say that there shouldn't be a sleeve. No, all I can presume is that one was not asked for.\"\nTrack listing\nUK 7\" free with Record Mirror - RM2\n# New Order: \"Sub-culture\" (exclusive remix) – 4:14\n# Raymonde: \"Jennifer Wants\" (exclusive track) – 2:02\n# Hipsway: \"Bad Thing Longing\" (preview from their forthcoming album) – 4:09\n# Adventures: \"Walk Away Renee\" (specially recorded for RM) – 3:11\nChart positions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
