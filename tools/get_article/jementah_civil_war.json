As a compromise, Sultan Ali was granted a fiefdom over Muar region, while Temenggong Ibrahim ruled the rest of Johor.\nFollowing Sultan Ali's death in 1877, the custody of the Kesang territory lay in the hands of Ungku Jalil, Sultan Ali's elder brother. Colonel Edward Anson, the acting Governor of the Straits Settlements, instituted an election for the Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar and the territory's chieftains to decide on the destiny of the Kesang territory, and they voted unanimously for Maharaja Abu Bakar as their leader.\nUngku Jalil handed over the custodianship of the Kesang territory and the Governor William Robinson recognised the fiefdom of Muar as having returned to Maharaja Abu Bakar's central administration in Johor Bahru, which greatly upsets Tengku Alam and many of his followers.\nTengku Alam began his moves by asking his cousins Tengku Nong and Tengku Mat to spread false information to the residents of Muar district to be on his side. He also gathered some powerful warriors for the battle.\nConflict\nTengku Alam and his followers launched the first blow of the war by seizing Jementah town, just outside Segamat, on 25 October 1879. The headman or governor of Jementah reported to the ruler of Johor, Maharaja Abu Bakar, who responded by sending a powerful force led by his cousin, Ungku Ahmad. Ungku Ahmad was a great tactician who contributed to the Johor Government's rapid victory.\nDato' Mohammed Salleh bin Perang, also known as Dato' Bentara Luar, was deployed by the government on 2 December to assist the government army. As a strategy, he split the Johor government army into four units to fight enemies easier. Each unit contained about 100 men.\nBy mid-December, the government army conquered more enemy strongholds and finally gained total victory at dawn on 30 December after a surprise attack on the enemy's final redoubt. Since then, the original District of Muar, which then included Segamat, was reintegrated into Johor.\nAftermath\nThe most notable event that happened as a result of the Johor government's victory in the Jementah Civil War was the opening of Muar as a new modern town by the Maharaja Abu Bakar, where the town was conferred the Bandar Maharani new title. Besides this event, the soldiers from both sides who later resided in the areas of Jementah and Segamat opened the residencies (mukim) of Pagoh, as well as some villages there.\nSee also\n*Sultan Ali of Johor\n*Raja Temenggong of Muar\nSources\n*YM Ungku Mohd.
