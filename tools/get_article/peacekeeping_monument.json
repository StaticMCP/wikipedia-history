Artist Jack Harman built the three soldiers with architects Richard Henriquez and Gregory Henriquez designing the site concept, monument  structures and the naming of the monument. Cornelia Oberlander was the landscape architect. The monument was completed in 1992.\nThe work, entitled Reconciliation, depicts three peacekeeping soldiers &mdash; two men and a woman &mdash; standing on two ridges of stone which cut through the broken debris of war and converge at a high point, which symbolizes the resolution which peacekeeping brings.  The base of the monument includes Lester Pearson's 1956 quote \"We need action not only to end the fighting but to make the peace... My own government would be glad to recommend Canadian participation in such a United Nations force, a truly international peace and police force\", as well as the French translation.\nIn 1995, the monument was commemorated on the year's $1 coin, following the 1994 commemoration of the National War Memorial.\nGallery\nFile:Reconciliation- The Peacekeeping Monument, Ottawa.jpg |Closeup of figures and inscription\nFile:Peacekeeping Monument in Ottawa.JPG |Another view of the figures\nFile:LPB quote on Peacekeeping Monument.jpg |Quote from Lester Pearson on the monument\nSee also\n* Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\n* National War Memorial (Canada)\n* The Ottawa Memorial\nSources\n* Gough, P.J.
