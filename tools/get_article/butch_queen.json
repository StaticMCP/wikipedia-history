It was released on March 4, 2016, just three days prior to the eighth season premiere of ''RuPaul's Drag Race. The album features guest appearances from Ellis Miah, Ts Madison and Taylor Dayne, among others.\nBackground\nA song on the album, \"U Wear It Well\" was first used in the promotional campaign for season eight of RuPaul's Drag Race in February 2016, which premiered during the 2016 NewNowNext Awards on Logo TV. On February 17, 2016, RuPaul tweeted \"GAGGING on duet w/@taylor_dayne from my NEW album \"Butch Queen\" coming March 7, 2016!\", confirming the release of his tenth album. It marks his third album to be released with a premiere of a season of RuPaul's Drag Race, after Born Naked (2014) and Realness (2015).\nSingles\nThe first song to be lifted from the album was \"U Wear It Well\" which was first heard in the teaser campaign for season eight of RuPaul's Drag Race''. It was subsequently made available to download on February 29, 2016. A music video was released the following day on World of Wonder's YouTube channel featuring every runway look worn by RuPaul over the last seven seasons of ''RuPaul's Drag Race.\nIn 2020, \"U Wear It Well\" was used as the \"rumix\" song for the final challenge in Canada's Drag Race. The \"Queens of the North Ru-mix\" was released to streaming platforms and online music stores in September 2020.\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 3:33\n| title2          = U Wear It Well\n| note2           =\n| length2         = 2:58\n| title3          = Category Is...\n| note3           = featuring Vjuan Allure\n| length3         = 3:52\n| title4          = Legends\n| note4           = featuring Margo Thunder and Ellis Miah\n| length4         = 3:32\n| title5          = Feel Like a Woman\n| note5           = featuring Vjuan Allure\n| length5         = 3:46\n| title6          = Drop\n| note6           = featuring Ts Madison and Ellis Miah\n| length6         = 3:00\n| title7          = Drag Queen Honey\n| note7           = featuring Vjuan Allure\n| length7         = 4:18\n| title8          = Be Someone\n| note8           = featuring Taylor Dayne\n| length8         = 3:40\n| title9          = How I Wanna Hold U\n| note9           = featuring Sharlotte Gibson and Matt Moss\n| length9         = 3:07\n| title10         = High Fashion Labels\n| note10          = featuring Vjuan Allure\n| length10        = 3:47\n| title11         = Sister Brother\n| note11          = featuring Margo Thunder\n| length11        = 4:46\n| title12         = Nothing Nice\n| note12          = featuring Vjuan Allure\n| length12        = 3:16\n}}\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
