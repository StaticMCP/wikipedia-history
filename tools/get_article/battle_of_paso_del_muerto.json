The confrontation occurred between the Spanish forces under the command of the brigade chief of San Antonio de Guerra, Brigadier Juan Suero, against the troops of the Dominican liberation army commanded by General Gregorio Luperón.\nAfter this encounter, which ended with a Spanish victory, Suero, nicknamed the Black Cid by the Spanish, was mortally wounded and died a few hours later. His death was very painful for the Spanish army.\nBackground\nAfter the dissolution of the Guanuma camp, which was putting the mambises in a tight spot, they began to increase their forces. Communications between the troops of Lieutenant General Pedro Santana, and troops stationed in San José de los Llanos and San Antonio de Guerra were becoming difficult and dangerous. The Spanish garrisons at Monte Plata and other points were ordered to retreat to the city of Santo Domingo, due to diseases, and this allowed the garrisons at Hato Mayor del Rey, San José de los Llanos and San Antonio de Guerra to be reinforced.\nAfter Brigadier Juan Suero went by order of the Superior Civil Governor and Captain General of the province of Santo Domingo, Field Marshal Carlos de Vargas, to relieve Lieutenant General Pedro Santana of the command of El Seibo, and before the refusal of the latter would end up leaving said town and in San Antonio de Guerra would take the position of head of the brigade of the homonymous town on March 14; upon arriving he had news that one of the largest groups of insurgents wandered around those surroundings and planned to go out in search of them. Among his provisions was the idea of working in combination with the Spanish forces of the Poma Rosa camp but on the same day that he conceived his project he received reinforcement from the third provisional battalion that had just arrived from peninsular Spain and that came with all of its soldiers. On the March 24, Suero received the confidences in which he was informed of the number of separatists and the point they occupied, barely a league away, and then he ordered the third provisional battalion to form, and placing himself at its head with 100 men from the Provincial Reserves of Santo Domingo, he left in search of the separatists at 6 in the morning.\nBattle\nAfter a steep slope, there was a slippery descent, at the end of which there was a gorge, on the opposite bank of which were the Dominican rebels at a point called Paso del Muerto, which was a difficult defile surrounded by dense forest, and to which a narrow and bad road led. Once the independentists were positioned in the thick forest, a very heavy fire began on both sides, with which Brigadier Suero ordered three more companies of the same battalion to accompany him under the command of their first chief with a piece of mountain artillery, twelve engineers with an officer and twenty horses with another; also ordering that with the four remaining companies of that corps, artillery, cavalry and engineers, Colonel Luis Rodriguez should defend and hold that point at all costs and take suitable measures for the protection of the column. At 11 in the morning, Brigadier Suero immediately joined the force that preceded him, distant, managing to defeat and repel General Luperón's troops.\nConsequences\nAs the companies retreated, Brigadier Suero approached a group of officers, lit a cigarette, and when he was most content, expressing his satisfaction with the behavior of his brave soldiers, a bullet came and went through him, leaving him mortally wounded. When the first wounded arrived at the town of San Antonio de Guerra, the wounded were treated in the temporary hospital.\nA few hours after the Spanish troops returned to San Antonio de Guerra, they had the displeasure of witnessing the unfortunate death of Suero.\nAftermath\nLieutenant General Santana felt bitterly at the loss of Brigadier Suero, as he saw that he was rapidly descending into nullity due to the lack of his friends and the hostility of his compatriots. From then on, Santana ceased to give signs of the activity and firmness that had so exalted him.\nRamón González Tablas referred to how the death of Brigadier Suero was felt in the Spanish army in the following way:\nIn the American newspaper The New York Times, the news of his death was headlined as \"A Negro General in Spanish Service Mortally Wounded,\" etc.\nIn the Spanish newspaper La Iberia, another version of the death of Brigadier Suero is narrated and begins like this:\nSee also\n*Dominican Restoration War\n*Pedro Santana\n*Juan Suero\nReferences"
