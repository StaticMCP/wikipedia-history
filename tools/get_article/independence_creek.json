In 2000 and 2001, The Nature Conservancy acquired the surrounding land to establish the Independence Creek Preserve.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Texas\nReferences\n*[http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/texas/placesweprotect/independence-creek-preserve.xml The Nature Conservancy - Independence Creek Preserve]\n*\n*[https://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/ USGS Geographic Names Information Service]\n*USGS Hydrologic Unit Map - State of Texas (1974)"
