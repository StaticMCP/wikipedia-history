A Real-Time Photo of the Year category was added to the list of official categories for the first time, recognizing the best photo posted to services such as Twitpic, Yfrog, or Facebook.\nThe second Shorty Awards competition introduced a panel of judges called the Real-Time Academy of Short Form Arts & Sciences whose members were Craig Newmark, David Pogue, Kurt Andersen, Caterina Fake, Joi Ito, Frank Moss, Alberto Ibargüen, Sreenath Sreenivasan, MC Hammer, Alyssa Milano and Jimmy Wales. After public nominations determined the finalists, the academy decided on the winners.\nWinners were announced at a ceremony held in the Times Center in The New York Times building in Manhattan, and were streamed online. The ceremony was hosted by CNN anchor Rick Sanchez, who presented awards in the official categories as well as the newly added Real-Time Photo of the Year and a special humanitarian award.\nWinners\nThe second annual winners by category:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Category\n!Winner\n|-\n|Best in Advertising\n|Frank Adman, @FrankAdman\n|-\n|Best in Apps\n|TweetDeck, @TweetDeck\n|-\n|Best in Art\n|deviantART, @deviantART\n|-\n|Best Brand\n|Whole Foods, @WholeFoods & Sesame Street, @sesamestreet\n|-\n|Best Celebrity\n|Nathan Fillion, @NathanFillion\n|-\n|Best Cultural Institution\n|Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, @lewisginter & Reduced Shakespeare Company, @reduced\n|-\n|Best in Customer Service\n|Bonnie Smalley, @ComcastBonnie\n|-\n|Best in Design\n|Smashing Magazine, @smashingmag\n|-\n|Best in Entertainment\n|True Blood HBO, @TrueBloodHBO\n|-\n|Best in Finance\n|The Suze Orman Show, @SuzeOrmanShow\n|-\n|Best in Food\n|Foodimentary, @Foodimentary\n|-\n|Best in Government\n|Cory Booker, @CoryBooker\n|-\n|Best in Health\n|Rachael Dunlop, @DrRachie\n|-\n|Best in Humor\n|Mrs. Stephen Fry, @MrsStephenFry & David Thorne, @27bslash6\n|-\n|Best in Innovation\n|Betty Draper, @BettyDraper\n|-\n|Best in Literature\n|Arjun Basu, @arjunbasu\n|-\n|Best Journalist\n|William Bonner, @realwbonner & Rachel Maddow, @maddow\n|-\n|Best in Music\n|Ivete Sangalo, @ivetesangalo & Ted Leo, @tedleo\n|-\n|Best in News\n|The Diane Rehm Show, @drshow\n|-\n|Best Nonprofit\n|TWLOHA, @TWLOHA\n|-\n|Best in Politics\n|The Nation, @thenation\n|-\n|Best in Science\n|Jen Scheer, @flyingjenny\n|-\n|Best in Sports\n|Bill Simmons, @sportsguy33\n|-\n|Best in Tech\n|Soldier Knows Best, @SoldierKnowBest\n|-\n|Best in Travel\n|Twitchhiker, @twitchhiker\n|-\n|Best in Weird\n|The Llama, @DoWhatITellYou\n|}\nSpecial Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Category\n!Winner\n|-\n|Real-Time Photo of the Year\n|Janis Krums, @jkrums for \"Plane on the Hudson\"\n|-\n|Special Humanitarian Award\n|Carel Pedre, @carelpedre\n|}\nReferences"
