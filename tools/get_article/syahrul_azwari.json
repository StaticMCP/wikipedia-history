He represented Malaysia U-23 in the 2011 VFF Cup and scored 1 goal. With the U-23 team, he also won the gold medal in 2011 Southeast Asian Games football tournament, where he scored the winning goal against hosts Indonesia in the group stage.\nHe made his debut for the senior national team in late 2015, with 2 substitute appearances in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Palestine and United Arab Emirates.\nClub career\nSarawak FA\nOn 20 February 2016, Syahrul was confirmed as Sarawak FA player on loan from Kelantan FA for 2016 season. According to the Secretary-general of the Football Association of Malaysia, Hamidin Mohd Amin, both Kelantan Football Association and Football Association of Sarawak has reached an agreement that Syahrul will join Sarawak FA as part of a loan deal.\nThe saga started when the disbanded of Harimau Muda and all players were instructed to join their home teams but they could also join other teams if the home teams did not want them. Syahrul signed for Sarawak FA in December 2015, despite being offered to return to Kelantan FA according to the Kelantan FA head coach, K. Devan. However, in January, the Football Association of Malaysia Players Status Committee made a decision that Syahrul must play for Kelantan and they must negotiate on new terms and conditions of his contract. However, both parties failed to agree terms, and Sarawak FA finally held talks with Kelantan FA about signing up Syahrul, resulting in a loan deal.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!
