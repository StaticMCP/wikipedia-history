The Weibo region, ruled autonomously by the Tian family, subsequently became one of the revolting garrisons of Hebei.\nWeibo features prominently in the film The Assassin (2015 film).\nHistory\nTang dynasty.

He was adopted by the Princess of Jiacheng when she married his father in 785 since she had no child of her own. It was said that Ji'an was cruel and ferocious. Tian Hongzheng, a nephew of Tian Chengsi, urged Ji'an to stop his wanton cruelty. This gained the ire of Ji'an who sought to kill Hongzheng.
