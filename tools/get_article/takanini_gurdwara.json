Under the management of the New Zealand Sikh Society Auckland, formed on 6 June 1982, now the Supreme Sikh Society of New Zealand, the Ōtāhuhu Gurdwara and Sikh community flourished. With the guidance of an advisory committee formed in 2001, the Society purchased 3.5 hectares of land on Takanini School Road and laid the foundation stone for a new gurdwara on 11 August 2002. The Gurdwara was officially opened on 13 March 2005 in the presence of Prime Minister Helen Clark.\nReferences"
