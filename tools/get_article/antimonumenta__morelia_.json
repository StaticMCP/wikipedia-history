The installation of the structure lasted around 30 minutes.\nDuring the night following its installation, the anti-monument was destroyed by unidentified females. The following morning, the installers went to the site to pick up the twisted metal and left flowers in its place, and on their social networks they said: \"They took down the Antimonumenta in Michoacán, but today an altar was born in its place\".\nOn the afternoon of 25 April of the same year, the collective installed a replica and commented that they will place it \"as many times as necessary until women in Michoacán live free, happy and safe\".\nDuring the demonstrations on 2 October, in honor of the Tlatelolco massacre, two unidentified men vandalized the Antimonumenta and Las Tarascas Fountain with slogans referring to the 2014 Iguala mass kidnapping.\nDescription and meaning\nThe original Antimonumenta was painted completely in purple and it was represented with the symbol of the feminist struggle, which is based on the symbol of Venus with a raised fist in the center. In feminism, the color represents \"loyalty, constancy towards a purpose [and] unwavering firmness towards a cause\". It was a metal sculpture whose upper part had written in Spanish, in violet capital letters: \"Alive, free and happy\", while on the arm of the cross it was written, \"Not one more!\". According to the installers, it represents the victims of femicide, as well as a method to invoke compassion, empathy and solidarity towards their cause.\nSee also\n* Antimonumenta (Guadalajara)\nReferences"
