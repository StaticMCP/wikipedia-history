It was released in the UK on 28 December 1987 and peaked at No. 7 the following month. In Europe, it was a Top 10 hit in Norway, and a Top 30 hit in the Netherlands. In the US, the single was released in March 1988 and reached No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1988.\nA music video was filmed to promote the single. Stewart also performed the song on the popular UK music show Top of the Pops with his backing band \"The Party\" in February 1988. In the US, Stewart performed the song on American TV show Soul Train.\nThe single's B-side, \"You Promise\", was exclusive to the single, and was written by Stewart and Roy Carter.\nCritical reception\nUpon release, Cash Box listed the single as one of their \"feature picks\" during March 1988. They commented: \"Stewart has about the brightest sounding voice in R&B, and it pokes through any kind of speaker, static, player and mental blockage. If he can't pierce through to the top 10 with this little pin-prick of a hit, we'd be shocked.\" In his 2015 book The Top 40 Annual 1988, James Masterton described the song as \"one of the more enduring pop hits of the winter months\" and noted the song's \"clever production\" and \"expected Aaron Zigman-produced pop funk\".\nFormats\n;7\" single\n#\"Say It Again\" - 4:07\n#\"You Promise\" - 4:47\n;12\" single (US release)\n#\"Say It Again (Extended Remix)\" - 8:30\n#\"You Promise\" - 4:46\n#\"Say It Again (Single Version)\" - 4:07\n#\"We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off (Extended Dance Mix)\" - 5:54\n;12\" single (European release)\n#\"Say It Again (Extended Remix)\" - 8:30\n#\"Say It Again\" - 4:07\n#\"You Promise\" - 4:47\n;CD single\n#\"Say It Again\" - 3:49\n#\"We Don't Have To Take Our Clothes Off\" - 4:04\n#\"Dress It Up\" - 4:42\n#\"You Promise\" - 4:47\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1988)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Belgian Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Dutch Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|27\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|Italy Airplay (Music & Media)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Norwegian Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|27\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|}\nPersonnel\n* Jermaine Stewart - vocals\n* Jerry Knight - instruments\n* Aaron Zigman - instruments\n* Bill Reichenbach, Gary Grant, Jerry Hey, Kim Hutchcroft - horns\n* Deniece Williams, James Ingram, Jerry Knight, Josie James, Marva King, Pam Hutchinson, Wanda Vaughn - backing vocals\n;Production\n* Aaron Zigman, Jerry Knight - producers of \"Say It Again\"\n* Csaba Petocz, Gary Wagner - engineers on \"Say It Again\"\n* John Arrias - additional engineer on \"Say It Again\"\n* Mick Guzauski - mixing and recording on \"Say It Again\"\n* Phil Harding - additional production, mixing on \"Say It Again (Extended Remix)\"\n* Ian Curnow - additional production and Fairlight programming on \"Say It Again (Extended Remix)\"\n* Jermaine Stewart, Roy Carter - producers of \"You Promise\"\n* Narada Michael Walden - producer of \"We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off\"\n;Other\n* Bill Smith Studio - sleeve design\n* Mark Le Bon - photography\nReferences"
