Under the sudden attack the German company had broken and left the field, while the French under Capt. Legaye also retired from the broken ground they had attempted to occupy. In five minutes, the whole command was in disarray in full and disorderly retreat; in fourteen minutes the Costa Ricans had won the battle. Walker's troops suffered 59 killed and the Costa Ricans 20 killed.\nThe Santa Rosa's Casona, one of the few historical sites, was burned down in May 2001 and later re-built.\nSee also\n* Second Battle of Rivas\nReferences"
