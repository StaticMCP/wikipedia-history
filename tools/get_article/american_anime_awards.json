The first gala awards presentation was hosted in New York City on February 24, 2007, at New York Comic Con. The hosts of the evening were eight actresses from the anime production company ADV Films: Christine Auten, Shelley Calene-Black, Jessica Boone, Luci Christian, Alice Fulks, Hilary Haag, Taylor Hannah and Serena Varghese. A streaming version of the one-hour awards ceremony can be seen on IGN.com. The awards were later broadcast on the Anime Network.\nVoting information\nThe ballots contained nominations from industry companies and professionals. To be eligible for an award, anime or manga must be available in the U.S. during the previous year, prior to the awards gala. Whether by DVD (or book or periodical, in the case of manga), national TV, or theatrical release. Anime and manga are defined, as animation or comics, respectively, originally produced in Japan.\nVoting was conducted via an online ballot system. The American Anime Awards partnered with respected industry news site ICv2 to host and track the fan voting to ensure accurate voting and to eliminate any mass voting by single individuals. Nevertheless, the impartiality of the poll was questioned as certain companies (ADV Films) were \"overwhelminvly involved\" in the event.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and denoted in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\" |\n*'Final Fantasy VII Advent Children  — Square Enix Holdings'\n**Akira — Toho\n**Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa — Bones\n**InuYasha Movie 4: Fire on Mystic Island — Sunrise\n**Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew — OLM\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\" |\n*'FLCL  — Gainax, Production I.G, and King Records'\n**Ah!

Also, since evidently any anime that was released in any way in 2006 is eligible for nomination, some actors have been nominated for work done years or even decades ago. Another criticism was the apparent error of including Johnny Yong Bosch as Best Actor in a Comedy despite the fact Akira is not a comedy.\nCoverage\nThe news of the awards were announced on major websites on affiliated websites like ICv2, but was also reported and followed like IGN.\nNotes\nSee also\n* List of animation awards\n* List of manga awards\nReferences\n[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-02-07/american-anime-awards-finalists-announced \"American Anime Awards Finalists Announced\"].
