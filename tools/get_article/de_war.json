A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication. De WAR is a nonprofit volunteer organisation outside of Dutch academia and educational system, and is part of the Dutch maker and hacker culture scene. It organizes public events, exhibits and workshops connecting technology, sustainability, science and arts. FabLab Amersfoort opened within De WAR in 2010, as one of the first grassroots fab labs.\nHistory\nDe WAR dates back to 2002, when a group of performing artists, \"De Spullenmannen\" created a laboratory in an old factory complex in Amersfoort. Leading artists of the \"De Spullenmannen\" (English: The Spullenmen; the Dutch \"spullen\" meaning \"things\" or \"stuff\") were Diana Wildschut and Harmen Zijp. They make visual theatre and theatrical installations, and work often with garbage from the consumer society. The Spullenmen act on the interface of art and science. The Spullen laboratory (\"Spullenlab\") was established in the abandoned factory of Warner-Jenkinson (part of Sensient Technologies), where dyes were made.\nAround 2007 the first steps in creating \"De WAR\" were taken. The idea was to create an open workspace for artists, (citizen) scientists, starting entrepreneurs etc. An important factor in the foundation of De WAR was the start of the so-called \"festival Franje\", (\"Franje\" meaning \"fringe\"), that continued as an autonomous fringe festival in Amersfoort, Arendal (Norway) and Potsdam (Germany) until 2017.\nGallery\nFab Lab De WAR Amersfoort, the Netherlands, Koppelting Festival, August 2024 - 02.jpg|De WAR Fab lab, 2024.\nFab Lab De WAR Amersfoort, the Netherlands, Koppelting Festival, August 2024 - 05.jpg|De WAR Fab lab equipment, 2024.\nFab Lab De WAR Amersfoort, the Netherlands, Koppelting Festival, August 2024 - 06.jpg|De WAR Fab lab equipment, 2024.\nFab Lab De WAR Amersfoort, the Netherlands, Koppelting Festival, August 2024 - 03.jpg|De WAR Fab lab equipment, 2024.\nWeerballon oplatenB.jpg|Citizen science: Weather balloon launch, De WAR, 2017.\nMicrometeorite_inside_dust_mite2.jpg|Citizen science: Microscope view of a metallic micrometeorite (pointed eggshape) including a dust mite, De WAR, 2024.\n20240816 DeWAR (binnen) Heiligenbergerweg 02.jpg|Showcase for discarded domestic electrical appliances (toasters) at De WAR, 2024.\n20240816 DeWAR (binnen) Heiligenbergerweg 05.jpg|Poster for the Koppelting Citizen science conference, August 2024.\n20160422 Stoomluciferfabriek De Eem werd later Warner Jenkinson.jpg|Former location of De WAR, former Steam Match Factory, Eem River, Amersfoort, the Netherlands, 2016.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\nLiterature\n*  Full text download.\n*\n*\n*"
