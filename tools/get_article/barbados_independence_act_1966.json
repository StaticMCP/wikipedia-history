The Act also provided for the granting of a new constitution to take effect upon independence, which was done by the Barbados Independence Order 1966.\nAs a result of the Act, Barbados became the fourth English-speaking country in the West Indies to achieve full independence from the United Kingdom, after Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago, and Guyana. At independence, Barbados became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations as a Commonwealth realm; prior to this, Barbados had been a fully self-governing British colony from 1961.\nBackground to enactment\nThe bill was first presented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as the Barbados Independence Bill on 28 October 1966, by Secretary of State for the Colonies, Frederick Lee.
