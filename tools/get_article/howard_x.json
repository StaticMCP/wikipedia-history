He attended the games and closing ceremony in his character and confused spectators by simultaneously waving both a North Korean flag and a rainbow flag. He was also approached by North Korean delegates dressed in DPRK tracksuits as they thought he was the real Kim Jong Un. He received attention online for his impersonation and was on Reddit’s homepage.\nIn a mini documentary produced by Urban Tales, Howard X shared that he spent at least two hours to get ready for his Kim Jong Un look, constantly studied his mannerism and had to be updated with everything that's happening in North Korea.

The duo jokingly stated they believed their political satire had inspired the 2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit as before these events, the relationship between the two countries were at all-time low where war of words were frequent between the real presidents due to tensions regarding North Korea's missile and nuclear programme. The impersonators flew together to Singapore before the actual summit to show solidarity towards the event.\nOn Valentine's Day 2018, Howard X visited the North Korean cheerleaders during the ice hockey games and was seen waving the Korean Reunification Flag.

Howard X was also not paid any compensation and was suggested to rent his custom-made suit to make some money out of the trip. He detailed the incident on his official pages to give the general public an idea of what performing artists have to put up with. He described this experience as the worst of the worst in the 18 years that he had been gigging as a musician and now as an impersonator and said, \"If they are willing to do this to a high-profile impersonator such as myself, imagine what others who have a lower profile have to put up with.\"\nDuring 2018 FIFA World Cup, Vladimir Putin impersonator Steve and Howard X travelled to Samara, Russia for the Russia-Uruguay match.

While the latter could stay, Howard was infamously deported. Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said that it was \"truly absurd and despicable\" that Vietnam was harassing and threatening Howard X.\nIn a 2019 interview with TIME, he explained that although his impersonation occasionally lands in hot water, most of his gigs almost always evoke laughters. He also mentioned that he was sure that the real Kim Jong Un knows about him.\nDuring 2019 G20 Osaka summit, Howard X and Donald Trump impersonator Dennis Alan travelled to Osaka, Japan, ahead of the G-20 leaders' summit in the city.

He held a sign that said \"No Extradition To Communist Countries\". The government-proposed bill prompted a series of 2019–20 Hong Kong protests as it would allow the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China, where human rights abuses are rife and death sentences common. Described as one of the largest and most unified protests in more than a decade, the massive march prompted rallies in solidarity in at least 29 cities around the world.\nIn August 2019, Howard X had formed a political satire band The Tyrants and were spotted at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with Donald Trump and Boris Johnson impersonators promoting their jazz parody fringe show.

One of his appearances was when protestors gathered at IFC mall in Central Hong Kong to chant pro-democracy slogans and sing songs related to the anti-extradition movement in which he appeared with an inflatable missile. On July 1, Howard X was also spotted at a Hong Kong rally against the new national security laws. When asked if he supported the new laws, the impersonator responded “Do not turn Hong Kong into another Pyongyang.” The protest coincided with the anniversary of the Handover of Hong Kong to China from the British in 1997.\nIn the same year when the real Kim Jong Un vanished out of spotlight for months and reappeared later for an event, Howard X was interviewed by the New York Post as there was a wild theory that a body double for Kim Jong Un appeared at a recent event in order to hide the fact that the Supreme Leader is dying. He said that there is no way the North Korean regime could find a convincing Kim Jong Un lookalike in the food-starved nation because he is too obese. He also believed that footages that emerged from years ago that purports to show the dictator's hired doppelgänger is bogus. In the interview, Howard X also revealed that he had maintained his pudgy physique through a strict regime of not exercising and eating a lot of quality steaks but he still weighs about 50 pounds less than the tubby tyrant.\n2021\nIn January 2021, several non-profit news websites such as Hong Kong Free Press and Radio Free Asia reported that Howard X was raided and arrested at his home by the Hong Kong government over suspicion of \"possession of firearm without license\". However, none were found in the raid and his iPhone was confiscated during interview at the police station. In interviews with the press, he said that he believed the arrest was politically motivated as he had always shown support towards Hong Kong city's pro-democracy movements and he felt that \"Hong Kong used to be a free city but it's gradually getting a lot more like Pyongyang\". As a professional impersonator of Kim Jong Un, he often makes use of and owns a number of replica BB guns, missiles and nuclear bombs for his performances and videos. Since he was required to report to the police station every six weeks, he made sure to arrive in character with his inflatable missile to highlight the ridiculous grounds of his arrest.

He was confronted by the media and the owners of the factory while calling \"everyone to vote for Gladys Liu\" sarcastically, and that she was the \"Communist candidate for Chisholm\". He was forced to leave  and was confronted by police. The event occurred amidst heightened tensions between Australia and China, and investigations into Liu's possible affiliations with the Chinese Communist Party.\nIn November, he contested Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews' electorate of Mulgrave as an independent candidate at the Victorian state election, under the name 'Howard Lee'. However, he only received 120 first-preference votes (0.32% of votes) and was not elected.\n2023\nIn September 2023, Howard X appeared on a stream by popular Kick streamer Adin Ross in a staged 'interview' mimicking the central theme of the film The Interview, receiving a peak viewership of 700,000 in the process.\nMusic career\nHoward X is also a drummer and runs a Samba school in Hong Kong.
