It is named in honour of Rosalind Franklin and initially funded by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and subsequently the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) as part of its efforts to promote women in STEM. Women are a significantly underrepresented group in STEM making up less than 9% of the United Kingdom's full-time and part-time professors in science. The award consists of a medal and a grant of £30,000. The recipient delivers a lecture as part of the Society's public lecture series, some of which are available on YouTube.\nLaureates\n* 2003: Susan Gibson on Make me a molecule.
