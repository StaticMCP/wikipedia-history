Park Ave between Center St. and National Blvd. in Long Beach, New York, USA.\nThe Monument was dedicated June 7, 1987, by the Holocaust Memorial Committee as a memorial to the six million Jews who were victims of Nazi persecution and the non-Jews who tried to save them.\nHistory\nThe Monument was designed by Dr. Stanley Robbin and Architect Monte Scott Leeper. Robbin was a holocaust survivor from the Schindlerjuden and Oskar Schindler’s physician and the chairman and founder of the Long Island Holocaust Memorial Commission.\nRobbin first started working on the idea in 1982, and the dedication took place on June 7, 1987.

McGrath, NYS Assemblyman Jerry Kremer and Long Beach Supervisor Bruce Nyman.\nUpon its unveiling, the memorial received international recognition and was the subject of an Austrian Broadcasting Corporation’s documentary.\nA steel sculpture by artist Allen Bertoldi called \"Homage to Noguchi\" erected in 1979 was removed to make place for the Holocaust Monument. The sculpture was moved to Nassau County Museum of Art.\nDesign\nThe monument consists of an inverted pyramid made of highly polished black granite containing white etchings on each of its sides.

A Nazi SS guard stands in the background. Korczak is bearded and cradles a young child in his proper left arm as other children surround him and hold on to his coat.\nOn the base beneath this panel are the words: “To the sacred and Eternal Memory of the Million Jewish Children; who perished in the Holocaust”.\nAnother panel of the pyramid is an etching of the Burning bush with barbed wire across the fire. Commemorating the Extermination camp.\nOn the base beneath this panel are the words: “The Burning Bush which was not consumed”.\nThe third panel contains the names of Raoul Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler and Maximillian Kolbe.\nOn the base beneath this panel are the words: “Their Brother Keepers”.\nOn the lower base are five plaques.\nOn Plaque one: The erection of this monument, in large measure, was made possible through the generosity of Honorary Chairman Dr. NATAN CELNIK in memory of his beloved wife URSULA Resistance Fighters.\nOn Plaque two: This monument was proposed and erected by the HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COMMITTEE of LONG ISLAND Executive Committee: Stanley R.
