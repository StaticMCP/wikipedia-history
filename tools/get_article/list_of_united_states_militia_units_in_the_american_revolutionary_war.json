The history of militia in the United States dates from the colonial era. Based on the English system, colonial militias were drawn from the body of adult male citizens of a community, town, or local region. Because there was no standing English Army before the English Civil War, and subsequently the English Army and later the British Army had few regulars garrisoning North America, colonial militia served a vital role in local conflicts, particularly in the French and Indian Wars. Before shooting began in the American War of Independence, American revolutionaries took control of the militia system, reinvigorating training and excluding men with Loyalist inclinations. Regulation of the militia was codified by the Second Continental Congress with the Articles of Confederation. The revolutionaries also created a full-time regular army—the Continental Army—but because of manpower shortages the militia provided short-term support to the regulars in the field throughout the war.\nIn colonial era Anglo-American usage, militia service was distinguished from military service in that the latter was normally a commitment for a fixed period of time of at least a year, for a salary, whereas militia was only to meet a threat, or prepare to meet a threat, for periods of time expected to be short. Militia persons were normally expected to provide their own weapons, equipment, or supplies, although they may later be compensated for losses or expenditures.\nMany of the states continued to maintain their militia after the American Revolution until after the U.S. Civil  War.   Many of the state National Guards trace their roots to the militia from the American Revolution.\nThe lists below show the known militia units by state for the original colonies plus Vermont.\nConnecticut\nRevolutionary War units:\n*Governor's Guard:\n**1st Company Governor's Foot Guard, 1771\n**2nd Company Governor's Foot Guard, 1775\n** 1st Company Governor's Horse Guards, 1778\n* 2nd Connecticut Light Horse, 1777\n* 5th Connecticut Light Horse, 1776–79\n* Backus' Regiment of Light Horse, 1776\n* Skinner's Regiment of Light Horse, 1776\n* Starr's Regiment of Light Horse, 1779\n* Seymour's Regiment of Light Dragoons\n* 1st Battalion State Regiment, 1776–77\n* 1st Regiment of Militia, 1778–79\n* 2nd Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 3rd Regiment of Foot, 1775\n* 3rd Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 4th Regiment of Militia, 1775–76\n* 5th Regiment of Militia, 1775–76\n* 7th Regiment of Militia, 1775–76\n* 8th Regiment of Militia, 1775–76\n* 8th Regiment of Militia, 1780\n* 9th Regiment of Militia, 1776–81\n* 10th Regiment of Militia, 1776–77\n* 11th Regiment of Militia, 1774\n* 12th Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 13th Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 16th Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 18th Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 19th Regiment of Militia, 1774-83\n* 20th Regiment of Militia, 1779–81\n* 21st Regiment of Militia, 1778–81\n* 22nd Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* 25th Regiment of Militia, 1776–78\n* 33rd Regiment of Militia, 1775\n* Belding's Regiment, 1777\n* Bradley's Regiment, 1776–77\n* Burrell's Regiment, 1776–77\n* Canfield's Regiment of Militia, 1781\n* Chapman's Regiment of Militia, 1778\n* Chester's Regiment of Militia, 1776–77\n* Cook's Regiment of Militia, 1777\n* Douglas' Regiment of Levies, 1776\n* Douglas' Regiment, 1776\n* Elmore's Battalion, 1776–77\n* Ely's Regiment, 1777\n* Enos' Regiment, 1776–77\n* Gallup's Regiment, 1779\n* Gay's Regiment, 1776\n* Hooker's Regiment of Militia, 1777\n* Johnson's Regiment of Militia, 1778\n* Latimer's Regiment of Militia, 1777–78\n* Lewis' Regiment, 1776\n* Mason's Regiment of Militia, 1778\n* McClellan's Regiment, 1777–82\n* Mead's Regiment of Militia, 1779\n* Mott's Regiment of Militia, 1776\n* Newberry's Regiment, 1777\n* Parker's Company of Teamsters, 1778\n* Parson's Regiment, 1776\n* Parson's Regiment of Militia, 1777\n* Porter's Regiment, 1781\n* Sage's Regiment, 1776–77\n* Silliman's Regiment, 1776\n* Talcott's Regiment, 1776\n* Thompson's Company\n* Thompson's Regiment, 1777\n* Tyler's Regiment, 1777\n* Ward's Regiment, 1777\n* Waterbury's Regiment, 1776–78\n* Whiting's Regiment, 1777\n* Wells' Regiment of Militia, 1779\n* Wells' Regiment, 1780–81\nDelaware\nThe first militia in Delaware was formed when Swedish settlers took up arms to defend Fort Christina (which was at the time a Swedish settlement) against Dutch invaders. During the American Revolutionary War, Delaware raised several units of militia in support of the Patriot side of the war. In the War of 1812, all of the Delaware volunteer units saw combat at Lewes, where they comprised the majority of an American force that drove off a Royal Navy squadron seeking control of the Delaware River. Despite the federal government initially prohibiting volunteer units the Mexican–American War, a volunteer unit raised in Delaware would serve in the battles of Contreras, Cherubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec, losing so many men that the unit was nicknamed \"The Bloody 11th.\" During the American Civil War, Delaware would raise multiple units in support of the Union cause. During the Spanish–American War, the 1st Delaware Volunteer Infantry was mustered into federal service but not deployed abroad. With the passage of the Militia Act of 1903, all state militia units were folded into the National Guard of the United States, largely turning the state militias from a state-funded and controlled force to a reserve component of the federal military.\nRevolutionary War Units:\n* 1st Battalion, New Castle County, 1777\n* 2nd Regiment, New Castle County, 1778–81\n* 2nd Battalion of Militia, 1776\n* 2nd Regiment of Militia, 1780\n* 7th Regiment of Militia, 1782\n* Flying Camp Battalion, 1776\n* Kent County Militia\n* Latimer's Independent Company, 1776\nGeorgia\nThe Georgia Militia existed from 1733 to 1879. It was originally planned by General James Oglethorpe prior to the founding of the Province of Georgia, the British colony that would become the U.S. state of Georgia. One reason for the founding of the colony was to act as a buffer between the Spanish settlements in Florida and the British colonies to the north.\nRevolutionary War units:\n* Emanuel's Regiment of Militia, 1781–82\n* Georgia Hussars, 1736\n* Liberty Independent Troop, 1776\n* 1st Brigade Georgia Militia\n* 1st Regiment Georgia Militia, Light Horse Troop\nMaryland\n* First Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Smallwood's Annapolis, 1776\n* Second Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Annapolis, 1776\n* Third Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Annapolis, 1776\n* Fourth Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Baltimore, 1776\n* Fifth Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Nathaniel Ramsey's, Annapolis, 1776\n* Sixth Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Annapolis, 1776\n* Seventh Company of the First Battalion Of Maryland, Annapolis, 1776\n* Eighth Company of the First Battalion of Maryland, Samuel Smith's, Baltimore, 1776\n* Ninth Company of Light Infantry, Annapolis, 1776\n* First Independent Maryland Company, Charles and Calvert Counties, 1776\n* Second Independent Company, Somerset County (Gunby), 1776\n* Third Independent Maryland Company, Worcester County, 1776\n* Fourth Independent Maryland Company, Talbot County, 1776\n* Fifth Independent Maryland Company, St. Mary's County, 1776\n* Sixth Independent Company, Dorchester County (Thomas Woolford), 1776\n* Seventh Independent Company, Queen Anne's and Kent Counties, 1776\n* Gale's Independent Company of Artillery, 1779–80\n* Smith's Artillery, 2nd and 3rd Companies, 1783\n* 34th Battalion of Militia, 1776\n* 37th Battalion of Militia, 1777\n* Extraordinary Regiment, 1780\n* Flying Camp Regiment (Ewing's), 1776\n* Flying Camp Regiment (Griffith's), 1776\n* Flying Camp Regiment (Richardson's), 1776\n* Flying Camp Militia, Harford County (Capt.

Initially, the militia units were centered on the 35 counties that then existed in the Province of North Carolina.  The units fought against the British, Loyalists, and Cherokee Native Americans that aligned themselves with British forces.  The units included military district brigades established in 1776, county regiments, four battalions, and one independent corps of light horse. Four regiments were located in counties that became part of the Southwest Territory in 1790 and later Tennessee in 1796. The size of brigades could be up to a few thousand volunteers. Brigades were commanded by a brigadier general.   Regiments were commanded by a colonel and made up of a number of companies commanded by captains with about 50 men in each company.  During engagements, one or more companies of regiments may have been involved in actions and commanded by the regimental or brigade commander.  In 1778, Major General John Ashe was selected to command all North Carolina militia and State Troops.  Brigade commanders reported to him.  Separate from the North Carolina militia, the state provided 10 numbered regiments to the Continental Army that were referred to as the North Carolina Line.\nThe following are the North Carolina militia Brigades and Regiments, along with the dates established and disestablished.:\n* Edenton District Brigade, 1776–1783\n** 1st Regiment of North Carolina Militia, 1780-1780\n** 2nd Regiment of North Carolina Militia, 1780-1780\n** Bertie County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Camden County Regiment, 1777–1783\n** Chowan County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Currituck County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Gates County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Hertford County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Martin County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** 1st Pasquotank County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** 2nd Pasquotank County Regiment, 1775–1777\n** Perquimans County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Tyrrell County Regiment, 1775–1783\n* Halifax District Brigade, 1776–1783\n** 1st Battalion of Volunteers, 1776–1777\n** 2nd Battalion of Volunteers, 1776–1777\n** Bute County Regiment, 1775–1779\n** Edgecombe County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Franklin County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Halifax County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Martin County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Nash County Regiment, 1777–1783\n** Northampton County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Warren County Regiment, 1779–1783\n* Hillsborough District Brigade, 1776–1783\n** Caswell County Regiment, 1777–1783\n** Chatham County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Granville County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Mounted Volunteers Regiment, 1780-1780\n** Northern Orange County Regiment, 1776–1777\n** Orange County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Randolph County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Wake County Regiment, 1775–1783\n* New Bern District Brigade, 1776–1783\n** Beaufort County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Carteret County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Craven County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Dobbs County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Hyde County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Johnston County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Jones County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Pitt County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Wayne County Regiment, 1779–1783\n* Morgan District Brigade, 1782–1783\n** Davidson County Regiment, 1783-1783\n** Green County Regiment, 1783-1783\n* Salisbury District Brigade, 1776–1783\n** Anson County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Burke County Regiment, 1777–1782\n** Guilford County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Lincoln County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** 1st Mecklenburg County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** 2nd Mecklenburg County Regiment, 1779–1780\n**Polk's regiment of light dragoons, 1779–1780\n** Montgomery County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Richmond County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Rowan County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** 2nd Rowan County Regiment, 1775–1777, 1782–1783\n** Rutherford County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Sullivan County Regiment, 1779–1783\n** Surry County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Tryon County Regiment, 1775–1779\n** Washington District Regiment, 1776–1777\n** Washington County Regiment, 1777–1783\n** Wilkes County Regiment, 1777–1783\n* Wilmington District Brigade, 1776–1783\n** 1st Battalion of Militia, 1776-1776\n** 2nd Battalion of Militia, 1776-1776\n** Bladen County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Brunswick County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Cumberland County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Duplin County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** New Hanover County Regiment, 1775–1783\n** Onslow County Regiment, 1775–1783\n* Independent units\n**Independent corps of light horse, 1780\nPennsylvania\nOn November 25, 1755, the Pennsylvania Assembly passed the Militia Act of 1755. This measure 'legalized a military force from those who were willing and desirous of being united for military purposes within the province.' This was as a result of citizens' pleas for protection from the French and Indians on the western borders. Two years later, a compulsory militia law was also enacted. All males between 17 and 45 years of age, having a freehold worth 150 pounds a year, were to be organized into companies. Every enrolled militiaman was required to appear for training, arming himself, on the first Mondays of March, June, August, and November.\nRevolutionary War units:\n* Artillery Battalion, Pennsylvania
