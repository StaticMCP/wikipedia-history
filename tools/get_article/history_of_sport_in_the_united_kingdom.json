Some sports were only standardised during that time period, and had been played for centuries beforehand.\nAncient era\nA Roman-era stadium for gladiators was discovered in 2023 in Colchester, England.\nMedieval era\nModern era\n16th century\n17th century\nLeech has explained the role of Puritan power, the English Civil War, and the Restoration of the monarchy in England. The Long Parliament in 1642 \"banned theaters, which had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, it is not clear if cricket was in any way prohibited, except that players must not break the Sabbath\". In 1660, \"the Restoration of the monarchy in England was immediately followed by the reopening of the theaters, and so any sanctions that had been imposed by the Puritans on cricket would also have been lifted.\" He goes on to make the key point that political, social, and economic conditions in the aftermath of the Restoration encouraged excessive gambling, so much so, that a Gambling Act was deemed necessary in 1664. It is certain that cricket, horse racing, and boxing (i.e., prizefighting) were financed by gambling interests. Leech explains that it was the habit of cricket patrons, all of whom were gamblers, to form strong teams through the 18th century to represent their interests. He defines a strong team as one representative of more than one parish, and he is certain that such teams were first assembled in or immediately after 1660.\nPrior to the English Civil War and the Commonwealth, all available evidence concludes that cricket had evolved to the level of village cricket, where only teams that are strictly representative of individual parishes compete. The \"strong teams\" of the post-Restoration mark the evolution of cricket (and, indeed of professional team sport, for cricket is the oldest professional team sport) from the parish standard to the county standard. This was the point of origin for major, or first-class, cricket. The year 1660 also marks the origin of professional team sports.\nCricket\nurn, competed for between Australia and England in cricket]]\nCricket had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools.\nArmy units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada (see also: Cricket in South Asia). Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the first and most famous rivalry is that between Australia and England for \"The Ashes.\"\nPublic schools\nA number of the public schools such as Winchester and Eton, introduced variants of football and other sports for their pupils. These were described at the time as \"innocent and lawful\", certainly in comparison with the rougher rural games. With urbanization in the 19th century, the rural games moved to the new urban centers and came under the influence of the middle and upper classes. The rules and regulations devised at English institutions began to be applied to the wider game, with governing bodies in England being set up for a number of sports by the end of the 19th century.\nThe rising influence of the upper class also produced an emphasis on the amateur, and the spirit of \"fair play\". The industrial revolution also brought with it increasing mobility, and created the opportunity for universities in Britain and elsewhere to compete with one another. This sparked increasing attempts to unify and reconcile various games in England, leading to the establishment of the Football Association in London, the first official governing body in football.\nFor sports to become professionalized, coaching had to come first. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914.  In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.\nSports culture\nBritish Prime Minister John Major was the political leader most closely identified with promotion of sports. In 1995 he argued:\n: \"We invented the majority of the world's great sports.... 19th century Britain was the cradle of a leisure revolution every bit as significant as the agricultural and industrial revolutions we launched in the century before.\"\nThe British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival. This was chiefly due to the development of the railway network in the UK before other nations. Allowing for national newspapers, and travel around the country far earlier than in other places. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play.\nCricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. New games became popular almost overnight, including lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.\nMany modern Olympic sports trace their roots back to Britain, including sports that are not commonly considered particularly British sports today, such as table tennis and bobsleigh.\nBritish Empire\nVictorian era\nThe Victorians saw sport as a way to increase physical discipline and spiritual connection. Scholars of the time looking back at sporting culture in ancient Greece and elsewhere often reinterpreted the practices of those times to be more in line with Victorian efforts.\nContemporary era\nThe decline of the British Empire saw cricket, which had been the most popular British sport for centuries and which had become identified with the imperial vision, lose ground to football.\nSee also\n* History of sport in England\nReferences"
