The Ethiopians successfully raided the Ottoman positions and Kedawert Pasha was killed in the Battle.\nThe Emperor proceeded to have the city besieged until the Ottomans sued for peace by offering lavish gifts to his camp at Debarwa.\n=Background=\nHaving been forced to retreat after a failed invasion of the Ethiopian Empire in the previous decade, the Ottoman armies attempted to conquer Ethiopian territory once again after a reinforcement of 7000 troops arrived. However, they were routed by the Ethiopian Emperor Sarsa Dengel once again who forced them to retreat to the coast.\n=Raid=\nSarsa Dengel quickly follwed up his victory by launching a punitive expedition on the Ottoman fort at the coastal city of Arkiko. The retreating Ottomans attempted to confront the advancing Ethiopians on the hills overlooking the city of Arkiko. The Ethiopian raiders managed to inflict significant damage on the Ottoman army and kill its commander Kedawert Pasha as well as the Viceroy's Brothers.\nThe Ottomans quickly entered the city and held their positions.The Emperor's men then forced their way through the city's defensive fortifications and started firing at the Turks inside while the Turks responded. During the ensuing exchange, several Turks were wounded and their Commander fell to the ground being struck by a bullet, which further demoralized the defenders. Having been hastily mobilized, the Emperor's men had little food with them. This caused them to complain bitterly but the Emperor chose to pay them no heed.\nThe Ottomans were reinforced again by troops of Ali Garad, a local leader. He dispatched some his own troops to help the Turks, promising he would follow. However he reversed his decision and decided to stay back, pretending to be loyal to the Emperor. The suspicious Emperor charged him with aiding the Ottomans. After receiving his sworn testimony, Sarsa Dengel ordered a warrior named Atfer to execute him. Atfer then executed Ali by beheading him with a sword.\n=Aftermath=\nThe victorious Emperor returned to Debarwa in triumph where the Ottomans sent him lavish gifts as a peace offering. He accepted the offering and concluded peace with the Ottomans, marking the end of the three decade war. Akuba Mikael, a local warrior who had distinguished himself throughout the campaign, was awarded with the special title of \"Son of the King\". According to Haggai Erlich, the Ottomans soon realized that \"it is to costly to mess with\" Sarsa Dengel's Empire and abandoned their territorial ambitions.\nReferences"
