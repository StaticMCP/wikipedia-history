When the $100 Film Festival was born in 1992, it showcased eight short films on Super 8. The name sprung from the challenge to shoot a short film on four rolls of Super 8 – which tallied to the cost of $100. In following years, the festival dropped the budgetary limit and allowed 16 mm film, which shifted the focus from low budget to quality small-format films. Thus, the name was changed to the Artifact Small Format Film Festival in 2017 so as to better represent the festival's role as an international celebration of creative story telling on celluloid.\nOver the years, Artifact has expanded to include the popular Film/Music Explosion!, commission projects, and various partnerships.\nArtifact is one of only a handful of festivals worldwide that exhibit exclusively on small-format celluloid.\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20130414130321/http://csif.org/csif/ CSIF Official Website]\n*[http://www.artifactfilmfestival.com/ Artifact Small Format Film Festival Website]"
