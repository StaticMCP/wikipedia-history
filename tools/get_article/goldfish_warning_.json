      "text": "# Goldfish Warning!\n\nis a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Neko Nekobe which ran in Nakayoshi. A 54-episode anime television series aired on TV Asahi from January 12, 1991 through February 29, 1992. Each episode of the anime contained two 11-minute stories, often unconnected with each other. A short film was released in 1992. The anime was made into an anime comic format with six episodes per volume. The first volume was released on July 25, 1991.\nAfter the end of the series, most of the anime's staff moved on to Sailor Moon (which would succeed this series in its timeslot), including director Junichi Sato and music composer Takanori Arisawa. Many references to Goldfish Warning! are made in Sailor Moons first season.\nA complete DVD set of the series was released on March 24, 2005.\nPlot\nThe manga tells the story about 14-year-old girl named Chitose Fujinomiya, who was formerly rich girl, but is currently an orphan who was kicked out of her super-elite school, Tokai no Gakuen (City's Academy), and is shunned by her former friends. She is sent to a rural public school, Inaka no Chugakkō (Country's Jr. High School), where very needy, and even pigs, oxen and chickens are students.\nThe only possession Chitose has left is a pink goldfish named Gyopi, given to her by her beloved father, and is very valuable. Her family's attorney attempts to steal Gyopi, but is foiled by Chitose's new schoolmates, namely Wapiko, a simple girl who can outrun almost anything and is well-liked in school. As it turns out, Chitose isn't poor; the attorney was merely hiding her inheritance for himself. Instead of going back to the super rich school, she buys the rural school and attempts to transform it into a refined school to compete with that of her rival/former best friend, but the students of the rural school don't want to be refined.\nCharacters\nStudents\n;\n:\n:A very uptight girl with long blonde hair that is kept back with a hairband, Chitose is worried that the students of Shin-Inaka no Chugakko (Wapiko especially) will cause her newly-formed school to be worse than Tokai no Gakuen. She is very arrogant to the point where she is unable to escape from a burning building due to her belief that she was raised as a high-class girl, and that she is not as tough as all the country students of Shin-Inaka no Chugakko (who had all escaped from the building except Wapiko due to her trying to get Chitose to escape) as well as trying to frequently ban all normal customs of the school to enforce a more \"proper\" custom, such as a Tea Ceremony Club, but ultimately fails, due to her plans usually backfiring. She is the president of Shin-Inaka No Chugakko. Her nickname is \"Chi-chan\".\n;\n:\n:An eccentric pink-haired girl who wears a Sailor-fuku, the agile Wapiko may be viewed as the closest thing the series offers to a true heroine. Almost always depicted in a comical chibi art style, she nearly always has a smile on her face and a happy-go-lucky personality, despite often being a chief instigator of events that bring anguish to Chitose. For being a middle school student, Wapiko tends to act and think like a small child. Nevertheless, her super speed, bloodhound-like nose, winning spirit and bottomless appetite for fun have earned her the respect of the entire student body, minus Chitose. Despite Chitose owning Gyopi, she and the goldfish are quite close to each other.\n;\n:\n:Shūichi is Wapiko's classmate and the sub-president of Shin-Inaka no Chugakko, and is puzzled over Chitose's recklessness.
