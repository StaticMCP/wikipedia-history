This award was peculiar for the MTV Video Music Awards, though, for (like Best Artist Website in 1999) it did not reward music nor music videos. Instead, the category awarded musical artists who excelled in at least three other areas beside their music career, such as acting, entrepreneurship, and activism, among others. When the VMAs returned to their old format in 2008, though, this category did not come back.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year !! Winner !! Other nominees !!
