He was in private practice in Mount Pleasant, Iowa from 1887 to 1889, and after that in Bellingham, Washington Territory (State of Washington from November 11, 1889) starting in 1889. He was city attorney of Fairhaven, Washington from 1891 to 1892, and an assistant county attorney of Whatcom County, Washington from 1892 to 1893.\nFederal judicial service\nHoward received a recess appointment from President William Howard Taft on August 26, 1912, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington vacated by Judge Cornelius H. Hanford. He was nominated to the same position by President Taft on December 3, 1912. His service terminated on March 3, 1913, after his nomination was not confirmed by the United States Senate, which never held a vote on his nomination.\nLater career and death\nHoward resumed private practice in Bellingham. He died on February 23, 1937.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n|years=1912–1913}}"
