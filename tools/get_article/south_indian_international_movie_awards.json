It was launched in 2012 by Vishnu Vardhan Induri and Brinda Prasad Adusimilli to appreciate and honour film makers from across the South Indian film industries: Telugu cinema, Tamil cinema, Malayalam cinema, and Kannada cinema, and provide a platform to promote South Indian films in international markets.\nHistory\nThe ceremony was instituted in 2012 by Vishnu Vardhan Induri, the founder of Celebrity Cricket League. Adusumilli Brinda Prasad is the chairperson of SIIMA. The awards are presented in separate parts on two different days. On the first day the most promising upcoming South Indian film artistes are honoured at the Generation Next Awards, while the second day is reserved for the main SIIMA Awards. The award nominees are selected by a jury of senior artistes and professionals and voted for by public polling.\nThe first SIIMA ceremony was held on 2122 June 2012 at the Dubai World Trade Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Unlike other South Indian film awards, SIIMA holds its ceremony abroad. However, in 2021, SIIMA was conducted in Hyderabad, India owing to the travel restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nSIIMA Short Film Awards were announced in 2017 to recognise makers and actors of short films. In September 2017, a twitter emoji was released on the platform. Invenio Origin joined as the strategic partner in January 2024, with significant stake in SIIMA  and CCL, to scale-up these formats, and to launch OTT Streaming Academy Awards  through, a new media IP called Indian National Cine Academy (INCA).\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!
