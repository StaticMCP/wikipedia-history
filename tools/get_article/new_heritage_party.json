Founded in 2001 as the Heritage Party it was shut down after the 2011 elections, but was revived by Chishala Kateka in 2020 as the New Heritage Party.\nHistory\nThe party was formed in 2001 by Godfrey Miyanda after he left the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy over President Frederick Chiluba's plans to run for a third term in office. In the December 2001 general elections Miyanda stood as the party's presidential candidate, finishing fifth in a field of eleven candidates with 8% of the vote. The party also received 8% of the vote in the National Assembly elections, winning four seats.\nIn the 2006 elections Miyanda was the party's presidential candidate again, but saw his vote share fall to 1.6%; in the National Assembly elections the party's vote share was reduced to 1.3% and it lost all four seats. Miyanda stood for president again in 2008, but received less than 0.8% of the vote, finishing last amongst the four candidates.\nThe 2011 general elections saw Miyanda's share of the presidential vote reduced to 0.2%, whilst the party received just 485 votes in the National Assembly elections (0.02%). Miyanda ran for a fifth time in the 2015 presidential elections, finishing eighth in a field of eleven candidates with 0.3% of the vote.\nIn 2020, Chishala Kateka, founding member and chairperson of the finance committee for the original Heritage Party, revived the party as the New Heritage Party in her bid for the presidency. She said that the new party had gone beyond the old Heritage manifesto, and had their own.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n|2001\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Godfrey Miyanda\n|140,678\n|8.09%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2006\n|42,891\n|1.57%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2008\n|13,683\n|0.76%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2011\n|4,730\n|0.17%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2015\n|5,757\n|0.34%\n|Lost\n|-\n|2016\n| colspan=\"4\" |Did not take part\n|-\n|2021\n|Chishala Kateka\n|8,169\n|0.17%\n|Lost\n|}\nNational Assembly elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Outcome\n|-\n|2001\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Godfrey Miyanda\n|132,311\n|7.55%\n|}}\n| 4\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|34,872\n|1.29%\n|}}\n| 4\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|485\n|0.02%\n|}}\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|colspan=\"6\" |Did not take part\n|-\n|2021\n|Chishala Kateka\n|1,762\n|0.04%\n|}}\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
