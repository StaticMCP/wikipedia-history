Quintos from a screenplay written by Ricky Lee, Mel Mendoza-Del Rosario, and Benjou Elgincolin, which was adapted from an original story written by Olivia M. Lamasan. The film stars Christopher de Leon, Aga Muhlach and Chin Chin Gutierrez, with a supporting cast including Kier Legaspi, Amy Austria, Robert Arevalo, and Karl Angelo Legaspi.\nProduced and distributed by Star Cinema, the film was theatrically released on March 7, 1996. In 2017, it was digitally restored and remastered by ABS-CBN Film Restoration, in partnership with Central Digital Lab. A streaming series that serves as a follow-up to the film, Cattleya Killer, was released on June 1, 2023.\nPlot\nGene Rivera, a director for television commercials, also operates as a serial killer known as \"The Cattleya Killer\", whose modus operandi involves seducing married women before murdering them and leaving a cattleya flower near their corpses.\nNational Bureau of Investigation agent Joven dela Rosa investigates the murders along with his partner Dino. His focus on the investigation alienates his wife Camille and their son Benjie, who suffers from nyctophobia. Gene brings his latest victim, Erlinda, to their family's private resort; his uncle Rolando follows after learning about the trip. After a sexual encounter with Erlinda, Gene attacks her with a baseball bat. Rolando learns of what happened but is dissuaded from informing the authorities by Gene, and they carefully clean the house before hiding Erlinda's body. Following the leads, Joven and Dino arrive at the resort, and Gene hides before a shootout erupts, leading to Joven fatally shooting Rolando. Following the incident, Gene swears vengeance against Joven. Meanwhile, Erlinda manages to survive her injuries but is prevented from talking to Joven and Dino by her uncooperative husband.\nWhile waiting for Benjie at school, Gene befriends Camille, and the two develop mutual feelings for each other. Gene then acquaints himself with Joven under a different persona. Gene invites Camille to his house and tells her about his past: as a child, he was often locked up by his mother for making mistakes, including the time he accidentally broke a vase holding a cattleya. One night, he witnessed his father kill his mother for having an affair before killing himself. Gene then confesses his love for Camille, who refuses to go any further and is raped by Gene. Camille hides the truth from Joven, telling him that someone drugged her. Camille later receives a videotape by Gene recording his sexual advances, then gets a phone call from him saying he has her wedding ring before threatening to expose her infidelity to Joven.\nJoven and Gene talk to each other about Camille; Gene asks what Joven would do if he learned his wife is having an affair, and states that he would kill her when Joven returns the question. Joven learns about Camille's affair, and Gene threatens Camille and orders her to go to his house. When Gene gives him a gun with an icon of a cattleya, Joven decides to visit Erlinda at the hospital, along with Dino. At Gene's house, Camille sees pictures of different women, including her, as well as different wedding rings, and realizes that he is the Cattleya Killer. Gene tries to kill Camille, who manages to escape, but she is recaptured along with Benjie. At the hospital, Joven and Dino realize that Gene is the killer after Erlinda reacts violently to a picture of him.\nJoven and Dino go to Gene's house and find the wedding rings of his victims, including Camille's, which shocks him. He then rushes home, where he sees Gene and Camille's sex tape. He is then told by Gene to go to his ancestral house, where Camille and Benjie are being held. There, Gene explains that the murders are revenge for the infidelity of married women and Rolando's death. Joven and Dino fight with Gene, who shoots Dino before holding Benjie at gunpoint. Gene then tells Joven to kill Camille, or he will kill Benjie. Joven fires at Camille's mirror reflection before fatally shooting a distracted Gene.\nJoven assures Benjie that he has nothing to fear, then announces his plans to spend more time with his family. He then puts Camille's wedding on her finger, and they share an embrace.\nCast\nMain cast\n* Christopher de Leon as Joven dela Rosa: An agent of the NBI who is assigned to track the trail of the serial killer named Gene Rivera.
