El Argar also developed sophisticated pottery and ceramic techniques, which they traded with other Mediterranean tribes.\nThe civilization of El Argar extended to all the current-day Spanish province of Almería, north onto the central Meseta, to most of the region of Murcia and westward into the provinces of Granada and Jaén, controlling an area similar in size to modern Belgium.\nIts cultural and possibly political influence was much wider. Its influence has been found in eastern and southwestern Iberia (Algarve), and it likely affected other regions as well.\nSome authors have suggested that El Argar was a unified state.\nThe center of this civilization is displaced to the north and its extension and influence is clearly greater than that of its ancestor.  Their mining and metallurgy were quite advanced, with bronze, silver and gold being mined and worked for weapons and jewelry.\nPollen analysis in a peat deposit in the Cañada del Gitano basin high in the Sierra de Baza suggests that the Argaric exhausted precious natural resources, helping bring about its own ruin. The deciduous oak forest that covered the region's slopes were burned off, leaving a tell-tale carbon layer, and replaced by the fire-tolerant, and fire-prone, Mediterranean scrub familiar under the names garrigue and maquis.\nExtension\nMain Argaric towns\nfortified town.]]\n*El Argar: irregularly shaped (280 x 90 m).\n*Fuente Vermeja: small fortified site, 3&nbsp;km north of El Argar\n*Lugarico Viejo: larger town very close to Fuente Vermeja.\n*La Bastida de Totana: larger fortified site.\n.]]\n*La Almoloya (Pliego, Murcia): in the top of a plateau.\n*Puntarrón Chico: in the top of a small hill, near Beniaján (Murcia)\n*Ifre (Murcia): on a rocky elevation.\n*Zapata (Murcia): 4&nbsp;km. west of Ifre, fortified.\n*Cabezo Redondo (Villena, Alicante): one of the biggest settlements, on a rocky elevation next to an old lagoon and salt evaporation pond.\n*Gatas (4&nbsp;km west of Mojácar, Almería): fortified town on a hill with remarkable water canalizations.\n*El Oficio (9&nbsp;km north of Villaricos, Almería): atop of a well defended hill, strongly fortified, especially towards the sea.\n*Cerro de las Viñas, Coy, Spain\n*Fuente Álamo (7&nbsp;km north of Cuevas de Almazora, Almería): the citadel is atop a hill, while the houses are terraced in its southern slope.\n*Almizaraque (Almería): a town dating to Los Millares civilization.\n*Cerro de la Virgen de Orce (Granada).\n*Cerro de la Encina (Monachil, Granada).\n*Cuesta del Negro (Purullena, Granada).\n*El Castellón Alto\nMaterial culture\n, c. 1600 BC.|199x199px]]\nGlass beads\nA meaningful element are the glass beads (of blue, green and white colors) that are found in this culture and which have been related with similar findings in Egypt (Amarna), Mycenaean Greece (dated in the 14th century BC), the British Wessex culture (dated c. 1400 BC) and some sites in France.  Nevertheless, some of these beads are already found in Chalcolithic contexts (site of La Pastora) which has brought some to speculate on an earlier date for the introduction of this material in southeast Iberia (late 3rd millennium BC).\nOther manufactured goods\nPottery undergoes important changes, almost totally abandoning decoration and with new types.\nTextile manufacture seems important, working specially with wool and flax. Basket-making also seems to have been important, showing greater extent and diversification than in previous periods.\nFunerary customs\nThe collective burial tradition typical of European Megalithic culture is abandoned in favor of individual burials. The tholos is abandoned in favour of small cists, either under the homes or outside.  This trend seems to come from the Eastern Mediterranean, most likely from Mycenaean Greece (skipping Sicily and Italy, where the collective burial tradition remains for some time yet).\nFrom the Argarian civilization, these new burial customs will gradually and irregularly extend to the rest of Iberia.\nIn the phase B of this civilization, burial in pithoi (large jars) becomes most frequent (see: Jar-burials). Again this custom (that never reached beyond the Argarian circle) seems to come from Greece, where it was used after. ca 2000 BC.\nGenetic profile\nOut of 36 males tested from La Almoloya and La Bastida sites, 35 were assigned to haplogroup R1b-M269 (the exact phylogenetic position on the Y haplogroup tree could be resolved further in 14 males, who carry the derived variant at Y-SNP P312, and the derived subvariant Y-SNP Z195 in 18 males), only an individual was from another clade, E1b-L618. The Argar Culture was likely formed from a mixture of new groups arriving from north-central Iberia (which already carried the predominant Y-chromosome lineage and central European steppe-related ancestry) and local southeastern Iberian Copper Age groups that differed from other Iberian regions in that they carried an Iran Neolithic-like ancestry (similar to that found in eastern and/or central Mediterranean ancient groups). The major additional ancestry source resembled central European Bell Beaker groups, which first contributed ancestry to northern Iberia, followed by a southward spread. The distal sources were ~60% Anatolian farmer, ~25% Western Hunter-Gatherer, ~15% Yamnaya. Some phenotypìc traits were: absolute majority of brown eyes, pale skin was majoritary, and brown hair was more usual than black hair.\nPeriodization\nThe culture of El Argar has traditionally been divided in two phases, named A and B.\nEl Argar A\nPhase A started in the 18th century BC, with the earliest calibrated C-14 dates pointing to the first half of that century:\n* 1785 BC (+/- 55 years) in the transitional Late Chalcolithic-Early Bronze of , a peripheral site\n* 1730 BC (+/- 70 years) in Fuente Álamo for El Argar A2, with six undated A1 layers under it\n* 1700 BC in  (another peripheral site) with identifiably Argarian materials in its lower layer\nEl Argar B\nPhase B begins in the sixteenth century BC. The main C-14 date is that of 1550 BC (+/- 70 years) in Fuente Álamo for the upper layer of El Argar B2 (with four layers underneath the lowest B phase). Other stratigraphic dates are somewhat more recent, but are not confirmed by C-14.\nPost-Argarian phase\nEl Argar B ends in the fourteenth or thirteenth century BC, giving way to a less homogeneous post-Argarian culture. Again, Fuente Álamo gives the best C-14 dating with 1330 BC (+/- 70 years).\nRecent trends\nMany more C-14 dates have been published since the beginning of the twenty-first century. In recent publications, at least 260 such dates are cited altogether. There is now a widespread consensus that the emergence of El Argar can be dated at 2200 cal BC, although its end remains somewhat disputed. Various opinions place the end of El Argar at 15th-14th centuries BC.\nEconomy\nRecent research suggests a link between drought and the cereals grown. In general, the cultivation of barley increased in the south of the Iberian Peninsula during the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, while the cultivation of wheat, which was initially dominant, decreased. Significant changes are associated with dry periods. However, during the very dry period between 1900 and 1600 BC, an increase in free-threshing wheat can be observed. This may be due to the fact that people in the neighbouring Motillas were already using groundwater to grow wheat. Through exchange, this grain also reached the settlements of the El-Argar culture.\nSilver was also exploited. Gold had been abundantly used in the Chalcolithic period, but it became less common in El Argar culture. Discovery in 2014 of an especially rich grave and an associated building at La Almoloya have provided important details about the culture. The archaeological site is in a southeastern portion of the Iberian Peninsula. The richness of the burials of its women has led to some re-evaluation of the place of women in this Early Bronze Age culture.\nGallery\nFile:El Argar (ajuar funerario).png|Grave goods\nFile:Enterramiento argárico en tinaja.jpg|Typical jar burialEl Argar B\nFile:El Argar (craneo con diadema).png|Woman's skullwith diadem\nFile:Espada de Guadalajara.
