The result was a victory for the English over the MacPhillips' and Burkes. The conflict was a part of the political and military struggle, involving the English and occasionally the Scots, for control of northern Ireland.\nArdnaree is the anglicised version of Árd na Ríogh, which can be translated as meaning 'Height of the Kings' or 'Hill of the Kings'.\nThe Mac Philbins and Mayo Burkes had risen in revolt against English rule in Ireland. An Irish-Scottish mercenary army, led by Donnell Gorm MacDonnell of Carey and Alexander Carragh MacDonnell of Glenarm, sons of the deceased James MacDonald, 6th of Dunnyveg, were invited into Connacht by the Burkes to attack English settlements and forces. The mercenary army was fronted at Sligo, Coolony and Ballingafad by English forces for over fourteen days.\nSir Richard Bingham, the Governor of Connacht, followed the mercenary force to Ardnaree, where the mercenary force had camped on the east (right) bank of the River Moy. Bingham's forces surrounded the camp at night and attacked the occupants. During the battle, 1,000 mercenaries were killed, including Donnell Gorm MacDonnell of Carey and Alexander Carragh MacDonnell of Glenarm. Also slaughtered were some 1,000 men, women and children in the camp.\nSir Richard Bingham went on to hang the leaders of the Burkes, with the former lands of Mac Philbins and Mayo Burkes given to English settlers.\nSee also\n* List of Irish battles\nNotes\nSources\n* The Oxford Companion to Irish History\n*\nReferences"
