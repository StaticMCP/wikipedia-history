In response, planning for a new high school began shortly after Battle Creek Elementary and Middle Schools opened. An official funding proposal for a new high school was unveiled in March 2021. In February 2022, the Maury County School Board voted to name the new school Battle Creek High School. Battle Creek High School opened on August 5, 2024, serving grades 9 and 10, with plans to become a 9–12 school for the 2026–27 school year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
