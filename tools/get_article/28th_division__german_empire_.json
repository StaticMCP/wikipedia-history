It was formed in Karlsruhe on 1 July 1871.  The division was subordinated in peacetime to the XIV Army Corps (XIV. Armeekorps).  The 28th Division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nThe division, along with the other division of the XIV Army Corps, the 29th Division, was formed in the Grand Duchy of Baden, a member state of the German Empire.  Both divisions grew out of the Grand Ducal Baden Division (Großherzoglich Badische Division), the army of the grand duchy.  The Grand Ducal Baden Division had fought against Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War, but after Prussia's victory Baden and most other German states had entered into conventions subordinating their armies to Prussia's.\nThe Grand Ducal Baden Division served in the Franco-Prussian War against France in 1870-71, where its regiments saw action in the Siege of Strasbourg and the Battle of the Lisaine.\nIn peacetime, the 28th Division was stationed in northern Baden (the 29th covered southern Baden), with garrisons in Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Heidelberg and Rastatt, among other cities.\nIn World War I, the division served primarily on the Western Front, seeing action at the Battle of the Frontiers and then moving north during the Race to the Sea.  It participated in some of the most well-known battles and campaigns of the Western Front, including the 1916 Battle of the Somme, the later phases of the Battle of Verdun, the tank battle of Cambrai in 1917, the German spring offensive of 1918, the Third Battle of the Aisne, the Battle of Belleau Wood, the Second Battle of the Marne and the Battle of Soissons.  When the Armistice took effect, the division was occupying defensive positions on the right bank of the Meuse, in the northern part of the Argonne Forest.\nPre-World War I organization\n* '55th Infantry Brigade (55.

Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from their higher headquarters.  The 28th Division was renamed the 28th Infantry Division. Its initial wartime organization (major units) was as follows:\n* '55th Infantry Brigade (55. Infanterie-Brigade) '\n** 109th Baden Life Grenadier Regiment (Badisches Leib-Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 109)\n** 110th Baden Grenadier Regiment \"Kaiser Wilhelm I\" (2.

During the war, most divisions became triangular - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a \"square division\"). An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, and the engineer contingent was increased. The 28th Infantry Division's order of battle on 26 May 1918 was as follows:\n* '55th Infantry Brigade (55. Infanterie-Brigade) '\n** 40th Fusilier Regiment \"Prince Karl-Anton von Hohenzollern\" (Füsilier-Regiment Fürst Karl-Anton von Hohenzollern (Hohenzollernsches) Nr. 40)\n** 109th Baden Life Grenadier Regiment (Badisches Leib-Grenadier-Regiment Nr. 109)\n** 110th Baden Grenadier Regiment \"Kaiser Wilhelm I\" (2.
