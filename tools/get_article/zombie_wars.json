It is, however, a terrible film in that the script is bad, the direction is lackluster, the acting is marginal and the premise, which has hints of Planet of the Apes, is laughable in its execution.\"\nPeter Dendle wrote that the film is \"conceptually ambitious\" but dragged down by its poor writing, acting, and production values.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n* Dendle, Peter (2012).
