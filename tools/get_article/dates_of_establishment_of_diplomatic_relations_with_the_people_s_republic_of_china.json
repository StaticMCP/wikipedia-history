Throughout the Cold War, both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all China and allowed countries to recognize either one or the other. Until the 1970s, most Western countries in the Western Bloc recognized the ROC while the Eastern Bloc and Third World countries generally recognized the PRC. This gradually shifted and today only  while the PRC is recognized by the United Nations, as well as 181 UN member states (including 18 G20 member states), Cook Islands, Niue and the State of Palestine. Both the ROC and the PRC maintain the requirement of recognizing its view of the One China policy to establish or maintain diplomatic relations.\nRecognition of the PRC before it was seated at the UN\n1949\nThe PRC was established on 1 October 1949, when the Chinese Civil War was still underway, and the seat of Government of the Republic of China in Canton was not relocated to Taipei until December 1949. All the countries that recognized the new PRC government in 1949 were communist states.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|2 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|4 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|5 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|6 October 1949\n|-\n| Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)\n|6 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|6 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|7 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|16 October 1949\n|-\n| (East Germany)\n|27 October 1949\n|-\n|\n|23 November 1949\n|}\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n| width=\"300\" |\n| width=\"150\" |6 January 1950\n|-\n| (North Vietnam)\n|18 January 1950\n|-\n|\n|1 April 1950\n|-\n|\n|13 April 1950\n|-\n|\n|9 May 1950\n|-\n|\n|11 May 1950\n|-\n|\n|8 June 1950\n|-\n|\n|14 September 1950\n|-\n|\n|14 September 1950\n|-\n|\n|28 October 1950\n|-\n|\n|21 May 1951\n|-\n|\n|5 October 1954\n|-\n|\n|2 January 1955\n|-\n|\n|20 January 1955\n|-\n|\n|1 August 1955\n|-\n|\n|30 May 1956\n|-\n|\n|1 August 1956\n|-\n| (North Yemen)\n|24 September 1956\n|-\n|\n|7 February 1957\n|-\n|\n|19 July 1958\n|-\n|\n|25 August 1958\n|-\n|\n|1 November 1958\n|-\n| Republic of Algeria\n|20 December 1958\n|-\n|\n|4 February 1959\n|-\n|\n|4 October 1959\n|}\n1960s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|5 July 1960\n|-\n|\n|28 September 1960\n|-\n|\n|25 October 1960\n|-\n| Somali Republic\n|14 December 1960\n|-\n| Free Republic of the Congo\n|20 February 1961\n|-\n|\n|25 April 1961\n|-\n|\n|9 December 1961\n|-\n|\n|18 October 1962\n|-\n|\n|11 December 1963\n|-\n|\n|14 December 1963\n|-\n|\n|21 December 1963\n|-\n|\n|10 January 1964\n|-\n|\n|27 January 1964\n|-\n|\n|22 February 1964\n|-\n|\n|29 September 1964\n|-\n|\n|29 October 1964\n|-\n|\n|12 November 1964\n|-\n|\n|19 July 1965\n|-\n| (South Yemen)\n|31 January 1968\n|-\n|\n|14 June 1969\n|}\n1970s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|13 October 1970\n|-\n|\n|15 October 1970\n|-\n|\n|6 November 1970\n|-\n|\n|24 November 1970\n|-\n|\n|15 December 1970\n|-\n|\n|10 February 1971\n|-\n|\n|22 March 1971\n|-\n|\n|26 March 1971\n|-\n|\n|6 May 1971\n|-\n|\n|28 May 1971\n|-\n|\n|29 July 1971\n|-\n|\n|4 August 1971\n|-\n|\n|16 August 1971\n|}\nRecognition of the PRC after it was seated at the UN\nThe Republic of China, which had occupied China's seat at the United Nations since 1945, was effectively expelled on 25 October 1971, through Resolution 2758 approved in the general assembly of said date. Its seat was taken over by the People's Republic of China from 15 November 1971, and the migration of relations to the PRC soon followed among members of the Western Bloc, except for the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy and the Scandinavian Countries which had previously established diplomatic relations.\n1970s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|25 October 1971\n|-\n|\n|2 November 1971\n|-\n|\n|9 November 1971\n|-\n|\n|12 November 1971\n|-\n|\n|7 December 1971\n|-\n|\n|8 December 1971\n|-\n|\n|14 December 1971\n|-\n|\n|31 January 1972\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1972\n|-\n|\n|19 February 1972\n|-\n|\n|13 March 1972\n|-\n|\n|15 April 1972\n|-\n|\n|18 May 1972\n|-\n|\n|5 June 1972\n|-\n|\n|27 June 1972\n|-\n|\n|19 September 1972\n|-\n|\n|29 September 1972\n|-\n| (West Germany)\n|11 October 1972\n|-\n|\n|14 October 1972\n|-\n| Malagasy Republic\n|6 November 1972\n|-\n|\n|16 November 1972\n|-\n|\n|21 November 1972\n|-\n|\n| 24 November 1972\n|-\n|\n|28 November 1972\n|-\n|\n|21 December 1972\n|-\n|\n|22 December 1972\n|-\n|\n|9 March 1973\n|-\n|\n|15 September 1973\n|-\n|\n|15 March 1974\n|-\n|\n|20 April 1974\n|-\n|\n|31 May 1974\n|-\n|\n|20 June 1974\n|-\n|\n|28 June 1974\n|-\n|\n|20 July 1974\n|-\n|\n|15 August 1974\n|-\n|\n|14 December 1974\n|-\n|\n|6 January 1975\n|-\n| European Economic Community\n|6 May 1975\n|-\n|\n|9 June 1975\n|-\n|\n|25 June 1975\n|-\n|\n|1 July 1975\n|-\n|\n|12 July 1975\n|-\n|\n|4 October 1975\n|-\n|\n|5 November 1975\n|-\n|\n|6 November 1975\n|-\n|\n|13 November 1975\n|-\n|\n|25 April 1976\n|-\n|\n|28 May 1976\n|-\n|\n|30 June 1976\n|-\n|\n|12 October 1976\n|-\n|\n|17 February 1977\n|-\n|\n|7 April 1977\n|-\n|\n|30 May 1977\n|-\n|\n|25 May 1978\n|-\n|\n|9 August 1978\n|-\n|\n|1 January 1979\n|-\n|\n|8 January 1979\n|-\n|\n|8 February 1979\n|-\n|\n|22 June 1979\n|}\n1980s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|2 January 1980\n|-\n|\n|7 February 1980\n|-\n|\n|18 April 1980\n|-\n|\n|25 June 1980\n|-\n|\n|26 March 1982\n|-\n|\n|1 January 1983\n|-\n|\n|12 January 1983\n|-\n|\n|2 March 1983\n|-\n|\n|30 April 1983\n|-\n|\n|1 November 1984\n|-\n|\n|9 July 1985\n|-\n|\n|1 October 1985\n|-\n|\n|7 December 1985\n|-\n|'\n|6 February 1987\n|-\n|\n|3 February 1988\n|-\n|\n|9 July 1988\n|-\n|\n|20 November 1988\n|-\n|\n|18 April 1989\n|-\n|\n|11 September 1989\n|}\n1990s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|22 March 1990\n|-\n||\n|21 July 1990\n|-\n|\n|3 October 1990\n|-\n|'\n|16 November 1990\n|-\n|\n|11 September 1991\n|-\n|\n|12 September 1991\n|-\n|\n|14 September 1991\n|-\n|\n|30 September 1991\n|-\n|\n|2 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|3 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|4 January 1992\n|-\n|}}\n|4 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|5 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|6 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|20 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|24 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|30 January 1992\n|-\n|\n|2 April 1992\n|-\n|\n|6 April 1992\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|12 May 1992\n|-\n|\n|13 May 1992\n|-\n|\n|9 June 1992\n|-\n| Republic of Korea (South Korea)\n|24 August 1992\n|-\n|\n|24 May 1993\n|-\n|\n|12 October 1993\n|-\n|\n|29 June 1994\n|-\n|\n|16 January 1995\n|-\n|\n|3 April 1995\n|-\n|\n|23 May 1997\n|-\n|\n|25 July 1997\n|-\n|\n|1 September 1997\n|-\n| Diplomatic relations were severed by the PRC on 31 May 2005 after Nauru resumed diplomatic ties with the ROC on 14 May 2005.}}\n|21 July 2002\n|-\n|\n|31 March 2004\n|-\n|\n|6 July 2006\n|-\n|\n|1 June 2007\n|-\n|\n|12 December 2007\n|-\n|\n|28 December 2007\n|}\n2010s\n{| class=\"wikitable \" border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|9 July 2011\n|-\n|\n|13 June 2017\n|-\n|\n|1 May 2018\n|-\n|\n|21 August 2018\n|-\n|\n|21 September 2019\n|}\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable \" border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!width=300|Country\n!width=150|Date\n|-\n|\n|26 March 2023\n|}\nSee also\n; PRC\n* Foreign relations of China\n; ROC\n* Foreign relations of Taiwan\n* Timeline of diplomatic relations of the Republic of China\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences"
