The lab uses advanced digital technologies to explore, document, and reframe archaeological and heritage sites at the intersection of anthropology, architecture, digital design, and heritage studies.\nOverview\nLIAVH works to create generative models for knowledge production and sharing using advanced data analysis to reveal archaeological narratives rooted in community oriented, anti-colonial, anti-racist, and feminist methodologies.\nThe lab specializes in merging digital tools with field-based and archival research, employing technologies such as:\n* 3D modeling\n* Mapping and digital reconstruction of archeological sites\n* GIS and spatial analysis\n* Virtual reality (VR) applications\n* Exhibitions and immersive heritage experiences\nThe lab is sensitive to the cultural, political, and ethical dimensions of how the past is visualized and represented through technology and actively works in the service of decolonization.\nM-Lab\nMohenjo-Daro is a UNESCO World Heritage Site dating to the third millennium BCE in present-day Pakistan. Over the past century, the site has been extensively documented through photographs, drawings, maps, and writings, however, many aspects of the ancient city remain unresolved, including a clear stratigraphic record grounded in archaeological evidence.\nLIAVH’s M-Lab research project integrates multidimensional archaeological data with high-resolution 3D site models.The initiative aims to develop tools and methodologies for more effective analysis, interpretation, and representation of complex archaeological datasets, with the goal of uncovering new insights into ancient urban environments.\nKey components of of the M-Lab project include:\n* Non-invasive Archaeological Survey\n* Rich contextual data\n* Spatial temporal analytics\n* Rich contextual data\n* Capacity building\n* International collaboration\n* Open source education and research tools\nReferences"
