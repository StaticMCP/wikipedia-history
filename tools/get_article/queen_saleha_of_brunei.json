She is the daughter of Pengiran Anak Mohamed Alam and Pengiran Anak Besar. After her husband was crowned as the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei, she succeeded her mother-in-law, Pengiran Anak Damit, as Raja Isteri (queen consort). She is the mother of Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah.\nEarly life and education\nPengiran Anak Saleha was born at Kampong Sumbiling, Jalan Istana Darussalam in Brunei Town (now Bandar Seri Begawan), Brunei on 7 October 1946. She is the eldest daughter of Pengiran Pemancha Pengiran Anak Haji Mohamed Alam and Pengiran Anak Besar.\nIn an interview, Abdul Ghani bin Jamil disclosed that Prince Hassanal Bolkiah, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, Princess Masna Bolkiah, Princess Nor'ain, Pengiran Anak Saleha, Pengiran Muda Abdul Rahman, Pengiran Anak Yusof, Pengiran Anak Puteh, Pengiran Anak Ja'afar, and Pengiran Muda Apong were students at the Istana Darul Hana Surau. She traveled to London to finish her studies, and attended the Raja Isteri Girls' High School (STPRI) in Brunei Town until 1965. She also studied at the Cygnets School, and improved her English language skills, while her husband and his brother, Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, were at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.\nMarriage and family life\nAt age 19 on 29 July 1965, Saleha married her paternal first cousin, Pengiran Muda Mahkota (Crown Prince) Hassanal Bolkiah, who later became the 29th Sultan of Brunei, at Istana Darul Hana. The sultan's mother Raja Isteri (Queen Consort) Pengiran Anak Damit and Saleha's father Pengiran Anak Mohamed Alam were siblings. The pair has seven girls and five boys together. She lives together with her children at Istana Nurul Iman.\nSaleha had to step aside after her husband married Dayang Hajjah Mariam in 1981, who then accompanied the monarch on most formal occasions and travels. One such instance occurred in October 1984, when he traveled to Oman, Egypt, and Jordan on official business before spending Christmas and New Year's Eve in London. Despite speculation that the sultan might name Dayang Hajjah Mariam's son, Prince Abdul Azim, as crown prince, Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, Saleha's son, was declared the crown prince on 10 August 1998. The situation changed further when the sultan divorced Dayang Hajjah Mariam on 2 February 2003.\nSocial contributions\nSaleha serves as the patron of several organisations, such as the Brunei Darussalam Women's Council, Brunei Shell Women Association (PWBS), the Women Graduates' Association (PSW), the Women's Institute (WI), PERTIWI, PEKERTI, the Girl Guides Association of Brunei Darussalam, the Brunei Government Senior Officers Wives Welfare Association (BISTARI).\nHobbies and interests\nSaleha has a fish pond, a bird park, and a fruit garden because she enjoys the outdoors. Reading is one of her pastimes, in addition to playing traditional Bruneian games like pasang and congkak in addition to badminton.\nTitles and honours\nFull title\nSaleha's full title is: \"Her Majesty Duli Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha binti Al-Marhum Pengiran Pemancha Pengiran Anak Haji Mohamed Alam.\"\nHonours\nShe has been awarded:\nNational\n*  Royal Family Order of the Crown of Brunei (DKMB; 15 August 1982)\n*  Family Order of Laila Utama First Class (DK)\n*  Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Medal (PHBS; 1 August 1968)\n*  Sultan of Brunei Silver Jubilee Medal (5 October 1992)\n*  Sultan of Brunei Golden Jubilee Medal (5 October 2017)\n*  Proclamation of Independence Medal (1 January 1984)\nForeign\n* :\n**  1st Class of the Bintang Mahaputera Adipurna\n* :\n**  Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* :\n**  Honorary Recipient of the Order of the Crown of the Realm (DMN)\n* :\n**  Recipient of the Royal Family Order of Kelantan (DK)\n* :\n**  Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion\n* :\n**  Member of the Grand Order of Mugunghwa\n* :\n**  Member of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (LSerafO)\n**  Member 1st Class of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (RNO1kl)\n* :\n**  Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Chula Chom Klao (DGC)\n**  King Rama IX 60th Accession to the Throne Celebrations Medal\n* :\n**  1st Class of the Order of Princess Olga\nIssue\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Birth\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Death\n! colspan=\"2\" |Marriage\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Children\n|-\n!Date\n!Spouse\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Pengiran Anak Puteri Hajah Rashidah Sa'adatul Bolkiah\n| rowspan=\"5\" |26 July 1969\n| rowspan=\"5\"\n| rowspan=\"5\" |15 August 1996\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Pengiran Maharaja Setia Laila Di-Raja Sahibul Irshad Pengiran Anak Haji 'Abdul Rahim bin Pengiran Indera Mahkota Pengiran Anak Dr. Kemaluddin Al-Haj\n|Pengiran Anak Raheemah Sanaul Bolkiah\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Hariisah Widadul Bolqiah\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak 'Abdul Raqiib\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak 'Abdul Haseeb\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Raqeeqah Raayatul Bolqiah\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Puteri Hajah Muta-Wakkilah Hayatul Bolkiah\n|12 October 1971\n|\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Pengiran Muda Mahkota Pengiran Muda Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah\n| rowspan=\"4\" |17 February 1974\n| rowspan=\"4\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |9 September 2004\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Pengiran Anak Isteri Pengiran Anak Sarah binti Pengiran Haji Salleh Ab-Rahaman\n|Pengiran Muda Abdul Muntaqim\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Muneerah Madhul Bolkiah\n|-\n|Pengiran Muda Muhammad Aiman\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Faathimah Az-Zahraa Raihaanul Bolkiah\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pengiran Anak Puteri Hajah Majeedah Nuurul Bolkiah\n| rowspan=\"2\" |16 March 1976\n| rowspan=\"2\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10 June 2007Divorced 7 December 2023\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pengiran Khairul Khalil bin Pengiran Syed Haji Jaafari\n|Pengiran Anak 'Abdul Hafeez\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Raihaanah Hanaa-Ul Bolqiah\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Pengiran Anak Puteri Hajah Hafizah Sururul Bolkiah\n| rowspan=\"4\" |12 March 1980\n| rowspan=\"4\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |20 September 2012\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Pengiran Anak Haji Muhammad Ruzaini bin Pengiran Dr. Haji Mohammad Yakub\n|Pengiran Anak Muhammad Za'eem\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Muhammad 'Aamir\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak 'Abdul Hakeem\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak 'Abdul Aleem\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pengiran Muda 'Abdul Malik\n| rowspan=\"3\" |30 June 1983\n| rowspan=\"3\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |9 April 2015\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pengiran Anak Isteri Pengiran Raabi'atul Adawiyyah binti Pengiran Haji Bolkiah\n|Pengiran Anak Muthee'ah Raayatul Bolqiah\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Fathiyyah Rafaahul Bolqiah\n|-\n|Pengiran Anak Khaalishah Mishbaahul Bolqiah\n|-\n|}\nAncestry\nSee also\n* Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital\n* Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha Bridge\n* Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Secondary School\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links"
