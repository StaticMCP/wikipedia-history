She was previously head coach of the Alcorn State Lady Braves basketball team.\nProfessional career\nAfter graduating from college, there were no opportunities to play professional basketball in the U.S., so Edwards played professionally in Italy from 1991 to 1992, Turkey in 1994, and Israel from 1995 to 1996. In the Autumn of 1996, she played for the Columbus Quest in the American Basketball League (ABL), and won two championship titles with them. In 1998, Edwards became the interim head coach for the Quest after coach Brian Agler resigned. After the ABL folded due to financial difficulties, Edwards was selected by the Minnesota Lynx in the 1999 WNBA draft. She also played for the Phoenix Mercury and Charlotte Sting.\nEdwards began her coaching career by returning to her alma mater, Northwestern Community High School in Flint, Michigan, for five seasons (1990–1995). She guided her team to the 1993 state championship with perfect 28–0 record, a 1992 state champion runner-up finish, and compiled a 78-23 overall record (.772).  She was named 1993 \"High School Coach of the Year\" in the state of Michigan.\nIn 2004, she became a radio commentator for the Phoenix Mercury games, and later became an assistant coach in the National Women's Basketball League.\nIn 2006, she was inducted to the Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame. That same year, she was named as an assistant coach to the women's basketball team at University of Detroit Mercy.\nAfter two years at Detroit, Edwards was head coach at Alcorn State from 2008 to 2015. Edwards was SWAC Coach of the Year in 2011 and led Alcorn State to the SWAC Championship Game in 2012. In seven seasons, Edwards went 60–147 at Alcorn State. On March 23, 2015, Alcorn State announced it would not extend Edwards' contract, which expired at the end of the month.\nCareer statistics\nWNBA\nRegular season\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 1999\n| align=\"left\" | Minnesota\n| 32 || 32 || 32.2 || .357 || .344 || .806 || 3.5 || 2.6 || 0.8 || 0.4 || 2.1 || 14.8\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2000\n| align=\"left\" | Phoenix\n| 32 || 32 || 28.9 || .376 || .307 || .782 || 2.4 || 1.8 || 1.1 || 0.3 || 2.0 || 10.6\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2001\n| align=\"left\" | Phoenix\n| 10 || 9 || 20.8 || .366 || .357 || .787 || 1.9 || 1.8 || 0.5 || 0.1 || 2.2 || 9.4\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2001\n| align=\"left\" | Charlotte\n| 22 || 0 || 16.9 || .340 || .227 || .730 || 2.0 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 0.3 || 1.8 || 4.5\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2002\n| align=\"left\" | Charlotte\n| 29 || 0 || 10.4 || .364 || .280 || .717 || 1.4 || 0.8 || 0.6 || 0.1 || 0.6 || 3.9\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Career\n| align=\"left\" | 4 years, 3 teams\n| 125 || 73 || 22.7 || .362 || .322 || .775 || 2.3 || 1.7 || 0.8 || 0.2 || 1.7 || 9.0\nPlayoffs\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2000\n| align=\"left\" | Phoenix\n| 2 || 2 || 30.5 || .250 || .231 || .667 || 3.0 || 2.5 || 2.0 || 0.0 || 1.0 || 8.5\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2001\n| align=\"left\" | Charlotte\n| 8 || 0 || 14.9 || .429 || .500 || 1.000 || 2.0 || 1.5 || 0.6 || 0.0 || 1.4 || 2.8\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 2002\n| align=\"left\" | Charlotte\n| 2 || 0 || 9.5 || .200 || .333 || .000 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 0.5 || 1.5\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Career\n| align=\"left\" | 3 years, 2 teams\n| 12 || 2 || 16.6 || .326 || .300 || .600 || 1.9 || 1.5 || 0.8 || 0.0 || 1.2 || 3.5\nCollege\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | 1987–88\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Tennessee\n|34||-||-||45.8||50.0||75.2||4.9||3.3||2.3||0.3||-||12.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | 1988–89\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Tennessee\n|20||-||-||45.0||11.1||79.7||3.0||3.4||2.3||0.2||-||9.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | 1989–90\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Tennessee\n|33||-||-||41.9||36.8||76.1||3.2||3.4||1.7||0.1||-||11.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2 | Career\n|87||-||-||44.2||36.1||76.4||3.8||3.3||2.1||0.2||-||11.6\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"14\"|Statistics retrieved from Sports-Reference.\nUSA Basketball\nEdwards was named to the team representing the US at the 1987 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan.
