The term infoware was first used in O'Reilly's talk on the subject at the Linux Kongress in Würzburg in 1997, and later in talks such as one at ISPCON 98. It was written up and published as his chapter Hardware, Software, and Infoware in the book Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution.\nThe term Infoware was in fact coined much earlier in 1981 by Hugh Gillespie and registered in Canada in 1982 as the name of a Software development and consulting company focused on the delivery of simple information glue tools.\nSee also\n* Web 2.0\nExternal links\n*[http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/tim.html Hardware, Software, and Infoware] chapter by Tim O'Reilly from Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution\n*[http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/ask_tim/1999/infoware.html Question regarding O'Reilly's \"infoware\" talk at ISPCON 98]\n*[http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5530 Applying Distributed XML to The Open Source Paradigm Shift] by Steve Mallett"
