      "text": "# Florida Heritage Trails\n\nFlorida Heritage Trails is a series of guidebooks available in digital format and as booklets published by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources. Each guide highlights historical and cultural locations related to a specific time period or group of people, with an emphasis on communities, buildings, museums, archaeology, arts, and festivals. The guides are geared toward tourists, residents, students and scholarly researchers, and all are accessible at no charge via the Florida Department of State web page.\nHistory of the guides\nIn the hope of creating new and innovative ways of teaching people about the state's African American cultural heritage, the Study Commission on African American History was formed by the Florida legislature in 1990. Tasked with identifying buildings and other sites connected to the narrative of the black people in Florida with the express desire to turn such locations into tourist sites, the Commission published the Florida Black Heritage Trail, the first in the series, in 1991.  That edition became the model for the guides that followed, and has undergone two revisions since.\nFlorida Heritage Trails Publications\n*Florida Black Heritage Trail—Covers significant African-American sites from Pensacola to Key West, and also includes profiles and biographical sketches of numerous eminent and gifted African-American Floridians.\n* British Heritage Trail—Essays on the British presence in Florida, and information on over 80 related historic sites throughout the state with direct links to Florida's British history from 1763 to the 20th century.\n* Civil War Heritage Trail—A comprehensive history of the Civil War in Florida, including a timeline of events, and a selected bibliography.
