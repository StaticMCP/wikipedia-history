It explores the Seleukid Empire (333 B.C. to 64 B.C.) in relation to the usurpers that successfully or unsuccessfully arose over time. The book was published by Oxford University Press in October 2016.\nSynopsis\nThis work modifies the author's thesis and turns it into a book. The book consists of an introduction, five chapters, and four appendices. The author, Boris Chrubasik, examines the role of usurpers in the Seleukid Empire. This empire was one of the successor states of Alexander the Great. However, it was challenged by usurpers throughout its history.\nChrubasik argues that usurpers were not simply rebels or criminals, but rather they were men who were trying to legitimate their claims to power by appealing to the people and the army. Chrubasik notes that local power holders who minted coins or founded new settlements were not, at the same time, asserting independence from the empire. Rather they were taking advantage of the short term weakness of central authority. No permanent breach was created and the integrity of the Empire stayed intact.\nChrubasik also says that the King's authority was not derived from royal blood, kin succession or a legal right. Rather, each King's authority was derived from the assent of his subjects. Hence, his authority is a \"form of social power, in which the ability to exercise authority ebbs and flows according to circumstances.\" And the individual accomplishments of  non-royal challengers were a \"platform for ruling.\" By framing the book on the dynamic of usurpers throughout the empire's history, Chrubasik \"is able to  explore the Seleucid monarchy in practice, rather than its ideology.\"\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:82c05a7a-831d-4f10-9fb0-1221ffc81c3f Author's PhD thesis] (2011).
