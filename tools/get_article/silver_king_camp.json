      "text": "# Silver King Camp\n\nSilver King Camp, also known as Fredericton, is a ghost town located in the West Kootenay region of British Columbia.  The town is located on Toad Mountain near Nelson and was founded in the 1880s. It had a high elevation, at around 1,813 meters above sea level. In 1887, silver ore was discovered on Toad Mountain, and a mine was created called the Silver King which was owned by the Hall family of Nelson. A small town, named Fredericton, grew around the workings of the mine.  By 1898, Silver King Camp had a population of 190.  The Silver King mine was the greatest exporter of silver ore to the Nelson Smelter for two decades.  A forest fire destroyed Silver King Camp and today little remains of its town. The town had few businesses, but the most notable of these was the Toad Mountain Hotel.\nReferences"
