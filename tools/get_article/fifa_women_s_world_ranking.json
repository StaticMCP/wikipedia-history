As of August 2025, the Spain national team is ranked number one.\nThe rankings were introduced in 2003, with the first rankings published on 16 July of that year. FIFA attempts to assess the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time based on their past game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. , the ranking has 196 national teams.\nThe ranking has more than informative value, as it is often used to seed member associations into different pots in international tournaments.\nSpecifics of the ranking system\n* FIFA Women's World Rankings are based on every international match a team ever played, dating back to 1971, the first FIFA-recognized women's international between France and the Netherlands.\n* FIFA Women's World Rankings are implicitly weighted to emphasize recent results.\n* FIFA Women's World Rankings are only published four times a year. Normally, rankings are released in March, June, September and December. (In World Cup years, dates may be adjusted to reflect the World Cup results.)\nThe first two points result from the FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the Elo rating system adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men's ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. In addition, any team that plays no matches for 4 years becomes unranked; this inactivity limit was previously 18 months, but was extended in early 2021 (after the COVID-19 pandemic stifled a significant amount of international play).\nRanking calculations\nThe rankings are based on the following formulae:\n:R_{aft} = R_{bef} + K (S_{act} - S_{exp})\n:S_{exp} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-x/2}}\n:x = \\frac{R_{bef} - O_{bef} \\pm H}{c}\nWhere\n{| style=\"width:50%;\"\n|-\n|width=4%|\n|-\n|R_{aft}||= The team rating after the match\n|-\n|R_{bef}||= The team rating before the match\n|-\n|K||= 15 M, the weighted importance of the match\n|-\n|S_{act}||= The actual result of the match, see below\n|-\n|S_{exp}||= The expected result of the match\n|-\n|x||= The scaled difference in rating points between the teams\n|-\n|O_{bef}||= The opposing team's rating before the match\n|-\n|H||= The \"home advantage\" correction, see below\n|-\n|c||= A scaling factor, see below\n|-\n|M||= The \"Match Importance Factor\", see below\n|}\nThe average points of all teams are about 1300 points. The top nations usually exceed 2000 points. In order to be ranked, a team must have played at least more than 5 matches against officially ranked teams, and have not been inactive for the last 48 months up to the date the rankings are published. Even if teams are not officially ranked, their points rating is kept constant until they play their next match.\nActual result of the match\nThe main component of the actual result is whether the team wins, loses, or draws, but goal difference is also taken into account.\nIf the match results in a winner and loser, the loser is awarded a percentage given by the accompanying table, with the result always less than or equal to 20% (for goal differences greater than zero). The result is based on the goal difference and the number of goals they scored. The remaining percentage points are awarded to the winner. For example, a 2–1 match has the result awarded 84%–16% respectively, a 4–3 match has the result awarded 82%–18%, and an 5–3 match has the result awarded 96.2%–3.8%. As such, it is possible for a team to lose points even if they win a match, assuming they did not \"win by enough\".\nIf the match ends in a draw the teams are awarded the same result, but the number depends on the goals scored so the results will not necessarily add up to 100%. For example, a 0–0 draw earns both teams 47% each, a 1–1 draw earns 50% each, and a 4–4 draw earns 52.5% each.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|\n| colspan=\"7\"|Goal Difference\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n| ||0||1||2||3||4||5||6 /+\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n| Goals scoredby non winning team || colspan=7| Actual result (percentage)\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|0||47.0 / 47.0||85.0 / 15.0||92.0 / 8.0||96.0 / 4.0||97.0 / 3.0||98.0 / 2.0||99.0 / 1.0\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|1||50.0 / 50.0||84.0 / 16.0||91.1 / 8.9||95.2 / 4.8||96.3 / 3.7||97.4 / 2.6||98.5 / 1.5\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|2||51.0 / 51.0||83.0 / 17.0||90.2 / 9.8||94.4 / 5.6||95.6 / 4.4||96.8 / 3.2||98.0 / 2.0\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|3||52.0 / 52.0||82.0 / 18.0||89.3 / 10.7||93.6 / 6.4||94.9 / 5.1||96.2 / 3.8||97.5 / 2.5\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|4||52.5 / 52.5||81.0 / 19.0||88.4 / 11.6||92.8 / 7.2||94.2 / 5.8||95.6 / 4.4||97.0 / 3.0\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"|5||53.0 / 53.0||80.0 / 20.0||87.5 / 12.5||92.0 / 8.0||93.5 / 6.5||95.0 / 5.0||96.5 / 3.5\n|}\nSource:\nNeutral ground or home field advantage\nHistorically, home teams earn 66% of the points available to them, with away teams earning the other 34%. To account for this, when two teams are not playing on neutral ground, the home team has its R_{bef} inflated by 100 points for the purposes of calculation. That is, if two equally ranked teams playing at one team's home ground, the home team would be expected to win at the same rate a team playing on neutral ground with a 100-point advantage. This 100 point difference corresponds to a 64%–36% advantage in terms of expected result. The scaling factor remains the same (c=200).\nImportance of the match\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Match importance\n!Match importancefactor (M)\n!K-value\n|-\n|FIFA Women's World Cup match\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|60\n|-\n|Women's Olympic football tournament\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|60\n|-\n|FIFA Women's World Cup qualifier\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n|-\n|Women's Olympic football qualifier\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n|-\n|Women's Continental finals match\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n|-\n|Women's Continental qualifier\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30\n|-\n|Women's friendly match between two Top 10 teams\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|30\n|-\n|Women's friendly match\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|}\nRanking schedule\nRankings are generally published four times a year.
