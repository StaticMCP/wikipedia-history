      "text": "# Timeline of cable television in the United Kingdom\n\nThis is a timeline of cable television in the United Kingdom.\nThe first part of the timeline covers the development of cable across the country, including details of the cable-exclusive channels which launched in the 1990s as part of cable television's attempt to compete with BSkyB's satellite television.\nThe merger of NTL and Telewest effectively resulted in a single national network, covering just over half the country. The second part of the timeline covers Virgin Media.__FORCETOC__\nPre-Virgin Media\n* 1928\n** The foundations for cable television are laid in Swindon when a company called Radio Relay starts transmitting two audio channels on a wire that runs around the town to a relatively small number of homes.\n* 1936\n** Rediffusion, a supplier of cable radio services since 1928, starts providing \"Pipe TV\" to customers, to coincide with the BBC's launch of the world's first regular high-definition television service.\n* 1950\n**A cable network is launched in Gloucester, to provide better television reception than is possible at the time via a rooftop aerial. Further such systems were built in other cities over the next three decades and by the late 1970s, 2.5 million British homes received their television service via cable.\n* 1961\n**A new cable network launches in Swindon to transmit television signals. As reception in the area is poor, take-up is high and by the end of the decade around 15,000 homes were paying to receive their pictures via cable television. However, only those channels available in the area are allowed to be carried on the system.\n* 1964\n**The company which provides the cable relay service in Swindon is acquired by Radio Rentals and is called Radio Rentals Cable.\n* 1968\n** Thorn Electrical Industries purchases Radio Rentals.\n* 1969\n** 15,000 people in Swindon are paying to receive their television pictures via cable television. However, because only existing terrestrial programmes could be put on the cable, and in consequence, the interest in cable started to decline as more and more BBC and ITV transmitters made reception clearer.\n* 1972\n** The UK's Minister for Posts and Telecommunications authorises five experimental community cable television channels. The first to launch is Greenwich Cablevision.\n* 1973\n**Sheffield Cablevision, The Bristol Channel and Swindon Viewpoint launch.\n* 1974\n** March – The final community station, Wellingborough Cablevision, launches.\n* 1975\n**14 March – After less than two years on air, The Bristol Channel closes.\n**24 March – Wellingborough Cablevision closes.\n* 1976\n** 2 January – Sheffield Cablevision closes when the funds run out.\n** Greenwich Cablevision closes as a full-time service although programming made by volunteers keeps the station on air in a restricted form until the early 1980s.\n**Swindon Viewpoint’s experimental phase ends when EMI decided to pull out of funding the service. However, the channel continues after it was sold to the public of Swindon for £1.\n* 1980\n** April – Regular programming on Swindon Viewpoint ends when funding dries up. but continues intermittently for the next decade with programmes made by volunteers.\n* 1981\n**Radio Rental Cable Television launches the UK's first pay-per-view movie channel, 'Cinematel', for cable viewers in Swindon. The channel later expands to Chatham in Kent.

Also provided is a local teletext service, with pages about film information, horoscopes, recipes, local bus times and job vacancies.\n**9 September – Rediffusion launches a movie channel called Starview. It is allowed to launch the channel following a decision by the Home Office granting several experimental licences to broadcast subscription television and Rediffusion had won one of these licenses.\n* 1982\n**Proposals to liberalise cable television in the UK are drawn up. Previously, apart from the 1981 experiments, the cable networks were only allowed to relay the over-the-air channels.\n* 1983\n**Ahead of the enacting of the forthcoming liberalisation, the Government licenses eleven interim franchises for broadband systems. Each covers an individual town or city of around 100,000 homes.\n* 1984\n**16 January – Satellite Television Ltd launches in the UK on Swindon Cable as Sky Channel.
