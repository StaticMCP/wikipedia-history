It is a grade II listed building with Historic England.\nHistory\nThe Bow Brickhill War Memorial was erected in March 1921, during the period following the First World War, which cost the United Kingdom more than one million military deaths. Since the UK government did not repatriate the bodies of all soldiers who died in overseas combat, tens of thousands of war memorials were erected in the UK so that communities could memorialize those who served and returned and those who died.\nThe memorial was officially unveiled by the dedicated on 26 March 1921 by the 12th Duke of Bedford. In 1947, names of locals who died in the Second World War were added.

The other faces are inscribed with the names of men who served in the First World War and the upper step of the base has five names, men who died in the Second World War (1939–1945).\nNotable people\nGerald Featherstone Knight, grandson of the rector of Bow Brickhill, was a captain in the Royal Flying Corps who died of cancer on 30 October 1919, aged 25.
