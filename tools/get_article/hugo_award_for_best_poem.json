It was chosen by Seattle Worldcon as its optional \"Additional Category\" (pursuant to Rule 3.3.20 of the CONSTITUTION of the World Science Fiction Society, as of August 12, 2024).\nSelection\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six finalists, except in the case of a tie.  Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six finalists is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and are held in a different city around the world each year.\nWinners and finalists\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the poem was first published. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a yellow background have won the award; those with a grey background are the finalists on the short-list. If the poem was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winners and joint winners\n&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winner selected\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"28%\" scope=\"col\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\" scope=\"col\"|Poem\n! width=\"26%\" scope=\"col\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n!scope=\"rowgroup\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"6\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| 2025\n| * || \"A War of Words\" || Strange Horizons, September 2024\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| || \"Calypso\" || Titan\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|  || \"Ever Noir\" || Haven Spec Magazine, Issue 16, July 2024\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|  || \"there are no taxis for the dead\" || Uncanny Magazine, Issue 58\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|  || \"We Drink Lava\" || Uncanny Magazine, Issue 56\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|  || \"Your Visiting Dragon\" || Strange Horizons, Fund Drive 2024\n|align=\"center\"|\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://thehugoawards.org/ Hugo Award official site]"
