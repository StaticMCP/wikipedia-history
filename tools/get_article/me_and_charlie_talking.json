The record was produced by Frank Liddell and Mike Wrucke. It was released on October 4, 2004, as the lead single to her debut studio album Kerosene (2005) by Epic Nashville.\nDespite breaking the record for the highest debut by a female artist's debut single, it only peaked at number 27 on the US Hot Country Songs chart.\nCommercial performance\n\"Me and Charlie Talking\" debuted on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart (then titled \"Hot Country Singles & Tracks\") the week of October 23, 2004 at number 42, becoming the \"Hot Shot Debut\" of the week; this led Lambert to breaking the record for the highest debut by a female artist's debut single during the BDS era, surpassing the number 48 debut that label-mate Gretchen Wilson had with her song \"Redneck Woman\". Despite this, the song would only rise to a minor 27 the week of March 19, 2005, where it stayed for two weeks; it stayed 23 weeks in total on the chart.\nMusic video\nA music video was released for the song, directed by Trey Fanjoy.
