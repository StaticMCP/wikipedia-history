The train made its inaugural run on 17 September 2013.\nHistory\nThis train is mainly introduce to compensate the Coimbatore Rameswaram daily Meter Gauge express via Madurai, Pollachi since this train has been discontinued due to gauge conversion of dindigul-pollachi line. Though gauge conversion completed, it never restored till date (but ran as a limited run festival special train after gauge conversion for a period of 1 month). So this train(16617/16618) will run to compensate the Meter Gauge express.\nThis train was initially operated as a summer special service from April to June 2012 on Saturdays and Sundays in the number 06010 and 06009 by using the lie over rakes of Kongu Express. But during regularisation of this summer special service, Rajkot express  lie-over rakes were allotted due to which the weekend service has been turned into week days service.\nSeveral stoppages has been removed for this train after COVID lockdown run but only Sivaganga stoppage alone provided again after restoration of regular service from COVID special service.\nService and schedule\nThe train starts on Tuesdays from Coimbatore and on Wednesdays from Rameswaram, covering the total distance of  in approximately 12 hours.\nRoute and stations\nThis train passes through 14 intermediate stations including Erode, Karur, Tiruchirappalli, Pudukkottai,  Karaikkudi, Devakottai Road, Sivaganga and Manamadurai. Previously this train also had stoppages at Kallal, Chettinad and Kodumudi.\nRake composition\nThis train shares its rake with Coimbatore Rajkot Express\n* 1 AC II tier\n* 3 AC III tier\n* 14 sleeper coaches\n* 2 general\n* 2 second-class luggage/parcel van\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders unsortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| Loco\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 1\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 2\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 3\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 4\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 5\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 6\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 7\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 8\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 9\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 10\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 11\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 12\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 13\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 14\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 15\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 16\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 17\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 18\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 19\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 20\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 21\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"background:lightskyblue;\"| 22\n|-\n| ||GRD||GEN||S1||S2||S3||S4||S5||S6||S7||S8||S9||S10||S11||S12||S13||S14||B1||B2||B3||A1||GEN||GRD\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://runningstatus.in/status/16618 16618 Time Table & Live Running Status]\n* [http://runningstatus.in/status/16617 16617 Time Table & Live Running Status]"
