The song was released as a single later that year, reaching #34 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #11 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. Despite being a relatively successful hit for the band, the song has not been included on the two main compilation albums released by the band; Big Ones (1989) and Loverboy Classics (1994).\nThe video for \"Queen of the Broken Hearts\" was the subject of an MTV contest in the summer of 1983, in which an MTV viewer won the chance to \"star\" in Loverboy's next video. The contest was won by a woman named Bridget Magnesi, who appeared very briefly in two shots, behind a bank of computer monitors about 15 seconds into the video.\nThe video was shot at Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles, where the desert, rock formations, and caves were utilized extensively for a  number of popular science fiction television series and many B-movies dating from the early 1950s.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
