He graduated from New York University.\nIn 1940 Chapnick joined a recently founded photo agency, Black Star. During World War II he served in the United States Air Force. In 1946 he returned to Black Star. He formed a new department responsible for photo essays and books. He also worked to make and maintain a network of photographers around the world.\nIn 1964 Chapnick bought out the founders' shares and had been a president of the agency for 25 years.\nHe taught annual workshops at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. In 1994 he published a book called Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism, summarising his many years of experience in the field of dealing with photojournalists.\nChapnick was a principal founder of the W.

After his death in 1996, the Fund established in his memory a grant to encourage and support leadership in fields ancillary to photojournalism.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/29/nyregion/howard-chapnick-74-photo-agency-chief.html/The New York Times]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150906183718/http://smithfund.org/uncategorized/the-howard-chapnick-legacy-a-collaboration-between-aperture-and-w-eugene-smith-memorial-fund W.
