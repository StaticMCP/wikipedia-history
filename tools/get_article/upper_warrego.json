In the , Upper Warrego had a population of 38 people.\nGeography\nThe Great Dividing Range forms part of the north-western, northern, and north-eastern boundaries of the locality.\nThe Warrego River rises in the north-east of the locality and meanders south-west, exiting to the south (Caroline Crossing). The locality name reflects that the upper reaches of the river are within the locality. Due to the Great Dividing Range, the Warrego River is the northernmost river within the Murray Darling drainage basin. Consistent with this, the elevations range from  in the north-east of the locality through to  in the south-west of the locality, with the following mountains in the north-eastern part of the locality (from north to south):\n* Mount Lambert (), rising to  above sea level\n* Mount Lyon ()\n* Junction Hill ()\n* Mount Sugarloaf ()\n* Mount Emily ()\n* Bally Lethbridge ()\n* Mount Hopeless ()\n* Mount King ()\n* Mount Drummond ()\n* Mount Yanalah ()\n* Mount Black ()\n* Mount Grassy ()\n* Mount Tabor ()\n* Bullock Mountain ()\nThe Landsborough Highway passes to the west of the locality; there is limited road infrastructure within the locality.\nThere are small parts of the Carnarvon National Park in the north-east of the locality, extending into the neighbouring localities of Carnavon Park to the north and Mount Moffatt to the east. Other protected areas within the south-west of locality include:\n* Pluto Timber Reserve, which extends into neighbouring Caldervale to the west\n* Attica State Forest, which extends into neighbouring Mount Moffat to the east\n* Cunno State Forest (two sections)\nApart from the protected areas, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the Warrego River, where Warrego is the Aboriginal name for the river, according to notes made on 11 September 1846 by Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor-General of New South Wales.\nDemographics\nIn the , Upper Warrego had  \"no people or a very low population\".\nIn the , Upper Warrego had a population of 38 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Upper Warrego. Students living in the far south-west of the locality could attend primary school at Augathella State School in Augathella to the south-west, but this school would be too distant from most parts of the locality. Also, there are no secondary schools nearby. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
