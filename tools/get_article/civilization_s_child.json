Like other films produced by Kay-Bee Pictures the film was praised at the time for its artistic title cards, created by Irvin Willat. A reviewer in Moving Picture World mentioned one title card where \"the efforts of a ward politician to get an unprotected girl into his clutches was symbolized by a realistic picture of a spider endeavoring to entice an unsuspecting little fly into the meshes of his web\".\nNo copies of the film are known to survive.\nPlot\nAfter an idyllic childhood in the mountains of Russia, Berna accompanies her uncle to Kiev, to the Jewish part of the city. Many Jewish residents of Kiev are killed by the Cossacks and Berna flees, taking ship for the United States.

But Ellen, McManus's daughter, falls in love with Nicolai and succeeds in drawing him away from his family. Meanwhile, McManus has become a judge; he ratifies their separation and grants Nikolai a divorce so that he can marry McManus's daughter and adopt Nikolai's and Berna's child.\nDriven mad by desperation, Berna goes to the judge, accuses him of being the cause of her ruin, and kills him.\nProduction\nThe film was produced by Kay-Bee Pictures and by the New York Motion Picture Co.\nDistribution\nThe film was distributed by Triangle Distributing, and opened in cinemas on April 23, 1916.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1916\n* List of lost films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://lcweb2.loc.gov:8081/diglib/ihas/loc.mbrs.sfdb.4305/default.html Film listing on American Silent Feature Film Database]\n*[http://lcweb2.loc.gov:8081/diglib/ihas/html/silentfilms/silentfilms-home.html American Silent Feature Film Database]"
