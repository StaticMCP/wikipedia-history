As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,832. Rockingham includes the incorporated villages of Bellows Falls and Saxtons River, as well as a large rural area west of Interstate 91.\nRockingham has no formal town center; instead, town offices and the Rockingham Public Library are located in the village of Bellows Falls. The approximate center is the Rockingham Meeting House, passed by Route 103, a popular east–west route across the state. The Meeting House was built in Rockingham Village, once the main settlement in the town, but with the increased use of water power for manufacturing, population shifted to other villages located on the two rivers in the town. Most of what was left of Rockingham Village (over a dozen buildings, also called the Old Town) burned in a fire on April 14, 1908; the fire came close to the Meeting House but it was saved. The houses, hotel, and store that burned were not rebuilt.\nHistory\nStreet scene, Rockingham Village,\nOne of the New Hampshire grants, it was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on December 28, 1752, and named for Lord Rockingham. The township was granted to Samuel Johnson and 72 others. When the Town was first settled in 1753 by pioneers, its rivers were sites of fishing for salmon and shad, as they had been for the original indigenous inhabitants. By 1771, the population reached 225. In 1785, Colonel Enoch Hale erected the first bridge over the Connecticut River, and until 1796, it remained the only bridge across. The village of Bellows Falls became an important mill town, which reduced the runs of palatable fish.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 42.3&nbsp;square miles (109.6&nbsp;km2), of which 41.9&nbsp;square miles (108.5&nbsp;km2) is land and 0.4&nbsp;square mile (1.1&nbsp;km2) (0.97%) is water. It is drained by the Williams and the Saxtons rivers, and several brooks that flow directly into the Connecticut River; the latter river forms the eastern boundary of Rockingham.\nThe highest point in town is Berry Hill at 478 m/1568&nbsp;ft elevation, near the northwestern corner of the town. The lowest point is on the Connecticut River at the southern boundary of town, at 73 m/240&nbsp;ft elevation.\nThe town is crossed by Interstate 91, U.S. Route 5, Vermont Route 103 and Vermont Route 121. The Bellows Falls train station was once served by three rail lines, and today it has Amtrak service on the Vermonter route, with two trains a day, one heading south to Washington, DC and one heading north to St. Albans, VT.\nDemographics\nThe rural community, based on farming, had its peak of population in 1920.\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 5,309 people, 2,202 households, and 1,387 families residing in the town.
