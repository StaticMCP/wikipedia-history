Their leader was said to be known as Heslop.\nIn F. Grice's telling of the traditional story The Duergar in Folk Tales of the North Country (1944), one of them is described as being short, wearing a lambskin coat, moleskin trousers and shoes, and a hat made of moss stuck with a feather.\nThe legendary dwarfs of Simonside were mentioned in the local newspaper, the Morpeth Gazette, in 1889, and in Tyndale's Legends and Folklore of Northumbria, 1930. They delighted in leading travellers astray, especially after dark, often carrying lighted torches to lead them into bogs, rather like a Will-o'-the-wisp. The menacing creatures would often disappear at dawn.\nThe word duergar is likely to be derived from the dialectal words for \"dwarf\" on the Anglo-Scottish border which include dorch, dwerch, duerch, Duergh and Duerwe amongst others  with a later, mistakenly added Norse -ar plural, perhaps as a result of linguistic misattestation. It may also come from the Old Norse word for dwarf or dwarfs (dvergar). These Border words for \"dwarf\", like the Standard English form, all derive from the Old English dweorh or dweorg via the Middle English dwerg.[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dwarf Online Etymology Dictionary]\nIn the 2004 film Van Helsing, the Duergar are the minions of Count Dracula.\nSee also\n* Brown Man of the Muirs\n* English mythology\n* Norse mythology\nReferences\n*\n*Grice, F, Folk Tales of the North Country (Thomas Nelson & Sons Ltd, London & Edinburgh, 1944) pp130–133\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221802/http://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/understanding/historyarchaeology/simonsidesacredmountain/simonsidestoriesandfolklore.htm Simonside Folklore]\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221749/http://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/understanding/historyarchaeology/simonsidesacredmountain/simonsidetheduergar.htm Grice's version of the story of \"The Duergar\"]"
