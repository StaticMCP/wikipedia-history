It largely replicates the existing European Union–Southern African Development Community Economic Partnership Agreement framework, maintaining preferential trade access. The agreement is part of the UK's strategy to maintain and enhance trade relationships with developing countries following its departure from the European Union.\nAgreement\nThe SACUM-UK EPA was signed in October 2019 and entered into force on 1 January 2021, following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. The agreement was designed to replicate and replace the trade preferences that previously existed under the EU-SADC EPA, ensuring continuity for exporters and importers in all participating countries. The agreement provides immediate duty-free and quota-free access for goods exported from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Namibia to the UK. South African exports also benefit from preferential access, though some products are subject to tariff rate quotas. In return, the agreement eliminates tariffs on a significant proportion of UK exports to Mozambique and includes provisions for the gradual reduction of duties on UK goods entering SACU and Mozambique.\nSee also\n* Botswana–United Kingdom relations\n* Economic Partnership Agreements\n* Eswatini–United Kingdom relations\n* Foreign relations of Botswana\n* Foreign relations of Eswatini\n* Foreign relations of Lesotho\n* Foreign relations of Mozambique\n* Foreign relations of Namibia\n* Foreign relations of South Africa\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\n* Mozambique–United Kingdom relations\n* Namibia–United Kingdom relations\n* South Africa–United Kingdom relations\n* Southern Africa Customs Union\nReferences"
