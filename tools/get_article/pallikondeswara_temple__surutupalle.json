The presiding deity Pallikondeswara, unlike other Shiva temples, is sported in reclining posture lying on the lap of his consort Parvati.\nThe temple house a three-tiered gateway tower known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Valmeegeeswarar and Maragathambigai being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., and five yearly festivals on its calendar. The Aipassi Annabishekam is the major festival in the temple. The temple was built by Vijayanagara king Harihara Bukka Raya (1344-47). In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by State Institute of Temple Administration (SITA) of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.\nLegend\nDuring the Samudra manthan (churning of the ocean of milk) by the gods and demons, many treasures along with the Amrita (elixir of the gods) and the poison Halahala rose from the ocean. To rescue the beings of the world from the poison, Shiva consumed it. When the poison was just going down the throat of Shiva, his consort Parvati stopped it there by tightly holding Shiva’s throat, turning Shiva's neck blue. After the episode, Shiva proceeded to his abode Kailash with Parvati. On the way, he felt exhausted and slightly uncomfortable, when he reached a place in the bounds of Andhra, which came to be called Suruttappalli. There, he lay down to relax, keeping his head in the lap of Parvati. The gods, who were concerned about Shiva's well-being, assembled there and stood around him, waiting for the Lord to open his eyes. This lying posture of Shiva is rare and unique, almost similar to Vishnu’s reclining posture.\nArchitecture\nThe temple was built by Vijayanagara king Harihara Bukka Raya (1344-47). The temple has an inscription stating the temple was renovated by Kalahasti princess in 1833. Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswati of Kanchi Mutt camped here for 40 days in 1976, he showed a place and asked people to dig it, when they did, they found the stone and Mahaperiyava disclosed that the footprints are those of Rama's twins Lava and Kusha. Sri Jayendra Saraswati and Sri Vijayendra Saraswati performed the Kumbabhishekam of the temple on June 23 2002. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by State Institute of Temple Administration (SITA) of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Palli Kondeswarar translates to reclining deity.

The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshipers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi.\nBrahmotsavam during the Tamil month of ' (September – October), Thiruvadhirai during the month of ' (December – January) and Annabhishekam during the Tamil month of  are the major festivals celebrated in the temple.
