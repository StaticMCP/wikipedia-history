The initial plan was for a surprise dawn attack, but Major Charles Hatch reported that the rebels were warned and American nationals evacuated before the assault. The rebels, fortified in the fort and nearby buildings, vowed to resist the landing.\nAs the Marines approached, they faced heavy sniper fire from the waterfront. With casualties already mounting, the gunboat Sacramento opened fire with its small cannon, which helped suppress enemy fire. However, the Marines encountered more trouble when their steam launch ran aground near the shore, forcing them to wade through the surf under fire. Despite this, they reached the beach and stormed the fort, taking it at bayonet point.\nThe rebels retreated through the town, maintaining harassing fire again the Marines. The gunboat provided artillery support as the Marines advanced uphill, eventually forcing the rebels to abandon their position at a hospital, which had been fortified. The battle resulted in several casualties but successfully secured the fort and the surrounding area.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
