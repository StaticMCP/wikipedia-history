This kingfisher is a resident over much of its range.\nDescription and taxonomy\nEbird describes it as \"A fairly large kingfisher of lowland and foothill open country and forest edge. Chocolate brown on the underparts and hood, down to the upper back. Back, tail, and wings bright blue, with large black shoulder patches, small black wingtips, a white throat, and a bright red legs. Somewhat similar to Stork-billed Kingfisher, but Brown-breasted has chocolate brown rather than orange underparts. Song is a rapid, descending series of a dozen or so sharp notes, trailing off in volume.\"\nIt was previously considered a subspecies of the white-throated kingfisher (H. smyrnensis), but was split as a distinct species by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International in 2014, and the International Ornithological Congress followed suit in 2022.\nIt is differentiated by its plummage white a smaller extent of white which is restricted to the chin versus the white-throated kingfishers which white spot includes the breast, a larger white wingpatch, more black on the wings and a shorter tail.\nThis species is monotypic.\nEcology and behavior\nFeeds on insects, reptiles, amphibians, fish, small birds and mammals and even the occasional bat. Typically perches 5 to 10 meters above its hunting area and swoops down to its prey.\nSeason is around April to May where it typically nests in termite mounds and lays 2 to 4 eggs.\nHabitat and conservation status\nHas a wide range of habitats that include clearings, fishponds, rivers, second growth scrubland, and forest edge.  Typically found below 1,000 meters above sea level.\nThe IUCN has yet to classify this species as separate from white-throated kingfisher. This species is  common all throughout and has well adapted and even benefited fromohuman modified habitats. While the Philippines has faced massive deforestation, this species adaptability has allowed it to survive and even thrive better than most Philippine birds.\nReferences\n*Collar 2011b; Allen 2020; HBW/Birdlife\n*Gill F, D Donsker & P Rasmussen  (Eds). 2022.
