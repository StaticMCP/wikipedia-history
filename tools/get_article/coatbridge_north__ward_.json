It elects four councillors. Covering neighbourhoods in the north of Coatbridge (Blairhill, Cliftonville, Drumpellier, Dunbeth, Gartsherrie, Greenhill, Parklands, Summerlee, Sunnyside, Townhead and the town centre), the ward had a population of 15,146 in 2019.\nIt was created in 2007 as Coatbridge North and Glenboig, originally covering around twice as much territory between Coatbridge and Condorrat about  further north, largely rural and sparsely populated but including the expanding commuter village of Glenboig. A nationwide boundary review in 2017 that recommended more representation for the area overall led to this rural half being placed in a separate new ward (along with Gartcosh and Moodiesburn from the Strathkelvin ward), but the electorate in the existing ward reduced only a slightly as a result and the number of seats was unaffected.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|John Wilson(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Tony Clarke(Labour)\n|rowspan=7; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=7|Bill Shields(Labour)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Martin McWilliams(Independent)\n|-\n!2009 by-\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Peter Sullivan(Labour)\n|-\n!2011 by-\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Michael McPake(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Fulton MacGregor(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Julie McAnulty(SNP)\n|-\n!2016 by-\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Alex McVey(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Kirsten Larson(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Allan Stubbs(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|}\nElection results\n2022 Election\nThe SNP (2) and Labour (2) retained the seats they had won at the previous election.\nSource:}}\n2017 Election\n|numcounts= 7\n}}\n2012 Election\n2016 By-election\n*Councillor Fulton James McGregor was elected as a MSP for Coatbridge and Chryston in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.
