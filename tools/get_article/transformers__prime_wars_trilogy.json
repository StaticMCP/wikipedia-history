A Council of Worlds was forged, consisting of Rodimus Prime, Starscream and the Mistress of Flame, ruling Cybertron and Caminus in an uneasy peace. However, the rise of the Combiners caused destruction and death on Caminus, setting Windblade, the Cityspeaker of the Titans, on a quest for vengeance. Meanwhile, the Combiner Victorion is on her own mission to find the Enigma of Combination.\nArc 2: \"Titans Return\"\nFollowing the end of the Combiner Wars, the Titans are awakened and Trypticon begins to wreak havoc on Cybertron. To combat Trypticon, Windblade gathers up a ragtag team of Transformers to resurrect an \"ancient ally\". And while some may be forever changed by the events, others may not emerge with their sparks intact.\nArc 3: \"Power of the Primes\"\nFollowing the death of Optimus Prime, the rest of the Transformers must band together to survive before Megatronus / The Fallen can wipe out their species forever.\nMedia\nVideo games\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=99%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Developer(s) / Publisher(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Platform(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Release date(s)\n|-\n| Transformers: Battle Tactics\n| DeNA\n| Android and iOS\n| January 30, 2015\n|-\n| Transformers: Devastation\n| PlatinumGames and Activision\n| Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One\n|\n|-\n| Transformers: Earth Wars\n| Backflip Studios\n| Android and iOS\n| June 2, 2016\n|}\nComics\nVarious comic book issues from The Transformers by IDW Publishing make reference to the Prime Wars Trilogy.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"99%\"\n!
