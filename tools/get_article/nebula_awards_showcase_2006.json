It was first published in trade paperback by Roc/New American Library in March 2006, which also issued an ebook edition in July 2009.\nSummary\nThe book collects pieces that won or were nominated for the Nebula Awards for best novel, novella, novelette and short story for the year 2005, a profile of 2005 grand master winner Anne McCaffrey and a representative early story by her, various other nonfiction pieces related to the awards, mostly by past Nebula Grand Masters, and the two Rhysling Award-winning poems for 2004, together with an introduction by the editor. Not all nominees for the various awards are included, and the best novel is represented by an excerpt.\nContents\n*\"Introduction\" (Gardner Dozois)\n*\"The Green Leopard Plague\" [Best Novella winner, 2005] (Walter Jon Williams)\n*\"Basement Magic\" [Best Novelette winner, 2005] (Ellen Klages)\n*\"Dry Bones\" [Best Novelette nominee, 2005] (William Sanders)\n*\"The Masters Speak: Introduction\" (Gardner Dozois)\n**\"Science Fiction Century\" (Jack Williamson)\n**\"The Way It Was\" (Robert Silverberg)\n**\"Teaching the Art\" (Ursula K.

He singles out for particular mention the stories by Klages, Sanders, McCaffrey (\"[e]very bit as potent as when it first appeared in 1961\"), Vinge and Rosenbaum (\"[t]he best piece of writing, by light years, in the 'Nebula' collection\"). He also notes the \"unrepentantly nostalgic essays\" of the past grand masters' essays in \"The Masters Speak\" section.\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe (2006) in Locus no. 543, April 2006.\nNotes"
