Yet it has no real drive or personality of its own. It looks like a movie made as a cooperative venture by film students with a fairly fancy budget.\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \"At the end, Anna Mae’s progression has a foreordained feel; not really privy to a struggle or a triumph. Yet it’s a decent film with decent intentions and values. Nowadays, that can sometimes be recommendation enough.\" Joe Baltake rated the film 2 stars out of 5, calling it \"a case of a movie getting longer with each cut.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
