He was an Anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation Member of Parliament (MP) for South Armagh from 1892 until his death.\nThe director and principal proprietor of a large drapery in Belfast, he was first elected at the 1892 general election, when he stood against the sitting Parnellite MP Alexander Blane. McHugh won a comfortable victory over the Unionist candidate, while Blane secured barely 1% of the votes. McHugh was re-elected in 1886, with a wide margin over another Unionist candidate, and held the seat until his death in August 1900. No by-election was held for his seat before Parliament was dissolved for the general election in October 1900.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
