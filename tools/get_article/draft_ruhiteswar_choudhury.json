He is recognized for his work in applied statistics, particularly in distribution theory, hydrological modeling, and copula-based dependence structures. He is currently a Ph.D. research scholar in the Department of Statistics at Assam University, Silchar.\nEarly life and education\nRuhiteswar Choudhury was born and raised in Hailakandi, Assam. He completed his undergraduate studies with honours in Statistics and later obtained a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Statistics from Assam University, Silchar. He graduated with distinction, securing the First Class Second Position in his cohort. In 2023, he qualified for Ph.D. admission in the Department of Statistics and secured the top rank in the university merit list.\nAcademic and research career\nChoudhury began his doctoral research under the supervision of Dr. Tanusree Deb Roy at Assam University. His research focuses on Copula Modelling, Distribution Theory and Applied Statistics.\nHis work involves deriving statistical properties such as moment generating functions, conditional expectations, survival functions, and hazard rate functions. He applies these models to real-world problems involving rainfall and temperature data from northeastern India. He also explores their use in statistical data imputation and risk modeling.\nIn May 2024, Choudhury co-authored a paper titled Rainfall Analysis of Guwahati City Using the Method of L-Moments, TL-Moments & Maximum Likelihood Estimation, published in the International Journal of Scientific Research in Multidisciplinary Studies. The study analyzed 37 years of rainfall data to model seasonal extremes using multiple estimation methods.\nTeaching and coaching\nIn addition to his academic work, Choudhury is a co-founder and senior faculty member of 3DS Coaching Institute, a private educational center in Hailakandi. The institute offers classes in Mathematics, Statistics, Science, English and Social Science for students in grades 7 to 12.
