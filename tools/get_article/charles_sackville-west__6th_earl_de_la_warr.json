He was a peer for the last  years of his life, succeeding his father in 1869. De La Warr committed suicide by drowning himself in the River Cam four year later; unmarried, his title and estates were inherited by his brother.\nEarly life\nSackville-West was the second son of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr, and Lady Elizabeth Sackville, daughter of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. He was notably brother of:\n*George West, Viscount Cantelupe (whom he outlived)\n*Reginald Sackville, 7th Earl De La Warr (who outlived and inherited the key estates)\n*Elizabeth Russell, Duchess of Bedford\n*Mortimer Sackville-West, 1st Baron Sackville, and\n*Lionel Sackville-West, 2nd Baron Sackville.\nHe was educated at Harrow.\nCareer and death\nSackville-West served in the British Army and was appointed aide-de-camp and military secretary to Sir Hugh Gough in India in 1845. He fought at the Battle of Sobraon in 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War. In 1850 he became known by the courtesy title Lord West after the untimely death of his elder brother, Lord Cantelupe who was likewise unmarried.\nPromoted to major in 1852 and to lieutenant-colonel in 1855, he served in the Crimean War. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1855 and an Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1856 and awarded the Order of the Medjidie in 1858. In 1864 he was promoted to major-general. He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1869.\nIn 1871 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB).\nLord Delaware died in April 1873, aged 57, by drowning himself in the Cam. He was unmarried and was succeeded in the earldom by his next-youngest brother, Reginald, Lord Buckhurst.\nReferences and footnotes\nCitations\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n*"
