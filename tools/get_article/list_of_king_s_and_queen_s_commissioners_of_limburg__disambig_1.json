Similarly, the Provinciehuis (Province Hall) in Maastricht is called Gouvernement (Governor's Residence). This local custom arose from the particular status of the current province in the nineteenth century.\nIn 1830, the whole of the province of Limburg, which at the time consisted of both the present Dutch and Belgian parts, joined in the Belgian Revolution, with the notable exception of the city of Maastricht. From then until 1839 Limburg was governed as part of Belgium. As per the 1839 Treaty of London, The Netherlands recognised Belgium's independence, but special provisions were made for Limburg (and Luxembourg). The province was divided into two, roughly taking river Meuse as the border, with most of the eastern half, although now an integral part of the Dutch territory, becoming a member of the German Confederacy as the \"Duchy of Limburg\" to appease Prussia, which had lost access to the Meuse after the Congress of Vienna. This peculiar arrangement, which excluded Maastricht and Venlo, lasted until the Confederation's dissolution in 1866.\nThe folklore custom to call the local King's Commissioner \"Governor\" dates from these times; nowadays it is used to underline the Limburgers' (self-)perceived otherness from \"regular\" Dutchmen.\nList of King's and Queen's commissioners of Limburg\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Term\n!Name\n!Party\n|-\n|1815–1828\n|Charles de Brouckère\n|Orangist\n|-\n|1828–1831\n|Maximilien Henri Ghislain, Baron de Beeckman\n|\n|-\n|-\n|1831\n|Pierre André Servais Kerens (ad interim)\n|Orangist\n|-\n|1831–1845\n|Johan Eberhard Paul Ernst Gericke van Herwijnen\n|\n|-\n|1845–1846\n|Pieter Daniël Eugenius Macpherson\n|\n|-\n|1846–1856\n|Eduardus Johannes Petrus van Meeuwen\n|Liberal\n|-\n|1856–1874\n|Joseph van der Does de Willebois\n|Moderate liberal\n|-\n|1874–1893\n|Eduard de Kuijper\n|\n|-\n|1893–1918\n|Gustave Ruijs de Beerenbrouck\n|Roman Catholic (conservative)\n|-\n|1918\n|Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck\n|General League\n|-\n|1918–1936\n|Eduard van Hövell tot Westerflier\n|General League / RKSP\n|-\n|1936–1941\n|Willem van Sonsbeeck\n|RKSP\n|-\n|1941–1944\n|Max de Marchant et d'Ansembourg\n|NSB\n|-\n|1944–1947\n|Willem van Sonsbeeck\n|RKSP / KVP\n|-\n|1947–1964\n|François Joseph Marie Anne Hubert Houben\n|KVP\n|-\n|1964–1978\n|Charles van Rooy\n|KVP\n|-\n|1978–1990\n|Sjeng Kremers\n|KVP, CDA\n|-\n|1990–1993\n|Emile Mastenbroek\n|CDA\n|-\n|1993–2005\n|Berend-Jan van Voorst tot Voorst\n|CDA\n|-\n|2005–2011\n|Léon Frissen\n|CDA\n|-\n|2011–2021\n|Theo Bovens\n|CDA\n|-\n|2021\n|Johan Remkes (acting)\n|VVD\n|-\n|2021–present\n|Emile Roemer\n|SP\n|}\nReferences"
