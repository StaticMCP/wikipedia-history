The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final, after having previously selected the performer internally.\nBefore Eurovision\nArtist selection\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) continued to use a national final A Song for Europe to select its entry. For 1992, the multi-artist format utilized since 1976 was dropped in favor of a single artist performing several songs as from 1964 to 1975. Michael Ball was revealed by the BBC as its entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest 1992.\nA Song for Europe 1992\nTwo songs each were premiered during the four broadcasts of Wogan on BBC1 between 8 and 30 March 1992, and were later featured in various programmes on BBC Radio 2.\nEight songs, all performed by Michael Ball, competed in the televised final on 3 April 1992 held at the BBC's TVC3 Studio in London and hosted by Terry Wogan. The show was broadcast on BBC1 and BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce. The performances were filmed earlier on 2 April 1992 and a public televote selected the winning song, \"One Step Out of Time\", which was revealed during a separate show broadcast on BBC1 and hosted by Terry Wogan.\nPaul Curtis' song was a last minute replacement for an unnamed song that was either disqualified or withdrawn. It was Curtis' 22nd and last song to feature in the British national finals for Eurovision; a record for any songwriter. It was the only one of the eight songs that Michael Ball did not record.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|+ A Song for Europe 19923 April 1992\n|-\n!
