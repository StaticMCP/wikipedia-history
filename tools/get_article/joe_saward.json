In 1984 he joined Autosport magazine in London. He began reporting on Formula One in 1988, working alongside Nigel Roebuck and remained as Grand Prix Editor of Autosport until 1993. He later wrote for the F1 News magazine, and went on to create the [http://www.flatoutpublishing.com/jsbm/ JSBM Newsletter] and more recently a Formula One blog, called Joeblogsf1.\nThis was followed by the launch of GrandPrix+, an e-magazine developed in partnership with David Tremayne. Saward hosts in-person and virtual audiences for Formula One fans who can ask questions about the sport. He also takes part in podcast interviews on Missed Apex podcast. He has the distinction of attending all the F1 races since 1988, is accredited as an FIA Formula One Permanent Passholder, and previously sat on the board of Caterham Cars as a non-executive director.\nSaward has also written a number of books, including The World Atlas of Motor Racing. In 2006 he published The Grand Prix Saboteurs, detailing the story of racing drivers who went on to establish a sabotage network in France during World War II. As a result, the Guild of Motoring Writers named Saward the Renault UK Author of the Year. He published a biography of his great-grandfather, Henry George Kendall, titled The Man who Caught Crippen. He has also published four volumes of Fascinating F1 Facts.\nSaward is the son of clergyman Canon Michael Saward (died 2015) and the brother of activist Jill Saward (died 2017).\nHe lives in France.\n2024 Online abuse\nOn 26th September 2024, Saward published an edition of his regular Green Notebook feature on his online blog in which he stated there was a paddock rumour circulating that Sergio Pérez would retire after the 2024 Mexico City Grand Prix. Saward's decision to publish the rumour drew the ire of Pérez's supporters online (particularly on the X platform) some of which were purely abusive or contained what he perceived to be death threats. Saward condemned the abuse in a blog post response on 2nd October 2024 announcing he would be restricting access to his X posts to approved followers only.\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://joesaward.wordpress.com/ Joe Saward's blog]\n*[http://www.flatoutpublishing.com/jsbm/ JSBM Newsletter]\n*[https://grandprixplus.com/ GrandPrix+, F1 e-Magazine]\n*[https://missedapexpodcast.com/ Missed Apex podcast]"
