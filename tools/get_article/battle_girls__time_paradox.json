She ends up encountering the feudal lord, Nobunaga Oda, and helps on her quest to gather the pieces of a Crimson Armor that will help her conquer the land.\nCharacters\nThe characters share the names of various historic figures in Feudal Japan, albeit their given names are spelled out in katakana.\n;\n:\n: A ditsy schoolgirl who finds herself transported to an alternate Feudal Japan made up of women. She at first struggles to fit in with her new world and often brings a lot of modern ethics to this time, including finding uses for her mobile phone despite not being able to get a reception. She is made Oda's retainer after showing skill with a staff, although she isn't good with combat and can't use magic. She is nicknamed \"Hideyoshi\" after Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\n;\n:\n: A feudal lord who desires to gather pieces of a mystical armor to unite the nations. While very short-tempered, aggressive, and overconfident, in the course of the story she becomes more benevolent, considerate, and caring under Hideyoshi's influence. She wields a large sword and appears to be able to control flames. She habitually carries around a kiseru given to her by her grandmother Nobubasa as a good luck charm, despite never smoking it.\n;\n:\n: Nobunaga's humble aide, who is often bemused at her acceptance of Hideyoshi's odd behavior and is secretly infatuated with Nobunaga. To this end, she is prepared to do whatever it takes to \"make Nobunaga happy\", which is why she is willing to acquire the Crimson Armor set on her feudal lord's behalf. Subconsequently, she is also jealous, at times, with Hide's interactions with Nobunaga. She bears a resemblance to one of Hideyoshi's classmates from her time and is often nicknamed  by Hideyoshi due to this likeness. Her weapon of choice is the kunai.\n;\n:\n: A warrior affiliated with Nobunaga and Mitsuhide, who is secretly Hideyoshi's teacher from the present. After witnessing a family member from the distant future arriving before her and then disappearing again, she decided to go back in time to find the Crimson Armor whose legend her descendant had discovered, in order to put Japan's history \"on the right track\" under the rule of her family. However, she did not know about the Armor's evil influence. Like Hideyoshi, she can't fight and possesses no magical abilities.\n;\n:\n: A feudal lord whose primary weapon is a yumi. She owned the left leg of the Crimson Armor but lost it to Nobunaga in a game. She is often bored and considers Nobunaga 'fun'. To her, Tokugawa is nothing short of a cute little sister. In episode 7, she is revealed to be a yuri fan.\n;\n:\n: Yoshimoto's retainer, who wields a priestess staff and magic in battle. Despite appearing to be gentle and obedient, Ieyasu is actually manipulative and also after the Crimson Armor. She bears a resemblance to one of Hideyoshi's classmates and is nicknamed  by Hideyoshi as a result. After being freed from the armor's evil influence, she realizes the error of her ways and becomes more benevolent.\n;\n:\n: A feudal general who wields a large fan and controls wind and fire. She owns a section of the Crimson Armor and is friends/rivals with Kenshin. She is rather awkward in expressing herself, and appears to be unaware of the power of the Armor.\n;\n:\n: A feudal lord who wields a spear and utilizes lightning. She owns a section of the Crimson Armor and is friends/rivals with Shingen. She appears to be unaware of the power of the Armor.\n;\n:\n: A bespectacled ninja (of many identical ones) who serves Ieyasu.\n;\n:\n: A male, slightly lecherous dog which wears a feudal helmet and has the ability to talk, though he only talks around Hideyoshi (and later Ms. Date). He is knowledgeable about the world and time, and the fact Hideyoshi is not from it.\n; Nobubasa\n: Oda's grandmother, who only appears in flashbacks in the series.\nMedia\nAnime\nThe anime aired in Japan on TV Tokyo between April 5, 2011, and June 27, 2011, and was simulcast by Crunchyroll.

After Nobunaga frees Hideyoshi, she punishes Mitsuhide for disobeying her by stealing her glasses before going to meet Kenshin and Shingen herself, challenging them both to a battle for the armor.

The others soon learn they can't leave the forest until they tell all 100 stories, which proves to be difficult since none of Nobunaga's stories are scary and Mitsuhide is easily frightened. Being mocked by the others, Hideyoshi gives Nobunaga a story from her time, the performance of which proves to be so scary it puts out all the remaining candles, allowing the dead samurai to pass on and the others to leave.

However, as they prepare to head back, Hideyoshi accidentally activates the security system, filling the way back with deadly traps.

After another long hike, they came across a village with a hot spring, which Hideyoshi spends too long in and catches a fever.

She explains she had encountered a Date clan member from the future, later discovering a jewel that could send her through time and a scroll containing the legend of the Crimson Armor. As Ieyasu sneaks into the castle to try to retrieve the remaining pieces of armor, Masamune warns Hideyoshi that the armor will go out of control if not equipped with the jewel she brought with her. Ieyasu uses her magic to activate the armor, awakening its dark power, which then takes control of her.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = As Ieyasu becomes possessed by the armor's evil influence and unleashes her power on the village, Hanzō, who realizes that Ieyasu is no longer the Ieysau he knew, begs the others to help save her.

As her friends stand to fight against her should she try, Nobunaga uses this distraction to knock away and destroy the armor, saying there is no need for it, bringing Masamune back to her senses. Afterward, as the feudal lords return to their homelands, Masamune tells Hideyoshi that they need to return to their own time. In the epilogue, Hideyoshi once again comes late to school and later stops in front of the temple and spots a dog who reminds her of Shiro. When she confronts the dog, she discovers it is Shiro, who is elated to see Hideyoshi, but he can't play with her because of an important mission he has to complete.
