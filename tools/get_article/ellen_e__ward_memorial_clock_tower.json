Ward Memorial Clock Tower (also known as the Roslyn Clock Tower) is a historic clock tower in the Village of Roslyn, Nassau County, New York. It is considered the symbol of Roslyn and appears on that village's official seal.\nHistory\nThe clock tower was constructed in 1895 as a memorial to Ellen E. Ward (1826–1893), who was a prominent and active Roslyn resident best known for donating the historic horse trough located within the village. The tower was commissioned by Ward's children. The tower was designed by the firm of Lamb & Rich.\nThe clock tower was rehabilitated in the 1990s and 2000s, and for its centennial in 1995, the Town of North Hempstead sold the tower to the Village of Roslyn for $1. The rehabilitation efforts experienced delays in the 2000s due to various reasons, including trouble securing grant money from New York following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The rehabilitation efforts were finally completed after 11 years in 2006.\nIt is listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and on the New York State Register of Historic Places, and is a contributing property to the Main Street Historic District.\nSpecifications\n* Tower height: approximately  (although some sources claim it is approximately 55 feet (17 m))\n* Exterior materials: granite & sandstone\n* Clockworks manufacturer: Seth Thomas & Co.\n* Clock type: weight-driven\n* Bell weight: approximately\nSee also\n* Main Street Historic District (Roslyn, New York)\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in North Hempstead (town), New York.\nReferences"
