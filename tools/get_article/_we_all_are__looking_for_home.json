Warren wrote the track \"You Knew Me When\" for Lewis' fifth studio album, I Am (2015). As Lewis and Warren are animal rights activists, they decided to work together again on a track that would raise awareness of the torturous cruelty to dogs around the world.-\n\"(We All Are) Looking for Home\" was recorded and released to raise awareness of The Vanderpump Dog Foundation, owned by Lisa Vanderpump and Ken Todd. Speaking about the campaign, Todd said, \"It is our vision that this song will represent a movement to a more humane world for dogs everywhere and symbolize the global outcry for change.\" Vanderpump expressed her excitement at working with Lewis and Warren, adding, \"We are very excited to be working alongside such innovative women like Diane and Leona. They are just as passionate about this campaign as we are, and we truly appreciate their support.\" The song supported the Stop Yulin Forever campaign in particular, which advocates for the end of the Lychee and Dog Meat Festival. The festival, which takes place in June each year, sees up to 10,000 dogs and cats slaughtered for their meat.\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Country\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 17 June 2016\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Digital download\n| rowspan=\"3\"| The Vanderpump Dog Foundation\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United States\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
