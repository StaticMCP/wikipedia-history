It started with the arrival of the Soyuz MS-12 spacecraft carrying Aleksey Ovchinin, Nick Hague and Christina Koch, joining Oleg Kononenko, David Saint-Jacques, and Anne McClain, who transferred from Expedition 58. The expedition formally began on March 15, 2019 (March 14 in the Americas). Ovchinin and Hague were originally meant to fly to the ISS aboard Soyuz MS-10, but returned to Earth minutes after takeoff due to a contingency abort. The expedition formally ended with the undocking of the Soyuz MS-11 spacecraft carrying Kononenko, Saint-Jacques and McClain on 24 June 2019; Ovchinin, Hague and Koch transferred to Expedition 60.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Position\n!Crew member\n|-\n!Commander\n| colspan=2 align=center| Oleg Kononenko, RoscosmosFourth spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer\n| colspan=2 align=center | David Saint-Jacques, CSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer\n| colspan=2 align=center | Anne McClain, NASAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer\n| colspan=2 align=center | Aleksey Ovchinin, RoscosmosSecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer\n|colspan=2 align=center | Nick Hague, NASAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer\n| colspan=2 align=center | Christina Koch, NASAFirst spaceflight\n|}\nSpacewalks\n{| class=\"wikitable sticky-header\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #cfccfc;\" | EVA #\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #cfccfc;\" | Spacewalkers\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #cfccfc;\" | Start (UTC)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #cfccfc;\" | End (UTC)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #cfccfc;\" | Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1\n| Anne McClain Nick Hague\n|22March 2019,12:01\n|22March 2019,18:40\n|6hours, 39minutes\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |McClain and Hague installed adapter plates while Dextre swaps the batteries between spacewalks. Get aheads included removing debris from the Unity Module in preparation for the arrival of Cygnus NG-11 in April, stowing tools for the repair of the flex hose rotary coupler, and securing tiebacks on the solar array blanket boxes.  This spacewalk was originally going to be carried out by European astronaut Alexander Gerst and Hague as part of Expedition 57, although it was delayed due to the Soyuz MS-10 launch abort.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2\n| Nick Hague Christina Koch\n|29March 2019,11:42\n|29March 2019,18:27\n|6hours, 45minutes\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Hague and Koch finished the work of the first spacewalk and installed the final three adapter plates on the other side of the P4 Truss. The crew also transferred some tools and installed a grapple bar on the flex hose rotary coupler. Between spacewalks, Dextre will change the batteries and the exposed pallet will be loaded onto HTV-8 to be jettisoned into space where it will burn up. One of the batteries malfunctioned and will be removed by Dextre and discarded. Dextre will also replace a Battery Discharge Unit and will bring the failed unit which was damaged by the short inside where it will be returned to earth on SpaceX CRS-17. Until it is repaired P4 will use the old batteries left on the station as spares. Get aheads included installing gap spanners and breaking torque on the P6 batteries in preparation for their replacement by Expedition 62 crew members this summer. Hague also inspected sockets on P6 so the foot restraints could be attached. This spacewalk was supposed to be done by Anne McClain and Christina Koch as an all female spacewalk but because of problems with Christina's suit and the spare suit not ready or properly sized Anne McClain will have to sit this spacewalk out and will have to go out with David on the next spacewalk. This spacewalk became the first for Koch who became the 14th woman to walk in space.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|3\n| Anne McClain David Saint-Jacques\n|8April 2019,11:31\n|8April 2019,18:00\n|6hours, 30minutes\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |McClain and Saint Jacques routed cables to be used as a redundant power supply for Canadarm2. The crew installed studs on the Columbus Module in preparation for the installation of an exposed facility. The crew removed an adapter plate and reinstalled an old set of batteries as spares to replace a failed battery that malfunctioned on the last spacewalk. Saint Jacques became the first Canadian crew member to walk in space and the fourth Canadian to do a spacewalk since Chris Hadfield\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |4\n| Oleg Kononenko Aleksey Ovchinin\n|29May 2019,15:42\n|29May 2019,21:43\n|6hours, 1minute\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Kononenko and Ovichinin removed experiments from the Pirs docking compartment and cleaned the windows. They also installed a handrail to connect Zarya to Poisk and re-positioned the Plume Measuring Unit. The crew then moved to the Zvesda Service Module and removed and jettisoned the Plasma Monitoring Units. Before they closed the hatch they sent a video of themselves and sang happy birthday in Russian to Alexei Leonov who was the first spacewalker and was celebrating his 85th birthday.\n|}\nUncrewed spaceflights to the ISS\nResupply missions that visited the International Space Station during Expedition 59:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!

The expedition will also conduct experiments on regolith simulants, Earth's atmospheric carbon cycle, and Astrobee robots designed to conduct routine chores aboard the ISS.\nNotes\nReferences"
