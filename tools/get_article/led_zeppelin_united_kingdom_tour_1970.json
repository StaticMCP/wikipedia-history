The tour commenced on 7 January and concluded on 17 February 1970.\nThis tour is arguably best known for the band's performance at the Royal Albert Hall on 9 January. According to Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, the Royal Albert Hall was \"at the time the largest and most prestigious gig in London\". In 1970, Led Zeppelin commissioned the British director and producer of the BBC's In Concert at the time, Stanley Dorfman, to film Led Zeppelin Live At The Royal Albert Hall, during which Dorfman and the two cameramen he hired, Peter Whitehead and an assistant, used handheld Bolex cameras to capture the concert on 16mm film. Virtually all the footage from the Royal Albert Hall concert was featured as Disk One of Led Zeppelin DVD in 2003. The audio portions were digitally remixed for stereo and 5.1 surround mixes. Audio recordings of two songs from the concert, \"We're Gonna Groove\" and \"I Can't Quit You Baby\", had earlier been released on the 1982 album Coda. In 2022, Led Zeppelin released portions of 1970 Royal Albert Hall footage as three official music videos, Dazed and Confused (Live at The Royal Albert Hall 1970), How Many More Times (Live at The Royal Albert Hall 1970), and What Is and What Should Never Be (Live at The Royal Albert Hall 1970).\nOne concert from this tour, at Edinburgh on 7 February, was postponed for 10 days owing to vocalist Robert Plant suffering a minor car accident, in which he sustained some facial injuries.\nFor all but one of these concerts, the band did not use any supporting act, although Barclay James Harvest did support them at the Edinburgh Usher Hall gig on 17 February. This would be a trend to continue on subsequent Led Zeppelin concert tours.\nTour set list\nThe fairly typical set list for the tour was:\n#\"We're Gonna Groove\" (King, Bethea)\n#\"I Can't Quit You Baby\" (Dixon)\n#\"Dazed and Confused\" (Page)\n#\"Heartbreaker\" (Bonham, Jones, Page, Plant)\n#\"White Summer\"/\"Black Mountain Side\" (Page)\n#\"Since I've Been Loving You\" (Page, Plant, Jones)\n#\"Thank You\" (Page, Plant)\n#\"What Is and What Should Never Be\" (Page, Plant) (9 January only)\n#\"Moby Dick\" (Bonham)\n#\"How Many More Times\" (Bonham, Jones, Page)\nEncores (variations of the following list):\n*\"Communication Breakdown\" (Bonham, Jones, Page)\n*\"Whole Lotta Love\" (Bonham, Dixon, Jones, Page, Plant)\n*\"Bring It On Home\" (Dixon, Page, Plant) (On 7 January, 9 January, and 17 February)\n*\"Long Tall Sally\" (Little Richard) (On 9 January)\n*\"C'mon Everybody\"/\"Something Else\" (Cochran, Capehart, Sheeley, Cochran) (On 7 January and 9 January)\nThere were some set list substitutions, variations, and order switches during the tour.\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| City\n! style=\"width:140px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:220px;\"| Venue\n|-\n|7 January 1970 || Birmingham || rowspan=\"7\"|England || Birmingham Town Hall\n|-\n|8 January 1970 || Bristol || Colston Hall\n|-\n|9 January 1970 || London || Royal Albert Hall\n|-\n|13 January 1970 || Portsmouth || Portsmouth Guildhall\n|-\n|15 January 1970 || Newcastle upon Tyne || Newcastle City Hall\n|-\n|16 January 1970 || Sheffield || Sheffield City Hall\n|-\n|24 January 1970 || Leeds || University of Leeds Refectory\n|-\n|17 February 1970 || Edinburgh || Scotland || Usher Hall\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ledzeppelin.com/timelinebrowse Comprehensive archive of known concert appearances by Led Zeppelin (official website)]\n*[http://www.bootledz.com/setlists.htm Led Zeppelin concert setlists]\n*[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=117377988734231201134.0004566e8219bed40c5fa&ll=53.566414,-0.944824&spn=10.163362,19.775391&z=6 View in Google Earth]\nSources\n*Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. ."
