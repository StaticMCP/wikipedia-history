The ceremony was held at Centrepointe Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario, on 6 October 2013 and was hosted by Ryan Belleville.\nCanadian Comedy Awards, also known as Beavers, were awarded in 26 categories. Winners in 5 categories were chosen by the public through an online poll and others were chosen by members of industry organizations.  The awards ceremony concluded the Canadian Comedy Awards Festival which ran from 3 to 6 October and included over 20 comedy events.\nThe films My Awkward Sexual Adventure and Please Kill Mr. Know It All led with six nominations each, followed by the film Dead Before Dawn 3D and TV series Seed with five.  My Awkward Sexual Adventure won two Beavers, as did TV series Mr. D and Mark Little for web series Dad Drives.  Colin Mochrie was named Canadian comedy person of the year.\nFestival and ceremony\nThe 14th Canadian Comedy Awards (CCA) was held in Ottawa, Ontario.  The gala awards ceremony was held on 6 October 2013 at Centrepointe Theatre hosted by Ryan Belleville. Belleville had previously hosted the 2007 CCA awards ceremony and won the Bluma Appel Award in 2001.\nThe awards ceremony concluded the four-day Canadian Comedy Awards Festival which ran from 3 to 6 October, with over 20 events at venues including Yuk Yuk's, Absolute Comedy, Arts Council Theatre, and Centrepointe Theatre.  Alan Thicke hosted a 4 October show featuring Ottawa natives Jon Dore, Jeremy Hotz, Tom Green, Mike MacDonald and Rebecca Kohler, and a headline show with stand-up comedians Harland Williams, Nikki Payne and Seán Cullen on 5 October.  The shows raised money for MacDonald who was making a comeback following a liver transplant. On the same evening as the Ottawa showcase, a Toronto Comedy All-Stars show was scheduled at the National Arts Centre, in what some called the Battle of Ontario.\nAmong the talks by industry experts was a discussion panel with Tim Long, executive producer of The Simpsons and former head-writer for David Letterman. This was the first year the festival included francophone talent with the show Le Spectacle Francophone at Yuk Yuk's on 4 October.\nPublished with the festival guide was a compact history of the capital region, Ottawa: Gateway to Carp. Written by John Mazerolle with assistance from other comedians, it suggests that the infamous tedium of Ottawa made fertile ground for the growth of comedy. Festival founder and Ottawa native Tim Progosh suggested that as a government town, there has been a variety of cultures which raises one's reference level, combined with an oral tradition of the Rideau Valley where Irish and French immigrants met and shared stories.\nThe Jokers vs. Senators Alumni charity hockey game was held at Bell Sensplex on 5 October.  A cocktail reception raised money for the Ottawa public library.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nomination criteria were altered this year so that feature film and television categories could include works released on the Internet.\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface:\nMultimedia\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Canadian Comedy Person of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Feature Film\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Colin Mochrie\n* Gerry Dee\n* Lauren Ash\n* Steve Patterson\n* Sugar Sammy\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Goon\n* Dead Before Dawn 3D\n* My Awkward Sexual Adventure\n* Please Kill Mr. Know It All\n* Unlucky\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Direction in a Feature\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Writing in a Feature\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Sean Garrity – My Awkward Sexual Adventure\n* April Mullen – Dead Before Dawn 3D\n* Sandra Feldman, Colin Carter – Please Kill Mr. Know It All\n* Ian A.
