There is also a competition at the local level in the United States and Canada.\nThe awards categories include network TV, TV stations, cable networks, cable systems, network radio, radio stations, syndication distributors, and interactive media. At one point, they also included the Brandon Tartikoff Award, although it has not been awarded in several years. In 2024, Promax rebranded as The Global Entertainment Marketing Academy of Arts & Sciences (G.E.M.A.) and announced an expansion beyond TV and Streaming into the Film, Music, Sports, and Gaming industries.\nWinners in the past have included FX Networks, Showtime, Red Bee Media, HBO, A&E Networks, 4Creative, S4C Ysgolion, 5Creative, Les Télécréateurs Paris, Rogers Media, and Bell Media Agency.\nPromax and Broadcast Design Association\nPromax was established in 1956 as a non-profit association for promotion and marketing professionals working in broadcast media. In 1997, the Broadcast Design Association (BDA) who had partnered with Promax for years on their annual conference, officially joined with Promax.\nThe PromaxBDA awards replaced earlier awards presented separately by Promax and the Broadcast Designers Association (BDA). Thousands of PromaxBDA awards have been presented to companies and individuals whose work is judged by a panel of promotion and marketing professionals using three measures: overall creativity, production quality, and results in achieving marketing objectives.\nThe Global Entertainment Marketing Academy of Arts & Sciences (GEMA)\nFounded in the United States in 1956 as the Broadcast Promotion Association (BPA), in 1985, the organization changed its name to Broadcast Promotion & Marketing Executives (BPME). In 1993, the organization again changed its name to PROMAX (a loose acronym for Promotion and Marketing Executives). A merger with the Broadcast Design Association (BDA) in 1997 created PromaxBDA. In 2019, the organization dropped BDA and reverted to Promax. In 2024, Promax rebranded to The Global Entertainment Marketing Academy of Arts & Sciences (GEMA).\nThe association holds conferences, award competitions and online publications  for their members, and present networking opportunities. Stacy La Cotera is the current President & CEO. The Board of Directors is composed of senior entertainment marketing executives and is currently chaired by Linnea Hemenez, SVP of International Marketing Starz and Alan Beard, CEO of Synonymous Technologies. Previous Promax chairs include, Steph Sebbag, CEO of Los Angeles–based creative agency BPG, Joe Earley, head of marketing for Disney+, (formerly COO, Fox Television Group, Lisa Gregorian, President & CMO, Warner Bros.
