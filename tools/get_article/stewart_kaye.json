Working in a stripped down Scottish version of the Art Deco style he was consultant architect to the Presbytery of East Lothian and the Halifax Building Society. Mainly based in Edinburgh he is responsible for a large proportion of the city's housing estates from the 1930s.\nLife\nHe was born in or near Broughty Ferry near Dundee in 1885 the son of James Kaye a cashier with the North British Railway Company. He was educated at Grove Academy in Dundee. He then studied engineering and architecture at the Technical College in Dundee and Dundee University and was articled to James McLaren of Dundee before traveling more widely: he spent some time with George Rivell in Alnwick; then George W. B. Rees in Cardiff; J. E. Rickards in London. In 1905 he did a study tour in the Netherlands and Belgium and in 1906 went to Italy.\nHe set up practice in 1913 in Dunfermline but moved to Gillespie Crescent in Edinburgh in 1914. His career was interrupted by the First World War, during which he first served with the Royal Scots then was commissioned into the Royal Engineers, reaching the rank of Captain. He was demobbed in 1919 and resumed his career. He was proposed as a member of the RIBA in 1920 by Alexander Lorne Campbell and Harold Tarbolton. He was also a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Surveyors.\nIn 1925 he was involved in making a photographic record of Amisfield House in East Lothian prior to its demolition.\nBetween the wars he oversaw and designed some truly huge housing schemes in Edinburgh, in liaison with City Architect Ebenezer James MacRae who also worked with Kaye on Gogarburn Hospital.\nIn the Second World War he was Director of Emergency Works in Scotland (a highly important role) and was involved in the location and specification of the structure of air raid shelters across the country.\nWhen he returned to work after the war, despite his son joining the firm, his style was well out of date. He retired due to ill health soon after taking on Colin McWilliam as an assistant at his offices at 13 Thistle Street.\nIn later life he lived at 5 Wester Coates Terrace; a large semi-detached villa in West Edinburgh.\nHe died on 17 February 1952 and is buried in the 20th century detached north extension to Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh.
