Military culture is the most important component of military life. The major cultural events held by the Russian military are primarily aimed at strengthening esprit de corps as well as advancing the historical traditions of the Armed Forces of Russia. The Ministry of Defence of Russia regularly holds cultural events at various levels. The central cultural institutions of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation are actively working in all military districts.\nOfficial traditions and customs\nThese traditions are upheld by the Ground Forces, Aerospace Forces, the Navy, the Strategic Missile Forces and the Airborne Forces.\nHolidays\n* Joint service\n** February 23 - Defender of the Fatherland Day\n** February 15 - International Duties Memorial Day is a veterans day that honors those who served in the Soviet–Afghan War and during combined-arms actions of the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War (e.g. Sino-Soviet border conflict, Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and Ogaden War).\n* Service branches\n** October 1 - Russian Ground Forces Day marks the raising of the first units of the Streltsy by Ivan the Terrible in 1550.\n** August 12 - Russian Air Force Day\n** Last Sunday of July - Navy Day\n** December 17 - Strategic Missile Troops Day was introduced in 1995 to commemorate the establishment of the strategic missile forces on 17 December 1959.\n** August 2 - Paratroopers' Day\n** October 24 - Day of Special Forces honors the 1950 raising of the first Spetsnaz companies\n*Specialized forces\n**February 27 - Special Operations Forces Day commemorates establishment of annexation of Crimea in 2014\n**August 6 - Russian Railway Troops Day\n**October 4 - Russian Aerospace Defense Forces Day marks the anniversary of the 1957 launch of the Sputnik satellite.\n**November 19 - Day of the Missile Forces and Artillery commemorate the artillery strikes employed at Battle of Stalingrad in 1942.\n**November 27 - Naval Infantry Day honors the 1705 date of the raising of the first units of today's Russian Marines by Peter the Great.\n**Second Sunday of September - Day of Tankmen\n**19 September - Gunsmith Day honors personnel of the Military-Industrial Commission and the defense industry of Russia.\nEvents\non 24 June.]]\nVictory Day Parades are held throughout the country, being unique to Russia and a common traditional military event on Victory Day. The Moscow Victory Day Parade is the main parade of these to be held in Russia, being held on the Russian capital's main square, Red Square. The first of these parades was held in 1995, just five years after the fall of the Soviet Union, held to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Soviet and allied victory in the Second World War.\nDrill\nCommands\n* Present arms - The command ''Na k'rah-ool! (На Караул!), also known as On Guard or Present Arms, is a command used for, with the preparatory command usually being Eyes on the Right and/or Eyes on the Left or Eyes on the Front. With an SKS rifle, present arms is carried out in two steps: through holding the rifle with the right hand, then, raising the rifle to the center of the chest, holding the rifle neck with the left, and then finally, the right hand moving to barrel of the rifle. When carrying an assault rifle, personnel will put the left hand flat over the neck of the weapon.\n* At attention - The command of attention is known as Smer-nah (Смирно), during which soldiers of any unit snap their heads to the front and hold their chin up.\nMarch step\ngoose-stepping near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.]]\nThe goose step is the standard marching step utilized by the Russian military. Originating in Prussian Army in the mid-18th century, it spread to Russia in the 19th century and was fully utilized by the Imperial Russian Army in the early 20th century. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union trained the militaries of its client states (particularly those in the Warsaw Pact) with Soviet ceremonial military drill, leading to its adoption in many Third World countries. A notable example of this in action was the East German Nationale Volksarmee, in which the Soviets encouraged a Prussian-style goose step.\nHeraldry\nEach branch of the Armed Forces has a representative colour, with a ceremonial colour also corresponding to the entire military. This colour was first introduced on 8 December 2000. Being implemented later that month, it was simply a plain red field, symbolizing the traditional red color of the Soviet Armed Forces and its predecessor the Red Army. The present official colour was adopted by order of the State Duma in June 2003, consisting of the coat of arms of Russia on the obverse side and the emblem of the armed forces, a double-headed eagle holding a sword and a laurel wreath, on the reverse side. While having elements of the military flags dating back to the latter years of the Russian Empire, it also contains four golden stars in each corner to honor its Soviet heritage. The reverse side also contains two pieces of text stylised as Old Slavonic script, with the top side containing the inscription \"Fatherland\" (\"Отечество\") and the bottom side containing \"Duty\" (\"Долг\") and \"Honor\" (\"Честь\").\nMottos and battle cries\nList of unit mottos:\n* С нами Бог и Андреевский флаг!''

It effectively serves as cultural center for the improvement of civil–military relations. In the early days of the USSR, these institutions were known as Houses of the Red Army. Events in the building include cultural activities that meet spiritual and cultural need for military/civilian personnel of the Armed Forces. Similar tasks are present in the Officers Houses of the armed forces of post-Soviet republics. During the Soviet era, party conferences were held for members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The main Russian officer house is the Central House of Officers of the Russian Army, located on Suvorov Square in Moscow.\nCentral Naval Library\nThe Federal State Treasury Institution of Culture and Art \"Central Naval Library\" of the Ministry of Defense is the oldest and largest library in the Armed Forces, serving as an information, bibliographic and methodological center for all libraries of the Russian Navy. The history of the Central Naval Library dates back to 25 November 1799, when the \"Committee for Discussion of Issues on Shipbuilding and Navigation\" was established under the Admiralty Board, subordinate to the President of the Admiralty Collegium, Tsar Paul I of Russia. The committee began to form a collection on maritime history, which laid the foundation for the first Maritime Library of St. Petersburg. The library has a color Atlas of Admiral Adam Johann von Krusenstern round-the-world travel, published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1813. In 2018, the library received as a gift documents from the personal archive of Minister of Defense, General Sergey Shoygu. In 2017, the book collections of the branch of the Central Naval Library returned to the Admiralty. In April 2018, the move of the Central Naval Library from the Mikhailovsky Castle to the reconstructed building on Vasilievsky Island was completed.\nThe Arts\nTheaters\nThe Armed Forces' theatrical production houses and entities include:\n*Central Academic Theater of the Russian Army\n*Drama Theater of the Eastern Military District\n*Drama Theater of the Northern Fleet\n*Drama Theater of the Baltic Fleet\n*Drama Theater of the Pacific Fleet\n*Drama Theater of the Black Sea Fleet\nMilitary Artists' Studio\nThe Mitrofan Grekov Military Artists' Studio  is a creative team that was founded in 1934 in memory of Soviet artist Mitrofan Grekov, the founder of Soviet battle painting.

More than 70 panoramas and dioramas, ranging from the first Soviet panorama \"Battle of Stalingrad\", to a recreation of Franz Roubaud's panorama \"Battle of Borodino\", have seen the involvement of the studio. It is a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and the Order of the Red Star.\nFilm Studio\nThe Film Studio of the Ministry of Defense () creates educational films for the Russian Armed Forces and is responsible for the distribution of military educational, documentary and technical propaganda for the MoD and the Russian government. The film studio was formed in 1960 in Leningrad in order to unite the scattered film studios, initially, being subordinate to the Main Directorate of Combat Training of the Ground Forces, and has been subordinate to the branch since 1998. In 1963, the film studio was transferred to Moscow on the territory of the former air defense town (Vykhino). In the same year, a film group was created at the General Staff to plan the production of films for the Armed Forces. Seven years later, it was transformed into the Department of Military Training Films of the Soviet Ministry of Defence. In 1985, the film studio was awarded the Order of the Red Star for its services in generalizing the experience of World War II. At its peak in the mid-1980s, the studio had 19 officers and 516 employees from the Soviet Army. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the film studio was greatly reduced and relocated to Bolshevo near Moscow, on the territory of its former branch. The level of funding has decreased, and, consequently, the number of films released was minimal.\n]]\nSong and Dance Ensembles\nThe Armed Forces hosts the following song and dance ensembles:\n* Alexandrov Ensemble - official ensemble of the Armed Forces and its most senior ensemble\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Western Military District\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Central Military District\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Southern Military District\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Eastern Military District\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Russian Aerospace Forces\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Strategic Missile Forces \"Krasnaya Zvezda\"\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Airborne Forces\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Northern Fleet\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Baltic Fleet\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Pacific Fleet\n* Song and Dance Ensemble of the Black Sea Fleet\n* Engineering Troops Ensemble \"For Faith and Fatherland\"\nMilitary bands\nGarrison in 2010.]]\nRussian military bands fall under the jurisdiction of the Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia, which is the official music service for the Armed Forces.
