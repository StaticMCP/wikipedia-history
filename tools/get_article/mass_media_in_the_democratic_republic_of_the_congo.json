Since gaining independence from Belgium in 1960, the country has struggled with democracy. Instead, autocratic leaders have often held power.\nMobutu's rule, which began in the 1960s, was marked by his personal control and the weakening of democratic institutions. This lasted for over thirty years until he was removed from power in 1997 amid rising dissatisfaction. Despite hopes for democracy under Laurent-Desire Kabila, who took over, his time in office was marked by conflict and a decline in freedoms, including those related to the press. Joseph Kabila's leadership also faced criticism for similar issues.\nThroughout these changes, the media landscape in the DRC reflected the country's political shifts. Sometimes, there was more openness, but at other times, dissent was suppressed, and the government controlled the narrative. Despite these challenges, there were some positive steps, like the establishment of independent electoral commissions.\nConstitution\nThe DRC's constitution was established in 1964 to bolster the presidency post-independence. It underwent revisions during the country's transition to Zaire in 1971 under President Mobutu. Further changes followed until a transitional constitution was adopted in 2003, as part of the 2002 Global and Inclusive Agreement in Sun City, South Africa. The current constitution took effect in 2006, with amendments made in 2011.\nEnsuring the safety and protection of journalists and press freedom has been a longstanding challenge for the DRC. However, recent constitutional revisions have aimed to safeguard freedom of expression and the right to information. Article 23 grants individuals the freedom to express themselves through speech, print, and images, provided it adheres to the law and public morals. Article 24 focuses on the right to information, allowing the press to broadcast via radio and television within legal and moral boundaries.\nIn March 2023, the DRC introduced [https://internews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ARISA-IEA-CHAPTER-6-DRC.pdf Ordinance Law 23/009], impacting Articles 23 and 24 of the constitution. This law replaced the stringent 1996 ordinance that severely restricted press freedom and expression. However, the new laws carry harsh penalties for disseminating false information, particularly targeting figures in authority, potentially empowering authorities rather than protecting journalists.\nMedia coverage in the DRC often prioritizes current political affairs over economic, social, and developmental news. Many outlets and organizations exhibit bias towards certain political candidates, and corruption remains a prevalent issue.\nFreedom of speech and the press\nWhile the constitution provides for freedom of speech and the press, the government has restricted this right in practice. Arrests, murders and other harassment of journalists is frequently reported.\nIn 2009, the freedom of the press global ranking released each year by Reporters Without Borders ranked the Democratic Republic of the Congo at 146 out of 175 countries.\nThere are several organizations monitoring freedom of the press in the Democratic Republic of the Congo:\n* Union nationale de la presse congolaise\n* Journaliste en danger\n\"Coupage\"\nMany journalists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are subjected to the practise of coupage (in English: cutting), where journalists are paid to write articles on behalf of persons who are the article's actual subject. Press independence remains stifled. There are two significant impacts from this practise:\n* it affects the principle of remuneration of some journalists, enabling the Congolese print media to make it difficult for journalists to earn a living from legitimate journalism alone;\n* it makes it easier to bribe the press, as much for partisan articles as for articles containing generally neutral information.\nHaute Autorité des Médias & Efforts\nThe Haute Autorité des Médias (HAM), established in 2004, aims to promote responsible media practices while preventing the spread of hate speech and incitement to violence, especially regarding ethnic and tribal issues. However, the HAM faces challenges in asserting its regulatory authority across the Congo.\nIn 2016, Journalists for Human Rights (JHR) organized training sessions for journalists covering politics, leading to government acknowledgment of malpractice and a formal apology, enhancing journalist protection.\nOrdinance Law 23/009\nWhile the [https://internews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ARISA-IEA-CHAPTER-6-DRC.pdf new ordinance law 23/009] is an improvement over the previous one, critics from Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and Journaliste en Danger (JED) have criticized its lack of specificity regarding press independence and source confidentiality. Organizations like RSF and Free Press Limited are advocating for further measures to protect journalists and media channels.\nThe DRC's press freedom ranking is currently ranked  124th in the 2023 Reporters Without Borders index.\nPrint\nThere are currently 540 newspapers in the country. Major newspapers are only nominally privately owned. Journalists must be members of the state-controlled union to practise their profession. The press today is firmly under MPR control. The largest dailies were Elima, ''Courrier d'Afrique, and Salongo (fr) (10,000).\nThe majority of print press publications are in French, an official language of the country. Despite their ambitions of national news coverage, it is difficult for these publications to attain broad coverage, both due to challenges in gathering information, and in physically distributing the publications. Many journalists are therefore tied to a city or a region, essentially Kinshasa.\nSeveral daily newspapers are published, of which the majority have a pro-government bias. Some newspapers are published irregularly.\nPrint publications\n;Daily publications\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name !!

In 2002 there were an estimated 10,000 mainline phones in use nationwide. In 2003 there were an estimated 19 cell phones in use for every 1,000 people. State-controlled radio and television transmissions, operated under Radio-Television Nationale Congolaise (RTNC), are the prominent broadcasting stations, reaching the largest number of citizens. The RTNC radio broadcast of La Voix du Congo, is available in French, Swahili, Lingala, Tshiluba, and Kikongo. There are also many privately run broadcasting stations. In 2001, there were 3 AM and 11 FM radio stations and 4 television stations. In 2003, there were an estimated 385 radios and 2 television sets for every 1,000 people.\nTelevision\nSince 1990 many television stations have been broadcasting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 2006, 58 television channels were available. Of these, 38 are in Kinshasa.\nTelevision stations\n* Action Missionnaire d'Évangélisation des nations TV\n* Africa TV\n* Antenne A, à Kinshasa\n* Canal Congo Télévision (CC TV)\n* Canal Kin Télévision (CKTV)\n* Canal Tropical Télévision (Tropicana TV)\n* Congo Education Broadcasting System (CEBS)\n* Couleurs Télévision\n* Congo Web TV\n* CMB TV\n* Musique Various & Le T.P.
