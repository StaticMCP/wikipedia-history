Specifically, King focused often on the \"inner lives\" of intelligent animals like primates, the octopus, squid, pigs, and dolphins, arguing that humanity should consider how best to communicate and accommodate these species' lives without anthropomorphization or exploitation.\nKing also utilized the blog format to relate personal stories for a general audience, such as her treatment for uterine cancer (2013) and her retirement from active teaching (2015).\nKing has been a full-time science writer since 2015, publishing stories in Scientific American, book reviews in the Washington Post, and essays in The Atlantic.\nA review for Animals’ Best Friends in the American Scientist described King as an \"expert on animal cognition and emotion\".\nPersonal life\nKing is a pescatarian in her personal life, stating that she supplements her \"almost-vegetarian\" diet with occasional fish. She has also described herself as a \"reducetarian\".\nSelected publications\n* The Information Continuum: Evolution of Social Information Transfer in Monkeys, Apes, and Hominids.
