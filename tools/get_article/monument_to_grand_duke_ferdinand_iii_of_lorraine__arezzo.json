In 1932 it was moved from its original location on the Piazza Grande to the present location at the intersection in front of Piazza di Murello.\nThe Grand-Duke had gained some affection from the contemporary inhabitants of Arezzo for his project, directed by his minister Vittorio Fossombroni to reclaim the marshy lands of the Valdichiana, by channelling the marsh water to flow both towards the Arno river. In the monument, the Grand Duke is represented in an anachronistic Roman toga and crowned with oak leaves, a symbol of virtue, strength, perseverance and loyalty. He holds the sceptre in his hand, the emblem of power, while at his feet lies a tamed lion.\nOn the side of the base facing Porta San Lorentino is a bas-relief attributed to the Aretine sculptor Ranieri Bartolini (1794-1856) which depicts, through an allegory, the Union between the Chiana valley and the Arno. Until a few years ago, the statue was darkened by car fumes, scarred by lichens and vandalism; the base had developed faults. During 2002-2005, it underwent restoration. In 2008 and again in 2011, the left hand of the duke was damaged by vandals.\nReferences"
