The airbase was formerly one of the two F-16 Fighting Falcon bases of the RNLAF.  The airbase lies northwest of the capital of Friesland, Leeuwarden.\nLeeuwarden Air Base is also one of the three military airbases (together with Gilze-Rijen Air Base and Volkel Air Base) that used to organise the twice-in-three-years Luchtmachtdagen ('Air Force Days') of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, consisting of air shows and static exhibits. In 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2016 Leeuwarden Air Base hosted these public demonstration days.\nSince Covid, the Luchtmachtdagen have not been held, and the demonstration flights of the F-16 and AH-64 Apache have also been halted.\nHistory\nSoesterberg AF Museum.]]\nThe airport of Leeuwarden was built in 1938, and was used as an airport between Schiphol and Eelde. The airport was used only infrequently at first, but that changed after the Germans invaded the Low Countries in 1940. The Luftwaffe used the airport as a base for their fighter aircraft (including the Messerschmitt Bf 109) and bombers. From the airbase the Germans could reach Great Britain. During World War II, and especially on the 16th and 17 September 1944, the airbase was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force.\nAfter the liberation of the Netherlands the airbase was repaired, and during the first post-war years it was used as a civil airport, and KLM ran a commercial line to Schiphol. In 1949, Leeuwarden became a dedicated military airbase.\nTwo F-16 squadrons were based at Leeuwarden Air Base: the \"swing-role\" 322 Squadron RNLAF and the Tactical Training Evaluation and Standardisation (TACTES) 323 Squadron RNLAF. 323 Squadron stood down as an F-16 Squadron on 31 October 2014 (passing the TACTES task to 322 Squadron on the same day) before being reinstated as the F-35A Test Squadron on 5 November 2014 at Eglin Air Force Base.\nIn addition, Leeuwarden Air Base was the home base of 303 Squadron RNLAF (Search and Rescue), part of the newly formed Defence Helicopter Command (DHC). It employed three Agusta Bell AB 412SP helicopters before its stand-down on 1 January 2015.\nRole and operations\nLeeuwarden Air Base was one of two Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16AM Fighting Falcon bases, which are being replaced by F-35A Lightning II, the first of which arrived at Leeuwarden on 31 October 2019.\nThe base is the location of the Fighter Weapons Instructor Training (FWIT) and the annual multinational NATO exercise \"Frisian Flag\". On 31 March 2015 six F-15Cs from the 125th Fighter Wing of the Florida Air National Guard landed at Leeuwarden Air Base to take part in Frisian Flag 2015.\nFour MQ-9 Reapers with a Ground Station will be fully air-deployable and self-supporting for global operations will be based at Leeuwarden from 2020. Future use by public services related to homeland security and surveillance (including the National Police; and customs, naval and environmental surveillance) is also planned.\nBased units\nUnits based at Leeuwarden.\nRoyal Netherlands Air Force\n*No. 306 Squadron – MQ-9A Reaper\n*No. 322 Squadron – F-35A Lightning\n*No. 323 Squadron - Air Combat Development Centre\n*No. 920 Squadron – Maintenance\n*No. 921 Squadron – Logistics\n*No. 922 Squadron – Base operations\nSee also\n*Netherlands in World War II\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.defensie.nl/organisatie/luchtmacht/vliegbases-en-luchtmachtonderdelen/leeuwarden Vliegbasis Leeuwarden - official website] (Dutch)"
