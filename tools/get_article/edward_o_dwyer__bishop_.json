He also supported Physical force republicanism stating \"God has made Ireland a nation, and while grass grows and water runs, there will be men willing to dare and die for her. It is that national spirit that will yet vindicate our glorious country and not the petty intrigues of parliamentary chicane.\"\nHe died in August 1917.\nO'Dwyer Bridge, a bridge over the Abbey River in Limerick city, is named after O'Dwyer.\nReferences"
