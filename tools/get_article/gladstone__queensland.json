In the , the Gladstone urban area had a population of 45,185 people.\nIt is  by road north-west of the state capital, Brisbane, and  south-east of Rockhampton. Situated between the Calliope and Boyne Rivers, Gladstone is home to Queensland's largest multi-commodity shipping port, the Port of Gladstone.\nGladstone is the largest town within the Gladstone Region and the headquarters of Gladstone Regional Council is located in Gladstone.\nHistory\n]]\nBefore European settlement, the Gladstone region was home of the Gooreng Gooreng, Toolooa (or Tulua), Meerooni and Baiali (or Byellee) Aboriginal tribes.\nIn May 1770, , under the command of James Cook, sailed by the entrance to Gladstone Harbour under the cover of darkness. Matthew Flinders, during his 1801–1803 circumnavigation of Australia, became the first recorded European to sight the harbour in August 1802. He named the harbour Port Curtis, after Admiral Roger Curtis, a man who was of assistance to Flinders a year earlier at the Cape of Good Hope. John Oxley conducted further exploration of the harbour and surrounding countryside in November 1823. Oxley was dismissive of the region, noting the harbour was difficult to enter, the countryside was too dry, and the timber useless for construction purposes.\nNevertheless, in 1847 the British attempted to establish the new colony of North Australia at Port Curtis. Colonel George Barney was chosen to lead this experiment in colonisation and his expedition was eventful. On 25 January 1847, the Lord Auckland, carrying 87 soldiers and convicts, arrived off the southern entrance of Port Curtis and promptly ran aground on shoals off the southern tip of Facing Island. The settlers spent seven weeks on the island before being rescued by the supply ship Thomas Lowry and delivered the intended site of settlement, the region now known as Barney Point. On 30 January at a proclamation ceremony at Settlement Point on Facing Island, Barney was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of the (already revoked) colony of North Australia. The convict settlement lasted barely two months and cost the Imperial government £15,000. A change of government in Britain ordered the withdrawal of Barney and the settlers.\nBy 1853, Francis MacCabe was surveying the site of a new town on the shores of Port Curtis under the protection of several detachments of Native Police. Maurice O'Connell was appointed government resident the following year, resulting in an influx of free settlers as land became available throughout the region.\nGladstone State School opened on 1 April 1861 and is one of the oldest state primary schools in Queensland. On 14 November 1968 it was renamed Gladstone Central State School.\nIn 1863, the town became a Municipality with Richard Hetherington elected Gladstone's first mayor. The fledgling town was named after the British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and has a 19th-century marble statue on display in its town museum.\nDevelopment of Gladstone was slow until 1893 when a meatworks was established at Parsons Point.\nParson's Point Provisional School opened on 1 August 1898, becoming Parson's Point State School on 1 February 1913. The school was relocated and renamed Gladstone South State School in 1945.\nOn 2 March 1949, a major cyclone hit Gladstone, resulting in extensive damage to the town.\nGladstone State High School opened on 2 February 1953.\nIn 1963, Queensland Alumina Limited established its alumina refinery on the site of the old meatworks. Gladstone's port facilities were expanded and the city launched into an era of industrial development and economic prosperity.\nGladstone West State School opened on 24 January 1966. In the same year, Stella Maris College, now known as Chanel College was founded.\nRosella Park State School was opened on 17 May 1971.\nClinton State School opened on 29 January 1974.\nToolooa State High School opened on 27 January 1981.\nKin Kora State School opened on 9 October 1981.\nIn 1985 the Gladstone Christian Community School opened as a primary school operated by the Gladstone Baptist Church.

The school had lost 20% of its enrolment due to families moving away to find work, leaving only 216 students in classes ranging from Prep to Year 12 making it no longer viable to operate the school.\nGladstone Cinemas, a locally owned and operated independent cinema, opened in March 2001.\nThe Gladstone Library building opened in 2003.\nHeritage listings\nGladstone has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 94 Auckland Street: Gladstone Central State School, Block B\n* Gladstone–Monto Road: Glengarry Homestead\n* Goondoon Street: Our Lady Star of the Sea Church & School\n* 1 Goondoon Street: Port Curtis Sailing Club Clubhouse\n* 33 Goondoon Street: Gladstone Post Office\n* 40 Goondoon Street: Kullaroo House\n* 114 Goondoon Street: Commonwealth Bank Building\n* 144 Goondoon Street: Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum (Old Town Hall)\n* Roseberry Street: Fig Tree\n* 6 Short Street: Port Curtis Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd Factory\n* 16 Yarroon Street: Gladstone Court House\nFile:Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church, corner of Goondoon Street and Herbert Street (view from Goondoon St), Gladstone, 2014.JPG|Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church, 2014\nFile:Port Curtis Sailing Club (view from water), Gladstone, 2014.JPG|Port Curtis Sailing Club (view from Auckland Inlet), 2014\nFile:Old Gladstone Post Office, 2014.JPG|Old Gladstone Post Office, 2014\nFile:Kullaroo House, 2014.JPG|Kullaroo House, 2014\nFile:Santos House, former Commonwealth Bank (front view), 114 Goondoon Street, Gladstone, 2014.JPG|Former Commonwealth Bank, 2014\nFile:Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum (Old Town Hall), 144 Goondoon Street, Gladstone, 2014.JPG|Gladstone Regional Art Gallery and Museum (Old Town Hall), 2014\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2021 census of population, there were 45,185 people in the Gladstone urban area.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.7% of the population.\n* 79.3% of people were born in Australia.

The Port of Gladstone is the fifth-largest multi-commodity port in Australia and the world's fourth-largest coal-exporting terminal. The port consists of a number of wharves and terminal facilities. Boyne Wharf is used by the Boyne Island aluminium smelter and was opened in August 1982. The western harbour basin has been expanded, primarily to allow increased exports of liquified natural gas (LNG). Furthermore, in 2016, a plant was constructed on Curtis Island to produce and export LNG, a construction project that contributed heavily to city's population and housing boom. Major exports include coal, alumina, aluminium, cement products, sodium cyanide and ammonium nitrate. Each year 50 million tonnes of coal passes through the port, making up 70% of the total exports.\nGladstone harbour is within the World Heritage Area of the Great Barrier Reef and has historically supported a thriving seafood industry.
