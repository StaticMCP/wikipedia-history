Both crowned their careers with invaluable chronicles of their engagement with the cinema: Tavernier with the documentary My Journey Through French Cinema, and the books \"50 Years of American Cinema\" and \"American Friends\".

Dickstein brought warmth, enthusiasm and prodigious analytic skills as a literary critic and cultural historian to writing about movies in journals like Dissent and Partisan Review, and in books like \"Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression\". Wilmington wrote beautifully and passionately about cinema as a critic for many publications, including the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, and co-authored the critical study \"John Ford\". The awards were also dedicated to Liz Weis, who stepped down after serving 47 years as executive director of the National Society of Film Critics.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://nationalsocietyoffilmcritics.com Official website]"
