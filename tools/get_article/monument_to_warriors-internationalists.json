The authors of the monument were sculptors S. A. Shcherbakov and S. S. Shcherbakov, architects Yu. P. Grigoriev and S. Grigoriev.\nThe monument is a four-meter bronze figure of a young Soviet soldier in camouflage uniform with a helmet in his left hand and a rifle in his right. The soldier is depicted approaching a cliff and looking into the distance. The figure of a warrior stands on a pedestal made of red granite. A bronze bas-relief with a battle scene is installed on the pedestal.\nThe opening of the monument took place on December 27, 2004 and was timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the introduction of Soviet troops into Afghanistan. The opening ceremony of the monument was attended by Afghan veterans, special forces who stormed Amin's palace, and representatives of veterans' organizations.\nGallery\nFile:Dorogomilovo District, Moscow, Russia - panoramio (355).jpg|Different angle\nFile:Dorogomilovo District, Moscow, Russia - panoramio (195).jpg|Close up of the sculpture\nReferences"
