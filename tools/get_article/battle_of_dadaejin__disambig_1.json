While Sō Yoshitoshi attacked Busan, Konishi led a smaller force against the fort of Dadaejin, located a few kilometers to the southwest of Busan at the mouth of the Nakdeong River.\nBattle\nKonishi Yukinaga's first attack was repelled by Yun Hŭngsin. The second attack came at night when Japanese forces filled the moat with rocks and lumber under cover of gunfire before scaling the walls using bamboo ladders. The entire garrison was massacred.\nAftermath\nThe following day, Konishi and Sō recombined their forces, and then advanced towards the fortress of Dongnae located ten kilometers northeast on the main road to Seoul.\nSee also\n*Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)\n*List of battles during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)\n*Timeline of the Japanese invasions of Korea\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 桑田忠親 [Kuwata, Tadachika], ed., 舊參謀本部編纂, [Kyu Sanbo Honbu], 朝鮮の役 [Chousen no Eki]　(日本の戰史 [Nihon no Senshi] Vol.&nbsp;5), 1965.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
