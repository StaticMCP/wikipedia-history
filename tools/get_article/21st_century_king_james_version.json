In contrast to the New King James Version, it does not alter the language significantly from the 1611 King James Version, retaining Jacobean grammar (including \"thee\" and \"thou\"), but it does attempt to replace some of the vocabulary that might no longer make sense to a modern reader.\nThe reader should notice almost no difference from reading the King James Version except that certain archaic words have been replaced with words that are more understandable in modern English. The translation is directed towards readers who are looking for a very conservative King James update, but reduce the use of obsolete words.\nA version containing the Apocrypha and without the unusual formatting was released under the name Third Millennium Bible in 1998.\nBackground\nThe 21st Century King James Version Bible is an updated version of the King James Version.\nAlterations\nUnlike the New King James Version, the 21st Century King James Version does not alter the language significantly from the King James Version. The author has eliminated \"obsolete words\". The changes in words are based on the second edition of the ''Webster's New International Dictionary''. There were no changes related to gender or theology.\nExamples comparing changes made by the 21st Century King James Version:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
