The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 31st Academy Awards, ten films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The United Arab Republic (Egypt) and Yugoslavia submitted films to the competition for the first time. The five nominated films came from France, Italy, Spain, West Germany and Yugoslavia.\nFrance won for the fourth time (its first competitive win) with Mon Oncle by Jacques Tati.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
