The 1977 London Symphony Orchestra recording peaked at number ten on Billboard Hot 100 and number thirteen in Canada RPM Top Singles. Meco's disco version of \"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band\" from his album Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk was a global hit in the same year.\nHistory\nIt is the main musical theme of Star Wars and is also considered the primary leitmotif for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the protagonist of the original Star Wars trilogy. The original 1977 recording was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The track became a hit in the United States (#10 on the Billboard Hot 100) and Canada (#13) during the fall of that year. The composition draws influence from Erich Wolfgang Korngold's score for the 1942 film Kings Row and Gustav Holst's \"Jupiter\" from his orchestral suite, The Planets.\nThe B side featured the original movie score of \"Cantina Band\".\nMeco's disco re-recording of the track was featured on his album Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk. A single edit from this album, \"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band,\" reached number one concurrently with the chart run of Williams's original movie score version.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1977)\n!align=\"left\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67\n|-\n|Canadian RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n|Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US Billboard Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|US Cash Box Top 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1977)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|189\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|99\n|-\n|US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|}\nCover versions\nThe Star Wars main title was covered by many musical artists, musicians and composers around the world.
