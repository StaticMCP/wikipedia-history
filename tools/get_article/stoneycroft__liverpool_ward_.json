The Stoneycroft ward was created as a single-member ward from the south-eastern portion of the former Tuebrook and Stoneycroft ward and a small portion of the former Old Swan ward. The ward boundaries follow West Derby Road, Mill Lane, Queens Drive, Derby Lane, behind Stoneville Road, Portlet Road, Mentstone Road and Brelade Road, and the Canada Dock Branch line.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
