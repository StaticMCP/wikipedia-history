He is a national political correspondent for Politico Magazine, author, and \"long-form writer.\" He is the author of The Bidens: Inside the First Family’s Fifty-Year Rise to Power— a book on the life of U.S. President Joe Biden.\nEarly life and education\nSchreckinger is from Belmont, Massachusetts. He attended Brown University, where he studied classics and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 2012. As a student, he was Editor-in-Chief of The Brown Daily Herald''. Later he freelanced as a ghostwriter for a consultancy's blog, for The Boston Globe, and for Boston Magazine.\nCareer\nPolitico was Schreckinger's first full-time job following his education at Brown University. He has also written for Salon, The Financial Times, The Atlantic, The Boston Globe and for GQ.\nJonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League said that a 2017 article on Trump and Putin by Schreckinger it \"evokes age-old myths about Jews\". In March and June 2016, Schreckinger was denied entry to or ejected from then-candidate and future U.S. President Trump events he was covering at the time. In the latter case, Schreckinger had entered using a general admission ticket, not a press pass, so a security guard removed him. In the summer of 2019, Schreckinger reported on bias at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nReporting on Biden family\nIn November 2020, Schreckinger signed a contract with Twelve to write his The Bidens book; upon its 2021 publication, Bret Stephens characterized it in The New York Times as \"scrupulously reported\".  That same year, Brown Political Review reported Schreckinger was the first reporter by a \"reputable news organization\" to confirm some of the emails in the Hunter Biden laptop story. A Biden campaign spokesman described one of Schreckinger's articles about a property transaction conducted by one of Biden's brothers as \"an absolute joke.\"\nBooks\n*\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n|The Fund for American Studies Award\n|Outstanding Reporting\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2021\n|National Headliner Award\n|Best Magazine Column\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nReferences"
