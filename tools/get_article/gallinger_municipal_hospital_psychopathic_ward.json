Local contractor George H. Wynne constructed the buildings for $766,200. By 1924 it had been featured in the journal Modern Hospital and was also described in 1928 in the standard text The American Hospital of the Twentieth Century.\nThe hospital was named for Senator Jacob Harold Gallinger of New Hampshire, who sponsored the bill for its construction in the Senate.\nIt was renamed D.C. General Hospital in 1953, and closed in 2001.\nConstruction of a prison on the site was planned in 1986, with preservationists contesting the plan until 1989. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February, 1989 and were demolished c. 1990.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ghostsofdc.org/tag/gallinger-hospital/ Gallinger Hospital] , Ghosts of DC"
