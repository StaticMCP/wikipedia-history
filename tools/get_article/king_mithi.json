He was the first King Janaka in the Janaka Dynasty of Mithila.\nMention\nAccording to Vishnu Purana and Bhavishya Purana the name “Mithila” is derived from King Mithi, who established the city of Mithilapuri. He was also known as Janaka because he was born out of the body of his father. The title Janaka was later adopted by subsequent kings of Mithila. According to Bal Kand of Valmiki Ramayana, King Mithi had a son named as Udavasu who became successor of the kingdom after him.\nDescription\nThe story of the birth of the King Mithi is described in Vishnu Purana, Shrimadbhagwat Purana, Ramayana, Devī Bhāgavata, Matsya Purana etc. King Mithi  is considered to be the first promoter of the Karmakanda ritual in Pitripaksha festival. It is said that the King Mithi once donated the things that his father loved to his Guru Vashishtha. Then Guru Vashishtha called this practice of donation as \"Divine inspiration\" and from here it is believed as the origination of Shraddha Karma for ancestors.\nBirth\nAccording to the sixth chapter of Devi Bhagavata, once the King Nimi was cursed to death by the sage Vashishtha for performing Yajna in his absence. Then the other sages present there took the lifeless body of Nimi and after performing Yajna rituals and worshipping the gods, they started churning the body. After some time during three parvas, a great, radiant, powerful and accomplished man was born from it. Since he was born by Mathana (churning) he was named Mithi.\nReferences"
