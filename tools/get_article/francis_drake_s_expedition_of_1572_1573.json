It is deemed a precursor to hostilities of the subsequent Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604.\nPrelude\nDrake's 1571 cruise of the West Indies had proved quite successful, earning him and his crew over £100,000. Consequently, upon his return to Plymouth that year, Drake determined to repeat his feat, assembling, with his brothers John and Joseph, a fleet of two light ships and three small pinnaces (carried in disassembled kit form as cargo).1573 expedition was Drake's sixth one to the West Indies, making Drake's 1571 cruise his fifth, and further, that the former's aim was the capture of Nombre de Dios .}}\nExpedition\nDeparture\nDrake and company departed Plymouth (aboard the Pascha and Swan) in May 1572, landing in southern Dominica on 29 June. Here, the crew refreshed their provisions, and on 1 July set for Port Pheasant (Zapzurro Cove, 35 leagues west of Tolú), which they reached in 11 days (on 12 July). The following day, Drake was joined by James Raunse and his 30 men.(cf previous citations).}}\nNombre de Dios, 1572\n]]\nAt Port Pheasant, Drake and Raunse's men built a log fort, so as to allow the carpenters time to assemble Drake's pinnaces.\nOn 20 July, the pinnaces having been assembled, the DrakeRaunce fleet sail for Isla de Pinos (not the Cuban isle), where they surprised two Spanish frigates out of Nombre de Dios. The frigates' (enslaved) sailors furnish the party with fresh intelligence regarding the said port, whereupon Drake (with 53 of his men aboard Drake's three pinnaces) and Raunce (with 20 of his men aboard a Spanish prize shallop) set sail for Nombre de Dios, making landfall in the evening of 29 July.\nAt 3:00am that night, the men stole into the port aboard rowboats, but were nonetheless espied by a 60-tonne Spanish merchantman in the harbour. Drake and company managed to land, however, and they took the town's six-gun battery without opposition. They now began dismounting its ordinance, which endeavour stirred the vecinos out of slumber. Upon hearing the warning bells and war drums, Drake and Raunce split their company a dozen men to guard the shore, John Oxenham and 16 others to circle behind the plaza, while Drake led the rest (46 men, with Raunce) noisily up the town's main thoroughfare. In the plaza, the Drake detachment were greeted by 'a jolly hot volley of shot,' but they nevertheless eventually scattered the impromptu militia, and thereby secured the city for themselves. Before the crew could loot the treasury, however, a sudden rainstorm drenched the men's match and gunpowder, and (coincidentally), Drake fainted from loss of blood, having sustained a gunshot during the volley. The fleet hastily retreated to Bastimentos (at dawn, on 30 July)., ).}}\nSpanish Main, 1572\nWhile Drake was recuperating at Bastimentos (an island off the coast of northern Panama), Raunce took his leave (on 6 August). Drake (now with only his 73 men) set out upon the Spanish Main, sighting Carthagena (a coastal town in northern Colombia) by the evening of 13 August. That night, the men seized the Pasha, a 240-tonne merchantman. This was followed by the seizure of two merchant ships the next day. As his crew was now stretched thin across two ships, three pinnaces, and three Spanish prizes, Drake burned one of the prizes, and scuttled the Swan.\nShortly thereafter, the crew set up a camp, christened Port Plenty, in the Gulf of San Blas (ie Darien). From this base, (Francis) Drake and company spend the next five or six weeks raiding settlements along the Main as far east as the Magdalena River, while John Drake endeavoured to befriend the Panamanian cimarrones., who further locates it on Slaughter Island, also in San Blas.}}\nJohn having cemented an alliance with the cimarrones (by 24 September), the company relocated Port Plenty, and spend the next two weeks fortifying it. On 7 October they were once more cruising off Cartagena. On 17 October, Oxenham and the Swan seized a 50-tonne barque, marooning its 10 men and 5 slaves. On 20 October, the fleet intercepted a 58-tonne and a 12-tonne merchant, likewise stranding their crews. Having noticed the fleet, on 22 October (at dawn), two frigates from Carthagena engaged Drake. They had a difficult time of it, however, the bay proved too vast to corner the Englishmen. Drake's fleet finally quit Carthagena for the Magdalena River on 3 November, their provisions running dangerously low..}}.}} notes that cimarrones had (almost) taken Nombre de Dios by surprise six weeks prior to Drake's arrival in Dominica or Port Pheasant, and further claims John or Francis Drake made contact at Isla de las Palmas.}}\nThe fleet reached Magdalena on 5 November, but found the settlements deserted and the herds withdrawn inland (Spanish authorities having forwarded the vecinos). They continued on to Santa Marta, reaching that town within a week. Here they also found the Spanish prepared, as they were prevented from watering by hidden snipers on shore. On 12 November, the fleet captured a 90-ton supply ship loaded with victuals and held the crew for one day. They next set for Curaçao, landing there on 13 November. A couple of days later, Drake detached Oxenham's pinnace \"Minion\" to sail directly back and advise his Panamanian base of his imminent return, while he scoured the Main with his own pinnace and prize. Upon refreshing for a few days, Drake renewed his raids towards the Main, while Oxenham (aboard the Minion) was dispatched to the recently relocated Port Plenty, to advise the crew there of Drake's upcoming return..}}\nDrake followed Oxenham to Port Plenty within the fortnight. Upon his 27 November arrival, he discovered his brother John had died. Drake now decided to postpone further raids, so as to renew his efforts upon the Panamanian treasure train the coming year. His remaining brother, Joseph, succumbed to a fatal fever that December. suggests Joseph's death was part of a yellow fever epidemic in the crew's camp, which would have proved fatal to a number of the men. The crew's doctor, during Joseph's autopsy, had found no evidence of yellow fever. He nevertheless concocted an antidote, 'which he hoped would save other crew members,' but died upon trying his own medicine .}}\nVenta Cruces, 1573\nOn 30 January, upon cimarron allies' intelligence, the Lion reconnoitred Nombre de Dios, intercepting a Spanish frigate there, which confirmed (the cimarrones' information) that the Spanish plate fleet had arrived. Consequently, on 3 February, Drake and Oxenham, with 16 Englishmen and 30 cimarrones, trudged through the jungle and over the Cordilleras to intercept the treasure train. On 14 February, the party approached Panama City, whereupon a cimarron in disguise stole into the settlement, returning that evening with news of an upcoming 14-mule treasure train (from Lima, to Nombre de Dios, via Venta de Cruces). The rovers set up an ambush near Venta Cruces (on Chagres River). Robert Pike, a drunken crew-mate, was discovered by a Spanish traveller en route to Venta Cruces, whereupon the treasure train was forestalled. They nonetheless managed to seize a few silver-loaded mules, and make a hasty retreat to Venta Cruces, which they easily occupied for some time, reaching base camp on 22 February., ).}}\nVeragua, 1573\nUndaunted, Drake determined to cruise off Veragua (aboard the Minion), finally desisting on 19 March, having gained a frigate and its Genoese pilot. In the meantime, Oxenham cruised eastwards (aboard the Bear), where he seized a well-provisioned frigate out of Tolú, heading back to camp by 21 March..}}.}}}}\nThe men celebrated Easter at Port Plenty, on 22 March. The next day, Drake ventured out (aboard his Spanish prize and the Bear). On 25 March, they chanced upon Guillaume Le Testu (and his 70 men aboard an 80-tonne ship), who agrees to join Drake and the cimarrones in an attempt against the treasure train. places the chance meeting as occurring off Cativas Island, and further dates it to 23 March 1573, though does not indicate whether the date is Gregorian or Julian.}}\nNombre De Dios, 1573\nOn 31 March, Drake (with 20 men), Le Testu (with some 20 men), and a number of cimarrones, rendezvous at the mouth of the San Francisco River, from where they advance (this time towards Nombre de Dios) to intercept the treasure train. On the morning of 1 April, the rovers (successfully) ambushed a treasure train of some 160 mules and 45 armed guards. The Spaniards guards engaged the rovers, mortally wounding Le Testu in the process. As their treasure summed nearly 30 tonnes of silver and gold, the surviving crew hid half of the booty before hastily making their escape, planning to recuperate the loot later on. They arrive at the rendezvous point on 3 April, only to find seven Spanish pinnaces at the river's mouth, and none of their own vessels (one prize and two pinnaces, which had been blown off-course some 12 miles by a strong westerly wind). Drake and three 'brave companions' venture out, in a shoddy raft, to retrieve their craft, which they do by nightfall, returning with the Bear and the Minion. The rovers hastily returned to base camp, where the loot was divided and the each contingent parted ways, their enterprise having proved a success. suggests that this raid netted Drake's company at least £20,000.}}.}}\nReturn\nIn late April, Drake departed Port Plenty, now with a 30-man crew. The crew provisioned themselves at the Magdalena River (with 250 turtles and a Spanish merchantman). The crew set anchor at Plymouth on 9 August, bringing the expedition to an end..}}\nTimeline\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable static-row-numbers\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:left;\"|Timeline of the 15721573 expedition..}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right;\"                                       |\n! style=\"text-align:right;padding-left:.5em;\"                     |\n! style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:.5em;\"class=unsortable      |Place\n! style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:.5em;\"class=unsortable      |Event\n! style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:.5em;\"class=unsortable      |Parties\n! style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:.5em;\"class=unsortable      |Notes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;\"                    |\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"  |\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"                   |Plymouth\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Departure\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |–\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;\"                    |\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"  |\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"                   |Dominica\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Arrival\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Provisioned\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;\"                    |\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"  |\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"                   |Dominica\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Departure\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |–\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;\"                    |\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"  |\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"                   |Port Pheasant\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Arrival\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Pinnaces Lion, Bear, Minion assembled\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;\"                    |\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"  |\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"                   |Port Pheasant\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Arrival\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |–\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;\"                    |\n| style=\"text-align:right;vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"  |\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;padding-left:.5em;\"                   |Port Pheasant\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |Cruise\n| style=\"padding-left:.5em;vertical-align:top;\"                   |?

still only one-fifth of Drake's 1571 loot). Some of this may have been forwarded to members of the Privy Council, who reportedly secured Drake a pre-emptive pardon for his unauthorised expedition. Drake himself may have used some of his share to buy a property on Notte Street, Plymouth, where he was listed as a merchant in 1576.\nIn the first half of 1573, the Real Audiencia of Panama stationed 60 soldiers at the Nombre de Dios garrison, to bolster its defence, and further petitioned the Crown 'promptly to take measures necessary to the defence of this coast and kingdom, for it is considered certain that the corsairs who have now left will return in greater force, and it is even said that they announce that they will settle.' Later that year, Spanish authorities in Panama retaliated against Drake's cimarron allies.\nThe neighbouring Real Audiencia of Guatemala likewise took steps to better defend its realm, planning 'to settle some Indians in a location [in Golfo Dulce] such that they can send warning if any [pirate] vessels seek to enter.'\nLegacy\nThis voyage has been considered Drake's first independent expedition, with its final raid on the treasure train deemed 'the most daring attack ever made upon Spanish-American treasure [up to 1573]'.\nDrake (or his crewmate Oxenham) is further reputed as the first Englishman to have sighted both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans simultaneously from Pedro Mandingo's lookout point (as Vasco Nuñez de Balboa had done in 1513, purportedly from the same lookout), and the first Englishman to have cruised the Bay of Honduras (and possibly the waters of present-day Belize).\nAn artisanal rum distillery, named after Pedro Mandinga, was established in Panama City in the late 2010s.\nSee also\n* Drake's Assault on Panama – 1596 Anglo-Spanish battle\n* Henry Morgan's Panama expedition – 1670–1671 English assault\nNotes and references\nExplanatory notes\nShort citations\nFull citations\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n|url-access=subscription\n}}\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#"
