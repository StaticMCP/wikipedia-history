However, it was disbanded during military regimes and later reinstated in 1999 following the return to democratic governance during the Fourth Republic.\nMandate and functions\nThe committee's primary mandate includes:\n* Legislative scrutiny of bills affecting the banking, insurance, and financial services sectors.\n* Oversight of key financial regulatory bodies including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), and Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC).\n* Monitoring compliance with financial laws and regulations enacted by the National Assembly.\n* Conducting investigations and hearings on sector challenges such as banking crises, insurance fraud, and consumer protection.\n* Approving budgets for financial regulatory institutions and recommending policy reforms to foster financial stability and inclusion.\nLeadership and membership\nMembership consists of Senators drawn from various geopolitical zones of Nigeria to ensure broad national representation. Leadership roles include the chairman and deputy chairman, usually appointed based on expertise and experience in finance, economics, or related fields. The chairman is responsible for coordinating committee activities and representing the committee in plenary sessions.\nOversight activities\nThe committee maintains a close oversight relationship with the Central Bank of Nigeria and other regulators. It regularly summons the CBN Governor and other key officials to brief Senators on monetary policies, banking sector health, insurance regulation, and financial market developments.\nSignificant events overseen include the 2004 banking consolidation reforms that raised minimum capital requirements for banks, which the committee reviewed extensively amidst controversy. The committee also investigated the 2009 bailout of distressed banks, examining management failures and regulatory lapses.\nInsurance sector oversight\nIn addition to banking, the committee oversees the insurance industry, working closely with NAICOM to address challenges such as low insurance penetration and fraud, and pushing for reforms to boost industry growth.\nPolitical challenges and controversies\nThe committee's work has occasionally been marred by political disputes and allegations of undue influence. Notable incidents include a 2013 clash between the committee chairman and the CBN Governor over loan recovery approaches, and media reports alleging influence by banking industry actors within the committee.\nProcedures and collaboration\nThe committee meets regularly during Senate sessions to review bills, conduct hearings, and prepare reports for plenary debates. It works closely with its House of Representatives counterpart to ensure comprehensive parliamentary oversight of Nigeria's financial sector. Occasionally, subcommittees are formed to focus on niche areas such as microfinance or pension regulation.\nStakeholder engagement\nEngagement with stakeholders is central to the committee's effectiveness. It collaborates with financial regulators, industry groups, consumer advocates, and international institutions like the World Bank and IMF to align Nigeria's financial regulatory framework with global best practices.\nSee also\n* Central Bank of Nigeria\n* Banking in Nigeria\n* Nigerian Senate\nReferences"
