The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior as it came to be known, was to serve as a memorial to all of the soldiers who had no known grave. On October 17, 1921, the Unknown Warrior was presented with the Medal of Honor, the highest award for gallantry conferred by the United States, by General John J. Pershing, Chief of Staff of the United States Army. The Medal of Honor was awarded by an Act of Congress approved March 4, 1921.  The medal hangs in a frame on a pillar close to the tomb.\nBelgium\nThe Belgian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (French: Tombeau du Soldat Inconnu, Dutch: Graf van de Onbekende Soldaat) is located in Brussels.  In War Department General Orders No. 52 of 1922, the United States announced the award of the Medal of Honor to the Belgian unknown soldier: \"By virtue of the authority vested by law in the President of the United States, the Congressional Medal of Honor, emblem of the highest military ideals and virtues, is bestowed in the name of the Congress of the United States upon the unknown, unidentified Belgian soldier in a desire to add all that is possible to the imperishable glory won by the soldiers of Belgium who fought as comrades of the American soldiers during the World War, and to commemorate with them the deeds of the nations associated with the United States of America, by paying this tribute to their unknown dead.\"\nFrance\nThe French Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (French: Tombeau du Soldat Inconnu) is located in the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.  The award of the Medal of Honor came in the same Act of Congress of March 4, 1921, which approved the award to the British Unknown Warrior.\nItaly\nA joint resolution of Congress on October 12, 1921, awarded the Medal of Honor \"upon the unknown, unidentified Italian soldier to be buried in the National Monument to Victor Emanuel II, in Rome.\"\nRomania\nWar Department General Orders No. 22 of June 6, 1923, announced the award of the Medal of Honor to the Romanian unknown soldier: \"By virtue of the authority vested by law in the President of the United States, the Congressional Medal of Honor, emblem of the highest military ideals and virtues, is bestowed in the name of the Congress of the United States upon the unknown, unidentified Rumanian soldier in a desire to add all that is possible to the imperishable glory won by the soldiers of Rumania who fought as comrades of the American soldiers during the World War, and to commemorate with them the deeds of the nations associated with the United States of America, by paying this tribute to their unknown dead.\"\nUnit citations\nWorld War II\n25 Field Battery, Royal Artillery\nIn October 1944, 7th US Armored Division was holding a very long stretch of the Allied line in The Netherlands when a German force of tanks and infantry attacked and captured the small town of Meijel in the centre of the Division's line; the village of Asten was also threatened. As 7th Armored was operating under British VIII Corps at the time, the corps commander, Gen Sir Richard O'Connor, sent 25th Field Regiment to support the US formation.\nThe German attack intensified and the artillery regiment, especially 25 Field Battery, played a critical role over two and a half days in ensuring that the line was not broken. On the afternoon of 28 October, 25 Battery engaged enemy tanks and infantry continuously for two hours, causing many casualties in the attackers' ranks. Although the Germans advanced some 700–1,000 yards, their advance was held.\nFurther reinforcements, from 15th (Scottish) Division, arrived on the 29th and 7th Armored was able to withdraw, having suffered heavily but not having allowed the enemy to pass. For its part in the battle, 25 Battery was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation and an Honour Title, becoming 25 (Asten) Battery, Royal Artillery. In 1947 it was renumbered as 59 (Asten) Battery and is today 59 (Asten) Training Battery.\nNo. 2 and 13 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force\nNos. 2 and 13 Squadrons, Royal Australian Air Force were awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for their service in the Timor area in mid-1942. Despite being awarded to No. 13 Squadron in October 1942 the citation it was not officially presented to the unit until May 1990.  The Distinguished Unit Citation was redesignated after World War II as the Presidential Unit Citation.\nFrench 2nd Armored Division\nThe French 2nd Armored Division (2e Division Blindée) was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for the liberation of Saverne and Strasbourg during the period from 16 to 24 November 1944.\nMarching Regiment of the Foreign Legion\nDistinguished Unit Citation with the inscription \"Rhine–Bavarian Alps\" for Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion (); redesignated as 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment () on July 1, 1945; for the R.M.L.E actions in the drive of the Sixth United States Army Group, of which the French First Army was part, across the Rhine River into southern Germany to Bavaria and Austria in 1945.\n1st Brazilian Fighter Group\nOn April 22, 1986, the 1st Brazilian Fighter Group was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions in the Po Valley region of Italy in World War II.  The Brazilians, operating in Italy in support of Allied forces, destroyed in one day (April 22, 1945) over 45 vehicles, strafed pontoon bridges on the River Po (hampering a German retreat) and harassed fixed positions of the German forces. From the citation:\n\"The casualties that they suffered reduced their pilot strength to about one half that of the United States Army Air Force squadrons operating in the same area, but they flew an equal number of sorties as their US counterparts&nbsp;... Eleven missions of 44 sorties were flown destroying nine motor transports and damaging 17. Additionally, they destroyed the facilities of a motor pool, immobilized 35 horse vehicles, damaged a road bridge and a pontoon bridge, destroyed 14 and damaged three enemy-occupied buildings, and attacked four military positions and inflicted much other damage.\"\nKorean War\nRoyal Marines at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir\nTask Force Drysdale, a combined unit of the United States 1st Marine Division which included 41 Commando, Royal Marines, formed in November 1950 at Hungnam in South Korea, with the aim of fighting its way to reinforce the garrison at Hagaru on the southern tip of the Chosin Reservoir. The column of Drysdale came under sustained attack almost from the off, but was eventually able to force its way through to Hagaru, with 321 casualties sustained. On entering the town, 41 Commando was nominated as the garrison reserve, and was called into action on the night of November 29/November 30, when part of the Commando was called on to reinforce a unit of the United States Marine Corps that was part of Drysdale on a hill overlooking the Chinese lines. During this night, the two Chinese divisions facing them sustained over 5000 casualties. Despite this, other United Nations forces along the reservoir were failing to hold the lines. So, the force at Hagaru were ordered to withdraw back to Hungnam. 41 Commando, along with the 5th Marine Battalion, brought up the rear, beginning on December 6. The force stopped at Koto-Ri on December 8, where a mass grave for 117 dead troops was prepared. 41 Commando moved out in the afternoon to guard the high ground over the formation against infiltration during the night. On December 9, the formation moved out to march the remaining distance to the Hungnam bridgehead, getting clear by December 11 and embarking with 22,000 US Marines to be shipped down to Pusan. The action had left 41 Commando with 93 casualties, and so the unit was withdrawn to Japan for reinforcement during the winter of 1950/51.\nThe actions of 1st Marine Division led to it receiving a Presidential Unit Citation, a US Navy award. Although 41 Commando was not mentioned in the original citation (as US Navy regulations did not originally allow bestowal upon foreign forces), representations to the USMC subsequently led to it also receiving the award, which was accepted in 1957. The streamer was born on the Regimental Colour of 41 Commando, Royal Marines until its disbandment in 1981.\nUN Forces in the Chinese spring offensive\nDuring the April 1951 Chinese spring offensive, along the breadth of the United Nations front, UN forces faced attacks from numerically superior Chinese Communist forces.  Among the units which received the Distinguished Unit Citation for battles during this offensive were the following:\n* 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, together with C Troop, 170 Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery: In the Battle of the Imjin River, 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, together with C Troop, 170 Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery, was surrounded and all but a handful of its soldiers killed or captured after holding off the Chinese for three days.  The streamer of the citation, bearing the honour 'Solma-ri', was attached to the Regimental Colour of the 1st Battalion. Since the amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment, this tradition has been assumed by the 1st Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Light Infantry until its amalgamation into The Rifles in 2007. In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, 170 Mortar Battery was awarded an Honour Title to become 170 (Imjin) Battery, Royal Artillery. Today it is 25/170 (Imjin) Battery, of the 47th Regiment Royal Artillery.\n* Belgian–Luxembourg UN Battalion: a Belgian battalion with an attached Luxembourg platoon, attached to the British 29th Brigade, the battalion initially held the brigade's right flank and was able to withdraw under enemy fire and move into the gap created by the Chinese surrounding of the Glosters.  The Belgians and Luxembourgers participated in the attempts to relieve the Glosters and to hold the line.\n* Tank Company, 10th Battalion Combat Team, Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea: Subjected to fierce Chinese attacks on the night of April 22–23, elements of the Philippine battalion were overrun during the Battle of Yultong Bridge.

After Yultong Bridge, the Philippine battalion participated in the attempts to relieve the Glosters.\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) and '''2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2PPCLI a.k.a. \"The Patricias\")''': 3RAR and 2PPCLI were in the vanguard of the 1st Commonwealth Division's 27th Brigade, defending the Kapyong valley, in the Battle of Kapyong during the Chinese Spring Offensive.  In recognition of their heroic actions at Kapyong, both 3RAR and 2PPCLI, together with A Company of the U.S. Army's 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, were awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation.  The streamer of the citation, bearing the honour 'Kapyong', is carried on the Regimental Colours of the Australian and Canadian battalions. In addition, although not a U.S. gallantry award, the 16th Field Regiment of the Royal New Zealand Artillery were awarded the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Kapyong.\nFrench Bataillon de Corée\nThe French Battalion (Bataillon de Corée) was a volunteer battalion which arrived in Korea at the end of November 1950 and was attached to the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division.  The battalion fought in numerous battles, including the Battle of the Twin Tunnels, Chipyong-ni, Hongchon, Hwachon Reservoir, the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge, and the Battle of Arrowhead Hill, until departing Korea in July 1953.  The French Battalion earned three Unit Citations (for Twin Tunnels, Chipyong-ni, and Hwachon Reservoir) and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for Battle of Arrowhead Hill. It is unclear from the sources, but the \"Hwachon Reservoir\" citation may have been a Presidential Unit Citation, a US Navy award, while the first two were the army version of the time, the Distinguished Unit Citation.\nNetherlands Detachment United Nations\nThe Dutch Battalion (Netherlands Detachment United Nations or Van Heutsz battalion) was a volunteer battalion that was part of the Regiment Van Heutsz which arrived in Korea at the end of November 1950. It was attached to the 38th Infantry Regiment (Rock of the Marne), which was part of the 2nd Infantry (Indianhead) Division. The battalion fought in numerous battles, including Battle of Wonju, Soyang River Battle, Battle of Heartbreak Ridge, and in the Iron Triangle. It left Korea in November 1954, leaving 123 dead and 463 wounded. The Dutch battalion was awarded two Distinguished Unit Citations (with the citations 'Hongchon, Korea' and 'Hoengsong, Wonju, Korea') and two Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations for the entire campaign. The decorations were attached to the battalion flag. The battle honour 'Korea 1950–1954' was awarded to the Regiment Van Heutsz. The traditions of the Netherlands Detachment United Nations are still maintained by the Regiment Van Heutsz, the most decorated regiment in the Royal Netherlands Army.\nSouth African Air Force, 2 Squadron.\nTurkish Brigade\nPresident Harry Truman signed a Distinguished Unit Citation on July 11, 1951, for the Turkish Brigade's acts of heroism. It reads: \"The Turkish Brigade, a member of the United Nations Forces in Korea is cited for exceptionally outstanding performance of duty in combat in the area of Kumyangjang-ni, Korea, from 25 to 27 January 1951.\"\nGreek Expeditionary Force\nThe Greek Expeditionary Force received a total of two Distinguished Unit Citations and one Navy Presidential Unit Citation.  The two army awards went to the Force's infantry battalion (known as the Sparta Battalion) for the capture of Scotch Hill (October 1951) and the defense of Outpost Harry (17–18 June 1953), while Flight 13 of the Hellenic Air Force was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation for its heroic evacuation of US Marines from Hagaru-ri (December 1950).\nThe rifle company involved in the defense of Outpost Harry received the following Distinguished Unit Citation:\n\"DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY Washington D. C., 10 March 1955 GENERAL ORDERS 18\nDISTINGUISHED UNIT CITATION Company P Greek Expeditionary Forces Battalion (Second Award) is cited for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against an armed enemy in the vicinity of Surang-Ni, Korea during the period 17 June to 18 June 1953. Assigned the defense of a vital outpost position (Harry), the company encountered a major enemy assault on the evening of June 17. After an intense concentration of enemy mortar and artillery fire, the hostile forces, which had taken up an attack position on the northeast and northwest side of the outpost, moved rapidly through their own and friendly artillery fire to gain a foothold on the northern slope of the position. Refusing to withdraw, Company P closed in and met the attackers in a furious hand-to-hand struggle in which many of the enemy were driven off. The aggressors regrouped, quickly attacked a second time, and again gained the friendly trenches. Immediately, the Greek Forces launched a series of counterattacks, simultaneously dispatching a diversionary force to the east of the outpost which successfully channeled the enemy thrusts. After 2 hours of close in fighting, the aggressors were again routed and the friendly positions restored. The outstanding conduct and exemplary courage exhibited by members of Company P, Greek Expeditionary Forces Battalion, reflects great credit on themselves and are in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service and the Kingdom of Greece.\"\nThe Greeks were awarded 6 U.S. Distinguished Service Crosses, 32 Silver Stars, and 110 Bronze Stars. Furthermore, 19 members of 13th Flight received the Air Medal for the Hagaru-ri evacuation operation in December 1950.\nVietnam War\n1st Division, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nThe 1st Division (South Vietnam) were awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.

The city was quickly and completely surrounded by several elite battalions of PAVN units on every side but repulsed all attempts at storming the citadel. The defence of Hue Citadel despite overwhelming odds was regarded as the most pivotal moment of the battle, and had significant symbolic value for many in South Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. The commander of the Hac Bao, Tran Ngoc Hue would also be awarded a Silver Star personally by General Creighton Abrams.\nRepublic of Vietnam Marine Division\nThe Republic of Vietnam Marine Division was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation in 1972 for the Second Battle of Quảng Trị, recapturing the city after it was over-run by 45,000 PAVN whom are deploying for the first time armoured and mechanised divisions.

During the battle this unit alone had lost almost 3,658 KIA while inflicting 17,819 enemy casualties, capturing 5,000 weapons and vehicles and disabling dozens of T-54/T-55 tanks. The battle was fought, alongside the Airborne Division arrayed against the three most elite and longest serving divisions of the PAVN, the \"Iron and Steel\" divisions of the 308th Division, 304th Division and 325th Division. This was the single bloodiest, longest and most intense engagement in the entire war and the most defining urban battle, far surpassing the Battle of Huế in all respects.\n1st Armored Brigade, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nA Presidential Unit Citation is awarded by Richard Nixon in 1970 for Operation Duong Son. It was conducted in the Quế Sơn District in 1970 by the newly created 1st Armored Brigade Headquarters, composed of an Armored Cavalry Squadron, a Regional Force Battalion and 2 Regular Battalions.

Almost 900 Viet Cong and PAVN were killed or captured, while the brigade lost sixty-eight men.\n37th Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nThis unit earned the single most Presidential Unit Citation of any unit in the war, and was the most decorated of the Ranger Battalion, out of the 11 Battalions in the ARVN Rangers whom had received presidential unit citations. South Vietnamese Army's 37th Ranger Battalion received no less than three United States Army Presidential Unit Citations.  The first was awarded in Department of the Army General Order 20 of 1967, for extraordinary heroism in the vicinity of Thach Tru, Quang Ngai Province on November 22, 1965. This was during a battle in which a much larger regiment of the crack 18th NVA Regiment and VC 45th Heavy Weapons Unit had staged a multi-pronged attack and were repulsed. Reinforcing the unit in the battle was a reinforcement of 3rd Battalion, 7th Regiment Marines.

The 42nd Ranger Battalion was commended for over-turning the attacking forces and turning them onto the defensive where they proceeded to rout them.\nAfterwards decorated on March 7, 1968, for assaulting a well-defended enemy stronghold. This unit was well-regarded as an assault unit capable of over-running well concealed fortifications and positions. Among the 11 ARVN Ranger Units awarded with the Presidential Unit Citation, the 42nd was among the most highly decorated.\n39th Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nTwice-decorated with a Presidential Unit Citation, awarded for actions between February 18 and 28, 1968, during the Tet Offensive and again for actions between February 11 to April 24, 1970. Alongside the 42nd and 37th these were the most decorated Ranger battalions of the war. One of the chosen forward assault groups during Operation Lam Son 719, after securing an outpost, when expected reinforcements were halted this unit was in turn entirely encircled by armoured and infantry units from the elite 102nd Regiment, 308th Infantry Division (Vietnam). Fighting its way out of a cordon, the unit was annihilated with 178 KIA/MIA and 148 WIA out of an initial 430, although inflicting 639 KIA upon the 102nd Regiment.\n52nd Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nOn 11 November 1965, the 52nd Ranger Battalion was augmented to the US 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and conducted an air assault to relief a US element of the 11th ACR that had been ambushed by the VC 275th Regiment near Kim Hai hamlet, in the village of Phuoc Hoa on Route 15, in Phuoc Tuy Province and received a United States Presidential Unit Citation.\n44th Ranger Battalion, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nOn April 6, 1965, the 44th Ranger Battalion was a reserve element of a larger force engaged in a search and destroy operation against two Viet Cong force battalions.

Upon entering into the landing zone,  the enemy delivered withering machine gun fire. Despite the loss of their executive officer, a U.S. Army Advisor, and three helicopters during the lift the unit pursued and over-turned the attacking ambush forces, forcing them to withdraw and thereby saving the ambushed and pinned forces. For these actions the unit has earned a Presidential Unit Citation.\nSecond Battalion, Vietnamese Marine Brigade, Army of the Republic of Vietnam\nThe Second Battalion of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Division, nicknamed Crazy Buffaloes was the most decorated Republic of Vietnam Marine Division.  A Presidential Unit Citation was earned at the battle of Phung Du in November 1966.

Participating in daily actions in support of Republic of Vietnam ground operations, the courageous men of the 514th Tactical Fighter Squadron carried out their attacks on military targets with indomitable spirit and determination.

This numerically superior enemy force was equipped with numerous automatic weapons, large supplies of ammunition, and new equipment. During the early morning hours, the Republic of Vietnam units were subjected to a heavy volume of mortar fire followed by three separate human wave assaults against the position. In each case, the enemy penetrations of the perimeter were beaten back by fierce counterattacks. The viciousness of the close combat and the effectiveness of the defenders were fully demonstrated when more than 70 enemy bodies were found within the inner fortifications after the battle. Supported by air and artillery, the valiant defenders held their position, accounted for more than 170 North Vietnamese soldiers, and captured over 90 individual and crew served weapons. The determination, devotion to duty, and indomitable courage demonstrated by these men of the 2d Battalion, 9th Regiment, are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon themselves, their unit, and the Republic of Vietnam.\"\n74th Tactical Wing, Vietnamese Air Force\nThe 74th Tactical Wing of the Vietnamese Air Force operating from July 1966 to February 1968 flew over 52,000 sorties with the 520th Fighter Squadron (A-1H), 74th Tactical Wing, flew 17,730 sorties in combat against armed hostile forces. This unit earned a Presidential Unit Citation.\n\"The officers and airmen of the wing repeatedly performed outstanding acts of heroism and gallantry, both individually and collectively, and demonstrated an esprit de corps in keeping with the highest traditions of the free military Air Forces. The 74th Tactical Wing inflicted severe damage on the hostile forces and, at the same time, saved countless Vietnamese and American lives. Despite their own tragic casualties and heavy battle damage, the men of the wing consistently maintained outstanding morale.\"\n9th Company, 1st Cavalry Regiment, Republic of Korea Army\nThe 9th Company, 1st Cavalry Regiment, Republic of Korea Army was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation on August 9, 1968, for its valor on August 9–10, 1966 in the defense of Landing Zone 27 Victor, Pleiku Province, Republic of Vietnam.  The citation reads, in part:\n\"About one hour before midnight the sounds of digging were heard outside the perimeter. The suspicious area was illuminated by a searchlight and reconnoitered by machine-gun fire from one of the United States Army tanks under operational control of the 9th Company. This action triggered the first of a series of violent attacks made against the perimeter by a North Vietnamese Army battalion and reinforced by heavy fire from recoilless rifles, mortars, and rockets. During the next six hours, the foe made repeated assaults from differing directions, only to be beaten back by the coordinated fire from the stalwart defenders. A single enemy managed to penetrate into the position, but this danger was quickly eliminated by a Korean soldier wielding a bayonet. Throughout this long battle the 9th Company held its position and exhibited great gallantry under intense fire and repeated ground attacks. The tenacious defense and subsequent mop-up of the battlefield virtually eliminated the enemy battalion as an effective fighting unit. The heavy losses inflicted upon the numerically superior enemy force attest to the physical courage, determination, and skill of the defenders. ...\"\n1st Company, Royal Thailand Army Volunteer Regiment and attached units\nThe 1st Company, Royal Thailand Army Volunteer Regiment and several attached and supporting units – a medical platoon, an armored personnel carrier platoon and an artillery battery – were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation by President Richard Nixon on November 5, 1969, for extraordinary heroism on December 20–21, 1967 in Vietnam.

By the unparalleled application of exceptional imagination, fearless courage, and unrelenting determination, the 1st Company succeeded in repelling three assaults by the superior enemy force. Although harassed by constant mortar fire, the valiant defenders aggressively engaged the enemy and inflicted heavy enemy casualties. Individual acts of heroism were numerous, and during the entire battle the company officers, through their superb leadership, provided an inspirational example to the rest of the company. The Thai victory deprived the enemy of one of its long-established infiltration and resupply routes.
