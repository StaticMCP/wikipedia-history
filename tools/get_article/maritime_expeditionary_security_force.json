The MESF originated from the Naval Coastal Warfare community which transitioned to the MESF in 2020. The MESF's primary mission is force protection with deployed operations occurring around the world. Anti-terrorism and force protection missions include harbor and maritime infrastructure defense, coastal surveillance, and special missions. Specialized units work together with MESF squadron staffs providing intelligence and communications. MESF units deploy worldwide to detect, deter, and defend an area or unit. Recent locations include the United States, Panama, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt.\nMESF Sailor ratings range from Master-at-Arms, and Boatswain's Mates, to supporting rates like Engineman, Hospital Corpsmen,Information Technology Specialists and others. Units receive extensive training in small boat operations, combat medical and first responder care, small arms, crew-served weapons, and close quarters battle.\nTwo Maritime Expeditionary Security Groups in San Diego, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia provide centralized planning, control, training, coordination, equipping, and integration of deployable units trained to operate in high density, multi-threat environments. Units conduct force protection of strategic shipping and naval vessels operating in the inshore and coastal regions, anchorages and harbors, from bare beach to sophisticated port facilities. Members of this community are highly encouraged to earn their Expeditionary Warfare Specialist Designation.\nOrganization\nin 2022]]\nThe MESF consists of two groups; one in San Diego and one in Virginia Beach. This includes two expeditionary security detachments in Guam and Bahrain; seven Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadrons (MSRON).
