She was raised Catholic. She received formal dance training at a young age.\nBosco was profiled in the Tribune'' after being awarded the Dance Educators of America Senior Boy Titlist, ranked at the national competition in Las Vegas in 2010. Her tap solo to Frank Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" received the highest award given by the judges.\nCareer\nThe name \"Bosco\" is taken from her deceased dog as a tribute to him, jokingly stating that \"He's not using it anymore, he's dead, so now it's mine\".\nIn 2022, Bosco competed on season 14 of ''RuPaul's Drag Race''. She performed a burlesque routine for the opening episode's talent show. In the fifth, ninth, and thirteenth episodes of the season, she won the main challenges, winning three cash prizes of US$5,000. For Snatch Game, Bosco portrayed Gwyneth Paltrow but landed in the bottom seven, and thus participated in a lip-sync tournament which took place the following episode. She lost two lip syncs, one against Willow Pill to \"Never Too Much\" by Luther Vandross and one against Lady Camden to \"Don't Let Go (Love)\" by En Vogue. In the final lip sync, Bosco went up against Jasmine Kennedie to \"Swept Away\" by Diana Ross, and won.\nIn episode 12, Bosco landed in the bottom two alongside Jorgeous and had to lip sync to \"Heartbreak Hotel (Hex Hector Remix)\" by Whitney Houston. She lost the lip sync but was saved after she received the Gold Bar (a twist introduced in the third episode where each queen was assigned a chocolate bar and whoever had a bar which contained a golden ticket wrapped inside would be saved from elimination). This allowed Bosco to stay in the competition. In the subsequent episode, Bosco won the main challenge, which was a roast of Ross Mathews. She ended up placing third in the finale. She appears in ''RuPaul's Drag Race Live Untucked.\nOn April 23, 2025, Bosco was announced as one of eighteen former Drag Race contestants participating in the tenth season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars''. Bosco competed in the season's first bracket and advanced to the semifinals, having earned six points and won two challenges. She advanced to the finale after winning the talent show in the penultimate episode. She ultimately placed third a second time after winning a lipsync against Daya Betty and losing to Ginger Minj, the season's eventual winner.\nPersonal life\nBosco uses \"she\" and \"they\" pronouns out of drag and \"she\" in drag. Bosco came out as a transgender woman in February 2022, having begun her transition after filming Drag Race. In 2023, she underwent facial feminization surgery and debuted her new look while walking in New York Fashion Week. Season 15 contestant Irene the Alien has been described as a drag \"sister\" to Bosco. Bosco has lived in Seattle since 2015.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Genre\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| 2022\n| ''RuPaul's Drag Race (season 14)\n| TV\n| Contestant\n| 3rd place (15 episodes)\n|\n|-\n| 2022\n| RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked (season 14)\n| TV\n| Herself\n| (13 episodes)\n|\n|-\n| 2024–present\n| RuPaul's Drag Race Live Untucked\n| Web series\n| Main cast\n| Season 1–present\n|\n|-\n| 2025\n| RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 10)\n| TV\n| Contestant\n| 3rd place (6 episodes)\n|\n|-\n|}\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Work\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2022\n| MTV Movie & TV Awards\n| Best Fight(Shared with Lady Camden)\n| rowspan=\"4\"| RuPaul's Drag Race''\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Critics' Choice Real TV Awards\n| Best Ensemble Cast in an Unscripted Series\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|People's Choice Awards\n|The Competition Contestant of 2022\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|2023\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Queerty Awards\n|Closet Door Bustdown(Shared with Jasmine Kennedie, Kornbread Jeté and Willow Pill)\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|-\n|2024\n|Future All-Star\n|Herself\n|\n|}}\n|}\nSee also\n* LGBTQ culture in Seattle\n* List of LGBTQ people from Seattle\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
