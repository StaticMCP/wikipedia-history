The album was released in 1999 on Epic Records and has sold over 236,000 copies in the United States, making it their best-selling album to date. It was re-released on June 17, 2000, with their cover of the Dead or Alive hit \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" as a bonus track. \"Pig Society\", \"Everything Sucks\", \"Sick\", and \"Debonaire\" were also released as singles, but did not chart.\nTrack listing\n| title5          = Kimberly's Ghost\n| length5         = 3:18\n| title6          = Spine for You\n| length6         = 4:39\n| title7          = One Fix\n| length7         = 3:41\n| title8          = Fuck tha Police\n| note8           = N.W.A cover\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 4:04\n| title9          = Intervention\n| length9         = 2:45\n| title10         = America the Pitiful\n| length10        = 2:42\n| title11         = Shit Life\n| length11        = 4:13\n| title12         = Wake Up\n| length12        = 3:20\n| title13         = I Am Nothing\n| length13        = 4:12\n| total_length    = 47:41\n}}\n| length14        = 2:43\n}}\n*The track listing on the back cover of some pressings does not list the song \"Fuck tha Police\" as appearing on the record. This is most likely due to a typographical error, censorship, or the producers using too much of the space on the back of the album for the artwork. The original pressing for the album's Canadian release does list the song on the back cover. There are also reports that some versions of the album actually did not contain this song.\n*On the later pressing that included \"You Spin Me 'Round (Like a Record)\", the song \"Everything Sucks\" is actually the Andy Wallace remix version.\nAppearances in other media\n*\"Debonaire\" is used during the SWAT assault scene in the movie The Fast and the Furious.\n*\"Debonaire\" is featured in the Scream 3 soundtrack.\n*\"Debonaire\" was used as the entrance theme of the wrestler Rhino in ECW. It was also used as the opening song for their video game Anarchy Rulz. Also used in the movie Run All Night starring Liam Neeson and Joel Kinnaman.\nPersonnel\n;Dope\n* Edsel Dope – lead vocals, programming, additional guitars, bass\n* Simon Dope – keyboards, percussion, sampling\n* Tripp Eisen – lead guitar\n* Acey Slade – rhythm guitar, bass, backing vocals\n* Preston Nash – drums\n;Additional personnel\n* DJ Lethal – screaming hummingbird on track 12\n* The N.Y.C.
