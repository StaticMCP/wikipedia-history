All nominees must be under the age of 21 and play in a European nation's top tier.\nSelection\nThe prize was established by the Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport in 2022. It is awarded along with the Golden Boy given to the best under-21 male footballer. It is presented by Tuttosport based on the votes of 50 sports journalists. The journalists who participate in the voting include Bild (Germany), Blick (Switzerland), A Bola (Portugal), ''l'Équipe (France), France Football (France), Marca (Spain), Mundo Deportivo (Spain), Ta Nea (Greece), Sport Express (Russia), De Telegraaf (Netherlands), and The Times'' (United Kingdom).\nPlayers must be on a team in a top division in one of the top 25 leagues in Europe based on UEFA coefficient rankings as of May or June of that year in order to be eligible for the Golden Girl award.\nA final selection of 10 applicants is produced by the panel from a shortlist of 100 players. Journalists from all throughout Europe then cast their votes for the prize. The journalists cast their votes for the top three options, giving the top option five points, the second option three points, and the third option one point. The player with the most points at the end is crowned the winner after those points are tallied to get the final rankings.\nWinners\n{| class=\"sortable plainrowheaders wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Winner\n! scope=\"col\" |Club(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Position\n! scope=\"col\" |Birth year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Ref(s)\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2022\n! scope=\"row\" | Jule Brand\n| Hoffenheim Wolfsburg\n|Midfielder\n| align=\"center\" |2002\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2023\n! scope=\"row\" | Linda Caicedo\n| Real Madrid\n|Forward\n| align=\"center\" |2005\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2024\n! scope=\"row\" | Vicky López\n| Barcelona\n|Midfielder\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2025\n! scope=\"row\" |  Michelle Agyemang\n| Arsenal Brighton & Hove Albion load\n|Forward\n| align=\"center\" |2006\n| align=\"center\" |\n|}\nAwards won by position\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Position\n! scope=\"col\" |Win(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Midfielder\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Forward\n| align=\"center\" |\n|}\nAwards won by nationality\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Country\n! scope=\"col\" |Win(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Year(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Germany\n| rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" |1\n|2022\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Colombia\n| rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" |1\n|2023\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Spain\n| rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" |1\n|2024\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | England\n| rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" |1\n|2025\n|}\nAwards won by club\nYear in bold have shared the win with other clubs.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" |Club\n! scope=\"col\" |Win(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Year(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hoffenheim\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"6\" |\n|2022\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Wolfsburg\n|2022\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Real Madrid\n|2023\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Barcelona\n|2024\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Arsenal\n|2025\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Brighton & Hove Albion\n|2025\n|}\nSee also\n* Bravo Award\n* Golden Boy (award)\n* Kopa Trophy\n* Ballon d'Or\nNotes\nReferences"
