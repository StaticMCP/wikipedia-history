The term \"ironclad\" in this period frequently referred to armored capital ships that succeeded the sailing or steam-powered ship of the line and preceded pre-dreadnought battleships, though other historians have used the term more generally, especially in relation to the small armored ships operated by the US Navy during the American Civil War.  and  were significantly smaller than later German ironclads, though they are typically included in lists of ironclad capital ships.}} In 1860, however, the Prussian Navy consisted solely of wooden, unarmored warships. The following year, Prince Adalbert and Albrecht von Roon wrote an expanded fleet plan that included four large ironclads and four smaller ironclads. Two of the latter were to be ordered from Britain immediately, as German shipyards were at the time incapable of building such vessels. The rival Danish fleet had three ironclads in service by the time the Second Schleswig War broke out in 1864; as a result, Prussia purchased the ironclads  and , then under construction in Britain and France, respectively. The British, sympathetic to the Danish cause, delayed delivery of both  and  until after the combined Austro-Prussian victory. Both ships entered service by 1865.\nThe Prussian Navy had acquired three more ships—, , and —by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. A fourth was ordered from Prussian shipbuilders, but would not be completed in time to see service during the war. In the aftermath of the war in 1871, the various Germanic states were unified under Prussian dominance as the German Empire; the Prussian Navy became the core of the Imperial Navy. The three turret ships of the  were built in Germany in the early 1870s, followed by two  vessels in the middle of the decade, the last capital ships ordered from foreign yards by Germany. A different strategic plan affected the next design, the four  ships. These vessels were intended to operate from fortified bases against a naval blockade, not on the high seas. The last ironclad built by Germany, , was originally to have been a fifth member of the  class, but dissatisfaction with those ships led to a new design. The German Navy temporarily ceased construction of capital ships in the 1880s, due to the poor performance of the  class and the rise of the ; instead, concentration was focused on creating a large force of torpedo boats for coastal defense. }}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Armament\n| The number and type of the primary armament\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Armor\n| The maximum thickness of the armored belt\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Displacement\n| Ship displacement at full combat load }}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Propulsion\n| Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Cost\n| Cost of the ship's construction\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Service\n| The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Laid down\n| The date the keel assembly commenced\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Commissioned\n| The date the ship was commissioned\n|}\n__TOC__\nShips\nSMS Arminius\n]]\nwas an ironclad warship of the Prussian Navy, later the Imperial German Navy. The ship was designed by the British Captain Cowper Coles and built by the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London as a speculative effort; Prussia purchased the ship during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, though the vessel was not delivered until after the war. The ship was the first German turret ship, armed with four  guns in a pair of revolving gun turrets amidships.\nserved as a coastal defense ship for the first six years of her service with the Prussian Navy. She saw extensive service in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars during the process of German unification. The vessel was the primary challenge to the French blockade of German ports during the latter conflict. After the wars,  was withdrawn from front-line service and used in a variety of secondary roles, including as a training ship for engine-room crews and as a tender for the school ship . The ship was eventually sold in 1901 and broken up for scrap the following year.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Summary of the  class\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Cost\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 4 ×  guns\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1 shaft, 1 steam engine,\n| 1,887,000&nbsp;gold marks\n| 1863\n| 22 April 1865\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Broken up in 1902\n|}\nSMS Prinz Adalbert\nwas originally ordered by the Confederate States Navy, but the Prussian Navy purchased the ship during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark. Like , the vessel was not delivered until after the war. The vessel was designed as an armored ram, but also carried three guns: one 21&nbsp;cm and two  pieces in fixed armored turrets. She was named after Prince Adalbert of Prussia, an early proponent of German naval power. The ship was poorly constructed and as a result had a very limited service career. She was heavily modified after her delivery to Prussia in 1865 and briefly served with the fleet between 1866 and 1871. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship was assigned as a guard ship in Hamburg. After the war, it was discovered that the internal wood construction was badly rotted; she was therefore removed from service in October 1871.  was stricken from the naval register in May 1878 and broken up for scrap that year.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Summary of the  class\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Cost\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 1 × 21&nbsp;cm  2 ×\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 2 shafts, 2 steam engines,\n| 1,863,000&nbsp;gold marks\n| 1863\n| 1864\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Broken up in 1878\n|}\nSMS Friedrich Carl\nFriedrich Carl was built for the Prussian Navy in the mid-1860s in the French Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers shipyard in Toulon. Built as an armored frigate, she mounted her main battery of sixteen 21&nbsp;cm guns on the broadside. Her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867. The ship was commissioned into the Prussian Navy in October 1867, after which she served with the fleet. During the Franco-Prussian War, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.\nFriedrich Carl was also deployed to Spain during an insurrection in 1873, during which she assisted in the seizure of three rebel vessels in two engagements. The ship was refitted at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven during the 1880s. Friedrich Carl was withdrawn from active service in 1895, when she was converted into a training ship. She was renamed Neptun in 1902 and used as a harbor ship until June 1905, when she was removed from the naval register. The following year, she was sold to ship breakers in the Netherlands and dismantled for scrap.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Summary of the Friedrich Carl class\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armament\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Cost\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Laid down\n! scope=\"col\" | Commissioned\n! scope=\"col\" | Fate\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! scope=\"row\" |\n| 16 × 21&nbsp;cm\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1 shaft, 1 steam engine,\n| 6,453,000&nbsp;gold marks\n| 1866\n| 3 October 1867\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Broken up in 1906\n|}\nSMS Kronprinz\n(Crown Prince) was built for the Prussian Navy in 1866–1867.

She returned to service to join maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in the early 1890s.  was converted into an armored cruiser in 1895–1896. By early 1904, however, she had been superseded by newer vessels. In May of that year, she was placed out of active service and used as a floating barracks and training ship, a role she held through World War I.

In 1884, it was found that her iron hull was badly corroded, which rendered the ship unfit for further active service. She was therefore removed from active duty and used for a variety of secondary roles. From 1884 to 1888, she served as a guard ship in Kiel, where she also trained engine and boiler room personnel. In 1888, she was stricken from the naval register and used as a barracks ship in Kiel.
