It was built about 1929, during an influx of Jewish immigrants to the area, and is a good example of Colonial Revival architecture in brick and stone.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.\nDescription and history\nThe Nathan Warnick Apartments are in a mainly residential area of Dorchester, at the southeast corner of Bradshaw and Bicknell Streets in the Franklin Field North area. It is a single building, four stories in height, built out of buff brick with a stone foundation, cast stone trim, and a flat roof.  The building is basically rectangular, with entrances near the centers of both street-facing facades, and an angled face at the street corner.  The Bicknell Street facade is four bays wide, with upper-story bays occupied by bands of two or three sash windows.  The main entrance is near the center of the facade, with similar bands of windows in the remaining ground-floor bays.  The entrance is framed by a modestly styled cast stone surround, which joins a stone belt separating the first and second floors.  The Bradshaw Street facade is longer, with a secondary entrance near its center, above which are paired recessed porches.\nThe apartment block was built in 1929 to a design by Bernard Levy, a locally prominent architect.  The neighborhood had seen an influx of Irish immigration during the late 19th and early 20th century, which was taken over by Jewish migration, primarily by second-generation Jews who grew up in Boston's North and West Ends.  Nathan Warnick, the builder, was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, and all of the building's early residents were Jews of Russian origin, either immigrants or first-generation descendants.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in southern Boston, Massachusetts\nReferences"
