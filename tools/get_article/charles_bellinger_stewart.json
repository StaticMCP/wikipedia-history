He died in 1885 at 79 years old.\nEarly life\nHe was born in Charleston, South Carolina, but moved to Texas in 1830. Stewart was a delegate from the Municipality of Austin to the Convention of 1836 where he signed the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico. He was a member of the committee that drafted the Constitution of the Republic of Texas. On March 8, 1836, two days after The Alamo fell, Stewart absented himself from the Convention for a few days to get married. On March 11, 1836, he married Julia Shepperd in the Lake Creek Settlement. Stewart returned to the Convention on March 16, 1836, and signed the Constitution of the Republic of Texas on March 17, 1836. He moved to Montgomery, Texas, in 1837 and later attended the state constitutional convention of 1845. He represented Montgomery County in the Texas House of Representatives.\nTexas State Flag and Seal\nSome have claimed that Stewart is either the designer of the Texas flag or drew the image used by the Third Congress when enacting the legislation adopting the flag. \"Accompanying the original Act ... is a drawing by Peter Krag of the national flag and seal ... although in the original President Lamar's approval and signature are at the top and upside down[.]\" However, Stewart's drawing \"looks suspiciously like a tracing of the Peter Krag art, including the upside down signature of President Lamar.\"\nOn April 21, 2011, a bust of Charles B. Stewart was unveiled at the ceremony dedicating the Lone Star Monument and Historical Flag Park in Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fst53 Charles B.
