The ward elects one councillor to Bassetlaw District Council using the first past the post electoral system for a four-year term in office. The number of registered voters in the ward is 1,901 as of 2019.\nIt consists of the civil parishes of Beckingham, Walkeringham and Saundby.\nThe ward was created in 1979 following a review of ward boundaries in Bassetlaw by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. A subsequent review of electoral arrangements in 2002 resulted in minor changes to the boundaries of the ward, namely the transfer of Bole and West Burton from the ward.\nCouncillors\n|frame=yes|frame-width=360|frame-height=310|text=Interactive map of ward boundaries.}}\nThe ward elects one councillor every four years.
