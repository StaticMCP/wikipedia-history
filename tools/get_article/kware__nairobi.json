Located in the larger Eastlands area of Nairobi, it is approximately  east of the central business district. It borders the Mukuru slums.Initially, Kware was predominantly an informal settlement but over the years part Kware and Pipeline have earned a reputation for their poor infrastructure, coupled with overcrowded flats, narrow streets, littering, as well as its poor drainage system.\nOverview\nKware is located approximately  southeast of Nairobi's central business district, west of the Outer Ring Road within the Eastlands area in Embakasi. Kware, a mispronounced version of 'quarry', got its name from a nearby quarry site. It borders the Mukuru and Pipeline slums. Electorally, Kware is placed under Embakasi South Constituency; the whole constituency is within the Embakasi Sub-county. Kware is also an electoral ward within the constituency.\nAs of 2019, Kware together with Pipeline have a population of 166,517, with 87,056 of them being male and 79,439 being female. The neighbourhood has a population density of 106,445/km2 in a land area of 1.6km2, the highest after Huruma.\nReferences"
