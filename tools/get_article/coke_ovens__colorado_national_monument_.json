This iconic landmark is situated on the west side of Monument Canyon, two miles south of the monument's visitor center, and  west of the community of Grand Junction. It is also one mile south of Kissing Couple, and both can be seen from viewpoints along Rim Rock Drive. It is so named because the rounded shape resembles beehive coke ovens that were used in the nineteenth century to convert bituminous coal into coke, which was then used for smelting iron.\nGeology\nThis feature is the remnant of differentially eroded Wingate Sandstone, which consists of wind-borne, cross-bedded quartzose sandstones deposited as ancient sand dunes approximately 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic. The caprock at the top of one of the four pillars consists of fluvial sandstones of the resistant Kayenta Formation. The slope around the base of the Coke Ovens is Chinle Formation. The floor of the canyon is Precambrian basement rock consisting of gneiss, schist, and granites. Precipitation runoff from this geographical feature drains to the Colorado River, approximately four miles to the northeast.\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Coke Ovens is located in a semi-arid climate zone. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are cold with some snow. Temperatures reach  on 5.3 days,  on 57 days, and remain at or below freezing on 13 days annually. The months April through October offer the most favorable weather to visit.\nGallery\nFile:Coke Ovens, from Rim Rock Drive in Colorado National Monument.jpg\nFile:Coke Ovens from Rim Rock Drive.jpg\nFile:Coke ovens.jpg\nFile:The Coke Ovens.jpg\nFile:Co nat mon.jpg\nFile:Artist Point Overlook of the Coke Ovens with Snow.tif\nFile:Wingate Sandstone (Lower Jurassic; Coke Ovens, Monument Canyon, Colorado National Monument, Colorado, USA) 2 (23386813253).jpg\nFile:Red Stone Coke Oven Historic District.jpg|Actual beehive coke ovens, also in Colorado\nSee also\n* List of rock formations in the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather forecast: [https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=39.0753&lon=-108.7225#.YGJZHLCSmUk National Weather Service]\n* Coke Ovens photo: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/77203352@N06/47045125294/in/photolist-2eFdyHU-2hfryVv-2fA1xdy-YRPmeb-U2NT4o-zYc7bk-yR7R2J-GYtg2K-NY9V2A-SihgyW-HRdcTK-2kwmPhr-2ikXMY6-5UVRYf-q1S8Wi-C8PHn3-y5vSN8-zFL6nZ-CbMs6p-GekPJK-2eH17Uj-27Y6dDk-2gu3GCP-N2HXnw-2hioPak-UCnmQP-2k5Gev8-qrWrLi-2dYdC4P-2jfAbWs-7pUpcS-2j89GPB-2156m1u-2kdf49L-HwrGSk-2jgBQaX-ssWWKz-PugnPu-29APZbG-zP34kb-Pp6tQ7-RCJftK-eqtVcX-RUhmZ2-rXsS88-27Uze1E-MG4LuW-J42Gf9-2i2mC1c-w7zc1f Flickr]"
