In addition, Piko Interactive created and published a US SNES cartridge in 2019, for the first time with a full official English translation, titled Gourmet Warriors.\nGameplay\nEach of the five stages has a time limit; players lose all the ingredients that were acquired when the timer reaches zero. However, the game has no concept of how many lives the player can have; it is an automatic game over if the player dies. Focusing on the time limit is important if the player wants to recuperate lost strength after the fight with the level's boss. One of the game's notable features is that a button is used to make the character perform various sentai poses when held down and used with the directional pad; while it is not beneficial, this was added to make the character flex their muscles for show.\nPlot\nIn the year 20XX, the metropolis known as Zeus Heaven Magic City has made a miraculous recovery from the fires of a nuclear World War III. In order to survive in this city of power and technology, inhabitants must ingest protein in whatever food they can find. The secret organization Bath is a force that grows and expands every day, causing enough violence and strife within the city to bring it to near ruin. Zeus's leaders, however, have launched a secret project that gives them a fighting chance in defending the city against Bath. This project looks to enhance and create a soldier wearing the special body armor, the strongest of the strongest body armor. From this project the conception of the idea to modify the human body was conceived, and three humans: Bonjour, Mademoiselle, and Très Bien have been transformed into fighting machines.\nReception\nRetro Gamer gave it an overall score of 79%, advising one \"should at least emulate it or watch the couple of game-play videos someone posted on YouTube. If you can stomach Choaniki – or even enjoy it – then this should be right up your alley.\" GamesRadar played the game on YouTube in the Freaky RadarPlays series and Le Monde featured it in Retro & Magic.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gamefaqs.com/snes/571351-gourmet-sentai-bara-yarou Gurume Sentai Barayarō] at GameFAQs\n* [https://www.giantbomb.com/gourmet-sentai-bara-yarou/3030-36259/ Gurume Sentai Barayarō] at Giant Bomb\n*"
