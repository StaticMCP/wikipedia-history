The Crusaders were led by fourth-year head coach Eddie Anderson and played their home games at Fitton Field on campus in Worcester, Massachusetts. The team competed as a football independent. Holy Cross started the year on a five game winning streak, which helped land them a spot in the first ever AP Poll, released on October 19, 1936, being ranked 17th in that poll. Losses to Temple and rival Boston College and a tie to Saint Anselm knocked the Crusaders out of the polls by the end of the year. The team finished with an overall record of 7–2–1.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium = Fitton Field\n| site_cityst = Worcester, MA\n| score = 45–0\n| attend =\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nRankings\nReferences"
