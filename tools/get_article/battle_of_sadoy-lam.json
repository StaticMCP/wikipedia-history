Sadoy-Lam, near the modern-day Chechen village Selmentauzen. The battle ended in a defeat for the former, resulting in Khour's assassination not long after and the end of the Insurgency in Durdzuketi.\nPreviously, the resistance fighters led by Khour I had undertaken several raids on Mongol posts in the lowlands and highlands of modern-day Chechnya. One such raids found place in 1252 on Sadoy-Lam. Before the attack of Khour's troops, the pro-Mongol Chechen commanders Ors, Botur and Navraz had gathered their forces and occupied a strong position on the mountain.\nDuring the battle that ensued, the troops of Khour II failed to capture the mountain and suffered a devastating defeat, which eventually put an end to the Insurgency of Khour II.\nSoon after the battle, Khour II was betrayed by Georgian princes, which eventually led to his assassination in the same year. He was succeeded by his only son Chakh the following year, in 1253.\nNotes\nSee also\n*Mongol invasions of Durdzuketi\n*Khour I\n*Ors Ela\n*Botur\n*Chakhig\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
