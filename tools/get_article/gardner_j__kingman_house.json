It has Queen Anne styling, with a variety of projections, decorations, and gables, including its main front gable, which has a large terra cotta floral-patterned panel. The building was commissioned by Gardner Kingman, a businessman prominent in civic affairs and in the city's dominant shoe industry; it has served as a funeral home for many years.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 25, 1977.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Plymouth County, Massachusetts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://mackinnonfuneralhomes.com/brockton-funeral-services MacKinnon Funeral Homes]"
