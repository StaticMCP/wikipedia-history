The medal is never issued without a clasp.\nThe NZGSM 1992 was issued in two varieties – one for warlike service, and another for non-warlike service.  Non-warlike operations were commemorated by this medal, operational deployments were commemorated by the NZGSM 1992 (Warlike) in silver.\nThis medal was replaced in 2002 by the New Zealand General Service Medal 2002 – all operations commencing on after 1 January 2000 will be recognised by awards of this new medal.  However the NZGSM 1992 will continue to be issued with the clasp Sinai for so long as that deployment continues, all other operations recognised by this medal have now ceased.\nClasps\n* Korea 1954–57\n* Thailand\n* Sinai\n* Indian Ocean\n* Peshawar\n* Iraq\n* Somalia\n* Mozambique\n* Cambodia\n* Rwanda\n* Arabian Gulf\n* Bougainville\n* Korea 1958–2000\nNotes\nBibliography\n* Mackay, J and Mussel, J (eds).
