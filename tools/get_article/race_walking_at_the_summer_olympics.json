There were three race walking events in the 2020 Summer Olympics: a men's and a women's 20 kilometres race walk, and a men's 50 kilometres race walk. The races were held in a final-only format.\nThe first men's events came at the 1908 London Olympics, which featured 3500&nbsp;m and 10-mile distances. A 10-Kilometer version was introduced at the 1912 Summer Olympics and it continued until 1952 (skipping three editions from 1928 to 1936). There was also a one-off 3000&nbsp;m walk at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics. The men's 20&nbsp;km walk became the standard short distance for men in 1956 and has continued since then. The longer men's event over 50&nbsp;km was first held at the 1932 Summer Olympics and was held continuously until the 2020 Olympics, except for a brief drop from the program in 1976 – the World Athletics held a World Championship for the event in protest and it was restored.\nThe first women's event was introduced at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, 84 years after the first men's race. Held over 10&nbsp;km for the first two editions, the women's event was extended to match the men's 20&nbsp;km distance from the 2000 Sydney Olympics onwards. Women have never commonly competed internationally over 50&nbsp;km, thus it was never proposed as an Olympic event – it was the last on the Olympic athletics programme in which men competed, but women did not have an equivalent. The 50&nbsp;km is also the longest distance race for an Olympic athletics event. In April 2023, a new Marathon Race Walking Mixed Relay event was announced for the 2024 Games, replacing the men's 50&nbsp;km event.\nThe Olympic records in racewalking were all broken at the 2012 London Olympics. In the 20&nbsp;km walk Chen Ding holds the men's record of 1:18:46 hours, while Elena Lashmanova held the women's mark of 1:25:02 hours until she was disqualified for doping in 2021. The men's 50&nbsp;km record is 3:36:53 hours, set by Jared Tallent.  Robert Korzeniowski is the most successful Olympic racewalker, having won the 50&nbsp;km three times as well as the 20&nbsp;km walk. Three other athletes have won four Olympic walk medals: Ugo Frigerio won three gold medals and a bronze in early competitions, Volodymyr Holubnychy won two 20&nbsp;km walk titles as well as a silver and a bronze, and Jared Tallent won a gold medal in the 50&nbsp;km along with two silver and a bronze.\nThe 1906 Intercalated Games, now not considered an official Olympic event, was the first venue for racewalking under the Olympic banner. Poor technique and judging significantly affected the 1500&nbsp;m walk event, to the point where a rematch over 3000&nbsp;m was added at short notice and judged by Constantine I of Greece.\nRace walking has been particularly affected by doping, with many Russian world and Olympic champions testing positive for banned performance-enhancing drugs.\nMedal summary\nAll-Time Combined Medal Table\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

However, this plan never came to fruition and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) later decided not to recognise these games as part of the official Olympic series. Some sports historians continue to treat the results of these games as part of the Olympic canon.\nTwo walking events were held on the track at the 1906 Games: a men's 1500&nbsp;m walk and a men's 3000&nbsp;m walk. The first final to be held was the shorter distance. American George Bonhag, an absolute walking novice who had competed in the 5-mile run, came away as the winner after Canada's Don Linden, the eventual runner-up, had given basic technical advice to allow him to compete.\nThe 3000&nbsp;m walk was held two days later as a last minute addition to the athletics programme, which was approved and also adjudicated by Constantine I of Greece after the dissatisfaction with the initial race. The entire walking field, minus Bonhag and Linden, was rearranged for the competition. Britain's Robert Wilkinson and Austria's Eugen Spiegler were again disqualified in the final stages for running, leaving Hungary's György Sztantics as the winner by a large margin.\n{|\n|-\n| 1500 metres\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| 3000 metres\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\n;Participation and athlete data\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20200417040716/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/ATH/mens-1500-metres-walk.html Athletics Men's 1,500 metres Walk Medalists].
