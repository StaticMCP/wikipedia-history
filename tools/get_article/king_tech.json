He is one half of the duo Sway & King Tech.\nCareer\nDJ King Tech began his career in the hip hop scene as a B-Boy in the Bay Area. He initially joined the musical crews \"Master City Breakers\" and \"Flynamic Force,\" performing with them regularly. As the popularity of B-Boy crews started to decline, he met Sway Calloway, and the two formed a dynamic partnership. With King Tech handling the turntables and Sway on the microphone, they represented Flynamic Force on their debut single, \"We Wanna Rock You,\" which sold 40,000 copies in the Bay Area. Their second single, \"Follow For Now,\" sold over 140,000 copies.\nWell-known on the local scene, Tech and Sway chose to start their own record label, All City Records, rather than signing with an existing one. This venture allowed them to release their music independently. Their indie release \"Follow 4 Now/Time 4 Peace\" achieved significant success, leading to a major label deal with Giant Records and the release of their LP \"Concrete Jungle.\"\nUpon entering and winning a local competition, the duo were given a one-shot deal for a 40-minute mix on local radio station 106.1 KMEL. Radio execs realized that the show can be a success with DJ King Tech on the mix and Sway as the front man. The show was named The Wake Up Show, featured music and interviews with well-known hip hop artists as well as up-and-coming ones. The show became very popular and later became NYC’s premiere Hip Hop outlet which aided Eminem to get his start at a very early stage. King Tech is also noted for helping out Wu-Tang Clan and Jay Z’s career in their early stages. The duo from The Bay Area were changing the face of not just urban radio but popular music in general and the way that it was played and appreciated on regular FM dials across the planet. King Tech was named one of the 50 Most Influential DJ’s of all time by BET.\nThe popularity of the show helped duo in getting another major label record deal with  Interscope Records. The album, This or That, reached #30 on Billboard's R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #1 on the Top Heatseekers chart in 1999.\nIn 2016, King Tech is one of the four main judges on the reality show One Shot. The show will be aired on BET in August 2016. In 2017 Tech, RZA and Mike Smith relaunched Razor Sharp Records.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Album details\n! style=\"width:120px;\"| Record\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1991\n| Concrete Jungle   5 versions\n|\nGiant Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1994\n| Best Of The Wake Up Show Free Styles '94 Vol. 1   6 versions\n| All City Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1996\n| The Wake-Up Show Mix Tape   2 versions\n|\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1996\n| Wake Up Show Freestyles Vol. 3  3 versions\n|\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1998\n| Wake Up Show Freestyles Vol. 4   2 versions\n|\n360 Enterprizes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1999\n|\nSway & King Tech featuring DJ Revolution - This Or That   5 versions\n|\nInterscope Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1999\n| Wake Up Show Freestyles Vol. 5   2 versions\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1999\n| The Wake Up Show 9th Anniversary Live Album ?(CD, Album)\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2000\n| Wake Up Show Freestyles Vol. 6   2 versions\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2001\n|\nWake Up Show Freestyles Vol. 7   2 versions\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2004\n|\nWake Up Show Freestyles Vol. 8   2 versions\n|\nBolo Entertainment\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2005\n|\nBack 2 Basics   3 versions\n|\nBungalo Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| Hip Hop Wars ?(LP)\n|\nGround Level Distribution\n|}\nSingles & EPs\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:120px;\"| Album details\n! style=\"width:120px;\"| Record\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1988\n| Flynamic Force   3 versions\n| All City Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1990\n| Follow 4 Now / Time 4 Peace   9 versions\n| All City Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1991\n| In Control / Devastating / Bum Rush The Sound   2 versions\n| Giant Records\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1999\n| Sway & King Tech Featuring DJ Revolution - The Anthem / Underground Tactics  4 versions\n| Interscope Records\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1999\n| Get You Mad   3 versions\n| Interscope Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2001\n| Sway & King Tech, Crooked I - Wake Up Show Freestyles\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2004\n| Trouble / Everything   2 versions\n| Up Above Records\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2004\n| Sway & King Tech feat.
