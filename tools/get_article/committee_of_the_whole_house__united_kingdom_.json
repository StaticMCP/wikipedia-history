The Finance Bill is always sent to a Committee of the whole House in the Commons. The sitting is presided over by the Chairman of Ways and Means, rather than the Speaker of the House, sitting in the clerk's chair (at the Table of the House) rather than the Speaker's chair normally occupied by the presiding officer, and is addressed as \"Chair\" instead of \"Deputy speaker\".\nIn the House of Lords, the Committee of the whole House examines the majority of bills.\nReferences"
