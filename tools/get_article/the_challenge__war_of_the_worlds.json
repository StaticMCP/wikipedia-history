This season featured alumni from The Real World, The Challenge, Are You the One?, The Bachelor Canada, The Bachelorette, Big Brother, Celebrity Big Brother UK, Love Island UK, Survivor Turkey, American Ninja Warrior, Party Down South, Geordie Shore, Ex on the Beach (Brazil, U.S., and UK), Telemundo, and Floribama Shore competing for a share of a $1 million prize. The season had a \"Basic Training\" launch special on January 30, 2019, and premiered on February 6, 2019 on MTV.\nThis is the first edition of the War of the Worlds series, with War of the Worlds 2 following in the fall of 2019.\nFormat\nThis season featured 16 Challenge veterans and 18 prospects - debuting Challenge competitors from around the world. For the first ten episodes, the players competed in male/female pairs. Each veteran player paired with a prospect of the opposite sex. The Prospect picked their alumni partner based on the finish order of the opening \"Impending Dune\" challenge. Once in their pairs, the main phase of the game began. The main elements of the game are as follows:\n*Daily Missions: Each round the pairs compete in the daily challenge. The top 3 pairs are immune from elimination and form the Tribunal for that round of play.\n*Tribunal: The Tribunal collectively nominate three pairs to nominate for the elimination round. The nominated pairs then face the Tribunal's interrogation with each nominee having the chance to plea their case as to why they should not be voted-in to the elimination.\n*Eliminations (The Killing Floor): At \"The Killing Floor\", the members of the tribunal each individually and publicly vote for a nominated pair to enter the elimination round. The nominated team must then call-out any non-immune pair, challenging them to the elimination. The losing pair is eliminated from the game, while the winner stays in the game and is given \"The Relic\" - which awards them immunity in the next round of play.\nDuring the 10th episode of the season, the 7 remaining pairs were disbanded, with the 14 remaining players playing the rest of the competition as individuals - with players competing in challenges as individuals and eliminated as individuals. The game format remains mostly the same, but with each round of play being designated as a male or female round and only players of the designated gender are at risk of being eliminated, but any player can be part of that round's Tribunal. Additionally, the relic is no longer awarded to an individual elimination winner.\nWhen eight players remain, they compete individually in the Final Challenge for their share of the $1,000,000 prize. First place received $750,000; second place received $200,000; third place received the remaining $50,000.\n;Twists\n*Purge: Some challenges are designated as a Purge challenge - sudden death challenges the losers are immediately eliminated. Two Purge challenge were held during the game:\n** In the \"Impending Dune\" challenge, the worst finishing male and female prospect were eliminated before pairs were drafted.\n** In the \"Judgement Day\" challenge, the worst finishing male and female were eliminated in the Penultimate Challenge of the game.\n*Double Elimination: The \"Ring Tossed\" challenge was a Double Elimination in which three teams competed and four players were eliminated (opposed to the normal two players). The pair called-out by the nominated pair must also call-out a third pair - meaning 3 teams would compete to stay in the game. Then the three players of each gender compete against each other in the elimination and only the winner of each gendered heat remaining in the game. Should members of two different pairs win their gendered-heat, they form a new pair and continue in the game, while their original partner is eliminated.\nContestants\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n!Male contestants\n!

Miz\" Mizanin and Olympian and The Challenge: Champs vs. Pros alumna Lolo Jones. Cast members attended in London, England. The first part received 0.55 million viewers along with a 0.3 18–49 demo rating, the second part dropped slightly to 0.50 million but matched the demo rating.\nControversy\nCast member Amanda Garcia claimed on her social media that fellow castmates Johnny Devenanzio, Theo Campbell and Kyle Christie used tape to cover her mouth and tie her against her will after an argument. Paulie Calafiore and Da'Vonne Rogers spoke about what allegedly happened, calling the incident \"disturbing\". A petition was also launched, demanding the network to release the unaired footage. The situation was addressed in the second part of the reunion special.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
