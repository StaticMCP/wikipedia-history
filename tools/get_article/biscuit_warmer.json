They were designed to be placed by a fire to warm the biscuits and act as a serving vessel. In the 21st century they are mostly treated as collectibles.\nDesign\nThe boxes were made of a clamshell design and commonly had a screen on either side affixed to a divider in the middle. They could be brought to the table so diners could take a hot biscuit.\nSee also\n*Bread warmer\nReferences"
