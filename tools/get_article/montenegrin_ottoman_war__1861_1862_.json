The war ended and Montenegro had to acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty.\nIn 1861 Montenegro encouraged a revolt in Herzegovina by their ethnic kinsmen.\nOttoman forces under Omar Pasha were first defeated but eventually prevailed. The Montenegrins were pressed by the Great Powers and withheld their forces from fighting in Herzegovina. The Ottoman army then invaded Montenegro.\nAfter the unsuccessful defense of Ostrog Monastery by Mirko Petrović, the Montenegrins were defeated.\nThe war ended  with the Convention of Scutari of August 31, 1862. Montenegro was forced to acknowledge Ottoman suzerainty, however the terms were generous because the Ottomans wanted to win Montenegrin goodwill.\nThe borders of 1859 were restored, the Montenegrins were allowed to import any goods, except arms, through Ottoman territory and to rent agricultural lands.\nBattles fought\n*Battle of Ostrog\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Knežević, Saša (2000). \"The Times’ coverage of the Montenegrin-Turkish War in 1862\".
