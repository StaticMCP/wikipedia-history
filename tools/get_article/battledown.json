In the 19th century a number of such private estates were established in the town;  Battledown is the last to remain private, the rest having been merged into the wider town.  Battledown is one of the richest parts of Cheltenham; the average house price is approximately £1 million.\nIn the 1960s Battledown Manor became a home for boys between the ages of 9 and 16. The head was a retired Royal Marines Captain, J B Ward, and the manor housed some 15 to 20 boys from across England. All of the boys were sent to local schools in Charlton Kings and Cheltenham.\nReferences\nExternal links"
