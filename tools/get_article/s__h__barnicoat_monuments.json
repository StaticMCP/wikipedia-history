H. Barnicoat Monuments, S. H. Barnicoat Granite Works, or, more recently, Hancock Monument Co. was a granite workshop at 114 Columbia Street, at the corner of Centre Street, in Quincy, Massachusetts.  It was housed in a rare surviving 19th-century granite workshop building dating to the 1890s, and was, at the time of its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, one of the only 19th-century granite workshops operating in the city.  Its main feature was a derrick more than  tall that was used to move granite around the property.\nThe workshop has since been demolished and replaced by a Valvoline lubrication garage and Dunkin Donuts.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Quincy, Massachusetts\nReferences"
