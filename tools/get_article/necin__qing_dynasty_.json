In 1727, he inherited the hereditary dukedom and appointed as the Junior Assistant Chamberlain of the Imperial Guard (Chinese: 散秩大臣, Manchu: sula amban). He was favored by Yongzheng Emperor, and appointed the Grand Councillor in 1728. He had served as lieutenant-general of the Manchu Bordered White Banner (鑲白旗滿洲都統), commander of the imperial bodyguard (領侍衛內大臣), lieutenant-general of the Manchu Bordered Yellow Banner (鑲黃旗滿洲都統), Minister of War (兵部尚書), Minister of Personnel (吏部尚書) and other positions. He was one of the officials whom Qianlong Emperor relied on, described as a \"hard-working, cautious, capable and honest\" official.\nIn 1748, during the First Jinchuan campaign, Necin was made the Military Commissioner (經略大臣) and sent to Sichuan to put down the rebellion. It was soon deprived of his post because of his failure to advance. He and Zhang Guangsi, whom was the Viceroy of Chuan-Shaan, quarreled over military strategy, mutually blamed each other. In the next year, Zhang was escorted to Beijing and later executed. Meanwhile, Necin was also condemned to death for cowardly conduct, for abusing his trust, and for making dishonest reports to the emperor. He was beheaded in full view of the army, making use of Ebilun's sword. His dukedom was given to his elder brother, Tsereng.\nReferences"
