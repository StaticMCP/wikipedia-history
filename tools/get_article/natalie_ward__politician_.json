Greg Pearce. Ward served as the Minister for Sport, Multiculturalism, Seniors and Veterans in the second Berejiklian ministry and the first arrangement of the Perrottet ministry between May and December 2021. She was the Minister for Metropolitan Roads and Minister for Women's Safety and the Prevention of Domestic and Sexual Violence in the second Perrottet ministry, from December 2021 to March 2023.\nWard is a commercial litigation lawyer of 20 years practice in large commercial firms, boutique practice and government regulatory financial services areas. She served on the board of Women Lawyers and is a member of the Rotary Club of Sydney. She is a former director of Australian Rugby Foundation.\nWard was formerly deputy chief of staff to NSW Minister for Finance and Services and Minister for the Illawarra, Greg Pearce. Prior to her appointment to the ministry, Ward served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney General and Chaired the Joint Select Committee on Coercive Control and the Joint Select Committee on Sydney's Night Time Economy.\nHer husband, David Begg, is a commercial lawyer and former president of Sydney Rugby Union.\nWard wanted to move to the Legislative Assembly at the 2023 New South Wales state election, but in a preselection contest for the ultra-safe Liberal seat of Davidson, in Sydney’s northern suburbs, she was defeated by Matt Cross, a former staff member for Mike Baird.\nAfter the defeat of the Coalition government at the 2023 state election, Ward was elected deputy leader of the NSW Liberal Party. This is despite the fact that she is a member of the upper house the Legislative Council as the position usually goes to a member of the lower house the Legislative Assembly and therefore necessitating rule changes to allow her to assume the position.\nReferences"
