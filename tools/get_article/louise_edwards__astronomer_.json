In 2002, she was pictured on a Canadian stamp.\nEarly life, education and research\nLouise Edwards grew up in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. She completed her undergraduate degree in physics and astronomy, with a minor in mathematics, at the University of Victoria. She received a master's degree from St Mary's University in 2003, and a PhD from Université Laval in 2007. She studies galaxy formation and evolution using optical and infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photometric data, and radio wavelength observations, focusing on Brightest Cluster Galaxies, galaxies in cluster cores, and galaxies in filaments.\nCareer\nFollowing her doctoral studies, Edwards was a postdoctoral research scientist at Caltech/IPAC and Trent University, and then an assistant professor at Mount Allison University. From 2012 to 2016, Edwards was a lecturer and research scientist in the astronomy department at Yale University, before starting her faculty position at Cal Poly in 2016. During her time at Yale, she was the chair of the Dorrit Hoffleit Undergraduate Research Fellowship program for undergraduate research in Astronomy.\nIn the media\n* CBC program celebrating Black History Month\n* The Deep Sky: From Near to Far.
