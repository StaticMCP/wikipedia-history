In 1616, he compiled a complete genealogy of the Priuli, the Arbore della nobilissima Famiglia Priuli. It is known from two manuscripts.Dorit Raines, [https://iris.unive.it/bitstream/10278/3683819/5/raines-articolo.pdf \"Les généalogies vénitiennes (XVIe–XVIIIe siècle): instrument politique, outil juridique\"], in Stéphane Jettot and Marie Lezowski (eds.), ''L'entreprise généalogique: Pratiques sociales et imaginaires en Europe (XVe–XXe siècle) [The Genealogical Enterprise: Social Practices and Collective Imagination in Europe (15th–20th centuries)] (Peter Lang, 2016), pp. 89–112, at 107–108. In 1619, he began writing the Pretiosi Frutti del Maggior Consiglio. He may have still been working on it into the early 1630s. It is preserved in the manuscript Museo Correr, Codici Cicogna MSS 3781-3 (formerly 2889-91). This manuscript is composed of three originally separate volumes assembled for Emmanuele Antonio Cicogna.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.culturaveneto.it/it/beni-culturali/manoscritti/5d137c1f656efb0a30dc410a Venezia, Biblioteca del Museo Correr, ms.
