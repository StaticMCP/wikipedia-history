In it, Pyotr Bagration's Russian troops defeated the Turkish troops of Koca Hüsrev Mehmed Pasha at the place of Rassowa.\nIn Cernavodă, where Bagration arrived on September 14, reconnaissance was carried out. Acting according to Bagration's plan, Mikhail Miloradovich's corps launched a frontal attack, while Matvei Platov's corps cut off Hüsrev Pasha's escape route to Silistria.
