The Salzburg Museum Rupertinum (which is now part of Museum der Moderne Salzburg) was co-founded by its first director Otto Breicha. The prize was awarded every two years until 2001. After a hiatus the prize was revived in 2007 and renamed \"Otto Breicha Prize for Photographic Art\" in memory of Otto Breicha's and the museum's early promotion of photography as an art form, which was still not very popular at the time, as well as the museum's extensive photographic collection (started in 1981).\nIt was reconceptualized so that it is not longer only awarded for pure photography, but also recognizes the role of photography in media contexts. The prize is supported by the Breicha family and the winner's work is shown in an exhibition at Rupertinum.\nLaureates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ABCDEF\"|\n! style=\"background:#ABCDEF\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#ABCDEF\"| Name\n|-\n| 01\n| 1983\n| Alfred Seiland\n|-\n| 02\n| 1985\n| Otmar Thormann\n|-\n| 03\n| 1987\n| Branko Lenart\n|-\n| 04\n| 1989\n| Heinz Cibulka\n|-\n| 05\n| 1991\n| Manfred Willmann\n|-\n| 06\n| 1993\n| Walter Berger\n|-\n| 07\n| 1995\n| Paul Albert Leitner\n|-\n| 08\n| 1997\n| Friedl Kubelka\n|-\n| 09\n| 1999\n| Seiichi Furuya\n|-\n| 10\n| 2001\n| Peter Dressler\n|-\n| 11\n| 2007\n| Ferry Radax\n|-\n| 12\n| 2009\n| Margherita Spiluttini\n|-\n| 13\n| 2011\n| Ilse Haider\n|-\n| 14\n| 2013\n| Matthias Herrmann\n|-\n| 15\n| 2015\n| Leo Kandl\n|-\n|16\n|2017\n|Lisl Ponger\n|-\n|17\n|2019\n|Marina Faust\n|-\n|18\n|2021\n|Anna Jermolaewa\n|-\n|19\n|2024\n|Sophie Thun\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
