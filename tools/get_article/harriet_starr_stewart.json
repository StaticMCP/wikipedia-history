She enrolled at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick in 1878, and completed her studies in 1882, seven years after Grace Annie Lockhart became the first woman in the British Empire and in Canada to earn a bachelor's degree, also at Mount Allison University.\nFollowing graduation, Stewart played a vital role in the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) as a charter member in New Brunswick.
