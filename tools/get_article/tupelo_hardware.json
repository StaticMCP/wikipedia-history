Booth in 1926 in a building across the street from its current location. Throughout most of the company's history, it has served its customers from its three-story brick, Main Street location in the historic downtown district of Tupelo, Mississippi.\nElvis Presley\nGladys Presley brought her son Elvis to Tupelo Hardware Co. in January 1945 to buy him a birthday present. Elvis would have preferred a rifle, but his mother succeeded in buying a guitar instead. The boy strummed the new guitar for a while, before his mother paid $7.75 and a 2% sales tax.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## Tupelo hardware\n\n#REDIRECT Tupelo Hardware"
