Awards were handed out for the best films of 2012 regardless of geography, and are the international counterpart to the awards for Australian films (held on 28 and 30 January). The ceremony took place at Soho House in West Hollywood, California on 26 January 2013. The event was hosted by Australian actor Russell Crowe.\nThe nominees were announced on 8 January 2013, with Silver Linings Playbook receiving the most nominations, with five. Silver Linings Playbook won the most awards with three, and were given to discretionary, non-competitive awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress to Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver, respectively.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees were determined by up to twelve jurors, which comprise writers, directors, actors and producers and people working in distribution and exhibition. Fifty films were selected to compete as early as May 2012, and by July or August the Jury was assembled to determine the nominees. The announcement was made on 8 January 2013, and Silver Linings Playbook received the most nominations with five, followed by Lincoln and Zero Dark Thirty, with four each. Silver Linings Playbook received the most wins with three, for Best Film, Best Direction and Best Actress.
