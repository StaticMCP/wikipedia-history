It is one of eight churches on Antarctica. The chapel is basically a large container of metal, modified so that it resembles a common church, whose interior has electricity and a proper heating system. Religious ceremonies are performed by a deacon, who lives permanently in the villa.\nThe chapel is relatively new, having opened in the late twentieth century. Currently the chapel is the southernmost Chilean Catholic church, and one of the southernmost of the planet.\nThe temple is part of the Catholic Military Bishopric of Chile (Obispado Castrense de Chile).\nSee also\n*Chapel of Santisima Virgen de Lujan, Antarctica\n*Chapel of St. Francis of Assisi (Esperanza Base)\n*Religion in Antarctica\nReferences"
