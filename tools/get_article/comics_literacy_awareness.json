The first Comics Laureate, Dave Gibbons, was selected in October 2014. Subsequent Comics Laureates have been Charlie Adlard (2017-19), Hannah Berry (2019-21), Stephen L. Holland (2021-23) and Bobby Joseph (2023-25).\nSee also\n* Kate Greenaway Medal\n* List of comics awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
