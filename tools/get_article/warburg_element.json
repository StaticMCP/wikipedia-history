That element is named after German physicist Emil Warburg.\nA Warburg impedance element can be difficult to recognize because it is nearly always associated with a charge-transfer resistance (see charge transfer complex) and a double-layer capacitance, but is common in many systems. The presence of the Warburg element can be recognised if a linear relationship on the log of a Bode plot (}} vs. ) exists with a slope of value –1/2.\nGeneral equation\nThe Warburg diffusion element () is a constant phase element (CPE), with a constant phase of 45° (phase independent of frequency) and with a magnitude inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency by:\n:{Z_\\mathrm{W}} = \\frac{A_\\mathrm{W}}{\\sqrt{\\omega}}+\\frac{A_\\mathrm{W}}{j\\sqrt{\\omega}}\n:{|Z_\\mathrm{W}|} = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{A_\\mathrm{W}}{\\sqrt{\\omega}}\nwhere\n* is the Warburg coefficient (or Warburg constant);\n* is the imaginary unit;\n* is the angular frequency.\nThis equation assumes semi-infinite linear diffusion, that is, unrestricted diffusion to a large planar electrode.\nFinite-length Warburg element\nIf the thickness of the diffusion layer is known, the finite-length Warburg element is defined as:\n:{Z_\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{1}{Y_0} \\tanh\\left(B \\sqrt{j\\omega}\\right)\nwhere B=\\tfrac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{D}},\nwhere \\delta is the thickness of the diffusion layer and  is the diffusion coefficient.\nThere are two special conditions of finite-length Warburg elements: the Warburg Short () for a transmissive boundary, and the Warburg Open () for a reflective boundary.\nWarburg Short (WS)\nThis element describes the impedance of a finite-length diffusion with transmissive boundary. It is described by the following equation:\n: Z_{W_\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{A_\\mathrm{W}}{\\sqrt{j\\omega}} \\tanh \\left(B \\sqrt{j\\omega}\\right)\nWarburg Open (WO)\nThis element describes the impedance of a finite-length diffusion with reflective boundary. It is described by the following equation:\n: Z_{W_\\mathrm{O}} = \\frac{A_\\mathrm{W}}{\\sqrt{j\\omega}} \\coth\\left(B \\sqrt{j\\omega}\\right)\nReferences"
