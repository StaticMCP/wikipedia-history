Finland agreed to pay the reparations in the Moscow Armistice signed on 19 September 1944.  The protocol to determine more precisely the war reparations to the Soviet Union was signed in December 1944, by the prime minister Juho Kusti Paasikivi and the chairman of the Allied Control Commission for controlling the Moscow Armistice in Helsinki, Andrei Zhdanov.\nFinland was originally obliged to pay $300,000,000 in gold to be paid in the form of ships and machinery, over six years. The Soviet Union agreed to prolong the payment period from six to eight years in late 1945. In summer 1948 the sum was cut to $226,500,000 (equivalent to US$}} in ). The last dispatched train of the deliveries paying the war reparations crossed the border between Finland and the Soviet Union on 18 September 1952, in Vainikkala railway border station.  Approximately 340,000 railway wagonloads were needed to deliver all reparations.\nThe authority responsible for deliveries, and also organising production agreements with the manufacturers according to the protocols, was Sotakorvausteollisuuden valtuuskunta, the delegation of the war reparations industry. The preliminary committee was established on 9 October 1944. It was chaired by the industrialist , with Jaakko Rautanen as secretary, and , Juho Jännes, Johan Nykopp, , and Wilhelm Wahlforss as members.\nSome deliveries\nLtd's workshop in Hyvinkää 28.8.1952]]\nElectrical\n*52,500 electric engines, 1,140 transformational stations, and 30 mills with power stations\nLocomotives\nLokomo together with Tampella produced 525 narrow gauge locomotives, PT-4 series.\nValmet\n*Move 21, a railway engine for narrow 750&nbsp;mm gauge, 76 units produced, 66 units delivered to the Soviet Union.

Vega was written off in 1979 and it was moved to a building berth in 1986. The Estonian Maritime Museum had a project for its restoration, but the work did not start. The schooner was not well protected and its condition started to worsen. The Finns planned to save the Vega, but the plans did not succeed. Pietarsaaren Vanha Satama Oy decided to establish a Vega foundation, which was registered on 3 June 1996.\nF. W.

The last delivery of wooden houses took place on 28 January 1948. The deliveries started on 22 December 1944. Altogether the floor area of the delivered wooden houses was 840,000 m2.  The war reparation itself contributed 177,000 m2 as compensation for the German property, which Finland did not hand over to the Soviet Union. This consisted of 37,208 railway wagons, which as a single train would have been 335&nbsp;km long.\n*522 wooden houses, Oulu company Pateniemi saw mill\nSee also\n* Finnish maritime cluster\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
