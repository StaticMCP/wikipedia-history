      "text": "# 2022 Senate Republican Conference leadership election\n\nOn November 16, 2022, Republican members of the United States Senate held an election to determine the leader of the Senate Republican Conference. Incumbent leader Mitch McConnell defeated a challenge by Florida senator Rick Scott in a vote by secret ballot. This was the first contested conference leadership election since 1996, marking a break from the tradition of unanimously confirming incumbent leaders seeking re-election. Voting was limited to those expected to serve as Republican senators in the 118th Congress.\nOverview\nRepublicans failed to produce the anticipated red wave during the 2022 United States elections, leading some more conservative members to blame the outcome on current leadership, including incumbent Senate Republican Conference leader Mitch McConnell. The election also marked the first time since 1996 that a contested Senate Republican leadership challenge proceeded to a vote.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates declared their intent to run.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px\" |Candidate\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px\" |State\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px\" |Other Senate roles\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 40px\" class=\"unsortable\" |Ref.\n|-\n|Mitch McConnell\n|Kentucky\n|Leader of the Senate Republican ConferenceRepublican Senate WhipChair of the Senate Rules Committee\n|\n|-\n|Rick Scott\n|Florida\n|Chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee\n|\n}}\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Votes\n!Percent\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Mitch McConnell\n|37\n|\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Rick Scott\n|10\n|\n|-\n|colspan=2|Write-in\n|1\n|rowspan=2|N/A\n|-\n|colspan=2|Abstentions\n|1\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total:\n!47\n!100%\n|-\n!colspan=4|Source:\n|}\nSee also\n*January 2023 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election#Republican nomination\nReferences"
