It is equivalent to the title of Mayor. Some provinces with communes are Córdoba, Chubut, Santa Fe and Tucumán.\nThe term does not apply to other structures also known as communes, this generally referring to entities that are small in size. The top executive post in such areas is not designated President but as Mayor (maire in the French or Luxembourg communes).\nSee also\n*List of administrative communes\n*Lists of communes of France\n*List of communes of Luxembourg\n*Communes of Senegal\n*Communes of Argentina"
