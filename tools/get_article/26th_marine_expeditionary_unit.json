It is an air-ground task force with a strength of about 2,400 personnel when at full strength during a deployment. It consists of four major parts: a command element, a ground combat element, an aviation combat element, and a logistics combat element. Since its establishment in the early 1970s as the 26th Marine Amphibious Unit, it has deployed extensively and participated in numerous combat and contingency operations, as well as training exercises. The 26th MEU is based out of Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in the U.S. state of North Carolina.\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit was established on 24 April 1967 for a short mission and was quickly deactivated (as was the norm during this period) on 20 October 1967. During June–December 1969, the 26th MEU was reactivated as the 36th Marine Expeditionary Unit for Exercise Landing Force Caribbean 3-69 (LANFORCARIB 3-69).\nIn 1975 the 36th Marine Amphibious Unit participated in Exercise , part of Exercise Reforger, conducted in the central plains of West Germany near the city of Hanover. The 36th MAU's participation marked the first time since World War I the Marine Corps had a combined arms force ashore in Germany. The unit was redesignated as the 26th Marine Amphibious Unit in 1982 and became part of the rotation cycle of three MAUs on the East Coast in 1985. It was the first of the MAUs to undergo Special Operations Capable training, earn the SOC qualification, and have AV-8B Harriers attached. The SOC designation denotes a MEU has undergone an enhanced pre-deployment training program and is able to provide special operations capabilities during an upcoming deployment. In 1986, the MEU participated in Operation El Dorado Canyon. The unit was again redesignated as the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit in 1988.\n1990s through 2000\nIn 1991 the 26TH MEU supported Operation Desert Shield by providing a \"Show of Force\" in the Mediterranean, and participated in Operation Sharp Edge, a non-combatant evacuation operation of Liberia. The next year saw the 26th MEU participating in Operation Provide Promise, Operation Deny Flight and Operation Sharp Guard off the coast of Yugoslavia.\nIn 1994 the 26th MEU participated in ceremonies marking the 50th Anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France. The 26th MEU also supported Operation Restore Hope off the coast of Somalia and participated in continued operations in Bosnia.\nThree years later the 26th MEU launched Operation Silver Wake, evacuating U.S. citizens and foreign nationals from Albania, and also participated in Operation Guardian Retrieval, the staging of forces in the Congo for a possible evacuation of Zaire.\nIn 1998 the 26th MEU served as the Headquarters for the Strategic Reserve Force during Exercise Dynamic Response in Bosnia. The SRF is a multinational force made up of forces from the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Romania, Poland, and the United States.\nThe 26th MEU played a notable role in the Balkan conflict. In 1998 it participated in Operation Determined Falcon, the one-day NATO aerial show-of-force in Kosovo. From April to May 1999 it took part in Operation Noble Anvil and Operation Shining Hope.

From June to July 1999, it participated in Operation Joint Guardian. As the first U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo, the 26th MEU helped provide stability to the embattled region.\nAugust 1999 saw the 26th MEU taking part in Operation Avid Response, providing Humanitarian Assistance to the people of Western Turkey left homeless by a devastating earthquake.\nThe 26th MEU conducted Adriatic presence operations during the election crisis in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in September 2000. The 26th MEU also participated in exercises Atlas Hinge in Tunisia and Croatian Phibex 2000, the first-ever bilateral exercise between the Marine Corps and the Croatian Armed Forces. During the next two months, the 26th MEU supported diplomatic initiatives during unrest in Israel while simultaneously taking part in the NATO exercise Destined Glory 2000 and continued to break new ground through the second bi-lateral exercise between the Marine Corps and the Croatian Armed Forces, exercise Slunj 2000.\nGlobal War on Terrorism\nFollowing the events of 11 September 2001, the 26th MEU(SOC) was among the first U.S. forces into Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Swift Freedom. From December 2001 to February 2002, 26th MEU(SOC) Marines reinforced the 15th MEU  who had conducted the 450 mile seizure of Camp Rhino in November 2001 and Kandahar International Airport in December 2001. Both MEUs worked together and constructed a detainment facility that held more than 400 Taliban and Al Qaeda terrorists.\nFrom April to May 2003, the 26th MEU participated in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom by conducting operations in Erbil and Mosul, Iraq. It was inserted via CH-53 and KC-130 and conducted combat operations until relieved by the 101st Airborne Division.\nThe 26th MEU served as the primary tactical unit for Joint Task Force Liberia during Operation Sheltering Sky from August to September 2003 in the Second Liberian Civil War.
