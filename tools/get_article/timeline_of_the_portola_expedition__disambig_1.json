Later, the region was administratively-split into Baja (lower, see Baja California peninsula) and Alta (upper, see Alta California). The first section of the march was on the Baja California peninsula, and the northern section of the expedition's trail was in today's US state of California.\nMissionary Juan Crespi kept a diary describing the group's daily progress and detailed descriptions of their locations, allowing modern researchers to reconstruct their journey. Portions of other diaries by Gaspar de Portolá, engineer Miguel Costansó, missionary Junípero Serra, army officer Jose de Canizares, and Sergeant José Ortega also survived. When analyzed as a whole, they provide detailed daily information on the route traveled and camping locations, as well as descriptions of the country and its native inhabitants.\nBackground\nThe Portolá expedition was the brainchild of José de Gálvez, visitador (inspector general, a personal representative of the king) in New Spain. On his recommendation, King Charles III of Spain authorized Gálvez to explore Alta California and establish the first permanent Spanish presence there.  Gálvez was supported in the planning of an expedition by Carlos Francisco de Croix (Viceroy of New Spain), and Father Junípero Serra (head of the Franciscan mission to the Californias).\nGálvez and Serra met in November, 1768, to plan the expedition. The goals set were to establish two Presidios and nearby missions – at San Diego and Monterrey (one \"r\" has since been dropped). These places had been described and given names 166 years before by the maritime explorations of Sebastián Vizcaíno. In addition, the name San Carlos Borromeo was chosen for the mission at Monterrey.\nGálvez placed Gaspar de Portolá, recently appointed governor of Las Californias, in overall command of the expedition. Second in command was Captain Fernando Rivera y Moncada, commander of the Presidio at Loreto. Serra headed the Franciscan missionary contingent. Three ships were also assigned: two to follow the land march up the coast and keep the expedition supplied from the naval depot at La Paz (on the Baja peninsula), and another ship to connect La Paz with the mainland at San Blas.\nElements of the land expedition gathered north of Loreto in March, 1769, and marched north-west to San Diego; then from San Diego to the San Francisco Peninsula and back. Rivera led the first group, consisting mainly of soldiers, scouts and engineers to prepare the road and deal with hostile natives. Portolá and Serra followed in a second group with the civilians, livestock and baggage. Serra stayed with the new mission in San Diego while Portolá and Rivera took a smaller group north.\nLed by Rivera's scouts, the road followed established native paths as much as possible (the southern and central California coastal areas were found to have the densest native population of any region north of central Mexico), and blazing new trails where necessary. The two main requirements for a camping place were an adequate supply of drinkable fresh water and forage for the livestock. For that reason, most of the campsites were near creeks, ponds or springs. All three of the main land expedition diaries give daily distances traveled in leagues. As used at that time, one Spanish league equaled about 2.6 miles. A typical day's march covered 2–4 leagues, with frequent rest days.\nThe following year (1770), Portolá returned north as far as Monterrey to establish the second Presidio there and to establish a new provincial seat. Serra came north by sea to make the Mission San Carlos Borromeo del rio Carmelo (moved a few miles south from its original Monterrey location) his headquarters. Portolá's successor as governor, Pedro Fages, found an easier inland route later in 1770 from Monterrey to San Francisco Bay, and further explored the eastern side of the bay in 1772 (accompanied again by padre Juan Crespí, who again kept a diary).\nThe 1776 expedition of Juan Bautista de Anza used the official Portolá expedition report (drawn from the diaries) to follow mostly in the footsteps of Portolá from Mission San Gabriel to Monterrey, taking the Fages route from Monterrey to San Francisco Bay. Much of today's Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail in coastal California was previously the Portolá trail. Sixteen of the twenty-one Spanish Missions of California were established along the Portolá route.\nAbout the diaries\nThe Crespí diary is the most complete of the three land expedition accounts, because Crespí was the only diarist present during the entire expedition. It includes nearly all of the information found in the other two, plus many extra details about the country and the native peoples. Herbert Bolton translated Crespi's diary to English and annotated it with modern references. Bolton added information about the modern campsite locations, as shown below. Bolton also included maps with his \"best guess\" of the expedition's march routes, superimposed on modern California maps.\nIn 2001, a new edition of the Crespí diary was published, with side-by-side Spanish and English text – both of Crespí's original field notes, and also his expanded rewrite for the later official version.\nVicente Vila, captain of the San Carlos — one of three ships supporting the expedition — also kept a diary that has survived, but he only sailed as far as San Diego, and never joined the expedition on land. Free online translations of both Vila's and Costansó's diaries are available. Fages also wrote, in 1775, an after-the fact account of the 1769–70 expedition.\nThe official report of the expedition is also available online. Written later by Carlos Francisco de Croix, marqués de Croix, the brief document drew on the diaries kept by the expedition participants.\nJanuary to June in Baja California\nMonth by month in Alta California\nThe hunters in this unnamed group were thus the first to report back to expedition leaders the sighting of San Francisco Bay. Ortega's scouts, however, because they left camp a day earlier, were probably the first to see the bay.\nThe hunters also saw and reported that further progress to the north was blocked by the wide bay entrance channel (later named the Golden Gate by John C. Fremont. As Crespí wrote:\nCrespí also quotes a revealing passage from the expedition's guidebook, in which Cabrera Bueno described what he called the \"Bahia de San Francisco\":\nCrespí thought that this passage described the entrance to the huge \"estuary\" the scouts had just found. If Crespí's interpretation was correct, then the discovery of San Francisco Bay happened many years earlier (Cabrera Bueno's Navegación Espéculativa y Práctica was published in 1734).\n|  3 – The scouts returned after dark, with news they had \"learned or inferred\" from some natives – that two days' march farther on there was a harbor with a ship in it. This information turned out to be false, but it inspired the expedition leaders to push ahead for a few more days.\n|  4 – The entire party climbed Sweeney Ridge, where there's a spot now marked as the San Francisco Bay Discovery Site. Portolá, Constansó and Crespí all saw the great bay to the east. To the north, however, the Golden Gate cannot be seen from the ridge – blocked from view by the intervening San Bruno Mountain.\nDescending the inland side of the ridge toward the southeast, camp was made in the valley of San Andreas Creek, near today's San Andreas Lake, or possibly another parallel valley to the west (Bolton).\n|  5 – Continuing southeast in the same valley (formed by the San Andreas Fault), camp was made near today's Crystal Springs Dam.\n|  6 – Continuing in the same direction to today's San Francisquito Creek, just past the Stanford Linear Accelerator.\n|  7–9 – Portolá decided to halt the main party and send the scouts out again, in an attempt to find the aforementioned harbor and ship. They were given four days.\n| 10 – The scouts returned with discouraging news – they had found no harbor or ship, and now doubted that they had correctly understood what the natives were trying to tell them. They had rounded the southern end of the bay and traveled up the east side far enough to see San Pablo Bay (actually the northern arm of San Francisco Bay) – which may have been as far north as modern Richmond.\n| 11 – Portolá convened another officers' council, which unanimously agreed that 1) they must have passed Monterey, 2) it was time to turn around and retrace their steps back to San Diego, and 3) no one would be left behind hoping a supply ship will arrive. The campsite that night was a few miles back to the north into the San Andreas rift valley. (Note: on p. 236 of the Crespí diary translation, Bolton includes in a footnote a lengthy translation of the Manila galleon pilot José Cabrera Bueno's description of Monterey Bay, as he saw it from shipboard while sailing south).\n| 12 – To San Andreas Creek (same camp as Nov. 4)\n| 13 – To San Pedro Creek (same camp as Nov. 1–3)\n| 14–15 – To San Vicente Creek (same camp as Oct. 30)\n| 16 – To Half Moon Bay (same camp as Oct. 29)\n| 17 – To Tunitas Creek\n| 18 – To Pescadero Creek\n| 19 – To Año Nuevo Creek\n| 20 – To Scott Creek (same camp as Oct. 19)\n| 21 – To Coja (Majors) Creek (same camp as Oct. 18)\n| 22 – To Soquel Creek (same camp as Oct. 16)\n| 23 – To a lake near Watsonville (same camp as Oct. 10–14)\n| 24–25 – To a lake \"one league\" south of the Pajaro River\n| 26 – To Blanco (same camp as Oct. 1–6)\n| 27 – To one of the small lakes now in the city of Monterey, possibly the one called Lake El Estero. On Portolá's return to the area later in 1770, the Presidio of Monterey was established nearby.\n| 28 – South across the Monterey Peninsula to Carmel Bay, across the Carmel River to camp north of Point Lobos\n| 29 – Dec. 6 – The main party stayed at this camp, while Captain Rivera went south with a scouting party.\n}}\n|  7 – The officers' council meets again, and the decision is made to return to San Diego without waiting any longer for the missing men or for a supply ship (which never came).\n|  8–9 – Stormy weather delayed the departure.\n| 10 – Portolá ordered that a large wooden cross be planted where it could be seen by passing ships, and a letter describing the expedition's travels was buried at its foot. Crespí quoted part of the letter as saying: \"The cross was planted on a hill on the edge of the beach of the little bay which lies to the south of the Point of Pines\". Today, the nearest beaches to the south of the point are along 17-Mile Drive. The letter went on to say that another cross had been set up on Monterey Bay, \"where the sand dunes and a lagoon are\". The expedition camped for the night near that spot in Monterey (same camp as Nov. 27).\n| 11 – The expedition camped at Blanco (same camp as Oct. 1–6 and Nov. 26).\n| 12–15 – Southeast on the Salinas River (same camps as Sep. 26–29)\n| 16–26 – Leaving the Salinas Valley near today's King City, the expedition retraces its trail through the Santa Lucia Mountains and down the coast to the San Luis Obispo area. The main mission road abandoned this part of Portolá's trail after 1774, when Juan Bautista de Anza established a new route from Mission San Luis Obispo to Mission San Antonio de Padua over the Cuesta grade.\n| 27–31 – Instead of turning south to follow San Luis canyon as before, the party continued southeast toward the modern community Edna before turning south into Price Canyon. From that point they followed the earlier trail, returning to Guadalupe on Dec. 31 (same camp as Sep. 1)\n}}\nand met them there. Apparently, however, no one kept a diary on that second journey to Monterey Bay, following the now-familiar trail.\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://pacificahistory.wikispaces.com/Portola+Expedition+1769+Diaries \"Three Portolá Expedition Diaries\"].
