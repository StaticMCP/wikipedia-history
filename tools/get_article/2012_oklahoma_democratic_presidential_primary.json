Oklahoma's 45 pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention were allocated according to the results of the vote.\nOklahoma was one of only a handful of primary states where candidates other than incumbent President Barack Obama qualified for the ballot. Although Obama ultimately triumphed in the primary by a comfortable margin, his showing in Oklahoma was his worst performance in any primary state. Four other candidates won 43% of the vote combined; candidates Randall Terry and Jim Rogers won the most votes in multiple counties and qualified for several delegates, although these delegates were not rewarded due to technicalities.\nProcedure\nOklahoma was allocated 50 delegates to the Democratic National Convention: 45 were allocated based on the results of the primary, with the other five being unpledged superdelegates.\nIn order to qualify for pledged delegates, a candidate had to receive at least 15% of the vote statewide or in at least one congressional district. 29 of Oklahoma's delegates were allotted among the state's five congressional districts. The remaining 16 pledged delegates were allocated based on the statewide popular vote, consisting of 10 at-large delegates and 6 pledged PLEOs (party leaders and elected officials).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:none; clear:none; padding:5px; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!

Candidates running against Obama won 43% of the vote combined.\nRandall Terry came second with 18% of the vote and placed first in 11 counties: Beaver, Bryan, Cimarron, Dewey, Grant, Greer, McCurtain, Pushmataha, Roger Mills, Texas and Washita.\nPerennial candidate Jim Rogers, who had run several times for office in Oklahoma, won nearly 14% of the vote and placed first in the counties of Beckham, Coal and Ellis.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" |2012 Oklahoma Democratic presidential primary\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Delegates\n|-\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Barack Obama (incumbent)\n|64,389\n|57.10\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Randall Terry\n|20,312\n|18.01\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Jim Rogers\n|15,546\n|13.79\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Darcy Richardson\n|7,201\n|6.39\n| rowspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bob Ely\n|5,323\n|4.72\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!Total\n!112,771\n!100%\n!45\n|}\nSee also\n* 2012 Oklahoma Republican presidential primary\n* 2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2012 United States presidential election in Oklahoma\nReferences"
