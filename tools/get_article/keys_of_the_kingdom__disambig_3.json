The inscription, written in Slovene, reads: \"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven\".]]\nThe keys of the kingdom is a Christian concept of eternal church authority. Christians believe it was established in the 1st century AD, initially through Saint Peter then through the rest of the 12 Apostles. The latter, continuing with the early Church Fathers, would eventually comprise the early church and its doctrine. It is this authority, having been given the keys, that subsequent doctrinal points have been built upon.\nThe authority can be traced to one passage in the New Testament, where Jesus mentions them first in response to St. Peter answering a question and secondly in speaking to a group of disciples. In these two instances, the concept of authority follows having been given the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven\" and regards loosing and binding things on earth, and thus having loosened and bound the same in heaven (Matthew 16:19, Matthew 18:18). A third authority regarding sin is seen without mentioning \"keys\" in John 20:23.\nNot all adherents to the faith in the risen Jesus Christ follow the further doctrinal concepts of sole authority held in any particular church, organization, or individual today. One view is that the keys were used for a specific purpose and at a set time; namely at the Day of Pentecost—the baptism of the Holy Spirit. There is much debate regarding the further doctrinal base the church's leadership established in the early centuries.|Matthew 16: 13-20 (NIV)}}\nIn this passage, the word \"you\" is singular in the original Greek, despite the other apostles being present. A mirroring passage, which does not mention the keys, is also found later in chapter 18, within the context of verses 18-20:\n|Matthew 18: 18-20 (NIV)}}\nHere, the plural \"you\" is used.\nDay of Pentecost and message\n]]\nAccording to Acts of the Apostles, on the day of Pentecost, Peter, in the presence of the other 11 disciples, speaks a message to the Jews from all over the known world, metaphorically using the keys to open the kingdom, inviting hearers in, building the church. Up until this point it was only Jesus who spoke / preached to the disciples. Here we see Peter act on the commission given to him by Christ in Matthew 16;\n|Acts 2: 14 (NIV)}}\nAfterwards, Peter speaks a message explaining the completion of several prophecies, concluding with;\n|Acts 2: 36-41 (NIV)}}\nIslam\nIn contrast to the Christian belief expressed in Matthew 16:19, where Jesus declares that Peter holds the \"keys of the kingdom of heaven\" (Greek: κλεῖδα, kleîda; Syriac: ܩܠܺܝܕ݂ܶܐ, qəlīḏe), thereby granting the Church authority over admission to Paradise, the Qur'an asserts that the keys of the heavens and earth belong to God alone (39:63; 42:12), affirming that only God possesses the power to grant or withhold entry to Paradise. Notably, in these verses the Qur'an employs the rare term maqālīd (مَقَالِيد) for \"keys,\" rather than the more common mafātīḥ, and this word appears exclusively in connection with \"heaven and earth.\" The term maqālīd ultimately derives from Aramaic אַקְלִידָא / ܐܩܠܝܕܐ (ʾaqlīdā, \"key\"), itself borrowed from Ancient Greek κλεῖδα (kleîda), subtly echoing the phrasing of Matthew 16:19 while simultaneously emphasizing that authority over the gates of Paradise, and, by extension, over all of creation, resides solely with God in the Islamic faith.\nSee also\n* Binding and loosing\n* Keys of Heaven\n* Matthew 16\n* Power of the Keys\n* Primacy of Peter\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
