The trail features signage at locations important to the Ahousat people; further information about each location of importance is shared in a guidebook published by Elder Stanley Sam.\nThe trail began as a First Nations women's ecotourism initiative to secure steady jobs and income for the people of the Ahousaht First Nation and was created by manual labour in 1993. The trail office was re-opened in 2010 as a non-profit operation dedicated to job creation within the Ahousat community, as well as ongoing stewardship by Ahousat of lands used by their people for thousands of years.\nReferences"
