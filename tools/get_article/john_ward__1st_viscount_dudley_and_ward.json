William Ward (d. 1714), second son of Humble Ward, 1st Baron Ward. His mother was Mary, daughter of the Hon. John Grey, younger son of Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford. He inherited the Willingsworth estate and the rest of the manor of Sedgley on the death of his father in 1720, and the entailed portion of the Dudley estates on the death of his cousin William Ward, 5th Baron Ward in 1740.\nHe was returned to Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1727, a seat he held until 1734. In 1740 he succeeded his second cousin as the sixth Baron Ward and entered the House of Lords. He was further honoured in 1763 when he was created 1st Viscount Dudley and Ward, of Dudley in the County of Worcester.\nMarriage and issue\nWard married firstly Anna Maria, daughter of Charles Bourchier, in 1723.
