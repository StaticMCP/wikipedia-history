It was led by N. Kornilov and A. Artemyev. The summer Soyuz station was established during this expedition.\nExtensive hydrological data of the lakes in Central Wohlthat Massif was conducted on this expedition. An  ice core, called the Komosmolskaia ice core, was extracted in 1983.\nAlthough the GDR could not build a research station as a result of not having signed the Antarctic Treaty, it operated a research station near the Soviet Novolazarevskaya station.\nIn 1983, six Germans joined the 28th Soviet Antarctic Expedition to research meteorology, physics of the upper atmosphere, geology and geophysics.\nReferences"
