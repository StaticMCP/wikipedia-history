The regulation of the law was given by Decree No. 132/993 of March 16, 1993, which approves the Regulation of the Medal.\nCharacteristics\nThe distinction consists of the medal and the diploma. The medal is characterized by having on its forehead the national coat of arms, made of 24-karat gold-plated metal with dimensions of 65 millimeters high by 60 millimeters wide. Its Sun is carved, the laurel and olive leaves accompany the oval of the coat of arms in half a carved point, and its center have a \"bulge\", with white and blue enameled colors with a glass finish. The reverse of it contains the text \"Oriental Republic of Uruguay\" in relief and with a diameter of 41 millimeters, and in the center the text \"Medal of the Republic\" in relief, straight in three lines.\nTo reward the medal there is a public act directed by the president of the republic, who rewards the medal along with a diploma signed by himself. If award is not possible because the beneficiary is abroad, it can be done by a person designated by the executive power.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Recipients\n!Rfs.\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |1993\n|-\n| – President Carlos Salinas de Gortari\n|\n|-\n| – President Rafael Ángel Calderón Fournier\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |1994\n|-\n| – President of the Regional Government of Galicia Manuel Fraga Iribarne\n|\n|-\n| – President Carlos Saúl Menem\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |1995\n|-\n| – President Lech Wałęsa\n|\n|-\n| – President Fernando Henrique Cardoso\n|\n|-\n| – President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro\n|\n|-\n| – Ambassador Alicia Martínez Ríos\n|\n|-\n| – Minister of Foreign Affairs Antonio Aranibar Quiroga\n|\n|-\n| – President Rafael Caldera\n|\n|-\n| – Minister of Foreign Affairs José Miguel Insulza Salinas\n|\n|-\n| – Minister of Foreign Affairs Luis María Ramírez Boettner\n|\n|-\n| – Secretary of Foreign Affairs José Ángel Gurría Treviño\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |1996\n|-\n| – President Algirdas Brazauskas\n|\n|-\n| – Ambassador Renato Prado Guimarães\n|\n|-\n| – Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization Jacques Diouf\n|\n|-\n| – President Ion Iliescu\n|\n|-\n| – President Juan Carlos Wasmosy\n|\n|-\n| – President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle\n|\n|-\n| – Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad\n|\n|-\n| – President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León\n|\n|-\n| – President Jacques Chirac\n|\n|-\n| – Vice President Marco Maciel\n|\n|-\n| – King Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan\n|\n|-\n| – King Juan Carlos I\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| – Queen Sofía\n|-\n| – President Václav Havel\n|\n|-\n| – Minister of Foreign Affairs Ricardo Alberto Arias\n|\n|-\n| – President Ernesto Pérez Balladares\n|\n|-\n| – Minister of Foreign Affairs Abel Matutes Juan\n|\n|-\n| – Ambassador Vaughan C.
