His father, Linus, was a farmer. In 1881, W. V. Howard married Mary (Eaton) Nutter, of Amesbury. They had no children. He had opened his office by 1882. In 1889, he took Fred T. Austin as partner in the firm of Howard & Austin.  Austin left in 1896 to work alone, before becoming the partner of Charles A. Brigham (Austin & Brigham) in Boston that same year.  In later life, Howard was appointed City Architect of Brockton. Howard died in 1927.\nHoward was fairly prolific in Plymouth County, and was competent in the major late-nineteenth century styles. Howard worked in Brockton during the 1880s and 90s, with its population more than quadrupling during his career. He and fellow Brockton architect Wesley Lyng Minor designed most of the city's major structures during that period.\nArchitectural works\nW. V. Howard, until 1889\n* 1882 - Aaron M.
