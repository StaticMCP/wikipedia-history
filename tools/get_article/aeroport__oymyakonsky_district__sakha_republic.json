It is located  from Ust-Nera, the administrative center of the district and  from Tomtor. Its population as of the 2002 Census was 61.\nThe Oymyakon Airport, that gives the village its name, was built during the Second World War as part of the ALSIB route for transferring Lend-Lease aircraft from the United States to the Soviet Union. It has an unpaved runway of 1900 metres length. In 1961, a cargo flight from Yakutsk to Oymyakon crashed en route, with no survivors. In the 1990s, Oymyakon had scheduled flights operated by Sakha Avia but these no longer operate. The disused terminal building was still standing as of 2018, however.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*Official website of the Sakha Republic.
