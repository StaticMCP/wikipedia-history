Thanks to Thor's party that the other aliens attended, Earth has improved its technology and now has space-traveling resources.\nHoward and Darcy join the Grandmaster on his intergalactic cruise, but he takes the egg and attempts to cook it for a breakfast before Yondu Udonta steals it. As the couple gives chase, Nick Fury and Phil Coulson explain that because their child was born during a rare alignment of the Nine Realms called the Convergence, it is destined for great things and has become highly sought after by several factions.\nOn Knowhere, Yondu delivers the egg to Kaecilius who kills Yondu and attempts to use the egg as a host body for Dormammu. S.H.I.E.L.D. attacks, intending to acquire the egg, though the couple recovers it.\nHoward and Darcy seek shelter from Loki on Jotunheim as he is working to promote his ski resort to his father Laufey. However, Laufey and his fellow Frost Giants, Malekith, Zeus, and Thanos and his Black Order are also after the egg, and a chase ensues. Loki persuades his father to withdraw from the pursuing. As the couple is cornered, the egg suddenly glows gold, rises into the sky and subdues the pursuers with golden energy while Zeus escapes claiming that he has an orgy to attend.\nThe egg hatches into a human/duck hybrid which Howard and Darcy name Byrdie. While Laufey accepts Loki's ski result proposal, Fury admits that the child should stay with her parents and they return home peacefully.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nTBD\nCasting\nJeffrey Wright narrates the episode as the Watcher, with Marvel planning to have other characters in the series voiced by the actors who portrayed them in the MCU films.
