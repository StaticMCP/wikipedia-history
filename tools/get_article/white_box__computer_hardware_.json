In this sense, building a white box system is part of the DIY movement.\nThe term is also applied to high volume production of unbranded PCs that began in the mid-1980s with 8&nbsp;MHz Turbo XT systems selling for just under $1000.\nIn 2002, around 30% of personal computers sold annually were white box systems.\nOperating systems\nA typical \"white box\" ATX mid-tower case as used by a systems builder\nWhile PCs built by system manufacturers generally come with a pre-installed operating system, white boxes from both large and small system vendors and other VAR channels can be ordered with or without a pre-installed OS. Usually when ordered with an operating system, the system builder uses an OEM copy of the OS.\nWhitebook or Intel \"Common Building Blocks\"\nIntel defined form factor and interconnection standards for notebook computer components, including \"Barebones\" (chassis and motherboard), hard disk drive, optical disk drive, LCD, battery pack, keyboard, and AC/DC adapter. These building blocks are primarily marketed to computer building companies, rather than DIY users.\nCosts\nWhile saving money is a common motivation for building one's own PC, for example in the US it is generally more expensive to build a low-end PC than to buy a pre-built one from a well-known manufacturer.\nSee also\n*Beige box\n*Enthusiast computing\n*Homebuilt computer\n*White-label product\nReferences"
