The remote peak is  east-southeast of The Tusk and  north of Juneau on the western margin of the Juneau Icefield. Precipitation runoff and glacial meltwater from the mountain's north slope drains to Berners Bay and Lynn Canal via the Gilkey River, whereas the south slope is surrounded by the Taku Glacier. Topographic relief is significant as the north face rises 4,500&nbsp;feet (1,370&nbsp;m) in . The mountain's descriptive name was applied by members of the Juneau Icefield Research Project in 1964 and the toponym was officially adopted in 1965 by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Glacier King is located in a tundra climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Coast Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Winter temperatures can drop to 0&nbsp;°F with wind chill factors below −10&nbsp;°F. This climate supports the Taku Glacier south of the peak, the Juneau Icefield east of the peak, and unnamed glaciers on the north slope.\nGallery\nFile:Gilkey Glacier, valley glacier, hanging glaciers on the mountain side, trim line, and glacial remnents, 1955 (GLACIERS 6190).jpg|Glacier King to right and The Tusk at upper right edge of frame.
