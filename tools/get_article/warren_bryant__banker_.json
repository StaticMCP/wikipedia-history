He was a son of Warren Bryant and Esther ( Wright) Bryant.\nCareer\nIn 1827, he first visited Buffalo on his way to see Niagara Falls, returning to Buffalo to reside permanently in 1832. He went into business as an importer of toys and fancy goods and was joined by his brother George H. Bryant in a store on Main Street near Exchange Street (which he bought in 1847).

Thayer, Benjamin Caryl, Judge Charles Townsend (who served as the first president), Francis C. Brunck, and Ernest G. Gray. He began serving as president around 1864, and served until his death in 1893. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving original trustee of the Bank.\nIn 1858, President James Buchanan appointed Bryant to succeed John T. Hudson as the Collector of the Port of Buffalo. He served until 1861 when he was replaced by Christian Metz Jr. (who was appointed by Abraham Lincoln).\nPersonal life\nIn 1840, Bryant was married to Amelia E. Stebbins (1819–1890) of Oneida County, New York. Together they, were the parents of ten children, including:\n* Joseph S. Bryant (1854–1924), a banker with Columbia National Bank (which was absorbed by the Marine Trust Company); he married Alice Taft of Whitinsville, Massachusetts.\n* Mary Steele Bryant (1855–1907), who collected a china and curio cabinet which was donated by her brother Joseph's widow to the Buffalo Historical Society.\nHis wife died in North Conway, New Hampshire while visiting there in September 1890. Bryant died at his home, 161 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, on August 5, 1893. After a funeral at his home led by the Rev. E. E. Chivers of the Prospect Avenue Baptist Church, he was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo. He left an estate worth $80,000 ().
