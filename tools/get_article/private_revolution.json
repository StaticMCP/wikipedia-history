At this point, singer-songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Karl Wallinger was the only member of World Party, and the only person pictured on the cover.\nWallinger is assisted on this album by several session musicians, including Anthony Thistlethwaite, Steve Wickham and Sinéad O'Connor. Several other musicians listed in the credits are actually whimsically named pseudonyms for Wallinger himself.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Karl Wallinger except \"Dance of the Hoppy Lads\", written by Wallinger with Stephen Wickham, and \"All I Really Want to Do\", written by Bob Dylan.\n# \"Private Revolution\" – 4:01\n# \"Making Love (To the World)\" – 2:30\n# \"Ship of Fools\" – 4:27\n# \"All Come True\" – 5:52\n# \"Dance of the Hoppy Lads\" – 0:44\n# \"It Can Be Beautiful (Sometimes)\" – 3:00\n# \"The Ballad of the Little Man\" – 5:02\n# \"Hawaiian Island World\" – 4:20\n# \"All I Really Want to Do\" – 4:43\n# \"World Party\" – 4:36\n# \"It's All Mine\" – 5:33\nPersonnel\n;World Party\n*Karl Wallinger — vocals, guitars, bass, sampling keyboards, drum programming\nwith:\n*Rufus Dove — guitars (probably a pseudonym for Wallinger - pun on \"rufous dove\")\n*Will Towyn — sampling keyboards (probably a pseudonym for Wallinger - pun on \"will to win\")\n*Delahaye — drums, percussion (possibly a pseudonym for Wallinger, or for Mike Scott - this is an alias also used on several Waterboys albums)\n*Millennium Mills — piano (probably a pseudonym for Wallinger - name taken from Millennium Mills building in London Docklands)\n*Ahmed Gottlieb — sitar and tabla (probably a pseudonym for Wallinger)\n;Additional personnel\n*Sinéad O'Connor — backing vocals on \"Hawaiian Island World\"\n*Steve Wickham — violin on \"All Come True\" and \"Dance of the Hoppy Lads\"\n*Martin Finnucane — harp on \"Dance of the Hoppy Lads\" ''(probably a pseudonym for Wallinger - this is the name of a character in the Flann O'Brien novel The Third Policeman)''\n*Anthony Thistlethwaite — saxophone on \"Ship of Fools\"\n*Rear cover monoprint – Edward Durdey\n*Cover photographs – Steve Wallace assisted by Mathew Stevens\n*Design – Stephanie Nash and Josh Riley\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1986–1987)\n!Position\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|13\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Canadian Albums Chart\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|US (Billboard 200)\n|align=\"center\"|27\n|}\nReferences"
