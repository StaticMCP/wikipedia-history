The project by Duszeńko and Kitowski was selected from 63 proposed projects.\nThe construction of the monument was initiated by the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites (Rada Ochrony Pamięci Walk i Męczeństwa) and consists of 236 granite blocks transported from the quarries in Strzegom and Borów and weighing 1,150 tons. The monument is decorated with bas-reliefs and inscriptions, which pay tribute to the defence of the Polish sea coast, the naval battles of WWII in which Polish sailors and soldiers took part as well as the Battle of Lenino, Battle of Studzianki and Battle of Kołobrzeg. The memorial also includes the inscription \"Glory to the Liberators\" (Chwała wyzwolicielom).\nThe shape of the monument resembles in its appearance a jagged bayonet impaled in the ground. Seven candle lights at the foot of the monument symbolically represent the seven days of heroic defence of Westerplatte by Polish soldiers against the numerically superior Nazi German army.\nThe 22-meter high artificial mound on which the monument is located was erected from the earth collected from the redevelopment of the Port of Gdańsk. The construction of the monument took 2 years to complete and it was ceremonially unveiled on 9 October 1966 on the anniversary of the Battle of Lenino.\nEach year, official state ceremonies to commemorate the outbreak of the Second World War take place at the foot of the monument and have been attended by prominent Polish and foreign dignitaries and heads of states.\nSee also\n*Museum of the Second World War\n*September Campaign\n*Battle of Wizna\n*Bombing of Wieluń\n*History of Poland (1939–1945)\nGallery\nFile:Westerplatte 2846.JPG|Westerplatte Monument\nFile:79th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II (3).jpg|79th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II in Gdańsk\nFile:Pomnik Obrońców Wybrzeża na półwyspie Westerplatte 1.jpg|Westerplatte Monument seen from a distance\nFile:Pomnik Obrońców Wybrzeża na Westerplatte.jpg|Inscriptions on the monument\nFILE:00565 Westerplatte Monument von SE.jpg|Seen from SE\nFile:0577 Westerplatte monument NE.jpg|Seen from NE\nFile:0578 Westerplatte monument NW.jpg|Seen from NW\nFile:0579 Westerplatte monument SW.jpg|Seen from SW\nFile:06561 Westerplatte pillars monument.jpg|Pillars and monument\nReferences"
