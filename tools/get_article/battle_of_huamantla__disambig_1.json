Upon learning of Santa Anna's at Huamantla, Lane left his supply train under guard and marched toward that city, with Captain Samuel H. Walker's four cavalry companies leading the advance.\nBattle\nWalker charged, upon seeing Santa Anna's lancers, driving the Mexicans from the town. Santa Anna led a counterattack, Walker was shot by a civilian in a nearby house, and his men retreated into a church. The Mexicans then retreated to Querétaro.\nLane allowed his troops to engage in a drunken sack of the town.  They reached Puebla on 12 October, lifting the siege.\nOrder of battle\nUnited States\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=25% | Brigade\n!
