It was unveiled on 4 November 2018 as part of the centenary of the end of the war.  The bronze sculpture is a 10 ft (3 metres) high depiction of a Sikh soldier of the First World War on a 5 ft granite plinth; it was created by Luke Perry.\nThe Sikh Soldiers\nThe Sikh soldiers contributed the most volunteers of any of the British holdings that had fought in that war. In 1919, India solely produced around 1 to 1.5 million troops for combat.  Among these troops, the Sikhs rallied in large numbers for the King, Empire, and the defence of Europe.\nChattri\nThe Chattri is a war memorial similar to the Lions of the Great War on a hill above the city of Brighton and Hove, England. The Chattri was built on the site where Indian soldiers were cremated. The structure is classified as Grade II listed status, reflecting its significance.\nReferences"
