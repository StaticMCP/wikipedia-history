The office was instituted in 2003 during the course of the Second Chechen War, when the Russian federal government regained control over the region and after a constitutional referendum approved the current Constitution of the Chechen Republic.\nEligibility\nAccording to the article 66 of the Constitution of the Chechen Republic, a citizen of Russia, no younger than thirty years old, may be elected Head. The term is for five years, with no limits on serving multiple terms (prior to the 2007 constitutional referendum the Head was elected for four years, with a two term limit). The Head is not allowed to be at the same time a deputy of the Parliament of the Chechen Republic, or deputy of a representative body of local self-government.\nPresidents and heads of the Chechen Republic\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2| Party\n! rowspan=2| Election\n|-\n!
