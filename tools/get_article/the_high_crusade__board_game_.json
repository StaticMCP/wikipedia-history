Swan commented that \"With the demise of Ares, it'd be a shame if a great game like The High Crusade got lost in the shuffle.  There are apparently no plans to reissue Ares games in boxed versions, so you'll have to round up a copy of issue 16 to get the game.  It's worth the effort.  The High Crusade is an absolute treat.\"\nReferences"
