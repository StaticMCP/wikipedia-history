The mountainous region, with its mixed Macedonian and Albanian population, emerged as a centre of resistance. Communist partisans organised under the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia (NOVM) and the Albanian National Liberation Army.\nThe Armistice of Cassibile, signed on 8 September 1943, precipitated the collapse of Italian military authority across the Balkans, creating a power vacuum that partisan forces moved swiftly to exploit.\nCourse of events\nDisarmament of the Italian garrison (9 September 1943)\nOn the night of 8–9 September, a joint force of Macedonian partisans led by Mirče Acev and Albanian communists under Fadil Hoxha and Hysni Kapo entered Kičevo. Through negotiation, they persuaded the commander of the Italian Ferrara Division to surrender without resistance. The partisans seized:\n* 1,200 rifles\n* 12 machine guns\n* Several artillery pieces\n* Substantial ammunition and supply stocks\nOnly three partisans were killed in minor skirmishes with disoriented Italian sentries.\nGerman and Balli Kombëtar reoccupation\nBy late September, Nazi Germany dispatched reinforcements to reassert control over western Macedonia. Facing troop shortages, the Germans armed and deputised Balli Kombëtar units as auxiliary police in Albanian-inhabited districts. Xhemë Gostivari (Hasa), a senior Balli commander, was appointed to oversee security in Kičevo.\nBalli Kombëtar, ideologically anti-communist and opposed to Yugoslav territorial ambitions, cooperated with the Germans to suppress partisan activity and secure supply routes to Thessaloniki.\nNovember guerrilla actions\nIn early November, the newly formed **\"Mirče Acev\" Battalion** and supporting Albanian partisan detachments launched a series of ambushes on German convoys and Balli outposts. The partisans inflicted approximately 30 casualties on Axis forces but suffered heavier losses (~60–80 killed or wounded) due to German artillery and air support.\nAftermath\nGerman and Balli control of Kičevo endured until **15 November 1944**, when the town was permanently liberated during the Kosovo Operation (1944).\nThe events exacerbated the rift between communist partisans and Albanian nationalist factions.\n}}\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n:Category:Conflicts in 1943\n:Category:1943 in Yugoslavia\n:Category:Yugoslav Partisans\n:Category:Military history of North Macedonia\nReferences\n}}"
