It was the tenth Presidents Cup competition and the sixth played in the United States.\nThe selection of Muirfield as the 2013 tournament site was taken as a tribute to golfing great Jack Nicklaus, who designed the course.  Nicklaus has said that his involvement as tournament host for the 2013 Presidents Cup \"probably will be my last involvement in anything significant in the game of golf\".  Muirfield was the third U.S. course to host the tournament, and the first course in the world to host Presidents Cup, Ryder Cup, and Solheim Cup international team competitions.\nIn May 2012, Fred Couples and Nick Price were named captains of the U.S. and International teams, respectively.\nThe United States won for the fifth successive time with an 18–15 victory over the International team.\nFormat\nThe first day consists of six matches of fourball. The second day consists of six matches of foursomes. The third day consists of five matches of fourball in the morning and five matches of foursomes in the afternoon. On the fourth and final day, twelve singles matches were played. 34 matches were played in all. All fourball and foursomes matches that are all-square after 18 holes will score  point for each team. All singles matches that are all-square after 18 holes will continue until a winner is determined. The fourball matches being played first is a change from the previous seven Cups.\nTeam qualification and selection\nBoth teams had 12 players.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Key\n|- style=\"background:#d0f0c0;\"\n| Top ten on points list\n|-style=\"background:#ffa;\"\n| Two captain's picks\n|-\n| Not picked, in top 15 of points list\n|}\nUnited States team\nThe United States team featured the top 10 in earnings from September 19, 2011 through September 2, 2013 (the Deutsche Bank Championship), with 2013 earnings weighted double, and two captain's picks.
