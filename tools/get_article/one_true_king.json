In their first video, founding member Asmongold stated, \"We came up with this idea of making an org, and building the org around our friends – building the org around friendship in general.\" The organization has been described by its members as being more of a media production company and lifestyle brand as opposed to being confined to any one game or section on Twitch. The organization has also gained notability for not receiving major backing from corporations as opposed to traditional esports teams.\n, Nmplol (seated), Asmongold, Esfand, and Tips Out.]]\nAlongside the group's initial announcement, the organization unveiled its professional World of Warcraft roster.
