Together with his wife Eve and Christabel Briggs, Pilkington enjoyed over half a century of trade with the Piccadilly, avoiding the prevailing commercialism and the fashion for abstract art. He championed the works of neglected figurative artists, Art Nouveau and 19th- and 20th-century Symbolism.\nIn December 2006 the Rainford Gallery in St Helens, Merseyside was renamed the Godfrey Pilkington art gallery after the gallerist.\nPilkington and his wife closed the Piccadilly Gallery on Dover Street on 31 May 2007.\nReferences"
