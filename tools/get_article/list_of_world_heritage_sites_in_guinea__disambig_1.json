Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. The Republic of Guinea ratified the convention on March 18, 1979. It has one World Heritage Site and a further eight on the tentative list. Guinea has served on the World Heritage Committee once, from 1980 to 1987.\n, Guinea has only one World Heritage Site, Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve. It is shared with the neighbouring country of Ivory Coast. The site has been endangered since 1992.\nWorld Heritage Site\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.

Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Guinea has listed nine properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The vernacular architecture and mandinga cultural landscape of Gberedou/Hamana\n|\n|Kankan Region\n|2001\n|ii, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Mount Nimba Cultural Landscape\n|\n|Nzérékoré Region\n|2001\n|ii, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Slave route in Africa, segment of Timbo, Pongo River\n|\n|Mamou Region\n|2001\n|iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|The coronation hut of the Almamy of Fouta Djallon\n|\n|Mamou Region\n|2025\n|iii, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Badiar National Park (PNB)\n|\n|Boké Region\n|2025\n|x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Niani, medieval city, ancient capital of the Mali Empire\n|\n|Kankan Region\n|2025\n|iii, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Cultural Landscape of Bassari\n|\n|Boké Region\n|2025\n|iii, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Fouta Djallon Massif\n|\n|Boké Region, Labé Region, Mamou Region\n|2025\n|vi, vii, x (mixed)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
