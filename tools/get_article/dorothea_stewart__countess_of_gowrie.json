The dates of the birth and death of Dorothea Stewart are unknown.\n]]\n, exterior of the Gowrie lodging]]\nEarly life\nShe was the oldest daughter of Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven and Janet Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl and Janet Campbell. Her siblings were Henry Stewart, 2nd Lord Methven, Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree, and Joan Stewart, Countess of Argyll.\n19th-century writers examined the possibility that Dorothea Stewart was the daughter of Margaret Tudor, or her granddaughter and daughter of a Master of Methven, said to have been killed at the battle of Pinkie in 1547.\nMarried life\nDorothea Stewart married William, Master of Ruthven on 17 August 1561 at Perth. The parish register suggests it was a double wedding, her half-sister, Elizabeth Kennedy (died 1572), the daughter of Janet Stewart and Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains, married Patrick Vans on the same day. Later, the Mistress of Ochiltree referred to Patrick Vaus of Barnbarroch in her letters as her \"brother\". He was the spouse of her half-sister.\nWilliam Ruthven became Lord Ruthven and was later made Earl of Gowrie. Their main home was Huntingtower Castle near Perth, then known as Ruthven Castle. The name Ruthven was pronounced \"Ryven\".\nIn October 1570 for her \"terce\" or jointure lands, Ruthven gave her Dirleton Castle and a third of the lands of Dirleton and Hassington, Haliburton, Ballernoch, Newton, and Cousland.\nHer husband was executed for treason in May 1584 at Stirling.\nShe was commanded to surrender Dirleton, Ruthven, Cousland, and the Gowrie lodging in Perth to the crown in May 1584.\nDorothea Stewart came to the opening of Parliament on 22 August 1584 and knelt down on the High Street crying to the king for grace for her children. James Stewart, Earl of Arran pushed her away, and she fainted and was left on the street.\nLater life\nDirleton Castle and other properties were restored to Lady Gowrie and her family. A disgraced courtier, William Keith of Delny stayed at her house adjacent to Holyrood Palace in July 1590. There were plans in 1591 for Dorothea Stewart to marry William Keith of Delny but James VI forbade it. In July 1593 the house attracted suspicion when it was used to access the palace during the Earl of Bothwell's second Raid of Holyrood.\nDorothea Stewart and her second husband Andrew Kerr of Faldonsyde complained in 1597 about a group of local men who stole rabbits from the links of Dirleton and terrorised her tenants.\nAfter the slaughter of her family at Perth on 5 August 1600, the Master of Orkney and Sir James Sandilands rode to Dirleton to arrest her two surviving sons, Patrick and William. They told Lady Gowrie her sons would be kept by Chancellor, the Earl of Montrose, a proposition which caused her great and visible distress, even though Montrose was the father-in-law of her daughter Margaret. The two young men were riding to safety in England.\nShe was still living at Dirleton in November 1600. She hoped that the king could be persuaded to support her daughters, \"quhais estait is verie desolait\" and she was not able to help them herself. A part of the ruined castle is known as the Gowrie lodging.\nFamily\n, Museo del Prado]]\nDorothea Stewart's children included:\n* James Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie (died 1588)\n* John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie (died 1600)\n* Alexander Ruthven (died 1600)\n* William Ruthven\n* Patrick Ruthven, who was imprisoned in the Tower of London.
