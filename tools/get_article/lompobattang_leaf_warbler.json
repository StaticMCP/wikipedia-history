The Sulawesi leaf warbler (P. nesophilus) was formerly considered conspecific with the Lompobattang leaf warbler and both were grouped under the name P. sarasinorum, but more recent analyses indicate that it is a distinct species.\nAppearance\nP. sarasinorum has a dark brown crown, and a broad, pale yellowish crown-stripe. Its upperparts are olive brown, and its underparts are whitish yellow. P. sarasinorum also has a wingbar made up of pale tips. Unlike P. sarasinorum, P. nesophilus lacks a crown-stripe, wingbar, and white in the outertail.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Lompobattang Leaf Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Lompobattang_leaf_warbler\n}}"
