It was built in 1907 for the display of horticulture during the annual Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and it is a listed heritage building.\nAlong with four other buildings at Exhibition Place designed by the same architect, George W. Gouinlock, it is a National Historic Site of Canada. In 2004, the building was leased to a private company for 20 years to use as a nightclub and for special events.\nDescription\nThe Horticulture Building was constructed in 1907 and was designed by local architect G. W. Gouinlock in the Beaux-Arts style. It is a one-storey building, in the layout of an \"E\", with a large glass dome at the intersection of the wings. The glass dome is the site of the main entrance facing south. The wings extend to the east and west to the north.\nHistory\nThe site was previously the location of Toronto's Crystal Palace building, an exhibition hall fashioned after the design of the Crystal Palace in London, England. Toronto's Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire on October 18, 1906, spread by sparks from a fire in the grandstand building. The following year, the Horticulture Building was constructed.\nBetween 1942 and 1946, when the CNE grounds were in use by the Canadian armed forces, the Horticulture Building became the Quartermaster Stores. In September 1949, when the S.S. Noronic passenger liner was destroyed by fire in Toronto Harbour, the Horticulture Building was turned into an emergency morgue. It temporarily housed as many as 104 casualties.\nIn 1958, the building was used in the design competition for Toronto's City Hall. All of the models for the new city hall and square were put on display for public inspection.\nIn 2004, Muzik Clubs Inc. won a competitive process to occupy the building and grounds from 2004 until 2024. It operated the upscale Muzik nightclub on Saturday nights and used the building for other private events. In 2013 the club proposed building swimming pools on the site in exchange for an extension of the lease until 2034. That proposal was turned down. Muzik Clubs Inc. is now known as Toronto Event Centre, and its focus is more on corporate events.\nGallery\nFile:Horticulture Building North View 1912.jpg |View of the building in 1912\nFile:Horticulture Building South View 1912.jpg |Main entrance in 1912\nFile:Horticultural Palace CNE 1927.jpg |The building in 1927\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.torontoeventcentre.com/ Toronto Event Centre website]"
