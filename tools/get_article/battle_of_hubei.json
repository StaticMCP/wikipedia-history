It was, for all intents and purposes, the last desperate attempt in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's war effort to win the war against the Qing dynasty, as more than 200,000 troops were taken prisoner, but a remainder of 19,000 Taiping troops led by Lai Wenguang broke out and marched into southern Henan and combined with 150,000 troops from the Nian Rebellion.\nReferences"
