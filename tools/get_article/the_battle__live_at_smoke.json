JazzTimes said \"For listeners familiar with classic recorded saxophone battles of the past-Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt, Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray, “Lockjaw” Davis and Johnny Griffin-this one is of equal stature, with more modern harmonies on display\". On All About Jazz Alain Londes noted \"Eric Alexander is one of the most hardworking and serious young tenor saxophone players out there ... This recording, taped live at Smoke in New York, finds him joined by the equally talented Vincent Herring on alto sax ... Since Alexander and Herring play different instruments, the final exchanges between the two demonstrate their ability to feed off, rather than upstage each other. In that sense these two musicians are not engaged in an actual battle, but rather a motivational exercise that puts them both at the top of their game\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Blues Up and Down\" (Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt) – 12:49\n# \"Road Song\" (Wes Montgomery) – 10:48\n# \"Firm Roots\" (Cedar Walton) – 9:37\n# \"Ritual Dance\" (Carl Allen) – 8:08\n# \"Shirley's Song\" (Mike LeDonne) – 11:07\n# \"Eleven Years\" (Mike LeDonne) – 8:01\nPersonnel\n*Vincent Herring – alto saxophone\n*Eric Alexander – tenor saxophone\n*Mike LeDonne – piano\n*John Webber – bass\n*Carl Allen – drums\nReferences"
