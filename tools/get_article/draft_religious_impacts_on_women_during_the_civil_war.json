According to Women During the Civil War: An Encyclopedia by Judith E. Harper, religion shaped women’s daily lives through prayer, scripture, and church attendance, helping them find comfort when husbands and sons went to war. Churches organized sewing circles, aid societies, and hospital support groups where women could turn their grief into action by helping soldiers. This faith gave meaning to sacrifice and offered the hope of heaven when loved ones died. Christian messages about duty and endurance also gave women motivation and social approval to take on new responsibilities at home, in hospitals, and in their communities.\nScholars like Scott Stephan and Drew Gilpin Faust show that women’s faith was not only personal but also shaped how they understood their roles in a changing South. Stephan’s Redeeming the Southern Family explains that before the war, evangelical women built a culture of “domestic devotion,” finding power through prayer and family leadership, which prepared them for the hardships of war. Faust’s article “Altars of Sacrifice” adds that women’s religious belief in sacrifice pushed them to support the Confederate cause while also hiding their private pain and doubts. Primary sources such as Brokenburn: The Journal of Kate Stone reveal this struggle firsthand—Stone often turned to faith to make sense of the chaos around her, even as her world of privilege collapsed. Together, these sources show that Christianity helped Southern women transform suffering into service and gave them emotional hope during one of the most difficult times in American history.\nReferences\nFaust, Drew Gilpin. “Altars of Sacrifice: Confederate Women and the Narratives of War.” The Journal of American History 76, no. 4 (1990): 1200–1228.\nHarper, Judith E.
