The decree establishing the symbols was adopted on 1 October 1990 and published on 15 November 1990.\nDesign\nThe coat of arms of the German-speaking Community of Belgium is blazoned as In Silber ein roter Löwe begleitet von neun blauen Fünfblättern, von einer Königskrone überhöht, which is to say Argent, a lion Gules surrounded by nine cinquefoils Azure, surmounted by a royal crown.\nThe red lion alludes to the coat of arms of the Duchy of Luxemburg and the historical Duchy of Limburg, and symbolizes the historical affiliation of the German-speaking community to those states. The nine gentiana flowers represent the nine municipalities of the German-speaking community. Gentiana flowers grow in High Fens, an upland area and a nature reserve in the region. The crown further shows the allegiance of the German-speaking community of Belgium to the Kingdom of Belgium itself.\nSee also\n* Flag of the German-speaking Community of Belgium\n* National symbols of Belgium\n* Belgian heraldry\n* German heraldry\nReferences"
