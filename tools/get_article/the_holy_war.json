Regarded as one of the early modern English novel written in the form of an allegory, it tells the story of the residents in a town called \"Mansoul\" (Man's soul). Though the town along with its citizens is deemed perfect under the rule of Shaddai (Almighty), its citizens had been persuaded by Diabolus to rebel and throw off his reign, effectively crowning Diabolus as its ruler. During Diabolus' reign on Mansoul, Shaddai, seeking to restore his kingship, sends his son Emmanuel to reclaim it.\nPremise\nChristian Focus  9781845503949 |url=https://www.rainbowresource.com/product/021919/Holy-War.html? |access-date=2022-06-08 |website=www.rainbowresource.com}}\n| align = right\n| width = 30%\n}}\nThe city named as Mansoul has been regarded as perfect under the rule of Shaddai for a long time. One day, three esteemed men, Lord Willbewill, Understanding, and Conscience, welcome Diabolus into the city.

Only two editions were published during Bunyan's lifetime, indicating that the work was much less popular than his earlier ''Pilgrim's Progress, which had run to eight editions in its first four years. Interest in The Holy War revived during the 18th century, although the text suffered at the hands of its editors, who were inclined to bring its ideas into a line with the prevailing theological climate. In 1854, Thomas Babington Macaulay asserted that The Holy War was \"the second-greatest allegory ever written, surpassed only by The Pilgrim's Progress''.\" Other 19th- and 20th-century critics have been more dismissive, and in modern times the novel is little studied in comparison with Bunyan's other works.\nSee also\n* Spiritual warfare\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Online text of The Holy War:\n**[http://acacia.pair.com/Acacia.John.Bunyan/Sermons.Allegories/The.Holy.War/To.the.Reader.html To the Reader]\n**[http://acacia.pair.com/Acacia.John.Bunyan/Sermons.Allegories/The.Holy.War/Advertisement.html An Advertisement to the Reader]\n**[http://acacia.pair.com/Acacia.John.Bunyan/Sermons.Allegories/The.Holy.War/Relation.of.Holy.War.html The Holy War (part 1)]\n**[http://acacia.pair.com/Acacia.John.Bunyan/Sermons.Allegories/The.Holy.War/Relation.of.Holy.War.2.html  (part 2)]\n*"
