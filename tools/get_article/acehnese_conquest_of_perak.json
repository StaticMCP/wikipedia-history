Now Iskandar Muda successfully controlled the trade of tin.\nAfter the invasion, the Acehnese detached 20 ships that sailed to the vicinity of Portuguese Malacca but were detected by the Portuguese and so they sailed away. The presence of 4 large warships in Malacca demonstrated that the Portuguese were ready to defend their interests in the region against Aceh, Iskander Muda asked the Dutch for assistance against those ships in return for extension of the Contract in Tiku.\nHaving gotten information of Aceh activity in Perak, the captain of Malacca dispatched 9 oar vessels under the command of Fernão da Costa to the vicinity of Perak, so as to scout the Acehnese armada and escort a number of Portuguese merchant ships that were expected to arrive. Fernão da Costa attacked a number of Acehnese ships within the river, and then withdrew.\nThe attack on Perak had worried the Portuguese, according to a Dutch merchant, Adriaen van der Dussen reported on 27 December that Malacca was busy fortifying its base, The Portuguese asked the Johorese sultan Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah to sell them 10 pieces of artillery but Abdullah told them that his artillery was not for sale, even if they paid in gold.\nAceh control of Perak was short. After the disastrous Battle of Duyon River, in which the Portuguese completely wiped out a large Acehnese armada, Perak defected to the side of Portugal.\nSee also\n* Siege of Malacca (1568)\n* Aceh expedition (1606)\n* Acehnese invasion of Johor\n* Acehnese invasion of Kedah\nReferences"
