It took place on 30 May 1863 near the village of Chruślina, which at that time belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Insurgent forces, commanded by Marcin Borelowski and Zygmunt Koskowski (180 men altogether) fought off a Russian detachment. The Poles lost 22 men; Russian losses were higher, but due to Russian numerical superiority, the insurgents had to withdraw towards Garwolin.\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.
