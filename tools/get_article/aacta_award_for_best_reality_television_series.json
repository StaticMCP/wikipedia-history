The award was first introduced in 2012, for the 2nd AACTA Awards in 2013, due to the growth of reality television productions in Australia. Reality television productions could previously be submitted in the Best Light Entertainment Series category.\nTo be eligible, the production being submitted must: be significantly non-scripted; \"involve participants being placed in an environment or format in which the premise, circumstances or situations they encounter are manipulated for the purposes of creating the program\"; be no less than four episodes of at least half an hour in length; not be a news, current affairs, light entertainment or documentary series; and not be a production that requires a producer to set up a situation \"that is then observed with minimal further intervention by the producers\". The winner of the award is the producer of the program.\nMasterchef Australia has received six wins from ten nominations, more than any other program. Programs from the Network 10 have received the most nominations with 18. Network 10 have received the most overall wins, with eight.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"19%\" | Program\n! width=\"19%\" | Network\n! width=\"19%\" | Recipient\n|-\n| rowspan=5 align=\"center\" | 2012(2nd)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| The Amazing Race Australia\n| Seven Network\n| David Gardner and Matthew Kowald\n|-\n| Masterchef Australia (series 4)\n| Network Ten\n| Tim Toni\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 3)\n| Seven Network\n| Matt Apps, Greg Swanborough and Evan Wilkes\n|-\n| The Voice\n| Nine Network\n| Julie Ward\n|-\n| rowspan=5 align=\"center\" | 2013(3rd)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| MasterChef Australia: The Professionals\n| Network Ten\n| Margaret Bashfield, David McDonald, Mark Barlin, and Tim Toni\n|-\n| ''Australia's Got Talent (series 7)\n| Nine Network\n| Greg Beness and Steve Kelly\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 4)\n| Seven Network\n| Rikkie Proost, Matt Apps, Evan Wilkes and Greg Swanborough\n|-\n| The X Factor (series 4)\n| Seven Network\n| Jonathon Summerhayes\n|-\n| rowspan=5 align=\"center\" | 2014(4th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| The Voice\n| Nine Network\n| Julie Ward\n|-\n| MasterChef Australia (series 6)\n| Network Ten\n| Margaret Bashfield, Dave Forrester, David McDonald, and Keely Sonntag\n|-\n| The Voice Kids\n| Nine Network\n| Julie Ward\n|-\n| The X Factor\n| Seven Network\n| Jonathon Summerhayes\n|-\n| rowspan=6 align=\"center\" | 2015(5th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| MasterChef Australia (series 7)\n| Network Ten\n| Margaret Bashfield, Marty Benson, Tim Toni and Rob Wallace\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 6)\n| Seven Network\n| Rikkie Proost, Evan Wilkes and Matt Apps\n|-\n| The Real Housewives of Melbourne (season 2)\n| Arena\n| Kylie Washington, Lisa Potasz and Virginia Hodgson\n|-\n| The Voice\n| Nine Network\n| Richard Rietveld\n|-\n| The X Factor\n| Seven Network\n| Digby Mitchell\n|-\n| rowspan=5 align=\"center\" | 2016(6th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| MasterChef Australia (series 8)\n| Network Ten\n| Marty Benson, Tim Toni and Rob Wallace\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 7)\n| Seven Network\n| Matt Apps, Joe Herdman and Rikkie Proost\n|-\n| First Dates\n| Seven Network\n| Geraldine Orrock, Bikkie Proost and Brad Gustafson\n|-\n| The Recruit\n| Fox8\n| Luke Tuncliffe and Lara Hopkins\n|-\n| rowspan=5 align=\"center\" | 2017(7th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| MasterChef Australia (series 9)\n| Network Ten\n| Marty Benson, Adam Fergusson and Tim Toni\n|-\n| Australian Survivor (season 4)\n| Network Ten\n| Peter Newman, Amelia Fisk, Tim Toni, Mark Barlin\n|-\n| Little Big Shots\n| Seven Network\n| Shaun Murphy, Sophia Mogford, Nick Davies\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 8)\n| Seven Network\n| Joe Herdman, Matt Apps\n|-\n| rowspan=6 align=\"center\" | 2018(8th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Australian Survivor (Champions vs. Contenders)\n| Network Ten\n| Amelia Fisk, Georgina Hinds and Adam Fergusson\n|-\n| Masterchef Australia (series 10)\n| Network Ten\n| Marty Benson, Tim Toni, Adam Fergusson\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 9)\n| Seven Network\n| Matt Apps, Joe Herdman\n|-\n| The Real Housewives of Melbourne (season 4)\n| Arena\n| Kylie Washington, Lisa Potasz, Natalie Brosnan, Pip Rubira\n|-\n| The Single Wives\n| Seven Network\n| Paul Franklin, Chris Culvenor\n|-\n| rowspan=6 align=\"center\" | 2019(9th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Australian Survivor (Champions vs. Contenders II)\n| Network 10\n| Amelia Fisk and Adam Fergusson\n|-\n| The Block (season 15)\n| Nine Network\n| Julian Cress, David Barbour\n|-\n| Married at First Sight\n| Nine Network\n| Tara McWilliams, Emma Lamb, Kate Feely\n|-\n| Masterchef Australia (series 11)\n| Network 10\n| Marty Benson, Adam Fergusson\n|-\n| My Kitchen Rules (series 10)\n| Seven Network\n| Joe Herdman, David Dutton, Nicole Anthony, Therese Hegarty, Angus Ross\n|-\n| rowspan=7 align=\"center\" | 2020(10th)\n|-  style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Masterchef Australia (Back To Win)\n| Network 10\n| Marty Benson and Adam Fergusson\n|-\n| The Amazing Race Australia (season 4)\n| Network 10\n| Paul Franklin, Chris Culvenor, Sophia Mogford, Stephen Tate\n|-\n| Australian Survivor (All Stars)\n| Network 10\n| Amelia Fisk, Keely Sonntag, Adam Fergusson\n|-\n| The Block (season 16)\n| Nine Network\n| David Barbour, Julian Cress\n|-\n| I'm A Celebrity...
