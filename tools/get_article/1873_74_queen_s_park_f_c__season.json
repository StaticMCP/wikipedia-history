Subscription fees from 15 of the 16 clubs that entered the competition were used to pay for the trophy for which they compete.\nQueen's Park's long and successful history in the competition began with a 7–0 win over Dumbreck in the highest scoring game in the inaugural competition on 25 October. They would go on to reach the final without conceding a goal with wins over Eastern and Renton in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively. In the final, they would face off against another Glasgow side – Clydesdale. Second half goals from Billy MacKinnon and Robert Leckie saw Queen's Park run out 2–0 winners at the original Hampden Park to lift the trophy for the first time.\nThis was the first season that the club didn't enter the FA Cup.\nFor the first time, Queen's Park played in their now traditional black and white hoops. Between 1874 and 1876, each player wore distinctive socks.\nResults\nScottish Cup\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Date\n!Round\n!Opponents\n!H / A\n!ResultF–A\n!Scorers\n!Attendance\n|-bgcolor=#ddffdd\n|25 October 1873\n|First round\n|Dumbreck\n|H\n|7–0\n|Broadfoot, Lawrie (2), B.
