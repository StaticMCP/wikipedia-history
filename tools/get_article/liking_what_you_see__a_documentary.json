      "text": "# Liking What You See: A Documentary\n\n\"Liking What You See: A Documentary\" is a science fiction novelette by American writer Ted Chiang, published in the 2002 collection Stories of Your Life and Others.\nPlot summary\nThe novelette examines the cultural effects of a noninvasive medical procedure that induces a visual agnosia toward physical beauty. The story is told as a series of interviews about a reversible procedure called calliagnosia, which eliminates a person's ability to perceive physical beauty. The story's central character is Tamera Lyons, a first-year student who grew up with calliagnosia but wants to experience life without it.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Place !!
