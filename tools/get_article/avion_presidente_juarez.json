      "text": "# Avion Presidente Juarez\n\nAvion Presidente Juarez was the Mexican presidential airplane.\nHistory\nThe plane is certified to fly by instruments under any weather conditions, has a range of nearly eleven hours of flight and can travel six thousand miles per tank at cruising speed. Inside, the Benito Juarez has room for 66 passengers and 15 crew members. At the center of the ship there is an area reserved for the President, which includes an office, bedroom and bathroom. In addition, due to spending enough time in hangar-unlike, for example, the Air Force of Argentina and Chile, which are open-parked, weather-related damage to this particular plane is relatively minimal. However, it has not been without incident. On February 8, 2008, Benito Juárez staggered before landing in Newark, New Jersey, so the pilot had to balance the plane to prevent from proceeding to the grasslands of the Newark airport.\nPrevious planes\n* El Mexicano The Mexican\n* Francisco Zarco\n* El Ciudad de México The Mexico City\n* El Tenochtitlán, El Guanajuato, El Jalisco, El Puebla\n* Miguel Hidalgo (a.k.a.
