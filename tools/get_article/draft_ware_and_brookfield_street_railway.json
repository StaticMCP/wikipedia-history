At times, the tracks were connected to these connecting street railways, Hardwick, Massachusetts in the distance.  View facing south at the intersection of Main Street and Highland Terrace.]]The Ware & Brookfield Street Railway additionally connected to three regional rail stations in the area, the Boston & Albany depots in both Ware and Gilbertville, and the Boston & Maine depot in West Brookfield, the latter of which is still standing, albeit without passenger service.\nThe completion of the WBSR had been greatly significant to the larger region, namely New England and New York, in that, once it was completed, and its rails connected with the adjoining street railways in Ware and West Brookfield, the last remaining gap between the street railway networks of Boston/Worcester/Rhode Island (connected) and Springfield/Connecticut/New York City (also connected), after which point it was possible to travel from Boston to New York entirely by streetcar.\nThere had been hopes of extending the Gilbertville line further north to connect with Fitchburg Railroad and a proposed extension of the Athol & Orange Street Railway to Worcester from Athol, Massachusetts (via Barre and Petersham), however, this vision remained unrealized at the time of the railroad's demise.\nThe Ware & Brookfield Street Railway ceased operations on Sunday, February 3rd, 1918, and was dissolved by an act of the Massachusetts General Court the following year.\nOrigins\nThe origins of the Ware & Brookfield Street Railway can be traced back to at least as far back as February, 1898, when a group, led by one Frederick D. Gilmore identified itself as The Ware Street Railway Company and subsequently petitioned the state legislature for incorporation under that name, as was the procedure at the time.\nReferences"
