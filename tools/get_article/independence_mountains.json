They are called Settoya in Shoshoni. The range reaches a maximum elevation of  on the summit of McAfee Peak. The range extends northward approximately  from a point near Carlin to the banks of the Owyhee River.  To the east is the North Fork of the Humboldt River, and to the west is the Owyhee Desert.  Passing to the south is the main branch of the Humboldt River, and near the northern end of the range is the Wild Horse State Recreation Area.  The Owyhee River is a tributary to the Snake-Columbia system, while the Humboldt is within the Great Basin.\nFrom a point about seven miles north of Carlin, the range rises to Swales Mountain, at an elevation of .  Dropping to an area of hills and buttes, it then rises again to Lone Mountain (Nannies Peak), at .  The range then drops nearly to the level of the surrounding valleys, at a pass where State Route 226 connects to the community of Tuscarora.\nRising sharply to the main core of the range, the crest runs through Wheeler Mountain (), Jack's Peak (), and finally to the range high point, McAfee Peak.\nMost of the range north of State Route 226 is included within the Mountain City Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.\nClimate\nTaylor Canyon is a SNOTEL weather station situated at the southern base of Wheeler Mountain (Nevada), along the State Route 226 pass.\n|source 2 = NOAA (Precipitation)\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
