Devitt was in private practice in East Grand Fords, Minnesota from 1935 to 1939, serving at the same time as a municipal judge of the Minnesota Municipal Court in East Grand Forks. He was an assistant state attorney general of Minnesota from 1939 to 1942. He served in the United States Naval Reserve during World War II as a Lieutenant Commander from 1942 to 1946.\nCongressional service\nDevitt was elected as a Republican to the 80th congress (January 3, 1947 – January 3, 1949) from Minnesota's 4th Congressional District. He was unsuccessful in his bid for reelection to the 81st congress in 1948, defeated by Eugene McCarthy. Devitt is the most recent Republican to have held this seat. Following his departure from Congress, he returned to private practice in Saint Paul from 1949 to 1950. He then served as a Judge of the Minnesota Probate Court for Ramsey County, Minnesota from 1950 to 1954.\nFederal judicial service\nOn December 10, 1954, Devitt received a recess appointment from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota vacated by Judge Matthew M. Joyce. Formally nominated to the same seat by President Eisenhower on January 10, 1955, Devitt was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 4, 1955, and received his commission on February 7, 1955. He served as Chief Judge from 1959 to 1981, assuming senior status on May 1, 1981. In 1979, Devitt presided over the criminal trial for the five Red Lake Reservation uprising defendants, imposing a 26-year prison sentence on uprising leader Harry S. Hanson Jr. Devitt would also impose prison sentences ranging from 10 to 16 years against Hanson's four co-defendants. He served as a board member of the Federal Judicial Center from 1968 to 1971. He served as a judge of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court from 1985 to 1992. Devitt remained in senior status until his death in Saint Paul on March 2, 1992.\nLegacy\nThe American Judicature Society has awarded the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award each year since 1983 to an Article III judge. The first recipient was Albert Branson Maris.\nSee also\n*Edward J.
