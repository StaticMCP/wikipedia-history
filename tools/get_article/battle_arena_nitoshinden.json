It is a spin-off from the Battle Arena Toshinden series. It was only released in Japan; it was planned for the US under the name of Toshinden Kids but was canceled.  Nitoshinden features super deformed characters, similar to those in Virtua Fighter Kids. The title  is a combination of the franchise's name  with the Japanese term .\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Nitoshinden is different from the main series. Each characters' move list has been reduced to 6 attacks; 4 standard attacks, a special attack and a desperation attack.\nThe normal attacks roughly correspond to standard Toshinden attacks. There is a hard attack, light attack, low attack and either a medium or 360 degree attack (depending on the character). There is no real combo ability but some attacks can be chained together.\nThe game features a different defense system to standard Toshinden games. The side step moves still exist, however blocking of other attacks is now done with a parry button that repels an opponent's attack, stunning them for a short time.\nAreas in Nitoshinden are all school-based locations and feature walled-in arenas, similar to Battle Arena Toshinden 3.\nCharacters\nExisting characters from the Toshinden series in this game are:\n*Eiji\n*Ellis\n*Sho\n*Sofia\n*Tracy\n*Vermilion\nUnique characters that only appear in this game are:\n*Baifu\n*Ryuji\n*Rika (guest character)\nReception\nReferences"
