A key part of this training involves recruits entering a room filled with tear gas, removing their respirator, and attempting to shout their name, rank, number, and the regiment/corps they are aspiring to join, before the effects of the tear gas (coughing, sneezing, eyes burning, shortness of breath) become too much to handle.\n* Field exercises where recruits are taught vital military knowledge such as patrolling discipline and formations, section/platoon attacks, room clearance drills, ambushes, searching enemy/civilian prisoners and vehicles, the 6 section battle drills; \"Prep for battle, react to enemy fire, locate the enemy, suppress the enemy, attack the enemy, re-group\", how to locate the enemy and accurately communicate the enemy's distance and location/target indication via methods such as direct method, clock ray method, bracketing etc, why things are seen and the \"7 S's of camoflauge\"; Shape, Speed, Skyline, Shadow, Silhouette, Spacing, Shine, Sound, defense of FOBs and 'harbour areas' and static and dynamic sentry, standing guard or \"stag\", river and obstacle crossing, hand signals, and radio communication voice procedure.\n* Navigation and map reading including navigating at night and in dense forest, using only a map and compass.\n* Courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty, and selfless commitment (CDRILS) are the Army's Values & Standards and are taught and discussed in presentations and practical scenarios.\n* The Law of Armed Conflict and Geneva Conventions.\n* A \"Realities of War\" trip.\n* Bayonet fighting and hand to hand combat.\n* Foot drill and rifle drill.\n* Grenade drills.\nSee also\n*Army Training Unit\n*Selection and training in the British Army\nReferences"
