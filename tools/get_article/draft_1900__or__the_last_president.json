However, the government fails to regulate the production of Bryan Dollars, and by the autumn of 1898, their value eventually drops to a third of the value of gold dollars. Revolts begin to break out in northern states in 1899, and a proposal is made to dissolve the U.S. into three countries, one of which would have New York City as its capital. On the night of December 31, a prolonged Congressional session is interrupted by an explosion of dynamite which destroys the dome of the Capitol at midnight.\nSee also\n* Baron Trump novels\n* Free silver\nReferences"
