      "text": "# Queen Maya of Silla\n\nQueen Maya () was a member of the Silla royal house and the wife and queen consort to King Jinpyeong of Silla, 26th King of Silla. She was of the royal Kim clan. She was the mother of Queen Seondeok of Silla.\nThe name of Queen Maya is derived from Queen Maya (摩耶夫人), the mother of Siddhartha Gautama (Shakyamuni Buddha). During the reign of King Beopheung, Buddhism became officially recognized, and as a result, names for the Silla royalty began to incorporate Buddhist elements and meanings. Although Queen Maya and King Jinpyeong had four daughters and no sons, the existence of two of their daughters, Sunhwa and Cheonhwa, remains uncertain.\nGenealogy\nAncestors\n松華公主 / 松花公主 ()\n|4= 4.
