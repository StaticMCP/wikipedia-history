The court found that the public health interest in achieving herd immunity from contagious diseases outweighed the individual right to privacy, and that the Czech law contained sufficient provisions for the exemption of those with medical or religious reasons for not receiving vaccination, neither of which were demonstrated by the objecting parent.\nThe case was the first in which the ECtHR had ruled on the question of compulsory vaccination.\nSee also\n*Vaccine hesitancy\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
