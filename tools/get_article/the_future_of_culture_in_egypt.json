      "text": "# The Future of Culture in Egypt\n\nThe Future of Culture in Egypt () is a 1938 book by the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein.\nThe book is a work of Egyptian nationalism, advocating both the independence of Egypt and the adoption of various European modes of behaviour and institutions, such as a strong military. The book was written after the independence of Egypt by the British in 1922, but while there remained considerable British influence in the country.\nHussein stressed the shared heritage of the Mediterranean civilization, and Egypt's connections with European culture over its relationship with the Middle East and Arab culture. The book opposed the Arab nationalism and the call for unity among all Arabic-speaking nations. Hussein did not believe that Egyptians spoke Arabic, and asserted that Egyptian Arabic is actually its own distinct language.\nThe book advocated for the nationalisation of the Suez Canal as a move towards further independence of Egypt from the British Empire. This finally occurred in 1956 leading to the Suez Crisis.\nHe also talked of the need to improve Egyptian education.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Future_of_Culture_in_Egypt.html?id=ECoiAQAAIAAJ Official book]\n*[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1954taha.html Excerpt from the Internet Modern History Sourcebook]"
