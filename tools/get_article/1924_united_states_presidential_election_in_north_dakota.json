Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nEver since statehood, North Dakota had been overwhelmingly Republican at state level and in many presidential elections, although progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson was able to carry the state in both his campaigns in 1912 and 1916, in the second due to his anti-war platform. The Russian-Germans who dominated North Dakota's populace were vehemently opposed to President Wilson's pushing of the nation into World War I and his “League of Nations” proposal. To this populace descended from Germans who had settled in Russia, Wilson's entry into the war and his support for the Treaty of Versailles was a betrayal, whilst farmers were also faced with a postwar agricultural depression as prices fell with reduced demand in Europe. Consequently, North Dakota went for the isolationist Warren G. Harding over the pro-League Democrat Cox by four-to-one in 1920.\nDespite Harding's massive victory, discontent amongst North Dakota's large farm population persisted during his term, but the national Democratic Party did nothing to provide any hope of regaining Wilson's prominence in North Dakota, being instead dominated by conflicts between its Southern and Western faction led by William Gibbs McAdoo and its urban Northeastern faction led by Al Smith. A fierce debate ensued that saw a compromise candidate, former Congressman John W. Davis of West Virginia, nominated after one hundred and three ballots in hot summer weather at Madison Square Garden. Although West Virginia was a border state whose limited African-American population had not been disenfranchised as happened in all former Confederate States, Davis did share many views of Southern Democrats of his era. He supported poll taxes, opposed women's suffrage, and believed in strictly limited government with no expansion in nonmilitary fields. In North Dakota, Davis had almost no appeal, especially as he unlike incumbent Calvin Coolidge supported the League of Nations and was opposed to the state's isolationist views. Although in September he underwent an extensive tour of the Great Plains, and campaigned to eliminate the income tax burden of the poorer classes,\nThe agrarian Nonpartisan League, as a response to the conservatism of the major parties, nominated Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin, with Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, as a third-party ticket, supported by the state's Senators Lynn J. Frazier and Gerald P. Nye. Davis and Coolidge both spent most of their campaign attacking La Follette as a political extremist, but nonetheless opinion polls showed that La Follette was attracting large numbers of those German-American and Scandinavian-Americans who completely deserted Cox in 1920. In September some polls had La Follette winning sufficient electoral votes to give no candidate an electoral majority and force the House to make a choice, but as polling day approached newer polls suggested incumbent President Calvin Coolidge would hold the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nevada and Montana, which La Follette had been predicted to win in August.}}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |John Calvin CoolidgeRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |John William DavisDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |Robert Marion La Follette, Sr.Nonpartisan League\n! colspan=\"2\" |William Z.

percent of the popular vote, North Dakota would prove to be La Follette's second strongest state in the 1924 election in terms of popular vote percentage after Wisconsin. Davis received a mere 6.96% of the vote in North Dakota, his second-weakest state behind neighboring Minnesota. This was one of only two states, the other being Wisconsin, in which La Follette won a majority of counties (32 of 53 counties in North Dakota were carried by him). LaFollette and Coolidge did tie in one state, Nevada, where they both won 8 counties, and Davis won one.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in North Dakota\nNotes\nReferences"
