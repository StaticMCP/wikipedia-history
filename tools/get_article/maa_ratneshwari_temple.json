The temple is dedicated to Maa Durga in her Lakshmi Swarupa form and has been a site of religious significance for centuries.\nHistory\nIt was established by Baba Bam Bholi Das, following its original foundation by Ratna Sen, a devoted follower of the Durga, during the rule of the Sena Dynasty in Bengal. Ratna Sen, the great-grandson of Keshava Sena, the last ruler of the Sena Dynasty, migrated to Mithilanchal and established a fort near an existing Durga temple. The temple is considered a prominent pilgrimage destination, particularly for devotees from the Mithilanchal region and Nepal.\nSignificance and Features\nThe temple is known for its peaceful and serene atmosphere, and its worship practices are centered around a sacred Pindi rather than an idol. It does not practice animal sacrifice, which aligns with its tranquil nature. The temple attracts a large number of devotees, especially during the Shardiya Navaratri and Navaratri festivals.\nGallery\nMaa ratneshwari Temple Intrance.jpg|Maa Ratneshwari Temple Intrance\nMaa Ratneshwari Mandir.jpg |Top View of Maa Ratneshwari Temple\nReferences"
