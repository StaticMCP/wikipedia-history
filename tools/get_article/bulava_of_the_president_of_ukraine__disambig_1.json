It contains a three-edged Damascus steel blade bearing the Latin phrase \"Omnia revertitur\", (\"Everything returns\"). The blade can be extracted from the mace by means of a button decorated with a Yakut emerald.\nThe whole bulava weighs 750 grams and consists of two hollowed parts: the handle, and the top, called the \"apple\". The \"apple\" is decorated with gold ornamental medallions, and crowned with a gold stylised wreath decorated with enamelled stones.\nThe bulava is kept in a mahogany case, decorated with a golden relief image of the Ukrainian coat of arms. The lodgement is made of purple velvet. Initially, a lock was placed on the case, but this was replaced by a gilded figure of a guardian angel to allow its easy opening during ceremonies.\nSee also\n* Bulava\n* State symbols of the President of Ukraine\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/1507/99 Указ Президента України від 29.11.1999 № 1507/99 «Про офіційні символи глави держави»]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170723100048/http://na.mil.gov.ua/7076-oficijni-simvoli-prezidenta-ukrayini Офіційні Символи президента України]\n* [http://www.nbuv.gov.ua/node/1018 Державні символи Президента України]"
