Gamers that have never cared about or have never heard of the series don't have any reasons to give it a whirl.\" 1UP.com called the game's learning curve \"intimidating\" even for veteran strategy gamers, but praised \"the top-notch writing, nifty historical setting, and unique aesthetic\", claiming \"the game gives you everything you could want from a turn-based tactics extravaganza.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.koei.com/rtkxi/ The official site for the English version]\n* [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/sangokushi/11/ Japan Gamecity RTK11 page]\n* [http://www.gamecity.net.cn/sangokushi/11/ China Gamecity RTK11 page]\n* [http://www.gamecity.com.tw/sangokushi/11/ Taiwan Gamecity RTK11 page]\n* [http://www.rotk.co.uk/ Koei Europe RTK11 page]"
