By later standards, the battle was a minor skirmish. Often deemed as a final part of the Battle of Rich Mountain, it was the end of a series of battles between the forces of Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and Confederate Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett.\nBattle\nMcClellan had defeated part of Garnett's force on July 11, 1861, at the Battle of Rich Mountain. Upon hearing about the defeat, Garnett fell back toward Virginia with approximately 4,500 men around midnight that night. He began to march towards Beverly, but received false information that McClellan's men occupied the town. The Confederates backtracked, abandoned the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike at Leadsville, and crossed Cheat Mountain into the Cheat River Valley. Union Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Morris pursued them with his Indiana brigade.\nAround noon on July 13, Morris overtook Garnett's rear guard at Corrick's Ford on the Cheat River, and attacked the retreating Confederates. Garnett personally directed the rear guard of the Confederate skirmishers in order to delay the Union attack. He soon withdrew to another ford a mile or two further away. The running skirmish resumed and as Garnett again prepared to retreat, a Union volley killed him instantly. The Confederates fled, abandoning their dead commander, one cannon, and nearly 40 wagons. A friend in the Union Army recovered Garnett's body after the battle. He was the first general officer killed in the Civil War.\nControl of western Virginia was now in Union hands and it stayed that way for the rest of the war. The campaign propelled Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan to command of the Army of the Potomac.\nMemorials\nTwo monuments mark the Battle of Corricks Ford. A six-ton boulder affixed with a bronze plaque was dedicated in 1926 and later moved to a site which is now along US Route 219. Another monument to the battle was unveiled at the courthouse in 1938.\nBattlefield preservation\nThe Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved  of the battlefield.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160712054651/http://canaanvalley.org/corricks-ford-battlefield-2.html Corricks Ford Battlefield Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160810143539/http://elrobinsonengineering.com/projects/corricks-ford-battlefield-master-plan-and-interpretive-signs Corricks Ford Battlefield Master Plan]"
