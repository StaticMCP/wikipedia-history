The first story is about a child, who on escaping from a rebel camp hijacks a car, transpiring in a journey that unravels her plight and probes deep into traumatic issues of children involved in armed conflicts. The next story is about a boy, a drug peddler, and his journey into the drug world. It simultaneously explores the life of his grieving mother while delving into the region that has become synonymous with the drug trade. The third story is about a man, an elephant poacher, who ends up killing fifteen elephants to fend for himself and his young wife.
