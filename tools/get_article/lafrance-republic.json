      "text": "# LaFrance-Republic\n\nLaFrance-Republic was a truck manufacturing company that was established in 1929 in Michigan as a merger of the Republic Motor Truck Company and American LaFrance. The company introduced a one-ton model in November 1929, and a \"super truck\" called the Mogul in 1931 powered by a 240 hp twelve-cylinder American-La France engine2. However, the company's fortunes did not improve, and it was eventually bought by Sterling Motor Truck Company.\nReferences"
