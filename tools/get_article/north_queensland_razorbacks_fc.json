They played in the Queensland State League. They were considered to be one of two feeder clubs for A-League team North Queensland Fury before its demise in 2011.\nHistory\nThe club has had reasonable success in the last few years. Before the North Queensland Fury were inducted into the A-League in 2009 the Razorbacks were the sole football team in Townsville and therefore got reasonable crowds in for their home games. However they have become the main feeder club for the Fury. They play their home games at the Murray Sports Reserve and normally play their games on Field 1. In turn the Fury have loaned out several players, including Jacob Timpano to the Razorbacks to gain gametime during the A-League offseason.\nIn 2010, the NQ Razorbacks played two warm up games against the preseason North Queensland Fury Squad, drawing 0–0 in the first match and then going down 7–2 after being 1–0 up for part of the first half.\nCurrent squad\n2012 Queensland State League Squad.\n(Captain)\n(Vice-Captain)\nStaff\n* Senior Mens Coach: Ken Mitchell\n* Senior Mens Assistant Coach: Troy Perry & Anthony Galliozi\n* '''Senior Men's Team Manager: David Chellingworth\n* Senior Mens Goalkeeping Coach: David Chellingworth\n* Physiotherapist: Luis Resa\n* Sports Trainer: Azra Rantucci\n* Operations Manager''': Ric Floyd\nSee also\n* Queensland State League\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110611/http://www.nqrazorbacks.com.au/ Official website]\n* [http://www.qldsl.com.au/team.php?id=2#profiles Team Profile]"
