Due to equipment shortages and administrative failings, many PRM members never received uniforms or weapons training. The best trained of the militia units were the Rapid Mobilisation Companies, one of which was provided for each PRA Defence Region.\nShortly after the overthrow and execution Maurice Bishop, the People's Revolutionary Militia began arming some of its members for civil war.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/page2c.html The Grenada Revolution Online – What was the PRA, PRAF and PRM?]"
