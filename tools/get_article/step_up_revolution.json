The film grossed over $140 million against a production budget of $33 million and received mixed reviews from critics.\nA sequel, Step Up: All In, was released in August 2014 in the United States.\nPlot\nIn Miami, a flash mob, later identified as \"The Mob\", shuts down Ocean Drive briefly by cutting off the streets with retro convertibles and dancing on cars to music blasted by DJ Penelope. A few hours later, Sean Asa, Eddy, and Jason Hardlerson, the leaders of The Mob, watch their latest flash mob air on the television news in a restaurant kitchen of the Dimont Hotel where they work as waiters.\nA few complain about their public disturbance, while others praise it. After they get off work, the group sneak into the hotel's beach club, claiming to be guests, not employees.\nMeanwhile, across the club at the bar, aspiring ballerina Emily Anderson tries to get a bartender's attention but ends up preparing her own beer. Sean, who is immediately smitten by her, asks for a beer. Emily heads down to the beach to dance, resulting in a dance battle between the two, but ending with Emily suddenly running off when she sees her father's business partner.\nThe next day, Emily and her father William Anderson argue over breakfast at the Dimont Hotel. Sean, their waiter, immediately recognizes her, but Emily spills her orange juice to distract him. In an angry fit, Emily storms off, and Sean follows her into the hotel's ballroom, where Emily begins a fast contemporary dance, oblivious to Sean's presence.\nAfter Emily notices Sean and warms up to him, she explains to him that she's trying to nail an audition for the prestigious Winwood Dance Academy Company. Sean advises her to incorporate faster, more interesting moves, but Emily declines, saying that there are rules.\nSean, in turn, tells Emily to break the rules, giving her an address and telling her to come there that evening. She does and finds herself at the Miami Museum of Fine Arts, where the paintings and statues come to life, which is the work of The Mob. By asking her to attend, Sean reveals to her his participation in The Mob.\nThe next day, Emily persuades Sean to let her take part in their next flash mob, which is scheduled to hit a restaurant the following week. Eddy immediately dislikes Emily, giving her the lead to test her. The flash mob goes well and Eddy admits that Emily did great.\nSean and Emily then take out a boat and move down the river. There, they kiss and fall sleep on the boat until morning, when they hurry back to Sean's uncle's bar, Ricky's. Ricky reveals to them that Emily's father, a building tycoon, is planning to develop the slums, destroying Ricky's bar, Sean's home, and most of the neighborhood.\nEmily wants to tell The Mob who her father is, but Sean convinces not to. She leads the rest of The Mob to protest the plans, and their dance is a huge hit. Eddy finds out that Emily is William's daughter, and reveals to William that Emily is a part of the Mob.\nEmily feels Sean betrayed her and he gets arrested for saving Eddy after a fight between the two. Emily had rehearsed her Winwood audition piece as a duet with Sean, but as she and Sean are estranged, she adapts the piece. Her solo performance falls flat so she fails her audition for the troupe.\nRicky bails Sean and Eddy out of jail for being caught in the flash mob, and the lifelong friends make up. They then mob the development's public announcement, with the help of members from The House of Pirates, including Moose, Vladd, Hair, and Jenny Kido.\nSean and Emily then perform the original audition piece.
