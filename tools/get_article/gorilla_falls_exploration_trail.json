It is about three-eighths of a mile in length. There are \"research students\" positioned at most locations to give information about the animals and answer questions.\nThe attraction originally opened on April 22, 1998 as Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail, but the name was changed to Pangani Forest Exploration Trail in August 1998. The attraction reverted to its original name on May 27, 2016.\nAnimals\n*Angolan black-and-white colobus\n*Okapi\n*Arabian spiny mouse\n*Naked mole-rat\n*Pancake tortoise\n*Kenyan sand boa\n*Ball python\n*African bullfrog\n*Angolan python\n*Hippopotamus\n*Grevy's zebra\n*Meerkat\n*Western lowland gorilla\nAviary\n*Red-and-yellow barbet\n*Hammerkop\n*Great blue turaco\n*Amethyst starling\n*Northern carmine bee-eater\n*Racket-tailed roller\n*Blue-bellied roller\n*African olive pigeon\n*White-headed buffalo weaver\n*Tambourine dove\n*Purple glossy starling\n*Taveta golden weaver\n*Green woodhoopoe\n*Snowy-crowned robin-chat\n*Marbled teal\n*African pygmy goose\n*Bruce's green pigeon\n*African jacana\n*Black-cheeked lovebird\nFish\n*Lake Victoria cichlid\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/animal-kingdom/attractions/pangani-forest-exploration-trail/ Walt Disney World Resort - Pangani Forest Exploration Trail]"
