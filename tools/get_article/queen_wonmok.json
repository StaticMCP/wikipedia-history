In the same year, her father, Seo Nul held positions such as Jungchusahsangisangsi () and Seogyeongyusupansa (), also during King Deokjong's reign, Seo Nul became Munhasijung ().\nThen, in 1026, Hyeonjong gave her biological mother, Lady Choe a title of \"Grand Lady of Icheon County\" () and her stepmother, Lady Jeong a title of \"Grand Lady of Icheon County\" ().\nLater life, Death and funeral\nShe outlived at least 26 years since her late husband's death in 1031 and later died on 16 June 1057 during the 11st year reign of her stepson, King Munjong. Although she was also one of the king's stepmother, but since she didn't have her own child, so many Ministers in the court told Munjong to not wear the \"Sang-bok\" (상복, 喪服; \"mourning clothes\") and he followed it as a result. For the same reason, her ancestral rites were not held on the New Year's Day.\nHer body was cremated, but where her tomb's location is unknown since no records left about that. Under his command too, she was posthumously called as Queen Wonmok ().\nFamily\n* Father - Sŏ Nul (서눌, 徐訥; 972–1043)\n** Grandfather - Sŏ Hŭi (서희, 徐熙; 943–998)\n** Grandmother - Lady Han of the Cheongju Han clan (청주 한씨; 947–?); daughter of Han Sik (한식, 韓湜; 921–?)\n* Mother - Princess Consort Incheon of the Ch'oe clan (이천부부인 최씨; 974–?); daughter of Ch'oe Yu-il (최유일, 崔有一; 948–?)\n* Sibling(s)\n** Older brother - Sŏ Su (서수; 996–?)\n*** Unnamed sister-in-law (1000–?)\n**** Nephew - Sŏ Chang-gi (서장기, 徐長己; 1024–?)\n* Spouse\n** Wang Sun, King Hyeonjong of Goryeo (고려 현종; 1 August 992 – 17 June 1031) — No issue.\nAncestry\n)\n|2=Sŏ Nul()\n|3=Lady Ch'oe ()\n|4=Sŏ Hŭi()\n|5=Lady Han, of the Cheongju Han clan()\n|8=Sŏ P'il()\n|9=Lady, of the Pyongyang Hwang clan()\n|16=Sŏ Sin-il()\n|17=Lady Hong, of the Hapcheon Hong clan()\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://db.history.go.kr/KOREA/search/searchResult.do?sort=levelId&dir=ASC&start=-1&limit=20&page=1&pre_page=1&itemIds=&indexSearch=N&codeIds=PERIOD-0-3&synonym=off&chinessChar=on&searchTermImages=%EC%9B%90%EB%AA%A9%EC%99%95%ED%9B%84%C2%A0&searchKeywordType=BI&searchKeywordMethod=EQ&searchKeyword=%EC%9B%90%EB%AA%A9%EC%99%95%ED%9B%84&searchKeywordConjunction=AND#searchDetail/kr/kr_088r_0010_0550/1/0/1/r Queen Wonmok] on Goryeosa .\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0040654 Queen Wonmok] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000949325 원목왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
