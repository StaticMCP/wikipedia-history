The museum is a non-profit organization and opened its gallery in July 2005 on the first floor of the former Wharton County Jail, which was constructed in 1888.\nThe museum's collection consists mostly of smaller items, such as radios, but also has a few experimental aircraft, including an ornithopter and a Rutan VariEze, which is displayed in front of the museum.  Many items on display in the museum are in working condition and may either be demonstrated to visitors or available for hands-on operation (including most of the arcade games on display).\nMajor displays in the museum include:\n*Radios\n* Phonographs and a jukebox\n* Televisions\n* Arcade games\n* Home appliances, such as early refrigerators\n* Farm equipment\n* Telephones\n* Typewriters\n* Computers\n* Electronics\n* Cameras\n* Aircraft\nSee also\n* List of museums in Central Texas\n*Museum of Radio and Technology\n*Museum of Broadcast Communications\n*American Museum of Radio and Electricity\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.20thcenturytech.org/ 20th Century Technology Museum] website"
