Embryonic age, in contrast measures the actual age of the embryo or fetus from the time of fertilization. Nevertheless, menstruation has historically been the only means of estimating embryonal/fetal age, and is still the presumed measure if not else specified. However, the actual duration between last menstruation and fertilization may in fact differ from the standard 2 weeks by several days.\nThus, the first week of embryonic age is already week three counting with gestational age.\nFurthermore, the number of the week is one more than the actual age of the embryo/fetus. For example, the embryo is 0 whole weeks old during the 1st week after fertilization.\nThe following table summarizes the various expression systems during week number x of gestation.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| || Week  number || Initial age(whole weeks)\n|-\n| Gestational || x || x-1\n|-\n|Embryonic || x-2 || x-3\n|}\nChanges by weeks of gestation\nEmbryonic stage\nWeek 3\nGestational age: 2 weeks and 0 days until 2 weeks and 6 days old. 15–21 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 1. 0 (whole) weeks old. 1–7 days from fertilization.\n* Fertilization of the ovum to form a new human organism, the human zygote. (day 1 of fertilization)\n* The zygote undergoes mitotic cellular divisions, but does not increase in size. This mitosis is also known as cleavage. A hollow cavity forms marking the blastocyst stage. (day 1.5–3 of fertilization.)\n* The blastocyst contains only a thin rim of trophoblast cells and a clump of cells at one end known as the \"embryonic pole\" which include embryonic stem cells.\n*The embryo hatches from its protein shell (zona pellucida) and performs implantation onto the endometrial lining of the mother's uterus. (day 5–6 of fertilization.)\n*If separation into identical twins occurs, 1/3 of the time it will happen before day 5.\nWeek 4\nGestational age: 3 weeks and 0 days until 3 weeks and 6 days old. 22–28 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 2. 1 week old. 8–14 days from fertilization.\n* Trophoblast cells surrounding the embryonic cells proliferate and invade deeper into the uterine lining. They will eventually form the placenta and embryonic membranes. The blastocyst is fully implanted day 7–12 of fertilization.\n* Formation of the yolk sac.\n* The embryonic cells flatten into a disk, two cells thick.\n* If separation into identical twins occurs, 2/3 of the time it will happen between days 5 and 9. If it happens after day 9, there is a significant risk of the twins being conjoined.\n*Primitive streak develops. (day 13 of fertilization).\n*Primary stem villi appear. (day 13 of fertilization).\nWeek 5\nGestational age: 4 weeks and 0 days until 4 weeks and 6 days old. 29–35 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 3. 2 weeks old. 15–21 days from fertilization.\n*A notochord forms in the center of the embryonic disk. (day 16 of fertilization.)\n*Gastrulation commences. (day 16 of fertilization.)\n* A neural groove (future spinal cord) forms over the notochord with a brain bulge at one end. Neuromeres appear. (day 18 of fertilization.)\n* Somites, the divisions of the future vertebra, form. (day 20 of fertilization.)\n*Primitive heart tube is forming. Vasculature begins to develop in embryonic disc. (day 20 of fertilization.)\nWeek 6\nGestational age: 5 weeks and 0 days until 5 weeks and 6 days old. 36–42 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 4. 3 weeks old. 22–28 days from fertilization.\n* The embryo measures  in length and begins to curve into a C shape.\n* The heart bulges, further develops, and begins to beat in a regular rhythm. Septum primum appears.\n* Pharyngeal arches, grooves which will form structures of the face and neck, form.\n* The neural tube closes.\n* The ears begin to form as otic pits.\n* Arm buds and a tail are visible.\n* Lung bud, the first traits of the lung appear.\n* Hepatic plate, the first traits of the liver appear.\n* Buccopharyngeal membrane ruptures. This is the future mouth.\n* Cystic diverticulum, which will become the gallbladder, and dorsal pancreatic bud, which will become the pancreas appear.\n* Urorectal septum begins to form. Thus, the rectal and urinary passageways become separated.\n* Anterior and posterior horns differentiate in the spinal cord.\n* Spleen appears.\n* Ureteric buds appear.\n[[Image:6 weeks pregnant.png|thumb|right|Embryo at 4 weeks after fertilization. This reconciles to Pregnancy Week 6.]]\nWeek 7\nGestational age: 6 weeks and 0 days until 6 weeks and 6 days old. 43–49 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 5. 4 weeks old. 29–35 days from fertilization.\n* The embryo measures  in length and weighs about 1 gram.\n* Optic vesicles and optic cups form the start of the developing eye.\n* Nasal pits form.\n* The brain divides into 5 vesicles, including the early telencephalon.\n* Leg buds form and hands form as flat paddles on the arms.\n* Rudimentary blood moves through primitive vessels connecting to the yolk sac and chorionic membranes.\n* The metanephros, precursor of the definitive kidney, starts to develop.\n* The initial stomach differentiation begins.\nA 10mm embryo from an ectopic pregnancy, still in the oviduct. This embryo is about five weeks old (or from the seventh week of menstrual age). This reconciles to Pregnancy Week 7.\nWeek 8\nGestational age: 7 weeks and 0 days until 7 weeks and 6 days old. 50–56 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 6. 5 weeks old. 36–42 days from fertilization.\n* The embryo measures  in length.\n* Lungs begin to form.\n* The brain continues to develop.\n* Arms and legs have lengthened with foot and hand areas distinguishable.\n* The hands and feet have digits, but may still be webbed.\n* The gonadal ridge begins to be perceptible.\n* The lymphatic system begins to develop.\n* Main development of sex organs starts.\nWeek 9\nGestational age: 8 weeks and 0 days until 8 weeks and 6 days old. 57–63 days from last menstruation.\nEmbryonic age: Week nr 7. 6 weeks old. 43–49 days from fertilization.\n* The embryo measures  in length.\n* Fetal heart tone (the sound of the heart beat) can be heard using doppler.\n* Nipples and hair follicles begin to form.\n* Location of the elbows and toes are visible.\n* Spontaneous limb movements may be detected by ultrasound.\n* All essential organs have at least begun.\n*The vitelline duct normally closes.\nThis embryo is also from an ectopic pregnancy, this one in the cornu (the part of the uterus to which the Fallopian tube is attached). The features are consistent with a developmental age of seven weeks.
