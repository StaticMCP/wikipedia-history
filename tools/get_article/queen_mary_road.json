The road was named in 1910 in honour of Mary of Teck, who became Queen consort on May 6, 1910, when her husband George V became King of the United Kingdom.\nHistory\nin 1943]]\nIn 1900, urban residents could still enjoy the  rural northern flank of Mount Royal by taking the path of the Côte-des-Neiges Road and then Côte-Saint-Luc Road.\nThe urbanization of the territory started in 1925 with the connection of different tram lines. The development of public transportation encouraged the construction of numerous tenements along major thoroughfares such as Queen Mary Road, which was then the Snowdon Junction terminus.\nIn the 1960s, the Decarie Expressway trench was dug, splitting the road in two, which increased vehicular traffic in the Snowdon neighbourhood.\nIn 1981, the Snowdon metro station opened near the site of the old tram terminus. This station is an important transit crossroad because it serves two Metro lines, the Orange Line and the Blue Line, in addition to many buses. Today, Queen Mary Road is still a main focus of the neighbourhood.\nProposed name change\nIn fall 2010, in the wake of the canonization of Brother André, some politicians and journalists suggested that Queen Mary Road be renamed Frère-André Road.\nSee also\n* 166 Queen Mary\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Ville de Montréal.
