The series portrays the lives of the Robertson family, who became successful from their family-operated business, Duck Commander. The West Monroe, Louisiana business makes products for duck hunters, primarily a duck call named Duck Commander. The episodes are structured in a sitcom story format, unlike other reality television series, which has allowed it to have continued success in syndication. The bearded Robertsons – brothers Phil and Si, and Phil's sons Jase, Willie, and Jep – are the poster characters for the show, though the main cast consists of family and friends of the Robertsons such as their wives – Miss Kay, Korie, Missy Robertson, and Jessica Robertson – as well as coworkers Martin and Godwin, beardless brother Alan, radio host Mountain Man, and the Robertson kids – Sadie, John Luke, Bella, Willie Jr, Rebecca, Rowdy, Mia, Reed, and others. The family was previously featured on the Duckmen series, and Outdoor Channel's Benelli Presents Duck Commander and its Buck Commander spin-off.\nThe 2013 fourth-season premiere \"Till Duck Do Us Part\" drew 11.8 million viewers; the most-watched nonfiction cable series in history (at that time), and with a 5.0 rating it is the highest rated telecast for A&E. The show earned $80 million in advertising sales for the first nine months of 2013, and merchandise has generated another $400 million in revenue.  After 11 seasons, the series concluded on March 29, 2017, with the hour-long finale \"End of an Era\", the episode concluded with Si Robertson performing the show's theme song \"Sharp Dressed Man\" alongside ZZ Top.\nIn 2025, A&E announced a reboot of the series, titled Duck Dynasty: The Revival, that is expected to premiere in the summer of 2025. The reboot series will feature 20 one-hour episodes that follow Willie and Korie Robertson with their growing family of children and grandchildren in their Louisiana homestead. Initially, Phil Robertson was not expected to be featured in the revival series amid declining health and recent Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Phil Robertson died on May 25, 2025.\nMembers\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Family Member\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"11\"| Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 1\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 2\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 3\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 4\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 5\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 6\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 7\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 8\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 9\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 10\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| 11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Phil Robertson\n| Willie's father, President of Duck Commander\n| colspan=4\n| colspan=7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Kay Robertson\n| Willie's mother\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Alan Robertson\n| Willie's brother\n| colspan=3\n| colspan=8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lisa Robertson\n| Alan's wife\n| colspan=3\n| colspan=8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Jase Robertson\n| Willie's  brother, COO of Duck Commander\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Missy Robertson\n| Jase's wife\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Reed Robertson\n| Jase's son\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Brighton Robertson\n| Reed's wife\n| colspan=9\n| colspan=2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Cole Robertson\n| Jase's son\n|\n| colspan=10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Mia Robertson\n| Jase's daughter\n|\n| colspan=10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Willie Robertson\n| CEO, Duck Commander\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Korie Robertson\n| Willie's wife\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| John Luke Robertson\n| Willie's son\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Mary Kate McEacharn-Robertson\n| John Luke's wife\n| colspan=7\n| colspan=4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sadie Robertson\n| Willie's daughter\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Bella Robertson\n| Willie's daughter\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rebecca Robertson\n| Willie's daughter\n| colspan=3\n| colspan=8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Willie Robertson Jr.\n| Willie's son\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Rowdy Robertson\n| Willie's son\n| colspan=9\n| colspan=2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Jep Robertson\n| Willie's brother\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Jessica Robertson\n| Jep's wife\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lily Robertson\n| Jep's daughter\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Merritt Robertson\n| Jep's daughter\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Priscilla Robertson\n| Jep's daughter\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| River Robertson\n| Jep's son\n| colspan=3\n| colspan=8\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Jules Augustus \"Gus\" Robertson\n| Jep's son\n| colspan=10\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Si Robertson\n| Willie's uncle/Vietnam Veteran\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Christine Robertson\n| Si's Wife\n| colspan=10\n| colspan=1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| John Godwin\n| Employee\n| colspan=11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Justin Martin\n| Employee\n| colspan=11\n|-\n|}\nRobertson family participants\nPhil Alexander Robertson\nPhil, (1946–2025), was the family patriarch and creator of the Duck Commander duck call.

Robertson cited the issues as part of what is often called \"spiritual warfare\", that there was no swearing that needed to be edited out, and the prayers were being censored to avoid offending non-Christian religious people. A&E did not comment on the claims.\nA&E suspended Phil Robertson over remarks he made during an interview with Drew Magary  for GQ Magazine which had attracted outside criticism. During the interview for a featured article in ''GQ's'' January 2014 issue, titled \"What the Duck?\", Magary asked Robertson: \"What, in your mind, is sinful?\" Robertson replied: \"Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.\" A&E stated they were \"extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty\". He said he is a \"product of the '60s\" but has since lived his life on Biblical principles. He added: \"I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me.\" The Robertson family released a statement about A&E's decision, refusing to do the show without him and supporting Phil by saying that while some of his comments were \"coarse,\" his beliefs are \"grounded in the teachings of the Bible.\" In the first public interview since the GQ interview, Robertson stood by his words and said: \"Jesus will take sins away. If you're a homosexual, He'll take it away. If you're an adulterer, if you're a liar, what's the difference?;\" Robertson himself would later be revealed to have had an adulterous affair in the 1970s which resulted in him conceiving a daughter.\nRobertson's remarks were reported in the media, with reactions split. Many social conservatives, including his corporate sponsors, some religious groups, and some Republican politicians including Sarah Palin, Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee, supported his right to such opinions. Robertson faced significant opposition from individuals viewing his comments as anti-gay and bigoted. A&E reversed Robertson's suspension. The network cited Phil and the family's regret for the use of \"coarse language\" in discussing body parts, and stated that A&E would launch a public service announcement across the channel's \"entire portfolio\" that would promote \"tolerance and acceptance among all people.\" A Human Rights Campaign representative saw the reinstatement and message as a positive step, and \"the real harm that such anti-gay and racist comments can cause\" and the governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal remarked on \"tolerance of religious views\".\nMedia franchise\nThe success of Duck Dynasty caused numerous spin-offs and expanded the media franchise for Duck Commander. This includes other television series, a music album, books, podcasts, and video games.\nRevival series\nIn January 2025, A&E announced it had ordered two ten-episode seasons of a new series called Duck Dynasty: The Revival, a reboot which will focus on Willie and Korie Robertson and their adult children and grandchildren. Other family members who featured prominently on the original series will return, except for Phil Robertson, who the family announced in 2024 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and other health issues.\nSpin-offs and other productions\nDuck Dynasty has launched several spin-off series since its release, including Jep & Jessica: Growing the Dynasty and Going Si-Ral during the show's success on A&E. Following the show's conclusion, Blaze Media produced the 2017–2021 show In the Woods with Phil, and starting in 2022 Fox Entertainment created a streaming and broadcast syndication series called Duck Family Treasure. Like past shows, many Robertson family members, co-workers, and friends appear in these spin-offs. Various on-going podcasts continue to prominently feature the Robertsons as well: Phil, Jase, and Alan host Unashamed; Sadie hosts ''WHOA That's Good Podcast; and Duck Commander produces Duck Call Room with Si, Martin, and Godwin. Outdoor Channel acquired rerun rights to Duck Dynasty'' in 2016. In 2020 Fox Nation acquired the streaming rights to the show for the year; after that deal concluded, Hulu began streaming the series in 2023.\nIn popular culture\nDuck Dynasty was parodied on Cartoon Network's MAD in a skit called, \"McDuck Dynasty.\" It was a mash-up of DuckTales (1987 TV series) and Duck Dynasty that had the cast of DuckTales playing the roles of the Robertsons.\nAwards and nominations\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Year\n!rowspan=2|Nominee / Work\n!colspan=2|Award Associations\n!rowspan=2|Result\n!rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n!\n!\n|-\n|2013\n|The Robertsons – Duck Dynasty\n|Teen Choice Awards\n|Choice TV: Male Reality Star\n|\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Duck Dynasty\n|Critics' Choice Television Awards\n|Best Reality Series\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|2014\n|Duck Dynasty\n|MovieGuide Awards\n|Faith & Freedom\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\n}}\nFurther reading\n* [https://newrepublic.com/article/120394/latest-duck-dynasty-product-musical  `Duck Dynasty`'s Success Is Entirely Based on Selling a Fantasy - The enduring, commercial fallacy of the \"authentic\" man], The New Republic\nExternal links\n*\n*"
