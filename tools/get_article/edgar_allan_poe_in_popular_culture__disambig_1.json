Besides his works, the legend of Poe himself has fascinated people for generations. His appearances in popular culture often envision him as a sort of \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\", exploiting his personal struggles. Many depictions of Poe interweave elements of his life with his works, in part due to Poe's frequent use of first-person narrators, suggesting an erroneous assumption that Poe and his characters are identical.\nThis article focuses specifically on the historical Edgar Allan Poe making appearances in fiction, television, and film.\nComics\nThere have been over three hundred comic book adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe's works as of 2008, possibly more than that of any other American writer.
