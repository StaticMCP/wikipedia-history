Movie critic Rex Reed, in a contemporary article about the broadcast, wrote:\nNBC's telcast of the Foreign Press Association's 25th annual Golden Globe Awards had to be seen to be disbelieved. The Federal Communications Commission have sent lawyers to have it investigated. But award-giving, pointless as it is, is still big business, and it also gives viewers a chance to see their favorite stars make fools of themselves in public, so the Golden Globes were back, minus some of their sponsors, who backed out at the last minute....\nJust last week Newsweek reported denials from the Foreign Press Association that its members give awards to the stars who throw the biggest feeds. \"We are not influenced by a glass of champagne,\" snapped [HFPA President Howard] Luft, \"Kirk Douglas threw a party last year, and what did he win? Nothing.\"\nThis year there was even a special category called the Cecil B. DeMille Humanitarian Award. Who won? You guessed it. Kirk Douglas.\nThe FCC was spurred to action because the public had been misled as to how the awards were actually made. Golden Globe broadcast advertisers determined Golden Globe winners and the HFPA pressured nominees to attend the award ceremony by threatening to award the Golden Globe won by a non-attendee to a losing nominee who was at the ceremony. The ban lasted until 1974.\nAfter the ban, NBC once again broadcast the awards ceremony, but it terminated its contract with the HFPA after the Pia Zadora scandal of 1982.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width=100%\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Best Motion Picture\n|-\n! style=\"width=50%\" |Drama\n! style=\"width=50%\" |Comedy or Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*In the Heat of the Night\n**Bonnie and Clyde\n**Far from the Madding Crowd\n**''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\n**In Cold Blood\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*The Graduate\n**Camelot\n**Doctor Dolittle\n**The Taming of the Shrew\n**Thoroughly Modern Millie\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Best Performance in a Motion Picture – Drama\n|-\n!Actor\n!Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Rod Steiger - In the Heat of the Night as Police Chief Bill Gillespie'\n**Alan Bates - Far from the Madding Crowd as Gabriel Oak\n**Warren Beatty - Bonnie and Clyde as Clyde Barrow\n**Paul Newman - Cool Hand Luke as Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson\n**Sidney Poitier - In the Heat of the Night as Detective Virgil Tibbs\n**Spencer Tracy - Guess Who's Coming to Dinner as Matt Drayton (posthumous)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Edith Evans - The Whisperers as Maggie Ross'\n**Faye Dunaway - Bonnie and Clyde as Bonnie Parker\n**Audrey Hepburn - Wait Until Dark as Susy Hendrix\n**Katharine Hepburn - Guess Who's Coming to Dinner as Christina Drayton\n**Anne Heywood - The Fox as Ellen March\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Best Performance in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical\n|-\n!Actor\n!Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Richard Harris - Camelot as King Arthur'\n**Richard Burton - The Taming of the Shrew as Petruchio\n**Rex Harrison - Doctor Dolittle as Doctor John Dolittle\n**Dustin Hoffman - The Graduate as Benjamin Braddock\n**Ugo Tognazzi - The Climax as Sergio Masini\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Anne Bancroft - The Graduate as Mrs. Robinson'\n**Julie Andrews - Thoroughly Modern Millie as Millie Dillmount\n**Audrey Hepburn - Two for the Road as Joanna \"Jo\" Wallace\n**Shirley MacLaine - Woman Times Seven as Paulette / Maria Teresa / Linda / Edith / Eve Minou / Marie / Jeanne\n**Vanessa Redgrave - Camelot as Guenevere\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Best Supporting Performance in a Motion Picture – Drama, Comedy or Musical\n|-\n!Supporting Actor\n!Supporting Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Richard Attenborough - Doctor Dolittle as Albert Blossom'\n**John Cassavetes - The Dirty Dozen as Victor R.
