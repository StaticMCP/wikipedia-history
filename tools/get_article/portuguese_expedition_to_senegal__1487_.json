With Arguin as a base the Portuguese tried to extend their influence in the countries to the south. Down south, a dispute over the throne of Joloff was occurring, which gave them the opportunity to try to gain a footing in the regions of the Senegal River. Gonçalo Coelho was sent to assist a claimant to the throne, Bemoi, whose claim to the throne was disputed by his brother Sibetah. Coelho made terms, where aid would be granted if Bemoi converted to Christianity.\nExpedition\nInitially, Coelho withdrew support when Bemoi refused to convert to Christianity. However, Bemoi later traveled to Lisbon, where he converted, and was baptized as João. With a fleet of twenty ships under Pero Vaz da Cunha, Bemoi returned to Senegal to reclaim his throne. A fort was built at the mouth of the Senegal River, securing Portuguese presence. However, soon after, tensions arose between Bemoi and the Portuguese.\nPedro Vaz da Cunha later had him murdered.\nAftermath\nAfter Bemoi's assassination, the Portuguese returned to their country. However, this expedition led to more communication with the rulers of the nearby territories.\nEmbassies were sent to Timbuktu and to African chiefs in the interior.\nReferences\nFootnotes\nSources\n*\n*"
