He co-wrote the track with Danick Dupelle and Jimmy Thow, and co-produced it with Dupelle. It was intended to be the lead single off Tebey's album Tulum, but the album release did not occur.\nBackground\nTebey wrote the song with his frequent collaborators Jimmy Thow and Danick Dupelle while in Mexico, with the title \"What Was I Drinking\" being partly inspired by a night out the three had during the trip. The three went out for several drinks one night and subsequently all woke up feeling \"violently ill\", with Thow remarking to Tebey \"what were we drinking\". Tebey stated that the track sounded more like country music than his recent contemporary-influenced singles. The track was released ahead of his appearance at the 2022 C2C: Country to Country festival in the United Kingdom.\nCritical reception\nTop Country named the song their \"Pick of the Week\" for February 18, 2022, citing it as the \"perfect song to get you in the mood\" for the Family Day long weekend.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Association\n!Category\n!Result\n!Ref\n|-\n| 2022\n| Canadian Country Music Awards\n| Record Producer of the Year - Danick Dupelle, Tebey Ottoh\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Country Music Association of Ontario\n| Single of the Year\n|\n|\n|}\nCommercial performance\n\"What Was I Drinking\" reached a peak of number 14 on the Billboard Canada Country chart.
