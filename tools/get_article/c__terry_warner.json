He founded the Arbinger Institute, which does consulting and training based on his academic work on the foundations of human behavior and self-deception.  In writings and seminars, Warner argues that people are responsible for their own actions and even negative emotions which are often used to accuse others rather than responding to their needs, and that people therefore have the power to free their relationships with others from negativity.\nWarner holds a PhD from Yale University and is a professor emeritus of philosophy at Brigham Young University. In 1967 he joined the faculty at Brigham Young University, where he served as chair of the Philosophy Department, director of the Honors Program, and dean of the College of General Studies. Among Warner's students was Steven Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. He was a visiting senior member of Linacre College, Oxford University.\nArbinger Institute\nWarner started the Arbinger Institute, in 1979, a leadership training and consulting firm, which has produced Leadership and Self-Deception a book recommended in a 2018 CNBC article called \"Best Business Books Recommended by Bill Gates, Barack Obama and other successful people.\" The book focuses on seeing people as people rather than objects to overcome self-deception in the workplace.\nThe Arbinger Institute has two headquarters and more than 26 international partners.\n* U.S.A. / State of Utah\n* Germany / Hamburg\n* United Kingdom / Buckinghamshire\n* Sweden / Sweden\n* Israel / Israel\n* China / Shanghai\n* Korea / Seoul\n* Japan / Fukuoka\nPublications\n* Bonds That Make Us Free: Healing Our Relationships, Coming to Ourselves, Salt Lake City, UT: Shadow Mountain Press, 2001.\n* Oxford Papers, 1997.\n* The Possibility of Language: A Discussion of the Nature of Language, With Implications for Human and Machine Translation (Benjamins Translation Library, Vol 14) with Alan K.
