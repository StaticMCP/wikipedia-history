      "text": "# The Energi Danmark Champions Battle (Tennis Exhibition)\n\nThe Energi Danmark Champions Battle is a one-night tennis exhibition held each November since 2014. The event is held at the Jyske Bank Boxen in Herning, Denmark. In first two editions matches were played in front of a sold-out crowd of 7,000.\nThe event format is a women's singles match and men's doubles match played with active players. In singles, they compete in a best-of-three set match with regular scoring, which means ad scoring is included. In doubles, rules are as of a regular doubles match, meaning when it's one-set all Super-Tie Break is played, and scoring is no-ad.\nCaroline Wozniacki, the winner of second edition in 2015, received a Shamballa bracelet worth 100,000 Danish krones (just over $14,000).\nList of winners\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!Year\n!width=\"260\"|Champion\n!width=\"260\"|Runner-up\n!width=\"125\"|Score\n!width=\"60\"|Ref\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2014 ||  Ana Ivanovic ||  Serena Williams || 6–4, 6–4 ||\n|-\n| colspan=2| Robert Lindstedt &  Horia Tecau vs  Frederik Nielsen &  Jonathan Marray || ? ||\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2015 ||  Caroline Wozniacki ||  Serena Williams || 6–3, 6–4 ||\n|-\n|  Jean-Julien Rojer &  Horia Tecau ||  Frederik Nielsen &  Jonathan Marray || 6–4, 3–6, [10–5] ||\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2018 ||  Caroline Wozniacki ||  Venus Williams || 6–4, 6–3 ||\n|}\nReferences"
