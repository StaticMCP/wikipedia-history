      "text": "# 1989 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 1989 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 29th in the National Football League (NFL). They finished with a 10–6 record to win the NFC Central Division. This title was secured during one of what is considered by many to be among the most exciting Monday Night Football contests ever: a Christmas Day victory over the Cincinnati Bengals at home, at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which was the de facto first playoff game of the year. The Vikings were beaten 41–13 in the divisional round of the playoffs by the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers.\nThis season was also notable for the number of sacks the defense recorded: 71 overall, with 39 coming from only two players (Chris Doleman and Keith Millard). Millard was named the Defensive Player of the Year after putting up record numbers by a defensive tackle.\nOffseason\n1989 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1989 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1 || 24\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers ||\n|-\n! 2 || 52\n| David Braxton || Linebacker || Wake Forest ||\n|-\n! 3 || 80\n| John Hunter || Offensive tackle || BYU ||\n|-\n! 4 || 108\n| Darryl Ingram || Tight end || California ||\n|-\n! 5 || 136\n|colspan=\"3\"| Pick forfeited during 1988 supplemental draft ||\n|-\n! 6 || 163\n| Jeff Mickel || Offensive tackle || Eastern Washington ||\n|-\n! 7 || 191\n| Benji Roland || Defensive end || Auburn ||\n|-\n! 8 || 219\n| Alex Stewart || Defensive end || Cal State Fullerton ||\n|-\n! 9 || 247\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New England Patriots ||\n|-\n! 10 || 275\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Miami Dolphins ||\n|-\n! 11 || 303\n| Brad Baxter || Running back || Alabama State ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 12 || 331\n| Shawn Woodson || Linebacker || James Madison ||\n|-\n! 335\n| Everett Ross || Wide receiver || Ohio State || From 49ers, via Raiders\n|}\nNotes:\nUndrafted free agents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1989 undrafted free agents of note\n!Player\n!Position\n!College\n|-\n|Pat Beaty\n|Kicker\n|North Dakota\n|-\n|Robert Carter\n|Running back\n|Troy State\n|-\n|Jarrod Delaney\n|Wide receiver\n|TCU\n|-\n|Darrell Ellison\n|Linebacker\n|Tulsa\n|-\n|Devin Harberts\n|Wide receiver\n|Iowa\n|-\n|Ken Johnson\n|Defensive back\n|Florida A&M\n|-\n|Andy Keeler\n|Guard\n|Nebraska\n|-\n|Tony Peterson\n|Quarterback\n|Marshall\n|-\n|Everett Ross\n|Wide receiver\n|Ohio State\n|-\n|Pat Thompson\n|Punter\n|BYU\n|}\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n*  Reggie Rutland  CB\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This was judged to be one of the turning points in the rise of the Cowboys to the top echelon of the NFL. Walker's trade was widely perceived as an exceptionally poor move considering what the Vikings had to give up in order to get him, and remains one of the most frequently vilified roster moves of the team's history. The Vikings coaches reluctantly accepted Walker after the trade and never totally used the tool they had been given. Scout.com says, \"Walker was never used properly by the coaching brain trust (a total oxymoron in this case)\".\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Wade Wilson || 2,543\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Wade Wilson || 9\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Herschel Walker || 669\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || Herschel Walker || 5\n|-\n| Receiving yards || Anthony Carter || 1,066\n|-\n| Receiving touchdowns || Anthony Carter || 4\n|-\n| Points || Rich Karlis || 120\n|-\n| Kickoff return yards || Herschel Walker || 374\n|-\n| Punt return yards || Leo Lewis || 446\n|-\n| Tackles|| Chris Doleman  Henry Thomas || 94\n|-\n| Sacks || Chris Doleman || 21.0\n|-\n| Interceptions || Joey Browner || 5\n|-\n| Forced fumbles || Chris Doleman || 5\n|}\nLeague rankings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=100px style=\"\"| Total yards\n!width=110px style=\"\"| Yards per game\n!width=80px style=\"\"| NFL rank\n|-\n| Passing offense || 3,189 || 199.3 || 17th\n|-\n| Rushing offense || 2,066 || 129.1 || 7th\n|-\n!
