The college offers apprenticeships, full-time, and part-time further and higher education courses.\nHistory\nThe college began in 1910 as the Nuneaton Technical College and the Nuneaton School of Art, with the technical college catering mainly to mining students. In 1913, the college moved to a larger building containing a laboratory, lecture room, drawing room, and handicraft room, only for the college to close between 1914 and 1919 due to the First World War. When the college reopened after the war, it changed its structure to include general education courses. The college relocated again in 1923, becoming the County Mining and Technical School in 1932. The size and scope of the education offered progressed in the next two decades. In 1952 the art school was amalgamated with the college to form the Nuneaton Technical College and School of Art, and in 1958 the main campus was relocated to Hinckley Road, where it remains.\nThe college was subsequently renamed North Warwickshire College of Technology and Art until the merger with Hinckley College to become North Warwickshire and Hinckley College in 1996.\nSince the start of the academic year in 2017, North Warwickshire and Hinckley Colleges have merged with South Leicestershire College to form North Warwickshire and South Leicestershire College.\nCampus developments\n* New Hinckley Campus: In September 2011, the College opened a new Hinckley Campus located on Lower Bond Street in the town centre.
