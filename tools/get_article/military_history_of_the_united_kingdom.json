Scottish regiments and in particular Highland regiments, made a significant contribution to the military expansion, history and maintenance of the British Empire in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Royal navy in particular, with major bases in four Imperial fortresses and coaling stations surrounding the globe, was the world's greatest naval force from the 18th to the mid-20th century. British military declined in the mid-20th century as did those of the traditional European continental powers following the two world wars, decolonisation, and the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as the new superpowers. However, Britain remains a major military power with frequent military interventions around the world since the end of the Cold War in 1991. The present-day British Armed Forces encompass the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force.\nBritain has been involved in a great many armed conflicts since the union in 1707, on all continents except for Antarctica.\n18th century\n* War of the Spanish Succession (1702&ndash;13) - England and Scotland, later Great Britain, Holy Roman Empire, Portugal and the Dutch Republic, were allied against France and Spain.\n** Queen Anne's War (1702&ndash;13)\n*Jacobite Rebellions (1715&ndash;16; 1719; 1745&ndash;46) - Civil War\n** Clifton Moor Skirmish, near Penrith (1745) - last land battle in England\n** Battle of Culloden (1746) - last land battle in Britain.\n* War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718&ndash;20) - Great Britain, France, Austria and the Dutch Republic v.
