After the war, Japan was under American occupation, and India gained its independence on 15 August 1947. In 1951, the San Francisco Peace Conference was held, with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refusing to attend the conference, because he considered the provisions of the San Francisco System to limit Japanese sovereignty.\nSee also\n*Indian independence movement\n*Treaty of Peace with Japan\n*India–Japan relations\n*Japanese–Meitei cultural relations\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gwu.edu/~memory/data/treaties/India.pdf Treaty of Peace Between Japan and India] George Washington University\n*[http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~worldjpn/documents/texts/JPSA/19520609.T1J.html 日印平和条約（日本国とインドとの間の平和条約）] Tokyo University\n*[http://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/7012/Treaty_of_Peace Treaty of Peace between the Governments of India and Japan] Ministry of External Affairs, India\n* [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjasas1989/2005/17/2005_17_1/_pdf Hiroshi Sato, \"India-Japan Peace Treaty in Japan's Post-War Asian Diplomacy\" Journal of the Japanese Association for South Asian Studies, vol. 17(2005)]"
