The film was made by the low-budget Itala Film in Hollywood, primarily for release in Italian-speaking inhabitants of the United States. Shot as a silent with sound added later, it re-used footage from Noa's 1924 film Helen of Troy.\nIts complex background has led to it being classified variously as an American, German or Italian film.\nCast\n* Antonio Moray as Priam\n* Viola LaRosa as Helen\n* Franco Faris as Paris\n* Bernardo Camilli\n* Giuseppe Laroy\n* Carlo Borelli\n* Pietro Costo\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Winkler, Martin M (ed.).
