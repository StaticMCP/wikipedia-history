Woodward's parents mounted the first performances of Viktor Ullmann's opera Der Kaiser von Atlantis, which Ullmann composed while interned in a Nazi concentration camp. Woodward's family moved to Amsterdam when her father was appointed musical director of the Netherlands Chamber Choir.  Two years later her parents separated, and she moved with her mother and brother to New York City to live with her grandparents.\nRaised on classical and Middle Eastern music, Woodward studied piano and flute before receiving singing lessons at age 12. She attended high school in The Bronx and sang house music in her friends' basements. During summers she attended music camp and visited her father in the Netherlands, where she frequently locked herself in her father's studio and listened to jazz and R&B records. At the age of 16, Woodward was accepted to the Manhattan School of Music to study jazz, but after a year she decided to drop out to focus on songwriting and performing. She spent the next few years in swing organ trios, including The Sugarman 3, working as a session singer, a waitress, and singing jazz standards in restaurants in Greenwich Village.\nCareer\n]]\n]]\n]]\nIn 2003 Woodward signed with Atlantic Records and recorded her debut album While You Can, which entered the Top 150 on the Billboard 200. The album included Woodward's Top 40 hit \"Dumb Girls\", which she had written with producer Kevin Kadish before signing with Atlantic. Other songs on While You Can were produced at Jim Henson Studios by John Shanks. She toured internationally and appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\nDuring the following year, Woodward was asked by producer Jaime Houston to record the big-band tune \"It's Oh So Quiet\" for the Disney film Ice Princess; the song was later used in various TV shows, commercials, and the Birds of Prey trailer. The song was first recorded by Betty Hutton in 1948 and later covered by Björk on her 1995 album Post. Woodward considers it a turning point in her career and the inspiration for much of her second album, Lucy Woodward Is...Hot and Bothered. The album was released in 2008 and distributed exclusively by Barnes & Noble as part of its Discover Great New Music program. It was produced by Itaal Shur and Tim K. The song \"Hot and Bothered\" takes its melody from a Yiddish lullaby that Woodward's grandmother sang to her as a baby.

Originally called \"More to Life\", the song was written with Kevin Kadish and Sabelle Breer for Woodward's 2003 Atlantic debut but was released instead on the Japanese import version of the album as a bonus track.

Woodward wrote much of the album with Dan Petty and Michelle Lewis, saying that she had been inspired by the music of Peggy Lee and Django Reinhardt. The album also received comparisons to Dusty Springfield and Brill Building. The song \"Another Woman\" was written for her by longtime inspiration Nellie McKay, who sang background vocals.
