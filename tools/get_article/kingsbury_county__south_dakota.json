As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,187. Its county seat is De Smet. The county was created in 1873, and was organized in 1880. It was named for brothers George W. and T. A. Kingsbury, descendants of the colonial English Kingsbury family in Boston, Massachusetts. They were prominently involved in the affairs of Dakota Territory and served as elected members of several Territorial Legislatures.\nHistory\nJohn C. Fremont surveyed the area in 1838, naming lakes Preston and Albert. The 1851 Treaty of Mendota with the Santee Sioux and the 1858 Yankton Treaty ceded the region for American settlement. American presence was minimal until the Dakota Boom, with the notable exception of Jacob Hanson's settlement at Lake Albert in 1873.\nSettlement surged in 1879 with the Chicago & North Western Railroad’s extension to De Smet. Kingsbury County was created in 1873, named for territorial legislators George W. and T. A. Kingsbury and was organized on December 13, 1879 with De Smet as the county seat. Settlements at Lake Preston, Arlington, and Iroquois grew rapidly, driven by the railroad and fertile prairie lands. By 1880, the county’s population reached 1,234.\nAgriculture, particularly corn and wheat, anchored early economic growth, with towns like Lake Preston boasting mills and newspapers by 1881. De Smet gained fame as the setting for Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House series, including The Long Winter and Little Town on the Prairie, chronicling her family’s life there from 1879.\nGeography\nThe terrain of Kingsbury County consists of low rolling hills. The central and east portions of the county hold numerous lakes and ponds. The land is largely devoted to agriculture. The terrain generally slopes to the southwest, and the highest point is near the midpoint of the east boundary line, at  ASL. The county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (6.2%) is water.\nLakes\nSource:\n* Cherry Lake\n* Mud Lake\n* Lake Albert\n* Lake Badger\n* Lake Henry\n* Lake Iroquois\n* Lake Preston\n* Lake Thisted\n* Lake Thompson\n* Lake Whitewood\n* Osceola Lake\n* Plum Lake\n* Spring Lake\n* Spirit Lake\n* Twin Lakes (partial)\nMajor highways\n* 20px U.S. Highway 14\n* 20px U.S. Highway 81\n* 20px South Dakota Highway 25\nAdjacent counties\n* Hamlin County – northeast\n* Brookings County – east\n* Lake County – southeast\n* Miner County – south\n* Sanborn County – southwest\n* Beadle County – west\n* Clark County – northwest\nProtected areas\n* Arnold State Public Shooting Area\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010–2020\n}}\n2020 census\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 5,187 people, 2,191 households, and 1,398 families residing in the county.
