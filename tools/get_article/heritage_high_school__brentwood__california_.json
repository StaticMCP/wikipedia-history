Its colors are gold, Columbia blue, and white, and its mascot is the Patriot. It was recently credited with the six-year status highest API score in the district.\nHistory\nIn 2003, bids were taken for the construction of the school.\nThe school grew every year until it reached the capacity of all four classes (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior) in 2008. The Heritage High School class of 2008 was the highest grade each year it was at Heritage, and was its first graduating class.\nIn 2012, the school became the first school in the district to ban the use of social media in school campaigns due to adverse social effects.\nIn 2012, more than 50 students were suspended for a prank involving a lamb and washable paint.\nIn 2013, a large number of students and spectators required medical treatment due to extreme heat at the graduation ceremony.\nIn 2014, the school created an innovative program combining art and technology.\nSLCs\nThe school is separated into four Small Learning Communities (SLCs), SLC-A1, SLC-A2, SLC-B, SLC-C, and SLC-D. SLC-A and SLC-D were the only SLCs open the first year of school, but the second school year saw the beginning of SLC-B, with SLC-C being partially used for PE teachers, and by 2007 it was being used completely. The Class of 2008 was the first class to graduate from Heritage High School, and the Class of 2009 was the first to have attended Heritage for all four years.\nAs of 2019, all four SLCs are being used and have been staffed with assistant principals.\nAthletics\nThe school is home to sports teams called the Patriots.
