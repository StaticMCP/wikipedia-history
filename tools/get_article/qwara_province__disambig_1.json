More importantly, it formed part of the territories of the warlord Dejazmach Meru, who had inherited the office of governor of Qwara from his uncle, Qeñazmach Kebte; these territories, known as Ye Meru Qemas (literally, \"The mouth of Meru\", or \"What Meru eats\") were inherited by Dejazmach Kinfu. In Qwara, was born Kinfu's relation, Kassa Hailu, who later used Kinfu's relationships in Qwara to build a power base there in his successful effort that made him Emperor \"Tewodros the Quaregna\" who was born in Qwara.\nII. The future Emperor made Qwara his base from the Battle of Koso Bar until his victory at the Battle of Gur Amba (27 September 1852), sometimes as a shifta, or outlaw.\nNotes"
