He went up to King's College, Cambridge in 1924.\nCareer\nMorris became a fellow of King's by dissertation. He stayed with the college until his retirement in 1971. His first specialism was in Tudor and Stuart constitutional history and he later taught the standard course on political thought from Plato to Rousseau. He was known for his range and his ability to produce a paper on a given subject with ease. He was also noted for his interest in his students.\nHe edited The Journeys of Celia Fiennes (1947). His survey, Political Thought in England: Tyndale to Hooker (1953), argued that political thought in the Tudor age was still largely medieval and that actors subordinated the state to society. Geoffrey Elton, who agreed, described the book in England under the Tudors (1955) as a \"brilliant summary\".\nMorris began a history of western political thought but only completed volume 1 (Plato to Augustine, 1967), being overtaken, according to The Independent, by new thinking that left his liberal approach looking outdated.\nPersonal life\nMorris married Helen Soutar in 1933. The couple had a daughter and a son. Their son pre-deceased them.\nDeath\nMorris died in Cambridge on 16 February 1993.\nSelected publications\n*The Journeys of Celia Fiennes.
