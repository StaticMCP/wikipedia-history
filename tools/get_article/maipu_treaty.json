The main purposes of it are to restore a railway connection between both countries, across the Andes mountain range, and a tunnel that goes through it at ground level. The project intends as well to allow 6 more crossings at other points of the Andes, and to facilitate the work of the Customs operations.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706084252/http://www.amersur.org.ar/Integ/TratadoDeMAIPU.pdf Text of the treaty]"
