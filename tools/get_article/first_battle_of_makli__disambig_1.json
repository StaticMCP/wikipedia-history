During Karīm Dād's time, Jam Bajar rose to power. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhora fully supported Bajar in the killing of Rano Arjun. Following this incident, the Kalhoras transferred the tribal leadership to Bajar. Rano Arjun was associated with the Nagamars (Rano) and had strong ties of friendship with the Kalmat Baloch chiefs. Many of the Nagamars in Rano's forces were Kalmat warriors. The Kalmat (or Karmat) tribe ruled Hub, Malir, and Sakro as their domains. They were granted lands by Emperor Aurangzeb. After the decline of the Mughals, in 1150 AH (1737 CE), when Thatta came under the control of Mian Noor Muhammad Kalhora, the new regime sought to consolidate power by negotiating with local tribal chiefs. For those who resisted, the Kalhoras launched military campaigns or applied political pressure.\nTo weaken the Kalmat’s dominance over Hub, Malir, and Sakro, the Kalhoras sent an army from Khudaabad. The Kalmat tribe, led by Nauzak Khan’s sons, stood firm in this campaign. Their mother, Mai Izzat, is remembered for her role during this period. While the Kalmat tribe managed to defend Malir, the Jokhios, under Jam Bajar, had the backing of the Kalhoras.\nThe Battle\nIn this first battle, Jam Bajar Jokhio led the Jokhio forces, while young Mir Mazar Khan commanded the Kalmat Baloch. Though Mir Mazar Khan was injured during the fighting, the Kalmat Baloch emerged victorious, defeating the Jokhio tribe.\nAftermath\nAfter the First Battle of Makli, enmity arose between the tribes.\nSee also\n* Second Battle of Makli\nReferences"
