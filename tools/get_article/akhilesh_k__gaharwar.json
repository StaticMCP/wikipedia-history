Gaharwar (born 3 January 1982, Nagpur, India) is an Indian academic and a professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Texas A&M University.\nEducation and work\nGaharwar completed his postdoctoral training with Robert Langer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ali Khademhosseini at Harvard University. He received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Purdue University, Master in Technology (M.Tech.) from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology.\nGaharwar's research experience spans diverse fields, including materials science, chemistry, biology, data science, genomics and bioengineering. His research program integrates biomaterials, regenerative medicine, drug delivery, and additive manufacturing for the development of functional living tissues.\nGaharwar has published more than 150 journal articles, multiple-issued/pending patents, has an H-index of 74. In addition, he also edited biomedical textbook entitled \"Nanomaterials in Tissue Engineering: Fabrication and Applications\". Gaharwar has published extensively in the area of biomaterials, bioprinting, tissue engineering, and stem cell bioengineering.\nGaharwar's research accomplishments are recognized by numerous national and international awards, including the NIH New Innovator Award (DP2), Texas A&M University President Impact Fellow, Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) Rising Star Award, Chemical communications Emerging Investigator, CMBE Young Innovator Award, and Dimitris Chorafas Foundation Award. Before the age of 40, Dr. Gaharwar was recognized as a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE), an honor reserved for the top 2% biomedical engineers in the world. He is also an election as a Fellow of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES). He is an Associate Editor of ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, as well as on the editorial board member of Regenerative Biomaterials, Bioprinting, Advanced NanoBiomed Research, and Bio-Design and Manufacturing.\nAwards\n*\t2023 Fellow of Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)(Oct 2023)\n*\t2023 Senior Member of National Academy of Inventors (NAI)(March 2023)\n*\t2022 Fellow of American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE)(March 2022)\n*\t2021 Texas A&M University Presidential Impact Fellow (Nov 2021)\n*\t2018 Rising Star Award by Cellular & Molecular Bioengineering Special Interest Group of Biomedical Engineering Society (Jan 2018)\n*\t2018 Langmuir Early Career Authors in Fundamental Colloid and Interface Science (Jan 2018)\n*\t2017 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's New Innovator Award (DP2) by National Institute of Health (Oct 2017)\n*\t2011 Biomedical Engineering Society Graduate Award\n*\t2011 Materials Research Society Graduate Student Award - Silver\nReferences"
