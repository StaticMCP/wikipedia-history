Originally a boarding school and grammar school, the secular college is selective and noted for its German Renaissance architecture, academic performance and alumni representation in sports, politics and science in Trinidad and Tobago and globally.\nHistory\nThe origin of QRC goes back to the Stuart Grammar School, at the corner of Duke and Edward Street in Port of Spain, whose Principal was Edward Stuart. In 1859, when a new \"collegiate school\" was being contemplated, Stuart was invited by the colonial government to be part of the enterprise. The Queen's Collegiate School opened later that year opposite what is now Lord Harris Square, then known as Billiards Orchard. QRC was originally a fee paying (British public school American private) school and was expressly secular.\nThe intention was, as Governor Arthur Hamilton-Gordon told the Legislative Council in 1870, \"that its advantages should be open to those of every race and every religion, and that the education given should be of a decidedly superior character.\"\nIn 1870, the school became the Queen's Royal College and was housed in the supper room of the Prince's Building.\nWhen the Government Farm moved from St Clair in 1899, part of the land was reserved as a new home for QRC through the intervention of acting Governor Sir Micah Fields.\nThe school, referred to in those days as Royal College, had 120 pupils, who did not wear a uniform but had to wear a hat or cap bearing the college crest. They learned algebra, geometry, arithmetic, Latin, French, English, geography, history and Greek or Spanish.\nToday in Queen's Royal College uniforms are worn, and QRC projects and involvements usually involve a blue theme, due to the uniform of blue shirt jack and long khaki pants. In 2009, the school implemented a new dress uniform for formal occasions.\nIts principal is David Simon.\nArchitecture and history of the main block\nThe foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1902 by Courtney Knollys, who was the acting Governor of the day. The structure was designed by Daniel M. Hahn, who was Chief Draughtsman of the Public Work Department and an Old Boy of Queen's Royal College, during the period when the school was housed at the Princess Building. He is also noted for designing the nations Parliament building the Red House. The architecture of the building is German Renaissance in style, evident by the solid appearance. Constructed at a cost of 15000 British pounds, 1,845,000.00 British pounds adjusted for inflation, the original building accommodated six classes for 30 boys each. The lecture hall could hold over five hundred persons at a time.\nGeneral information\nThe main building itself is one of the Magnificent Seven, a group of historic buildings built in the early 1900s. The North and South buildings, known as the North Block and Science Block respectively, were built during the late 1930s. The school has its own pavilion and canteen, both located on the edge of its field, used in all seasons for various sports.\nClasses\nWest Block of Queen's Royal College 2007, Port of Spain|alt=West Block of Queen's Royal College 2007, Port of Spain|thumb\nQueen's Royal College, as a secondary school in Trinidad & Tobago consists of classes from Form One through Form Six. The school can be termed a \"seven-year\" school but qualification into Form Six is based on the student's performance at the CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) examinations. Classes are categorized by name according to the word \"ROYAL\" but now excludes the letter \"A\", which was used for an accelerated class to what was then the GCE O-Level that students sat after four years rather than the usual five. Form One consists of three classes, 1R, 1O and 1Y whereas, Forms 2 through 5 consists of xR, xO, xY and xL where x represents the class number. All students in each class from forms 2–upper 6 are in the same school house. External students can also gain access into the Sixth Form Level based on their qualifications and other academic factors. On average, up to ten external students enter the Sixth Form level per year.\nSubjects offered at Form Six level\nThe following subjects apply to both Lower Six (year one) and Upper Six (year two). Subjects are usually divided into Unit 1 and Unit 2 with the exclusion of Caribbean Studies which is usually assigned to the first year in Form Six or Lower Six and Communication Studies to the second year in Form Six or Upper Six. All subjects are of the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE) format and students are allowed to do a minimum of four subjects, but exceptions are sometimes accepted.\nAs of July 2012\n;BUSINESS STUDIES\n* Accounting\n* Economics\n* Management of Business (Business Studies or M.O.B)\n;MODERN STUDIES\n* Art and Design\n* French\n* History\n* Literature in English\n* Sociology (offered as a Modern subject although it is a Science)\n* Spanish\n;SCIENCE STUDIES\n* Biology\n* Chemistry\n* Geography\n* Physics\n* Pure Mathematics\n* Applied Mathematics\n;COMPULSORY SUBJECTS\n* Caribbean Studies\n* Communication Studies\nNotable alumni\n* Clive Abdulah (b. 1927), former Bishop of Trinidad\n* Lloyd Best (1934–2007), economist, essayist, politician, scholar.
