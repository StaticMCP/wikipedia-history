The electoral college was elected in 1852 and subsequently elected the president in March 1853.\nThe Liberal Party, then in power under General José Hilario López after winning the Colombian Civil War of 1851, was assured of victory. Its official candidate General José María Obando had little difficulty winning the election, with his only significant rival being his fellow Liberal Tomás Herrera, who was mainly supported by the Panamanian regionalist movement. The election victory was achieved with a pact of unity between the two factions of Liberalism, the Golgothians (radicals) and the Draconians (moderates).\nResults\nElectoral college\n|votes7=4\n|cand8=Juan de Francisco Martín|votes8=3\n|cand9=|votes9=2\n|cand10=Joaquín París Ricaurte|votes10=2\n|cand11=Evaristo Azuero|votes11=1\n|cand12=|votes12=1\n|cand13=Manuel Murillo Turo|votes13=1\n|cand14=Antonino Olano|votes14=1\n|cand15=Juan Clímaco Ordóñez|votes15=1\n|cand16=José de Jesús Quijano|votes16=1\n|cand17=Venancio Restrepo|votes17=1\n|cand18=Manuel Urquinaona|votes18=1\n|cand19=J.M.O.|votes19=1\n|row20=Blank votes|votes20=43\n|source=Historia electoral colombiana\n}}\nReferences"
