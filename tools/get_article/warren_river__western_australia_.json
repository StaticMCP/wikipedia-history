The river was named\nby Governor James Stirling, probably after Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren under whom Stirling served whilst in action in North America in 1813.\nHistory\nThe river was encountered in 1831 by Lieutenant William Preston RN, first of the Success, then of the Sulphur. Preston was in charge of a boat survey of the south-west coast from Albany to Fremantle. The boat was wrecked near Green Point and Preston and his crew were forced to make the first land journey from Albany to Fremantle, along the coast. Preston was a brother-in-law of Governor Stirling.\nThe first settler on the Warren was Edward Reveley Brockman, who in 1862, established Warren House homestead and station on the banks of the river.\nGeography\nThe river rises in the Tone State Forest west of Strachan,  south-east of Manjimup. From the confluence of the Tone and Perup Rivers (at Murtinup) it flows  in a south-westerly direction crossing the South Western Highway and then through the Warren State Forest, the Greater Hawke and D'Entrecasteaux National Parks and the Dombakup Nature Reserve, finally discharging into the Southern Ocean near Coolyarbup.\nThe Warren is a medium-sized river originating in medium rainfall marri/wandoo woodlands, flowing through jarrah/marri forest and high rainfall karri country to the coast. It is the second largest river by streamflow in the Busselton-Walpole region. Tributaries of the Warren River include the Perup, Yerraminnup, Wilgarup and Tone rivers, and Quinninup, Lefroy and Dombakup brooks.\nSalinity\nPrior to vegetation clearing for agriculture, salinity was recorded as approximately 120–350&nbsp;mg/L, where\nReferences"
