It takes place 14 years after Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005) and progresses toward the events of the original film (1977). It depicts the Galactic Empire hunting down the last of the Jedi while a fledgling rebellion against the Empire emerges. The visual style of the series is inspired by the original Star Wars trilogy concept art by Ralph McQuarrie. The series features new characters, along with some from the original trilogy and from the previous animated series, Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–14; 2020). The series comprises four seasons.\nThe series premiered as a one-hour television film, Spark of Rebellion, on October 3, 2014, on Disney Channel prior to the premiere of the series on October 13 on Disney XD. The second season premiered on June 20, 2015, with a one-hour television film, The Siege of Lothal. The third season premiered on September 24, 2016, with the television film, Steps Into Shadow. The fourth and final season premiered on October 16, 2017, with another one-hour television film, Heroes of Mandalore. Its final episode aired on March 5, 2018.\nDave Filoni, Simon Kinberg, and Greg Weisman served as executive producers of the first season. Weisman left the show after the first season. Filoni was also the supervising director for the first two seasons, a role he relinquished after accepting a promotion that expanded his creative role into overseeing all Lucasfilm Animation projects; he chose Justin Ridge to succeed him for the third season. Filoni re-assumed the role for the fourth season.\nRebels has been generally well-received with several award wins and nominations. The show was nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Animated Series and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program. Rebels became the first recipient of the Saturn Award for Best Animated Series on Television, winning for its final two seasons.\nA number of tie-in media have been released to expand upon the series' lore such as the comic book series Kanan, the novel A New Dawn, and the novel series Thrawn. Characters, storylines, and elements introduced in the series would also appear in subsequent Star Wars media. The series' storyline continues in the Disney+ live-action series Ahsoka.\nPremise\nFourteen years after the fall of both the Galactic Republic and the Jedi Order and the rise of the Galactic Empire, a motley group of rebels called the Spectres unite aboard a light freighter called the Ghost and begin to conduct covert operations against Imperial forces on and around the planet Lothal and on other planets that are menaced by the Empire.\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Taylor Gray as Ezra Bridger, a teenage street kid who is taken in by Kanan to be trained as a Jedi\n* Vanessa Marshall as Hera Syndulla, a Twi'lek pilot turned Rebel Commander (later General) and the daughter of Ryloth freedom fighter Cham Syndulla.\n* Freddie Prinze Jr. as Kanan Jarrus, formerly known as Jedi Padawan Caleb Dume, who survived the events of Order 66.

Star Wars writers have often used biblical names for Jedi while giving galactic Imperial characters Roman names. In 2015 an interview was conducted with Dave Filoni and Simon Kinberg where Kinsberg stated that they wanted to connect to the original films by using the biblical naming scheme seen in the films. Both Caleb and Ezra are historically Hebrew names, with Ezra translating to \"helper\". Characters with Roman names include Clone Captain Rex which translates to \"King\" in Latin (although that character was created for The Clone Wars) along with Sabine Wren, Admiral Brom Titus and Admiral Kassius Konstantine.\nSee also\n* 2015 in science fiction\nReferences\nFootnotes\nCitations\nPrint sources\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
