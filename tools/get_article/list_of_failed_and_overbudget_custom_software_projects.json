In some cases, problems may be due partly to problems with the purchasing organisation, including poor requirements, over-ambitious requirements, unnecessary requirements, poor contract drafting, poor contract management, poor end-user training, or poor operational management.\nPermanent failures\nBecause software, unlike a major civil engineering construction project, is often easy and cheap to change after it has been constructed, a piece of custom software that fails to deliver on its objectives may sometimes be modified over time in such a way that it later succeeds—and/or business processes or end-user mindsets may change to accommodate the software. However, sometimes, for various reasons, neither approach succeeds (or is even tried), and this may be considered as another level of failure—a permanent failure.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"width: auto\"\n|-\n!

In the next audit in 2016, the Auditor General of Ontario noted that 14 years after Smart Systems for Health was started, not all of the eHealth projects were complete, and it was impossible to even determine if they were overbudget because the government had never originally put a budget on them.\n|Can$8bn (unknown)\n|In-house, but with heavy use of consultants\n|-\n|2013\n|HealthCare.gov\n|Healthcare exchange website\n|\n|Federal government\n|By some estimates, only 1% of people managed to successfully enroll with the site in its first week of operation.

In 2012 troubles with supply of spare parts was reported, causing multiple Gripen fighter jets to be put out of service. The air force was operating at a 70% capacity, another area was reported to operate at a 3% capacity with half of the staff not able to work at all. It would take up to a year to restore capacity. At this point the cost to scrap the project and develop a new one was estimated to be SEK 11bn ($1.3bn). Not seen as an alternative, the development continued and the original budget of SEK 2.4bn was increased to 4bn. In 2015 the project was still on its way to be fully implemented.\n| SEK 4bn ($470m) (ongoing)\n| Technical aspects outsourced\n|-\n| 2013\n| Universal Credit\n| Welfare payments system consolidation\n|\n| Central government\n| The schedule has slipped, with the final delivery date now expected to be 2021, although the system is gradually being introduced.

A significant portion of this spend was composed of contracting fees to IBM and Fujitsu. As of early 2016, business take up of electronic reporting was 2-3%. Program has also suffered from significant scope creep and confused objectives. It is likely that choice of XBRL as the reporting format is the main driver behind low take-up (due to its obscurity and high implementation cost  relative to other technical standards).\n| ~$1bn to date (ongoing)\n| Technical aspects outsourced\n|}\nSee also\n* Software crisis\n* Vaporware\n* Agile software development\n* Government waste\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/risks The Risks Digest]\n*\n* [http://www.iiitech.com/advisor/SAP-Project-Implementation-Best-Practices.php Best Practices and Measures for Success of your ERP IT Software Projects]"
