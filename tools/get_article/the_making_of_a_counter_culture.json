      "text": "# The Making of a Counter Culture\n\nThe Making of a Counter Culture: Reflections on the Technocratic Society and Its Youthful Opposition is a work of non-fiction by Theodore Roszak originally published by Doubleday &  Co. in 1969.\nRoszak \"first came to public prominence in 1969, with the publication of his The Making of a Counterculture\" which chronicled and gave explanation to the European and North American counterculture of the 1960s. The term \"counterculture\" was first used by Roszak in this book.\nThe Making of a Counter Culture \"captured a huge audience of Vietnam War protesters, dropouts, and rebels--and their baffled elders. Theodore Roszak found common ground between 1960s student radicals and hippie dropouts in their mutual rejection of what he calls the technocracy--the regime of corporate and technological expertise that dominates industrial society. He traces the intellectual underpinnings of the two groups in the writings of Herbert Marcuse and Norman O. Brown, Allen Ginsberg and Paul Goodman.\"\nFurther reading\n*Crouch, Colin. \"Book Review: The Making of a Counter Culture; The Youth Culture, and The Universities.\" Sociology, 1971:5, 123.\n*Kirk, Jerome. \"Book Review: The Making of a Counter Culture.\" The American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 75, No. 5, March 1970: 893-6.\n*Wassen, Richard. \"Book Review: The Making of a Counter Culture Hi.\" College English, Vol. 31, No. 6, March 1970: 624–628.\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=5FAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 Life review]\n* Birnbaum, Norman. \"Review: The Making of a Counter Culture\" The Massachusetts Review Vol. 11 No. 1, 1970: 197–201.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
