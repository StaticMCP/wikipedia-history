It was a time of multiple crises for the Weimar Republic. Hyperinflation, fueled by the policy of passive resistance towards the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, was at its peak, and parties on the extreme left and right had taken over or joined the governments in Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia.\nDuring its brief three months in office, the Great Coalition ended the passive resistance against the Ruhr occupation, successfully stabilized the currency by replacing the worthless Papiermark with the Rentenmark and expelled the German Communist Party from the governments of Saxony and Thuringia by means of a Reichsexekution.\nIn part due to the latter move, the SPD withdrew from the Great Coalition in November 1923 and brought down the Stresemann government.\nThe second cabinet of Hermann Müller (28 June 1928 – 27 March 1930) could also be considered a Great Coalition. In addition to the other four parties, it included the Catholic Bavarian People's Party, which had historical ties to the Centre Party.\nSee also\n* Grand coalition (Germany)\n* Weimar Coalition\nReferences"
