It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for Business and Trade (DBT).\nThe BHC was created under the Hallmarking Act 1973 (c. 43) to oversee the activities of the four remaining assay offices (located in London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh). The costs of its operations are met entirely by the four offices.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/british-hallmarking-council British Hallmarking Council website]"
