In 1965, it was renamed St Therese’s School. As suburban development increased around Edmonton, the rising number of students made it necessary to relocate the school to neighbouring Bentley Park in 1995. Although now under lay leadership, the school continues to be operated in the Mercy tradition.\nBentley Park State School was originally opened in 1997. In 2004, the construction of secondary school facilities made it a P-12 school called Bentley Park College.\nDemographics\nIn the , Bentley Park had a population of 7,420 people.\nIn the , Bentley Park had a population of 8,018 people.\nIn the , Bentley Park had a population of 8,360 people.\nEducation\nSt Therese's School is a Catholic primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 135 Robert Road ().
