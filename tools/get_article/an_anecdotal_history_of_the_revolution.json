Feng was very dissatisfied with this status quo, and he thought that this was the key to the survival of the Republic of China, thus, in 1936, he began to write the Unofficial History of the Revolution, which was not fully completed until 1948.\nAn Anecdotal History of the Revolution was first published in 1936, but the volumes were not all published at one time. The first volume was published by the Shanghai Commercial Press in 1939, the second in 1943, the third in 1945, the fourth in 1946, and the fifth in 1947. Due to changes in the political situation, the sixth was published in 1981.\nReferences"
