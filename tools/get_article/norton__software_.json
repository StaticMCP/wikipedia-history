It is now used by the American company Gen Digital (formerly Symantec and NortonLifeLock) for some of its software.\nNorton was originally a suite of utility software for IBM DOS, expanded into user guides for IBM DOS and then utilities and guides for Microsoft DOS in 1982, and eventually Microsoft Windows. After acquiring Norton Computing in 1989, Symantec merged their anti-virus software into the Norton package and rebranded it as Norton AntiVirus which was released in 1991.\nIn 2014 Symantec separated their business into two units. One was focused on security, and the other was focused on information management; Norton was placed in the unit focused on security. Symantec was renamed to NortonLifeLock in 2019 following Broadcom’s acquisition of its enterprise division.\nAs of 2022, Norton is a consumer cybersecurity brand of Gen Digital, the parent company formed following the merger between NortonLifeLock and Avast. It currently covers a variety of products and services related to digital security, identity protection, and online privacy and utilities.\nHistory\nPeter Norton Computing was a software company founded by Peter Norton. Norton and his company developed various DOS utilities including the Norton Utilities which originally did not include antivirus features.\nThe company was acquired by Symantec in 1990. Symantec's consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name.\nIn early 1991 Symantec's Norton Computer Group launched Norton AntiVirus 1.0 for computers. The company updated and diversified its product line until combining its offerings into one seamless product, Norton Security. Ads for the product, with suggested retail $129, featured Norton in his crossed-arm pose from the user guides, wearing a pink shirt and surgical mask covering his nose and mouth.\nIn the 1990s, Norton provided software to check computer systems for Y2K compliance. In 2019, Symantec was renamed to NortonLifeLock following Broadcom’s acquisition of its enterprise division, leading to the combination of the Norton 360 suite with the LifeLock identity threat protection offering, which was purchased by Symantec in 2017.\nIn 2019, Norton 360 was reintroduced, replacing Norton Security and adding privacy features, including a VPN service and identity theft protection services alongside its traditional antivirus features.\nProducts and services\nNorton's products are primarily digital security tools for personal computers, server devices and mobile devices. It is currently compatible with PCs running Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11, macOS, and since 2011, Android and iOS, and is available as an annual subscription.\nNorton software is licensed to consumers. The brand's primary product is Norton 360, available in multiple editions. Norton 360 Standard Edition includes real-time threat protection, Norton's Secure VPN, cloud backup, a password manager, and a smart firewall. A mobile version of the software is also available. Norton 360 Deluxe and Norton 360 Advanced editions also add parental controls and digital identity features including dark web monitoring for leaks of personal information.\nNorton also offers its traditional antivirus software, Norton AntiVirus Plus, as a standalone service, as well as separate subscriptions for Norton AntiTrack, Norton Secure VPN, and Norton Identity Advisor Plus. Other products, including PC tune-up and optimization software (Norton Utilities), are also available as separate offerings.\nIn January 2022, several users brought to light an issue with a hidden backdoor crypto-mining tool in the Norton 360 security software suite. Following the report in media Norton highlighted the procedure for uninstalling the product from their computer.\nAwards\n* 2022 - Norton 360 was awarded Best Protection (Windows), Best Android Security Product, and Best MacOS Security Product by AV-TEST\n* 2022 - Norton 360 was won AV-Comparatives's Gold Award for Malware Protection\n* 2023 - SE Labs recognized Norton 360 as the Best Home Anti-Malware Solution in their annual report.\n* In November 2023, Norton 360 Deluxe maintained the PCMag Editors’ Choice award and “Excellent” rating.\nLogos\nFile:Norton 1989.svg|1990-2001\nFile:Norton (2001).svg|2001-2007\nFile:Norton logo 2007.svg|2007-2010\nFile:Norton av logo.png|2010-2019\nFile:Nortonn.png|2019-2021\nFile:Norton Logo (November 2021).png|2021-present\nSee also\n* Comparison of antivirus software\n* Gen Digital\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
