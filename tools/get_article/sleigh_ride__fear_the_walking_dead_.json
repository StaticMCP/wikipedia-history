Proctor John arrives at the dam with Alicia, displeased that Strand wasn't fully able to deliver on their deal; Alicia bargains for Madison's safety. Strand is helping Madison and Nick escape when Lola attacks the Proctors and is killed. For their duplicity John decides to kill all four, starting with Alicia as a mercy. Nick uses the detonator in a standoff, threatening to blow up the dam. Madison, Alicia and Strand escape on a boat. The Proctors begin to move on Nick who receives unexpected help from Walker and Crazy Dog who snipe from a nearby hilltop and Daniel who fights his way across the dam. Nick detonates the explosives, blowing a hole in the dam and the boat is carried through by the current. Nick and Daniel escape while Madison swims to shore alone.\nProduction\nThis is the last episode for a departing Dave Erickson as a showrunner.
