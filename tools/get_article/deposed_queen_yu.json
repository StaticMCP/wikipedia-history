She was queen consort of Joseon from 1608 until her husband's deposition in 1623, after which she was known as Deposed Queen Yu.\nBiography\nEarly life\nThe future queen was born on 15 August 1576 during the reign of King Seonjo. Her father, Yu Ja-shin, was member of the Munhwa Yu clan, and her mother, Jeong Yang-jeong, was a member of the Dongrae Jeong clan. Lady Yu was the third daughter and eighth child within ten siblings.\nThrough her ancestors, her family had some distant relations with the royal family. Through her mother, Lady Yu was a 4th great-granddaughter of King Jeongjong and Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Haengju Ki clan. Through her father, she was also a 5th great-granddaughter of King Jeongjong and Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Chungju Ji clan. Thus making her parents fifth cousins once removed with one another.\nThrough her paternal grandmother, her great-great-great-grandfather was Chŏng Inji, and was a first cousin once removed of Queen Inseon, her future niece-in-law and the future Queen Consort of King Hyojong. Her paternal grandmother was also the younger cousin of Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong, the mother of King Seonjo. Thus making her second cousins with her future father-in-law and second cousins once removed with her future husband.\nThrough her paternal great-grandmother, Lady Yu was the 4th great-grandniece of Queen Soheon and the 5th great-granddaughter of Sim On.\nMarriage, Deposition, and Death\nAt the age of 11 in 1587, she was selected to become the consort of Yi Hon, Prince Gwanghae, son of Seonjo, born to Kim Gongbin, senior 1st rank king's concubine. As Gwanghae's wife, she was given the royal title of Princess Consort Munseong (문성군부인, Munseong Gunbuin). When Gwanghae became the crown prince in 1592, she was elevated to the crown princess' rank at the age of 16. 16 years later, Gwanghae ascended to the throne as the fifteenth Joseon king in 1608 and she became queen consort.\nThe queen's father was given the title Internal Prince Munyang (). The queen's mother was given the title Internal Princess Consort Bongwon ().\nOn April 6, 1623, Gwanghaegun was deposed in a coup by the Westerners faction. The coup directed by Kim Yu took place at night. The King fled but was captured later. His nephew, Injo, was placed on the throne as the 16th Joseon monarch. As deposed king's wife, she lost her status as queen consort and known as Deposed Queen Yu. She was deposed and exiled to Ganghwa Island, together with Gwanghae. Her son, Yi Ji, the deposed Crown Prince, tried to escape with his wife but failed, resulting in them committing suicide. Deposed Queen Yu died on October 21 that the same year after seven months of living in exile.\nThere was no known tomb for Deposed Queen Yu as she was buried nearby a waste house but her remains could not be found when she was due for a proper burial. But she is \"buried\" in Jeokseong, Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.\nFamily\nParent\n* Father − Yu Ja-shin (; December 1541 – 7 February 1612)\n* Mother\n** Step - Lady Go ()\n** Biological - Jeong Yang-jeong, Internal Princess Consort Bongwon of the Dongrae Jeong clan (; 1541–1620)\nSiblings\n* Older brother − Yu Hui-kaeng (; 1561–1643)\n* Older brother − Yu Hui-dam (; 1563–1614)\n* Older brother − Yu Hui-bun (; 1564–1623)\n* Older brother − Yu Hui-bal (; 1566–1623)\n* Older sister − Yu Ok-yeong, Lady Yu of the Munhwa Yu clan (; 1567–?)\n* Older brother - Yu Deok-shin (; 1568–?)\n* Older sister − Yu Jung-yeong, Lady Yu of the Munhwa Yu clan ()\n*Older brother − Yu Hui-ryang (; 1575–1628)\n* Younger sister − Yu So-yeong, Lady Yu of the Munhwa Yu clan ()\n* Younger brother − Yu Hui-an (; 1581–1638)\nConsort\n* Yi Hon, King Gwanghae (; 4 June 1575 – 7 August 1641)\n** Father-in-law - Yi Yeon, King Seonjo of Joseon (; 6 December 1552 – 6 March 1608)\n** Mother-in-law - Royal Noble Consort Gong of the Gimhae Kim clan (; 26 November 1553 – 23 June 1577)\n** Legal mother-in-law - Queen Uiin of the Bannam Park clan (; 15 May 1555 – 26 July 1600)\n** Legal mother-in-law - Queen Inmok of the Yonan Kim clan (5 December 1584 – 3 August 1632)\nIssue\n* Unnamed child (1592)\n* First son (1596–1596)\n*Son − Deposed Crown Prince Yi Ji (; 31 December 1598 – 22 July 1623)\n**Daughter-in-law − Deposed Crown Princess Consort Park of the Miryang Park clan (; 1598 – May 1623)\n***Unnamed granddaughter (; 1614–1614)\n*Third son (1601–1603)\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Jang Seo-hee in the 1995 KBS2 TV Series West Palace.\n*Portrayed by Sa Kang in the 2003–2004 SBS TV series ''King's Woman.\n*Portrayed by Han Hyo-joo in the 2012 movie Masquerade.\n*Portrayed by Lee Si-a in the 2013 MBC TV series Hur Jun, The Original Story.\n*Portrayed by Kim Hee-jung in the 2014 KBS TV series The King's Face.\n*Portrayed by Kim Hyo-seo in the 2015 MBC TV series Splendid Politics.\n*Portrayed by Lee Se-young in the 2019 tvN TV series The Crowned Clown.\n*Portrayed by Park Min-jung the 2019 KBS2 TV series The Tale of Nokdu''.\nReferences\n*\n}}\n}}"
