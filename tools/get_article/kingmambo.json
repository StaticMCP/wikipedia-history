Niarchos owned both a U.S. thoroughbred farm, where his mare Miesque was stationed, and a French operation, where he did most of his racing.\nRacing career\n1992: two-year-old season\nAs a two-year-old, after winning a six furlong race at Maisons-Laffitte racecourse, Kingmambo placed second in the French Group 1, Prix de la Salamandre, the Group 3 Prix Thomas Bryon, and the Group 3 Prix de Cabourg.\n1993: three-year-old season\nAt the age of three, ridden by the American, Cash Asmussen, and trained by François Boutin, he won the Prix Djebel on his debut, beating Zafonic in an upset. He went on to prove himself to be a genuinely top class colt with three Group One wins in the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, the St. James's Palace Stakes and the Prix du Moulin de Longchamp.\nStud career\nKingmambo was retired to stud in 1994 and stood at Lane's End Farm. He was pensioned from stud duties in 2010.\nKingmambo was euthanized at age 25 on January 20, 2016 due to the infirmities of old age. Kingmambo was eventually buried at Lane's End.\nMajor winners\nc = colt, f = filly, g = gelding\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| Foaled\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| Name\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| Sex\n| style=\"width:550px;\"| Major Wins\n|-\n| 1995\n| El Condor Pasa\n| c\n| NHK Mile Cup, Japan Cup, Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud\n|-\n| 1996\n| Lemon Drop Kid\n| c\n| Belmont Futurity, Belmont Stakes, Travers Stakes, Whitney Handicap, Woodward Stakes\n|-\n| 1997\n| Bluemamba\n| f\n| Poule d'Essai des Pouliches\n|-\n| 1997\n| King's Best\n| c\n| 2000 Guineas\n|-\n| 1998\n| Malhub\n| c\n| Golden Jubilee Stakes\n|-\n| 1998\n| Okawango\n| c\n| Grand Critérium\n|-\n| 1998\n| Voodoo Dancer\n| f\n| Garden City Handicap, Diana Handicap\n|-\n| 1999\n| Dubai Destination\n| c\n| Queen Anne Stakes\n|-\n| 2000\n| Alkaased\n| c\n| Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, Japan Cup\n|-\n| 2000\n| Russian Rhythm\n| f\n| 1000 Guineas, Coronation Stakes, Nassau Stakes, Lockinge Stakes\n|-\n| 2001\n| Boboman\n| c\n| Hollywood Turf Cup\n|-\n| 2001\n| King Kamehameha\n| c\n| NHK Mile Cup, Tokyo Yūshun\n|-\n| 2001\n| Rule of Law\n| c\n| St Leger\n|-\n| 2002\n| Divine Proportions\n| f\n| Prix Morny, Prix Marcel Boussac, Poule d'Essai des Pouliches, Prix de Diane, Prix d'Astarte\n|-\n| 2002\n| Student Council\n| c\n| Pimlico Special, Pacific Classic\n|-\n| 2002\n| Tawqeet\n| c\n| Caulfield Cup\n|-\n| 2002\n| Virginia Waters\n| f\n| 1000 Guineas\n|-\n| 2004\n| Archipenko\n| c\n| Queen Elizabeth II Cup\n|-\n| 2004\n| Light Shift\n| f\n| Epsom Oaks\n|-\n| 2005\n| Campanologist\n| c\n| Deutschland Preis, Rheinland-Pokal, Preis von Europa, Gran Premio del Jockey Club\n|-\n| 2005\n| Henrythenavigator\n| c\n| 2000 Guineas, Irish 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes, Sussex Stakes\n|-\n| 2005\n| My Kingdom of Fife\n| g\n| Queen Elizabeth Stakes (ATC)\n|-\n| 2005\n| Thewayyouare\n| c\n| Critérium International\n|-\n| 2008\n| Master of Hounds\n| c\n| Jebel Hatta\n|-\n| 2009\n| Encke\n| c\n| St Leger\n|}\nPedigree\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pedigreequery.com/kingmambo Pedigree & Partial Stats]\n* [http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/stallion-directory/stallion.aspx?stallion_no=1281016 TB Times Stallion Directory Kingmambo]"
