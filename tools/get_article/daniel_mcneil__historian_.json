His article, \"Even Canadians Find It a Bit Boring: A Report on the Banality of Multiculturalism\" (2021), was the inaugural recipient of the Editor's Award from the Canadian Journal of Communication, and he has been invited to provide advice, consultation and lectures on multiculturalism and anti-racism to the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canadian Museum of Human Rights.

Kamari Clarke, David Theo Goldberg, and Lawrence Grossberg have described Thinking While Black as an \"important,\" \"nuanced,\" \"deeply informed,\" \"lucid,\" \"smart,\" and \"wonderfully novel\" analysis of the aspirations and achievements of Black Atlantic communities in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In her review of the book, Antonia King regarded the book as \"a necessary and innovative exploration of Black culture, Black disagreement, and debate.\" Nicholas Rickards regarded the book as an important resource for understanding the contributions of two intellectuals, Paul Gilroy and Armond White, within the context of Black critical consciousness and popular culture.\nPublications\nBooks\n* McNeil, Daniel.
