The plan to take the fortress was approved personally by Emperor Nicholas I.\nAfter the Turkish commandant refused to surrender, during February 15, the fire of Russian ship guns were suppressed all the enemy's coastal batteries, and on the morning of February 16, under cover of fog, 500 Russian paratroopers landed on the shore. Seeing them, the Turkish garrison (1600 people) left Sozopol. The commandant of the Turkish garrison Hamil Pasha was taken prisoner. Trophies of the Russians were 2 banners, 11 guns, a large amount of ammunition and food. After the capture of the city, the Russians immediately began to build new fortifications in it.\nOnly a month later, Ottoman forces attempt to retake Sozopol. During this time, the force under Russian command in the city grew to 3,000 men, including the Sozopol Bulgarian Bulgarian detachment of Stoyko Mavrudov's Thracian Volunteers numbering 1,000 men.\nOn March 28, 1829, Turkish troops (4,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry) made a desperate attempt to retake Sozopol. The assault on the fortress lasted all day, but was successfully repulsed by the combined forces of the Russian army, navy and fortress artillery. The outcome of the battle was decided by a counterattack by the Russian reserve. During the battle, 27 sailors and soldiers in the fortress and 5 sailors on the ships were killed. The Turks, having lost 250 men killed, retreated.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Sozopol became the main base of Russian naval operations until the end of the war. In April, the main forces of the Black Sea Fleet led by Admiral Alexei A. S. Greig moved into the port. From Sozopol he paralyzed the Turkish supply by sea and helped the army of I. I. I. Dibicha, which crossed the Balkans, in the delivery of food and the capture of Mesemvri.\nReferences\n[Category:Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]]"
