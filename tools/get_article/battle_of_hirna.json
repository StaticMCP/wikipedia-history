The Shewan forces were routed.\nBackground\nIn response to king Menelik's orders to occupy the Emirate of Harar, in September 1886 Dejazmach Wolde Gabriel a general of Menelik invaded the Emirate of Harar and occupied the Chercher area at Hirna however his army would be ambushed by the Emirate's troops.\nBattle\nAccording to Harold G. Marcus, his army \"was in poor shape, reduced to a relatively small number by sickness and desertions.\" A night attack by Emir 'Abd Allah's army routed the Dejazmach's force, sending them fleeing westward towards the Awash River. Ethiopian historian Bahru Zewde calls it a decisive victory for the emirate's troops.\nMenelik's informant Asme Giyorgis, conceded the initial push towards Harar by Walda Gabryiel was a failure as the Amir's soldiers used fireworks to startle his men, forcing a retreat. Harari records report Walda Gabryiel's army were strategically pushed into a wheat field full of spikes which pierced their feet, immobilizing them.\nSee also\n*Battle of Chelenqo\nReferences"
