Barton commented that \"Although the quality of their earlier products made me hesitant to try this one out, in I.S.C.V. King Richard, FASA has pretty much redeemed themselves. You should find the King Richard an interesting addition to your campaign.\"\nDoug Houseman reviewed I.S.P.M.V.: Fenris / S.F.V. Valkyrie, ZISMV: Vlezhdatl, I.S.C.V.: King Richard, I.S.P.M.V.: Tethys, and I.S.C.V.: Leander for Different Worlds magazine and stated that \"All five ships can be readily converted to Archive's Star Rovers or FGU's Space Opera rules. SPI's Universe does not allow for easy conversion due to its pod and frame design rules. Use of all the vessels is limited to onboard only.\"\nSee also\n*Action Aboard: Adventures on the King Richard - an adventure supplement for use with this product\n*List of Traveller books\nReferences"
