It featured a 50-foot vertical marquee illuminated with over 6,000 light bulbs of different colors, The vertical marquee has since been removed, and many of the original light bulbs on the rest of the marquee were replaced with neon strips.\nDon Knotts worked at the Warner Theatre while he was a student at West Virginia University. On March 20, 1964, the Warner Theatre hosted the national premiere of The Incredible Mr. Limpet, a Live-action/animated film featuring actor Don Knotts.\nRound Table Corporation ownership and 2010 closure\nThe Round Table Corporation purchased the theater in 2004 with the intention of restoring it to its original condition. The once single-screen theater became a multiplex in the early 1970s.\nAfter 79 years of business, The Warner Theater closed on September 5, 2010.\nSeveral factors contributed to this closure. One such cause was a growing maintenance backlog. The heating, cooling, and projection systems were in need of replacement. The condition of the roof was also a major issue. Several leaks had caused brickwork to deteriorate as well as moisture and mold issues. Another cause for the closure was financial difficulties. The Warner Theatre struggled to compete with the newer multiplexes in the area. The entrance was boarded up in 2014 after interior damage was caused by vandals.\n2021 ownership transition and renewed restoration initiatives\nOn December 28, 2021, The Dominion Post published an article announcing that The Warner Theater had been purchased by Mark Downs and Rich Brant. The new owners plan to return the venue to a single-bay theater and use the theater to host live performances. Dan Coffey, known for his work on theater restorations in Chicago, has already visited the Warner.\nMorgantown based construction firm March-Westin has been selected to perform the renovations. The theatre could reopen as early as 2025.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
