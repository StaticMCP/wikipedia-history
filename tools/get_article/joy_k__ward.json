She began a new role as the dean of the College of Arts & Sciences at Case Western Reserve University on July 1, 2020 - leaving behind her professorship at the University of Kansas. Her research on plant life has gained her notoriety in many scientific research fields. Aside from her work in the lab, she is also a strong advocate for advancing underrepresented communities' scientific learning and careers. As part of her deanship at the University of Kansas, Ward was an important factor in increasing the number of underrepresented individuals who held faculty positions in STEM subjects. Notably, as a result of her research efforts, she was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by U.S. President Barack Obama.\nEducation\nWard received her bachelor's degree in biology from Penn State University in 1991. Moving to Durham, she completed her master's degree in botany in 1994 at Duke. This was quickly followed by a PhD, also from Duke, in botany that was completed in 1997. Since 1997, Ward has also published over 40 peer-reviewed articles.\nResearch interests\nWard's primary research interests focus on how plants adapt to changing environments and conditions. As global warming has become a prevalent issue for all, Ward has directed her research to understanding how specific species of plants react to changes in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. Utilizing a holistic approach to her research, Ward is interested in understanding these changes on multiple levels - molecularly, physiologically, and evolutionary. Ward is better able to understand the long-term impacts of atmospheric changes by utilizing fossil records in her research. Understanding how plants have adapted to environmental shifts in the past is an integral part of Ward's research. With her arsenal of knowledge, Ward hopes to be able to contribute ideas and strategies for conserving and ensuring the health of earth's currently thriving ecosystems.\nCarbon dioxide impacts\nAs carbon dioxide levels continuously fluctuate, Ward has studied the impact this has on plants. By forming an understanding of how plants adapt, Ward hopes we might be better able to predict how they will behave in the future. This will have monumental impacts on various ecosystems throughout the world. As aforementioned, Ward has been a pioneer in utilizing fossil records in her research. Through chemical and physical analysis, this groundbreaking work enabled Ward to understand past adaptations of plant life.\nin 1999, Ward examined the differences in response between  and  plants when exposed to drought in environments that were low in carbon dioxide or high in carbon dioxide. Ward and her team found evidence that  plants have an advantage over  plants when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase. Additionally, the team found evidence that  plants have an advantage over  plants when they experience frequent and severe droughts. During this time, Ward also led research studies on the ways that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide has affected plant species in the past and present. Ward has used her data to predict how plants and future ecosystems and biological processes will operate in the future where atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will become higher.\nCarbon Dioxide Implications for the Future\nMany of Ward's more recent research involves her predictions about the way that increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide will impact plants, ecosystems, and ecology. In 2017, Ward led a study about plant responses to increasing carbon dioxide in the past, present, and future. Ward maintains that studying plants in this manner will allow scientists to better understand and predict the evolutionary consequences that will come with the changing environment. In this study, Ward found evidence for the implications of rising carbon dioxide for integrated plant-water dynamics and drought tolerance, the carbon dioxide effects on symbiotic interactions and evolutionary feedbacks, and the change in plant mechanisms in response to elevated carbon dioxide levels.\nTeaching career\n*2024—present: Provost and Executive Vice President, Case Western Reserve University\n*2023—2024: Interim-Provost and Executive Vice President, Case Western Reserve University\n*2020—2023: Dean, College of Arts and Sciences, Case Western Reserve University\n*2015—2020: Dean's professor of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Kansas\n*2015—2020: Professor with tenure, University of Kansas, Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (courtesy appointment in environmental studies)\n*2009—2015: Associate professor with tenure, University of Kansas, Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (courtesy appointment in environmental studies)\n*2006—2016: Inaugural Thelma and Edward Wohlgemuth Faculty Scholar Award.
