Published by HarperCollins from 2016 to 2018, the six-novel arc follows the events of Dawn of the Clans and focuses on protagonist Alderpaw, a ThunderClan medicine cat apprentice who receives prophetic visions that challenge the Clans' stability. The arc introduces Darktail's rogue group, explores SkyClan's reintegration into forest life, and culminates in a climatic battle that redefines Clan territories. Like other arcs, it was written by Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, and Tui T. Sutherland under the collective pseudonym Erin Hunter, with editorial oversight from Victoria Holmes.\nDevelopment\nThe concept for A Vision of Shadows emerged as a bridge between the prequel arc Dawn of the Clans and modern Clan events. Victoria Holmes stated in a 2016 interview that the team wanted to \"reintroduce SkyClan in a meaningful way\" after their initial appearance in the stand-alone manga ''SkyClan's Destiny''. The arc's central prophecy—\"Embrace what you find in the shadows, for only they can clear the sky\"—was designed to parallel the Clans' need to accept former rogues and outsiders to survive.\nTui T. Sutherland, who joined as a primary writer for this arc, developed Darktail as an antagonist to explore themes of prejudice and cyclical violence. Darktail's backstory as the half-Clan son of Onestar (WindClan's leader) and a rogue cat was intentionally crafted to mirror the series' recurring conflicts about identity and belonging.\nThe writing team conducted research on animal behavior to depict the rogue group's hierarchical structure, contrasting it with Clan life. New settings, such as the \"ShadowClan\" territory under Darktail's control, were designed to show environmental degradation caused by poor leadership.\nPublication history\n''The Apprentice's Quest\nReleased in hardcover on 15 March 2016, this novel debuted at #4 on the New York Times'' Children's Series list. It introduced Alderpaw's perspective and the prophecy driving the arc. The paperback followed on 6 December 2016.\nThunder and Shadow\nPublished on 6 September 2016, this installment expanded on Darktail's growing influence. Special editions included a bonus short story about Needletail.\nShattered Sky\nReleased on 11 April 2017, this book featured SkyClan's return to the lake territories. The cover art depicted the dramatic fire scene that destroys ShadowClan's camp.\nDarkest Night\nPublished on 7 November 2017, this novel marked the midpoint of the arc, with the Clans at their most divided. The paperback included an exclusive manga about Violetshine's backstory.\nRiver of Fire\nReleased on 10 April 2018, this penultimate installment focused on ShadowClan's reformation under Tigerstar II.\nThe Raging Storm\nThe finale published on 10 April 2018, concluded the conflict with Darktail and established SkyClan's permanent territory. A special box set of all six books was released simultaneously.\nTranslations followed in German (2017-2019), French (2018-2020), and Japanese (2019-2021). The German edition, published by Beltz & Gelberg, included revised cover art to match regional preferences.\nSetting and characters\nThe arc is set in the lake territories several moons after Omen of the Stars, with these key locations:\nShadowClan's Abandoned Camp: Darktail's base of operations after driving out ShadowClan.\nSkyClan's Gorge: The original territory shown in ''Firestar's Quest, revisited in The Apprentice's Quest''.\nThe Five Trees: A neutral meeting ground that becomes symbolic of Clan unity.\nMajor characters\nAlderheart: A ThunderClan medicine cat who receives the prophecy. His self-doubt and compassion drive the narrative.\nTwigbranch: A SkyClan-born cat raised in ThunderClan, representing the struggle of divided loyalties.\nVioletshine: Twigbranch's sister, who joins ShadowClan and later Darktail's rogues.\nDarktail: The primary antagonist, a vicious rogue leader with WindClan blood.\nTigerstar II: The reformed ShadowClan deputy (later leader) who opposes Darktail.\nStarClan's communication becomes increasingly cryptic in this arc, reflecting the Clans' spiritual uncertainty. The Dark Forest (ghostly realm of villainous cats) is mentioned but does not appear directly.\nSynopsis\n''The Apprentice's Quest''\nAlderpaw, struggling as a medicine cat apprentice, receives a prophecy to \"find the sky\" and leads a quest to SkyClan's old territory. He discovers Twigkit and Violetkit, orphaned sisters who become central to the arc's conflict.\nThunder and Shadow\nDarktail's rogues infiltrate ShadowClan, exploiting divisions between Clanborn cats and outsiders. Needletail, a ShadowClan warrior, defects to the rogues but later regrets her choice.\nShattered Sky\nSkyClan arrives at the lake but is rejected by the other Clans. Darktail burns ShadowClan's camp, forcing the Clan's dissolution. Needletail sacrifices herself to save Violetshine.\nDarkest Night\nThe Clans debate SkyClan's right to stay. Alderheart uncovers Darktail's half-Clan heritage, which Onestar had concealed. Twigbranch joins SkyClan while Violetshine remains with the rogues.\nRiver of Fire\nTigerstar II reforms ShadowClan with former rogues and loyalists. Violetshine defects back to ShadowClan after witnessing Darktail's cruelty.\nThe Raging Storm\nThe Clans unite to defeat Darktail, who drowns in the lake. SkyClan is granted permanent territory near ShadowClan. The arc ends with new leadership across all five Clans.\nThemes\nIdentity and Belonging: Explored through Twigbranch and Violetshine's divided loyalties.\nPrejudice: Darktail's hatred of Clan life mirrors the Clans' bias against rogues.\nLeadership: Contrasts Tigerstar II's inclusive approach with Darktail's tyranny.\nProphecy: Alderheart's struggle to interpret visions critiques blind faith in signs.\nCritical reception\nThe arc received praise for its complex villains and emotional depth but faced criticism for pacing:\nPublishers Weekly called The Raging Storm \"a satisfying payoff to two years of buildup.\"\nKirkus Reviews noted Darktail as \"one of Warriors' most chilling antagonists.\"\nCommon criticisms included \"overcrowded POVs\" (School Library Journal) and \"repetitive territory disputes\" (Booklist).\nThe German translation was nominated for the 2019 Jugendbuchpreis (Youth Book Prize) in the fantasy category.\nReferences"
