The Wolf Award, which has also come to be known as the International Wolf Award, consists of a certificate of appreciation and a sculpture of a howling wolf, presented in ceremonial fashion to the recipient.\nThe symbol of the wolf was chosen because the founders of The Wolf Project felt that wolves serve as a reminder that society's survival depends upon cooperation and collaboration.\nThe Wolf Project was developed by Heather Acres and Beatrice MacTavish of Flin Flon, Manitoba, and was initiated with the hope that by acknowledging the efforts of those striving to ameliorate relations between diverse cultures and peoples, others would be encouraged to become involved.  For their work, Acres received the Governor General of Canada's Meritorious Service Award, and MacTavish received the Manitoba Provincial Order of the Buffalo Hunt.\nRecipients\nSome recipients of the Wolf Award are listed as follows:\n*Nelson Mandela (1918 - 2013) received the Wolf Award for his work in human rights advocacy.   The wolf sculpture was presented in 1995 in South Africa by Canadian aboriginal leaders Phil Fontaine and George Muswagon, and was kept by Mr. Mandela in a place of honor just outside his office door.\n*Chief Arvol Looking Horse was presented the Wolf Award in 1996 for his work promoting racial equality and social justice.   He is the spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Nations and the 19th generation keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe.\n*Minnijean Brown-Trickey, for her contributions to improving race relations.   Minnijean was one of nine African-American students who enrolled in the all-white Little Rock Central High School in 1957.   The students, who later came to be known as the Little Rock Nine, were forced to face down an angry mob of white protesters and desegregate the school.  Brown-Trickey later spent many years in Canada, where she became an advocate for aboriginal peoples.  She received the Wolf Award in June, 1998 in Hull, Quebec.\n*Elder William Commanda (1913 - 2011) received the Wolf Award for his efforts promoting intercultural understanding and racial harmony.  Elder Commanda was Keeper of the Seven Fires Prophecy Belt, which dates back to the 15th century and purportedly teaches the history of the indigenous peoples of North America.   The Wolf was presented to Elder Commanda in November, 1998 by members of the Algonquin Nation on the River Desert Reserve in Maniwaki, Quebec.\n*[https://www.qmhc.qld.gov.au/professor-gracelyn-smallwood-awarded-national-naidoc-person-year/ Professor Gracelyn Smallwood], recognized for her commitment to advancing the human rights of indigenous Australians, and for promoting, encouraging and honoring inter-racial harmony in Australia.
