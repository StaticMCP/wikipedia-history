The first such single service award was issued during the Spanish–American War by the Revenue Cutter Service to honor the actions of the vessel USRC Hudson during the Battle of Cárdenas.  The last single service award was issued in 1960 when Congress authorized the awarding of the Four Chaplains' Medal recognizing the Four Chaplains who died together during World War II. There have been no single service awards issued since by the U.S. military, mainly due to the decline and complications of awarding commemorative service medals.\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In most cases, unofficial awards were designed to commemorate a specific battle or engagement of a commander's unit.  The most well known unofficial awards were issued during the American Civil War.\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Ribbon/award name\n|- bgcolor = \"#ccccff\" align=center\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|Civil War decorations\n|-\n|align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|Kearny Cross\n|-\n|Kearny Medal\n|-\n|\n|Butler Medal\n|-\n|No ribbon\n|Gillmore Medal\n|-\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Even so, the Department of Defense has stated that large numbers of unofficial medals were privately issued to members of the Armed Forces of the United States for many years after the Civil War, mostly to commemorate specific battles, events, or as private veteran memorabilia. One of the more well known is the Walter Reed Medal (recognized today as a Congressional Gold Medal), awarded for exploratory scientific achievement in the field of malaria treatment.  While presented as a gold medallion, members of the military were reported to wear a red ribbon on their uniforms to denote the decoration.\nForeign and international awards\nForeign and international decorations are authorized for wear on United States military uniforms by the Department of Defense in accordance with established regulations for the receipt of such awards as outlined by the State Department.  In the case of foreign decorations, the awards may be divided into senior service decorations (awarded only to high ranking U.S. officers), heroic decorations for valor, and foreign service decorations.\nThere are hundreds of foreign and international awards which have been approved for issuance to United States military personnel since World War I, the following being among the more common.\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Service members could receive both the individual award and the unit cord; in the case of the later, the unit citation could either be worn temporarily while a member of the unit or permanently if the service member was present during the actual battle which warranted the unit citation.  A further unit citation cord of the Order of William of the Netherlands was also issued during World War II, and was far more commonly known as the \"Orange Lanyard\".\nAs of 2002, South Korea has again issued the Korean Presidential Unit Citation to certain units of the United States Marine Corps, thus placing this previously obsolete foreign award back on the active order of precedence for U.S. decorations.  Apart from this one decoration, most 21st century foreign military awards are reserved for only the most senior flag and general officers and then only presented as \"end of tour\" decorations upon transfer from a major command.\nSee also\n*Awards and decorations of the United States government\n**Merchant Marine\n**Awards and decorations of the Public Health Service\n**Awards and decorations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n**Civilian decorations of the United States\n**Awards and decorations of the National Guard\n**Awards and decorations of the State Defense Forces\n**Military decorations of the Cold War\n***Awards and decorations of the Vietnam War\n*United States military award devices\n*Military badges of the United States\n**Badges of the United States Air Force\n**Badges of the United States Army\n**Badges of the United States Coast Guard\n**Badges of the United States Marine Corps\n**Badges of the United States Navy\n**Badges of the United States Space Force\n**Obsolete badges of the United States military\n**Identification badges of the uniformed services of the United States\n*Unofficial combat badges of the United States Army\n*List of military decorations\n*State decoration\n*Army-Navy \"E\" Award\n*Medal inflation\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131015105545/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/order_of_precedence.aspx Decorations and Medals - Ribbons - Order of Precedence] at the Institute of Heraldry website\n* [https://archive.today/20121212040800/http://www.army.mil/symbols/ U.S. Army Symbols and Insignia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060411072120/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/ The Institute of Heraldry, U.S. Army]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010428091723/http://www.history.navy.mil/medals/ U.S. Navy Service and Campaign Medals]\n* [https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r670_1.pdf Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia] (in PDF format)\n* [https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r600_8_22.pdf Military Awards (U.S. Army)](in PDF format) [https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/pdf/r600_8_22.pdf]\n*"
