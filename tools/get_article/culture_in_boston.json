      "text": "# Culture in Boston\n\nThe culture of Boston, Massachusetts, shares many roots with greater New England, including a dialect of the Eastern New England accent popularly known as Boston English. The city has its own unique slang, which has existed for many years. Boston was, and is still, a major destination of Irish immigrants. Irish Americans are a major influence on Boston's politics and religious institutions and consequently on the rest of Massachusetts.\nMany consider Boston a highly cultured city, perhaps as a result of its intellectual reputation. Mark Twain once wrote of it, \"In New York, they ask, 'How much money does he have?' In Philadelphia, they ask, 'Who were his parents?' In Boston they ask, 'How much does he know?'\" Much of Boston's culture originates at its universities.\nPerforming arts\nThe Washington Street Theatre District, south of Boston Common, contains a number of ornate theatres, including the Boston Opera House, the Cutler Majestic Theatre and The Citi Performing Arts Center. The most prominent professional theater companies are located at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge and at the Huntington Theatre, but small companies and theaters are scattered throughout the city, including at the Boston Center for the Arts and the Calderwood Pavilion in Boston's South End. The Boston Ballet is a world-renowned classical dance company. Street performers can be found in and around Quincy Market near Faneuil Hall.  Every summer, the Commonwealth Shakespeare Company offers open-air performances free to the public on the Boston Common.\nOutside view of Jordan Hall, an important Boston concert venue located at The New England Conservatory\nBoston is also home to a wide array of music - from bands like Boston and Aerosmith - to the world-renowned Boston Symphony Orchestra, the famed Boston Pops, the Boston Symphony Chamber Players, the Boston Philharmonic, the Boston Chamber Music Society, Boston Lyric Opera Company, Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Opera Boston, the Celebrity Series of Boston and the Handel and Haydn Society (one of the oldest choral company in the US). Major venues include Jordan Hall, Symphony Hall, and the Berklee Performance Center, as well as venues at each of the colleges and universities.  Several important music schools are located in Boston, including the New England Conservatory for classical and jazz music, the Boston Conservatory for classical music, dance, and musical theater, and the Berklee College of Music for jazz and a variety of contemporary music styles. Every two years, the city hosts the Boston Early Music Festival, an international gathering for people interested in historical music performance.\nPop music manager Maurice Starr launched the careers of popular 1980s boybands New Edition and New Kids on the Block, both of whom were based in Boston.\nThere are also countless lesser known local musicians, thanks to a thriving underground music scene.  In contrast to what might be considered the more \"refined\" aspects of Boston's culture, the city is also one of the birthplaces of hardcore punk. Boston had one of the leading local ska-punk scenes in the ska revival of the mid-1990s with bands like The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Allstonians, and Skavoovie and the Epitones.  The punk rock group Dropkick Murphys have had ties to both Boston professional sports teams, particularly the Boston Red Sox and Boston Bruins, and their music has appeared in some films early in the 21st century.\nBoston was also the center of a thriving and influential indie rock, college rock, post-punk and new wave scenes throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including bands like The Cars, Pixies, 'Til Tuesday, Throwing Muses, Scruffy the Cat, Mission of Burma, The Lemonheads, Human Sexual Response, Galaxie 500, Damon & Naomi, Helium, The Pernice Brothers and Swirlies. Bands formed and located in the western part of Massachusetts in the college towns of Amherst and Northampton also had a major impact on the Boston music scene: important bands from western Massachusetts include Sebadoh, Dinosaur Jr., Buffalo Tom, and many others.\nBoston is also known for its Hip Hop scene. Many rappers such as Guru of the rap duo Gang Starr, Big Shug, ED O.G. & Da Bulldogs, Mr. Lif, The Perceptionists, Benzino, 7L & Esoteric, Bia (rapper) and Special Teamz made this city famous for its urban music.\nActress and Latin pop singer Sasha Sokol relocated to Boston after leaving Timbiriche in the mid-1980s.  Sokol recorded her solo debut album while still residing in Boston, only to return to Mexico City in order to do television work.  Sasha remains the only Latin pop act to have been based in Boston.\nCurrent music venues support a diverse array of live music throughout Boston. Venues support local bands, and showcase national touring acts. Clubs include The Middle East, T.T. the Bears, P.A.'s Lounge, Great Scott, and The Paradise (a larger venue). This scene is supported by local press including The Boston Phoenix and the Weekly Dig, musicians from local colleges including Berklee College of Music, and more recently Boston-based weblogs and podcasts such as Band in Boston Podcast.\nVisual arts\nMuseums dedicated to visual art in the Boston area include the Museum of Fine Arts, the National Center of Afro-American Artists, the Institute of Contemporary Art and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.  Notable art museums and galleries are associated with Harvard University, Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston College, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Wellesley College, MassArt, and other schools.\nNumerous art galleries are located on Newbury Street, in the South End and in the Fort Point Channel area.
