The 'Gulls' have had a proud history especially through the successful years of the early 1920s, 1970s and 1980s.\nLean seasons in 1998 and 1999 in the Gippsland/Latrobe FL, saw the club transfer to the West Gippsland FL, with the thought of providing a better chance of retaining players. The Victorian Country Football League provided this clearance for the Gulls to the WGFL, where they played from 2000 to 2004. However, the merging of the GLFL and WGFL saw Warragul resume its battles with former foes from 2005.\nSince 2005, the club has been a part of the Gippsland FL, competing against clubs such as Bairnsdale, Drouin, Garfield (until their transfer to the EDFL), Moe, Morwell, Traralgon, Maffra, Sale, Wonthaggi and Leongatha.\nIn 2010 and 2011, Warragul finished bottom of the ladder, winning only one game in each respective season. The club is currently building a young base of players to build on into the future, many of whom had success with the club in both the Under 16 and 18's previously.\nFootball Leagues Timeline\n*1889: South Gippsland Challenge Cup\n*1890: Robinson's Challenge Cup\n*1891: Kennedy's Challenge Cup\n*1892: Gippsland & Feilchenfeld Cup\n*1893: Thomas Challenge Cup\n*1894: Ross Challenge Cup\n*1895: Storie Challenge Cup\n* 1896: ?\n*1897: [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/67432975# Harlem Hotel Cup]\n*1898-1908: West Gippsland FA\n*1909-1915: Central Gippsland FL\n*1916-1918: No Football Played.
