A former member of the governing People's Action Party (PAP), he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Pasir Panjang division of West Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) between 1997 and 2001, and the West Coast division of the same constituency between 2001 and 2024.\nIn 2023, Iswaran was arrested by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in connection with a case that was not publicly disclosed at the time, and was instructed to take a leave of absence by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. His transport portfolio was succeeded by Chee Hong Tat, initially in an acting position. In January 2024, Iswaran resigned as Minister for Transport as well as from his positions as an MP and member of the PAP, two days before pleading not guilty to 27 counts of corruption and obstruction of justice relating to his dealings with Malaysian billionaire Ong Beng Seng.\nIn September 2024, Iswaran pleaded guilty to four counts under Section 165 of the Penal Code, relating to \"obtaining gratification as a public servant\" and one count of obstruction of justice under Section 204A(a). He voluntarily returned more than S$384,000 in bribes and was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. He completed his sentence in June 2025 and has since kept a low profile. Iswaran was the first Singaporean minister in half a century to be imprisoned since Wee Toon Boon in 1975.\nEarly life and education\nIswaran was born on 14 June 1962 in Chennai, India, and later moved to Singapore as a child. Iswaran attended Saint Andrew's School and National Junior College before graduating from the University of Adelaide with first class honours, where he read economics, which was provided for by a Colombo Plan scholarship. He also holds a Master of Public Administration from Harvard University.\nCareer\nPrior to entering politics, Iswaran was Senior Vice President and Managing Director at Temasek Holdings (2003–2006), Director for International Trade at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and Director of Strategic Development at Singapore Technologies (1996–1998).\nThroughout his political career, Iswaran concurrently held directorships in several organisations, including Quintiles Transnational, Sunningdale Tech, Shin Corporation, SciGen, PSA International, Sembcorp Industries, and Hyflux.\nPolitical career\nduring the Thomson–East Coast line open house, 2022.]]\nIswaran made his political debut in the 1997 general election when he contested as part of a four-member People's Action Party (PAP) team in West Coast GRC and won with 70.14% of the vote, becoming a Member of Parliament.\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Iswaran was Deputy Speaker of Parliament. On 1 July 2006, he was appointed Minister of State at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\nAfter the 2006 general election, on 1 April 2008, Iswaran was promoted to Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Trade and Industry. On 1 April 2009, he was given an additional appointment as Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Education.\nFollowing the 2011 general election, Iswaran was promoted to full Minister in the Cabinet and appointed Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Home Affairs, and Second Minister for Trade and Industry. After the 2015 general election, on 1 October 2015, he relinquished his three positions and took up the portfolio of Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) alongside Lim Hng Kiang, who was Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade). On 1 May 2018, he became Minister for Communications and Information, however he did continue in the Ministry of Trade and Industry as Minister In-Charge of Trade Relations.\nAfter the 2020 general election, Iswaran continued as Minister in the Ministry of Communications and Information. On 15 May 2021, after a Cabinet reshuffle, Iswaran became Minister for Transport while continuing his appointment as Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations.\nProsecution and conviction\n2023\nOn 11 July 2023, Iswaran was arrested and released on bail. He also had his passport impounded. The next day, he and other individuals were summoned to assist in an unspecified corruption investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB). Upon being briefed on the investigation by the CPIB, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong instructed Iswaran to go on a leave of absence until the end of the investigations; Chee Hong Tat was appointed as the Acting Transport Minister.\nIswaran's case is the first high-profile graft investigation involving a minister since November 1986, when Minister for National Development Teh Cheang Wan was investigated by the CPIB for bribery allegations, although Teh committed suicide a month later before he could be formally charged. The next day, the government announced that Iswaran would not have access to government offices and had to remain in Singapore until the investigations were completed.\nOn 2 August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Iswaran had been interdicted with a reduced monthly pay of S$8,500 as per civil service guidelines, given that there are no specific provisions that cover ministers under investigation. Until his resignation, Iswaran still drew a monthly salary of S$16,000 as an MP as Parliament had not tabled a motion to remove it.\n2024\nOn 9 January 2024, investigations by the CPIB against Iswaran were completed, was being reviewed by the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC). Writing in a reply to non-constituency Member of Parliament Hazel Poa, Public Service Minister-in-Charge and Education Minister Chan Chun Sing said that the CPIB had completed a “robust and thorough” investigation and assured that the case \"will be put through the due legal process\".\nOn 18 January, Iswaran was charged in the State Courts of Singapore with 27 charges relating to bribery and corruption. The CPIB, alleged that Iswaran obtained kickbacks valued at S$384,340.98 from property tycoon Ong Beng Seng, in part to advance Ong's business interests. Iswaran subsequently resigned from the PAP, and stepped down as Transport Minister and West Coast GRC MP. Iswaran was defended by Senior Counsel Davinder Singh.\nOn 25 March, Iswaran was handed 8 new charges over obtaining $19k in items including a Brompton bicycle and golf clubs from Lum Chang Building Contractors Managing Director Lum Kok Seng, which is linked to a contract between the company and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) for addition and alteration works to Tanah Merah MRT station and existing viaducts.\nOn 25 September, Iswaran pleaded guilty to 4 charges under Section 165 of the Penal Code 1871 for receiving gifts while in office as well as 1 charge of obstruction of justice. He was convicted of all 5 charges on the same day. The sentencing hearing was scheduled for 3 October 2024. The prosecution sought a custodial sentence of 6 to 7 months whereas the defence contended that no more than 8 weeks' imprisonment should be imposed. On 3 October, Iswaran was sentenced to 12 months in prison, a term higher than the requested sentencing by both the prosecution and the defence. Within almost 50 years, Iswaran is also the first minister to serve a jail term following Wee Toon Boon back in 1975 for corruption charges.\n2025\nOn 7 February 2025, after serving four months in prison, Iswaran was transferred to the home detention scheme to continue the rest of his sentence in the community. As Iswaran served with good behaviour and therefore eligible for parole after two-thirds of his stipulated jail term (equivalent to eight months), he was allowed to transition to the home detention scheme halfway through his reduced sentence. The decision was made after the prison authorities took into consideration Iswaran's low propensity to re-offend, his strong familial support and that he did not commit any institutional offence during his incarceration.\nOn 6 June, it was reported that he had completed his sentence.\nPersonal life\nIswaran is married to Kay Mary Taylor, an Australian citizen. They have a daughter, Monisha Catherine Iswaran, an Australian citizen, and two sons. Monisha previously held Singaporean citizenship by virtue of her father being Singaporean but was deprived of it in 2025 under Article 135(1)(b) of the Constitution. The Article provides that a person ceases to be a citizen of Singapore if they acquire the citizenship of another country after the Constitution came into force, or if, before that time, they applied for citizenship of another country and no other condition for the acquisition of Singapore citizenship was specified.\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pmo.gov.sg/cabinet/Mr-S-Iswaran S.
