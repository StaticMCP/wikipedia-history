He was the son of Aybuqa, son of Boyoqa, son of Alagush Tegin Quri. His mother was , the youngest daughter of Kublai Khan.\nGeorge was married twice. His first wife was Qudadmiš, a daughter of Zhenjin. She died young and George married Aiyašri, a daughter of Khublai Khan's grandson Temür Khan. In the summer of 1294, he was granted the title \"Prince of Gaotang\" (高唐王 Gāotáng Wáng) by the Chinese sovereign.\nLife\nGeorge's birth date is not recorded, but analysis of his skeleton shows that he died at about forty years of age. He was described by Book of Yuan as \"courageous and resolute by nature, trained in military affairs, and particularly devoted to Confucian learning.\" According to the book, he built the Hall of Ten Thousand Volumes in his private residence, where he daily engaged with scholars in discussions on the classics, history, metaphysics, cosmology, and numerology.\nGeorge belonged to the Church of the East. In 1294 or 1295, George met the Franciscan friar John of Montecorvino, who converted him to Catholicism. He gave John permission to construct a Catholic church in an Ongud capital, possibly Olon Süme. He took minor orders so that he could participate in the office of the Mass while wearing his royal robes. According to him, they had plans to translate Latin liturgy to George's language and script. John claims that George maintained his Catholic faith, but Li Tang points out that he maintained certain practices (such as prayers in Syriac) that could indicate that he remained attached to the Church of the East.\nDuring the Yuan–Chagatai war, Temür Khan sent George to the western border to attack the Chagatai. In April 1297, he defeated them at the battle of Bayasi. In the winter of 1298, however, his garrison came under attack by the Chagatai leader Duwa; he was captured and executed. George was first buried at Bole. He was supposed be succeeded by his son John. But he was aged only two or three, therefore passing the line to Yohannan, George's brother. In 1310, John received permission from the Emperor Wuzong to bring his father's body back for burial in the family cemetery at Yelike'ersi. George's tomb has been found in Guyuan.\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
