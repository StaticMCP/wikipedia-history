Until May 2011, the position was called President of the Republic of Adygea.\nHistory\nThe position of the President of the Republic of Adygea (until March 24, 1992 - Adygean ASSR) was introduced in accordance with the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Adygean ASSR on June 28, 1991. In December 1991 - January 1992 (in two rounds), the elections of the first President of the Republic was held in Adygea. On October 19, 1994, the members of the Constitutional Commission prepared a draft of the new constitution of the republic and submitted for the approval by the State Council. After a discussion, the session of the State Council adopted the draft and submitted it for the nationwide discussion. March 6, 1995, after 4.5 months of national discussion and two-time consideration in the State Council, the draft version of the Constitution was submitted for final consideration and adoption by the State Council members. By the adoption of the new constitution after the numerous discussions the powers and the duties of the President of Adygea was fixed.\nOn December 28, 2010, the Federal Law was adopted, which establishes that the name of highest official of the Federal subjects of the Russian Federation (the head of the highest executive body of the state) cannot contains the titles and phrases that constitute the name of the position of the head of state - the President of the Russian Federation. This law establishes until January 1, 2015 a long period during which the constitutions and charters of the Russian federal subjects must be brought into line with it.\nOn April 20, 2011 at the second meeting of the State Council of Adygea, members approved the introduction of amendments to the Constitution of the republic to replace the name “President of the Republic of Adygea” with “Head of the Republic of Adygea”.\nSelection process\nElection\nThe Head of the Republic is elected by the members of the State Council of Adygea from candidates submitted by the President of Russia.\nLast election\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;
