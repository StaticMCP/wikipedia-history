It consisted of a grass strip and supporting buildings in what is now the Kingscourt subdivision of the city, just to the west of the St. Mary's cemetery. The city of Kingston purchased what was then the Reid Farm and leased it to the Kingston Flying Club, who operated a flight school using two Gipsy Moth aircraft.\nThe Kingston Airfield was a popular refuelling stop between Toronto and Montreal, and in 1931, 1,400 transient aircraft were recorded using the field.\nThe airport was closed in 1942 after a crash. After World War II, the Kingston Flying Club resumed operations at Norman Rogers Airport, west of the city, which had been built as a military field, and the original Kingston Airfield was redeveloped as a residential neighbourhood.\nReferences\nSources\n* [http://www.thewhig.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1597301 Kingston's First Airfield] (Kingston Whig-Standard, 4 June 2009) Retrieved September 12, 2011"
