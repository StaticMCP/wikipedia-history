The album consists of four tracks, one from each of their four most recent albums up to that point, with \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" as the lead track.\nMusic video\nIn 1977, Queen filmed a promotional video for \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" in the Top of the Pops studios. The music video featured a drastically different arrangement of the song.\nCommercial performance\n''Queen's First E.P. entered the UK Singles Chart at number 36 in the week ending 4 June 1977, peaking at number 17 in early July.\nRelease and reception\n}}\nJim Allen of AllMusic wrote that Queen's First E.P. \"is a four-song affair featuring one song apiece from A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races, Sheer Heart Attack, and Queen II. \"Tenement Funster\", sung by drummer Roger Taylor, is a slice of Bowie-ish glam rock. \"White Queen\" is a prog-tinged epic ballad. \"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\" taps into the lighter, music-hall side of Queen, and the scabrous hard rocker \"Death on Two Legs\" finds the band baring its fangs a bit.\"\nQueen's First E.P. was reissued on CD in 1988 on the CD Single box set through Parlophone Records. In November 2008, it was made available as part of the limited edition CD box set The Singles Collection Volume 1''.\nOn 18 April 2009, the EP was reissued on CD as a part of Record Store Day 2009.\nTrack listing\nAll lead vocals by Freddie Mercury, except \"Tenement Funster\", sung by Roger Taylor.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (1977)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |UK Singles (Official Charts Company)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 17\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
