The association maintains its own list of heritage sites, which should not be confused with the list of National Heritage Sites defined by the Israeli government's \"Landmarks\" program ().\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Official site, in [https://shimur.org Hebrew] and [https://shimur.org/?lang=en English]"
