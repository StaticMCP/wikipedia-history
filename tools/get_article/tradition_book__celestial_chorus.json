The book was originally released by White Wolf Publishing in July 1996, with a second edition following in June 2001.\nReception\nAdam Tinworth reviewed Celestial Chorus for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Tinworth comments that \"For any player keen to take on the playing of such a religious character, this book provides a valuable grounding in the origin of the movement. But crucial elements that both players and storytellers alike will be looking for are sadly lacking. This is something of a missed opportunity.\"\nReviews\n* #32 (Jul-Aug 2001)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.legrog.org/jeux/mage-l-ascension/tradition-books/celestial-chorus-en Guide du Rôliste Galactique]"
