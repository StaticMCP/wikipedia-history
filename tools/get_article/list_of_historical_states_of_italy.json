The following is a list of the various Italian states during that period. Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the arrival of the Middle Ages (in particular from the 11th century), the Italian Peninsula was divided into numerous states. Many of these states consolidated into major political units that balanced the power on the Italian Peninsula: the Papal States, the Venetian Republic, the Republic of Florence, the Duchy of Milan, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily. Unlike all the other Italian states of the medieval and early modern period, the republics of Venice and Genoa, thanks to their maritime power, went beyond territorial conquests within the Italian Peninsula, conquering various regions across the Mediterranean and Black Seas.\nAncient Italy\n, before the Roman expansion in Italy.]]\nThe ancient peoples of Italy are broadly referred to in historiography as Italic peoples, although in modern linguistics this term is used to define only the speakers of the Italic languages, namely the Latino-Faliscans and the Osco-Umbrians.

The kingdoms of Sicily, Sardinia, Naples (inclusive of the State of Presidi) and the Duchy of Milan were left under the control of Spanish Habsburgs. France was in control of several fortresses and in particular of the Marquisate of Saluzzo. All the other Italian states remained independent, with the most powerful being the Venetian Republic, the Medici's Duchy of Tuscany, the Savoyard state, the Republic of Genoa, and the Papal States. The Gonzaga in Mantua, the Este in Modena and Ferrara and the Farnese in Parma and Piacenza continued to be important dynasties. Parts of the north of Italy remained a part of the Holy Roman Empire.\nMajor states\n*  Papal States\n*  Republic of Venice\n*  Grand Duchy of Tuscany\n*  Kingdom of Naples\n*  Republic of Genoa\n*  Duchy of Savoy\n*  Duchy of Milan\nMinor states\n*  Kingdom of Sardinia (under Spanish rule)\n*  Kingdom of Sicily\n*  Prince-Bishopric of Brixen\n*  Prince-Bishopric of Trent\n*  Principality of Compiano\n*  Principality of Piombino\n*  Principality of Monaco\n* Principality of Bozollo\n*  Duchy of Mantua\n*  Duchy of Ferrara\n**  Duchy of Modena and Reggio (In personal union with Ferrara)\n*  Duchy of Parma and Piacenza\n**  Duchy of Castro (in personal union with Parma)\n*  Duchy of Urbino\n* Marquisate of Arquata\n*  Marquisate of Bastia\n* Marquisate of Castiglione (raised to Principality of Castiglione in 1609)\n*  Marquisate of Finale\n*  Marquisate of Fosdinovo\n*  Marquisate of Massa (raised to Principality of Massa in 1568)\n** Marquisate of Carrara (in personal union with Massa)\n*  Marquisate of Masserano (raised to Principality of Masserano in 1598)\n*  Marquisate of Montferrat (raised to Duchy of Montferrat in 1574; in personal union with Mantua)\n*  Marquisate of Sabbioneta (raised to Duchy of Sabbioneta in 1577)\n*  Marquisate of Torriglia\n*  County of Correggio (raised to Principality of Correggio in 1616)\n*  County of Guastalla\n*  County of Pitigliano\n*  County of Mirandola\n*  County of Montechiarugolo\n*  County of Novellara and Bagnolo\n*  County of Santa Fiora\n*  County of Tende\n* County of Correggio (raised to Duchy of Coreggio in 1630)\n*  Monastic State of the Order of Malta\n*  Republic of Ancona\n*  Republic of Cospaia\n*  Republic of Lucca\n*  Republic of Noli\n*  Republic of Ragusa\n* Republic of San Marino\nAfter the Wars of Succession of the 18th century\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), Savoy acquired Sicily, while the remaining Spanish dominions in Italy (Naples, Sardinia, and Milan) were taken over by the Austrian Habsburgs. In 1720, Savoy exchanged Sicily for Sardinia. Following the extinction of the House of Medici, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was ruled by the Habsburg-Lorraine. Later on, Southern Italy passed to a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, known as House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. Other states such as Genoa, Venice, Modena, the Papal States and Lucca remained with their governments unchanged.\nMajor states\n* Papal States\n* Kingdom of Naples (under the Habsburg monarchy from 1714 to 1735; in personal union with Sicily under the Bourbon-Two Sicilies thereafter)\n*  Grand Duchy of Tuscany (under Habsburg-Lorraine after 1737)\n*  Duchy of Milan (under Habsburg Monarchy)\n*  Duchy of Savoy\n*  Republic of Genoa\n*  Republic of Venice\nMinor states\n*  Kingdom of Sardinia (under Austrian monarchy from 1714 to 1720; in personal union with Savoy thereafter)\n*  Kingdom of Sicily (under Savoy from 1713 to 1720; under Austrian monarchy from 1720 to 1734; in personal union with Naples under the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies thereafter)\n*  Duchy of Mantua (under House of Gonzaga until 1708, Austrian Monarchy thereafter)\n*  Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (under Habsburg Monarchy from 1734 to 1748, under House of Bourbon-Parma thereafter)\n*  Duchy of Guastalla (in personal union with Parma from 1748)\n*  Duchy of Modena and Reggio\n*\n*  Duchy of Massa and Carrara (in personal union with Modena from 1731)\n*  Duchy of Mirandola (in personal union with Modena from 1710)\n*  Prince-Bishopric of Brixen\n*  Prince-Bishopric of Trent\n*  Principality of Masserano\n*  Principality of Torriglia\n*  Principality of Piombino\n*  Principality of Monaco\n*  Duchy of Montferrat, to House of Savoy from 1708\n*  Marquisate of Fosdinovo\n*  Marquisate of Bastia\n*  Republic of Lucca\n* Republic of San Marino\n*  Republic of Ragusa\n*  Republic of Noli\n*  Republic of Cospaia\n*  City of Fiume and its District\n*  Monastic State of the Order of Malta\nTheir populations and other vital statistics stood as follows in the late 18th century:\n* Kingdom of Naples (including Sicily): 6,000,000 (400,000 in Naples), army of 60,000 to 80,000, 2 ships of the lines and some frigates\n* Republic of Venice: 3,500,000 (140,000 in the city of Venice itself), standing army and navy of 30,000, 12-15 ships of at least 54 guns plus frigates and brigs\n* Kingdom of Sardinia: 2,900,000 (2,400,000 on the mainland and 500,000 on the island), 12-15 fortified cities and towns (largest being Turin at 80,000), standing army of 25,000, which could be raised to 50,000 in a time of war and 100,000 with militia\n* Papal States: 2,400,000 (140,000 in the city of Rome), standing army of 6,000 to 7,000\n* Austrian Lombardy (Duchy of Milan, Duchy of Mantua, and minor territories): 1,100,000 (40,000 in the city of Milan itself)\n* Grand Duchy of Tuscany: 1,000,000 (80,000 in Florence), standing army of 6,000, navy of 3 frigates\n* Republic of Genoa: 500,000 (100,000 in the city of Genoa itself)\n* Duchy of Parma: 500,000 (40,000 in the city of Parma itself), standing army of 2,500 to 3,000\n* Duchy of Modena: 350,000 (20,000 in the city of Modena itself), standing army of 5,000 to 6,000\n* Republic of Lucca: 100,000\nTotal: 18.3 million\nDuring Napoleonic times (1792–1815)\nSister republics of Revolutionary France\n*  Republic of Alba\n*  Anconine Republic\n*  Astese Republic\n*  Republic of Bergamo\n* Bolognese Republic\n*  Republic of Brescia\n*  Cisalpine Republic\n*  Cispadane Republic\n*  Republic of Crema\n*  Italian Republic\n*  Ligurian Republic\n*  Jacobin State of Lucca\n*  Parthenopean Republic\n*  Republic of Pescara\n* Piedmontese Republic\n*  Roman Republic\n* Subalpine Republic\n* Tiberina Republic\n*  Transpadane Republic\nClient states of the First French Empire\n*  Kingdom of Etruria\n*  Kingdom of Italy\n*  Kingdom of Naples\n*  Principality of Lucca and Piombino\n*  Principality of Benevento\n*  Principality of Pontecorvo\nOther states\n*  Kingdom of Sardinia\n* Kingdom of Sicily\n*  Principality of Elba (non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled Emperor Napoleon)\n*  Republic of Cospaia\n* Republic of San Marino\nFrom the restoration to the unification\nFollowing the defeat of Napoleon's France, the Congress of Vienna (1815) was convened to redraw the European continent. In Italy, the Congress restored the pre-Napoleonic patchwork of independent governments, either directly ruled or strongly influenced by the prevailing European powers, particularly Austria. The Congress also determined the end of two millenary republics: Genoa was annexed by the then Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia, and Venice was incorporated with Milan into a new kingdom of the Austrian Empire.\nAt the time, the struggle for Italian unification was perceived to be waged primarily against the Habsburgs, since they directly controlled the predominantly Italian-speaking northeastern part of present-day Italy and were the most powerful force against the Italian unification. The Austrian Empire vigorously repressed nationalist sentiment growing in its domains on the Italian Peninsula, as well as in the other parts of Habsburg domains.\n*  Papal States\n*  Kingdom of Sardinia\n*  Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n*  Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia (under Austrian Empire)\n*  Kingdom of Illyria (under Austrian Empire)\n*  Grand Duchy of Tuscany\n*  Duchy of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla\n*  Duchy of Modena and Reggio\n*  Duchy of Massa and Carrara\n*  Duchy of Lucca\n*  Principality of Monaco\n*  Republic of San Marino\n* Republic of Benevento\n* Republic of Pontecorvo\n* Republic of Cospaia\n*  Republic of San Marco\n*  Roman Republic\n*  United Provinces of Central Italy\nPost-unification\nin 1871, after the Capture of Rome]]\nin 1924, after World War I]]\n*  Kingdom of Italy\n*  Republic of San Marino\n*  Italian Regency of Carnaro\n*  Free State of Fiume\n*  Italian Social Republic\n*  Kingdom of the South\n*  Free Territory of Trieste\nItalian Partisan Republics\nThe Italian Partisan Republics were the provisional state entities liberated by Italian partisans from the rule and occupation of Nazi Germany and the Italian Social Republic in 1944 during the Second World War.
