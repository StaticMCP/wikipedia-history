It is intended to convey the connections and relationships between units and formations. At the end of the Cold War in 1989, the Bulgarian People's Army (BPA) reported to the Ministry of People's Defence (Bulgaria). The BPA included the Bulgarian Land Forces; the Air and Air Defence Forces; Navy; and Construction Troops.\nThe Interior Ministry supervised the Border Troops, Interior Troops, Transport Troops, and Communications Troops.\nWar Planning\nIn case of war the Bulgarian People's Army's Land Forces Command would have formed the 1st Balkan Front with multiple Bulgarian armies and wartime reinforcements. Two Bulgarian armies, four to six motorized rifle divisions and three tank brigades, the CIA estimated in 1979, would be assigned to this Front (page 149/201). Additional Soviet units would also come under its command (particularly 10th Army of the Soviet Union (10th Guards Budapest Rifle Corps?, which later became the 14th Guards Army), planned to deploy between the fifth and tenth day after a full mobilization in the area between Silistra, Tolbukhin, Varna and Omurtag).\nAccording to Lieutenant-General Hristo Hristov (former Chief of the Land Forces and Chief of the Georgi Rakovski Military Academy): \"For that purpose the Land Forces Command was formed in 1973. Its first chief was Colonel-General Hristo Dobrev, with the rank of Deputy Minister of People's Defence. At a conference about the organization of the armed forces of about ten years ago [around 2003] he has formulated the need for the formation of the LFC as such: ''\"It is well known, that according to the operational plans of the Supreme Headquarters of the Warsaw Pact Organization our country was supposed to form a frontal Operational-Strategical Formation (фронтово оперативно-стратегическо обединение), mainly including the Bulgarian People's Army with the mission in case of an aggression launched against the People's Republic of Bulgaria to mount defensive action on the southern state border in order to secure the deployment on Bulgarian soil of additionally one Soviet and one Romanian front. ..Our Land Forces at the moment [the 1970s] numbered around 60-62 000 men, the exercises were constant. Each division executed annually one winter and one summer exercise in full strength. The three army headquarters - one command exercise under the leadership of the respective army commander and one command exercise under the leadership of the Land Forces Main Staff annually. The massive exercises of the Land Forces, normally during the summers normally included an army headquarters from the Soviet Army and occasionally an army headquarters from the Romanian Army. On the Balkan operational direction our armed forces were planned to cooperate with them.\"\nAfter which with the support of the Soviet Strategic Missile Troops the three fronts were, with the support of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet [which at that point would have absorbed the Bulgarian and the Romanian Navies] to launch a strategic operation aimed at the total destruction of the aggressor... Our men were excellent trained.\n1st Balkan Front\nThe headquarters of the 1st Balkan Front had direct command of the following units:\nFrontal Command, Sofia\n* Directly Subordinated\n** Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff:\n*** 68th Independent Parachute-Reconnaissance Regiment (Plovdiv, an equivalent of the Soviet GRU-Spetsnaz, the Intelligence Directorate even had a \"Spetsnaz\"-Department with that exact name and the responsibility for combat readiness and mission planning of the Specnaz units). The regiment was formed on October 1, 1975, by bringing together the battalion-sized 68th (in Plovdiv) and 86th Training Parachute-Reconnaissance Base (in Musachevo village, immediately to the east of Sofia. The bases, called \"Training\" (Учебна Парашутно-Разузнавателна База - Резерв на Главното Командване (УПРБ-РГК)) for maskirovka were special mission units, directly subordinated to the General Staff with the capabilities to execute covert intelligence gathering and direct actions deep in the enemy rear of the two NATO adversaries in the region - Greece and Turkey respectively. Each of the bases was composed of a Command; Staff and Staff Services; 3 Para-Recon Companies of 6 Para-Recon Groups each (composed of 7 people: a commanding officer, a master sergeant executive commander, a radiotelegraphist, a senior intelligence gatherer, an intelligence gatherer, an intelligence gatherer/ grenadier and a military interpreter); a Training Company, a Signals Company and diverse support and supply units. The newly formed 68th IPRR included a Command; Staff and Staff Services; 3 x Para-Recon Battalions; Diversionary-Reconnaissance Detachment (reinforced company, specialised in direct actions, upgraded to a full battalion in 1989); Training Battalion; Signals Battalion and support and supply units. The full compliance to Soviet GRU-Spetsnaz standards since the formation of the regiment is also noted in the specification of the Para-Recon Groups, which were renamed Spetsnaz-Reconnaissance Groups (Разузнавателни Групи със Специално Назначение (РГСН)). The regiment is the forerunner of the modern 68th Special Forces Brigade.\n*** ?. Independent Brigade for Radio-intercept and Radio-technical Reconnaissance OSNAZ (?. Отделната Бригада за Радио и Радиотехническо Разузнаване ОСНАЗ) in Musachevo, just to the east of Sofia (the ELINT and Radio Interception units of the BPA were called OSNAZ from the Russian ОСобое НАЗначение (roughly translated as \"of specific purpose\"), Electronic Warfare, such as the N, S and NS type units were called SPETSNAZ (same as the special forces units) from the Russian СПЕЦиальное НАЗначение (translated as \"of special purpose\"))\n** Directorate for Signals and Electronics of the General Staff:\n*** 62nd Signals Brigade, in Gorna Malina - with the escalation in the nuclear armament of NATO and the Warsaw Pact a plan was devised by the Bulgarian government, that in the case of a full-sized conflict, to retain command and control, the higher echelon of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the senior military command was to be divided in three groups and evacuated to nuclear blast-protected bunkers in the Bulgarian mountains. Next to the functions of the Signals Regiment in the Sofia suburb of Suhodol, the brigade also had the functions of maintaining the higher military communication lines. For that reason the 62nd Brigade had at least three dispersed signals regiments for government communications, such as the 75th Signals Regiment (Lovech), the 65th Signals Regiment (Nova Zagora) and at least one additional unknown Signals Regiment in the Rila-Pirin mountain massif. The modern successor of the 62nd Signals Brigade are the Stationary Communication and Information System (Стационарна Комуникационна Информационна Система (СКИС)) of the Defence Staff (which fulfills also the tasks of SIGINT and Cyber Defence next to its strategic communications mission) and the Mobile Communication and Information System (Мобилна Комуникационна Информационна Система (МКИС)) of the Joint Forces Command.\n** Electronic Warfare Department (Отдел за Радиоелектронна Борба към Генералния Щаб (ОРЕБ-ГЩ)) (a General Staff department, headed by a Colonel)\n*** Stationary Battalion for Radiojamming (Стационарен Батальон за Радиосмущения)\n*** Unit for Radioelectronic Control (Отряд за Радиоелектронен Контрол'') (The unit's task was to control the radioelectronic signature of the own forces and to manage their survivability against jamming by the enemy.

УБАЕ)) with its Yak-11 trainers from Telish Air Base to Kamenets Air Base and transformed it into 2nd Combat Training Air Regiment (2ри Учебно-Боен Авиационен Полк (2. УБАП)) with its 2 Yak-11 squadrons transitioning to Yak-17 and Yak-23. In the following year the air regiment transitioned to MiG-15/MiG-15bis/UMiG-15, and then to MiG-17s in 1963.\nIn 1967 the 2nd Combat Training Air Regiment split in two separate combat-training air regiments. The 1st Combat Training Air Regiment relocated to Shtraklevo Air Base close to Ruse with two MiG-17 squadrons and a third squadron relocated to Dolna Mitropoliya. The remainder of 2nd Combat Training Air Regiment stayed in Kamenets with two MiG-17 squadrons, retaining its designations. In 1969 the 1st Combat Training Air Regiment (1 CATR) formed a fourth MiG-17 squadron at Dolna Mitropoliya (1st and 2nd at Straklevo, 3rd and 4th at Dolna Mitropoliya AB). In 1971 the 3rd and 4th Squadrons split from the 1st CTAR, becoming 1st and 2nd Squadrons of a newly formed 3rd Combat Training Air Regiment at Dolna Mitropoliya. The replacement of the MiG-17 with Aero L-29 Delfín jet trainers started in 1964 at 2nd CTAR at Kamenets with small numbers used for the training of flight instructors. In 1965 the training of air force cadets on the L-29 started from the 3rd Squadron of 1st CTAR at Dolna Mitropoliya, and continued with the progress in deliveries with the 1st and 2nd Squadrons in Shtraklevo and the newly formed 4th Squadron in Dolna Mitropoliya.\nThe 2nd CTAR converted its 1st Squadron to MiG-21 in 1984 and its 2nd Squadron to L-39 in 1986.\n* '''People's Higher Air Force School \"Georgi Benkovski\"' (Висше Народно Военновъздушно Училище \"Георги Бенковски\" (ВНВВУ)) (Dolna Mitropoliya Air Base)\n** Shtraklevo Airfield (near Ruse)\n*** 1st Combat Training Air Regiment (1ви Учебно-боен Авиационен Полк (1ви УБАП))\n**** 1/1st Training Air Squadron, flying L-29 Delfín\n**** 2/1st Training Air Squadron, flying L-29 Delfín\n**** 3/1st Training Air Squadron, flying L-29 Delfín\n*** 34th Independent Aviation Technical Battalion (34ти Отделен Авио-технически Батальон (34ти ОАТБ))\n*** 12th Independent Battalion for Signals and Radio- and Lighting Technical Support (12ти Отделен Батальон за Свръзки и Радиосветотехническо Осигуряване (12ти ОБРСТО))\n** Kamenets Airfield (near Pleven)\n*** 2nd Combat Training Air Regiment (2ри Учебно-боен Авиационен Полк (2ри УБАП))\n**** 1/2nd Training Air Squadron, flying MiG-21PFM/UM\n**** 2/2nd Training Air Squadron, flying L-39ZA Albatros\n*** ?

Heavily concentrated on Bulgaria's iron curtain border with NATO members Greece and Turkey the Border Troops would have come under the Ministry of People's Defence in times of war. After the Cold War the border troops were reformed as Border Police.\nUntil 1946 the Bulgarian border guard was a task of the regular army and each infantry regiment in proximity of the border had a border guard company. In 1946 the new Communist regime formed an independent service, dedicated to the border security on August 10, 1946, as the Border Militsiya, but this name lasted only until October 8, when it was renamed to Border Troops. The service initially numbered 8 Border Sectors (Гранични сектори (ГС)). The service was modeled on the Soviet Border Troops. Unlike them the Bulgarian Border Troops were not part of the State Security service, but subordinated to the Ministry of the Interior (between 1962 and 1972 to the Ministry of People's Defence). The internal structure of the troops was overhauled with ministerial order #44 from March 9, 1950, as follows:\n* the highest formations (the Border Sectors) were renamed into Border Detachments (Гранични Отряди (ГО), an equivalent of a motorised rifle regiment in the army, but with a smaller manpower, and increased from 8 to 10)\n* the battalion equivalents were renamed from Border Sections to Border Commandatures (Гранични Комендатури (ГК))\n* the company equivalents were renamed from Border Subsections to Border Outposts (Гранични Застави (ГЗ))\nAs a military formation each Border Detachment had its Command, Staff and supporting units. The number of the detachments varied through the Communist Era from 8 sectors at the formation of the Border Troops, to 10 in 1950 and 17 at the height of the service's build-up, to 12 in 1989, of which 1 was a training formation. The organization of the Border Troops, as published by the Committee for Disclosing the Documents and Announcing Affiliation of Bulgarian Citizens to the State Security and Intelligence Services of the Bulgarian People's Army (A public commission, authorised by law of the Parliament to study the repressive apparatus of the Communist regime and to establish the connection of individuals to it) in a collection book of declassified documents, was as follows:\nDirectorate of the Border Troops (Управление на Гранични войски (УГВ))\n* Headquarters (Щаб, with 11 departments, such as Operations; Combat Training; Communications; Engineering etc.)\n* Intelligence Section (Разузнавателно отделение (РО))\n** Intelligence Desk (Разузнаване (Р))\n** Counter-Intelligence Desk (Контраразузнаване (К))\n* Political Section (Политическо отделение (ПО), with 8 departments, such as Political Education; Editorial of the Border Troops official magazine; Technical Editorial; Library etc.)\n* Rear (Тил, logistical services, 5 departments)\n* Training Border Detachment (Учебен Граничен Отряд (УГО)) (Ivaylovgrad, former 18th Border Detachment)\n* Sergeant School for Working Dog Handlers (Сержантска школа за инструктори на служебни кучета (СШИСК) (Berkovitsa)\n* Supply and Support Battalion (Батальон за Обслужване и Осигуряване (БОО))\n* Border Detachments:\n** 1st Border Detachment - Vidin (1ви Граничен Отряд – Видин (1 ГО))\n*** including a Border Ships Division (Дивизион Гранични Кораби) for patrols on the Danube river\n** 2nd Border Detachment - Dragoman (2ри Граничен Отряд – Драгоман (2 ГО))\n** 11th Border Detachment - Kyustendil (11ти Граничен Отряд – Кюстендил (11 ГО))\n** 3rd Border Detachment - Petrich (3ти Граничен Отряд – Петрич (3 ГО))\n** 6th Border Detachment - Gotse Delchev (6ти Граничен Отряд – Гоце Делчев (16 ГО))\n** 4th Border Detachment - Smolyan (4ти Граничен Отряд – Смолян (4 ГО))\n** 5th Border Detachment - Momchilgrad (5ти Граничен Отряд – Момчилград (5 ГО))\n** 13th Border Detachment - Lyubimets (13ти Граничен Отряд – Любимец (13 ГО))\n** 6th Border Detachment - Elhovo (6ти Граничен Отряд – Елхово (6 ГО))\n** 7th Border Detachment - Malko Tarnovo (7ми Граничен Отряд – Малко Търново (7 ГО))\n** 8th Border Detachment - Burgas (8ми Граничен Отряд – Бургас (8 ГО))\n*** including a Border Ships Division (Дивизион Гранични Кораби) for patrols on the Bulgarian Black Sea coastline\nThe border guards were conscripts, which underwent their training at the border detachment they were assigned to. After that those, who have displayed higher skills in the training process were sent to the Training Border Detachment for an NCO course. Of them small numbers were selected for training as working dog handlers at the K-9 Sergeant School. The officer candidates of the Border Troops studied at the Ground Forces Combined Arms Higher School in Veliko Tarnovo and the career development of Border Troops officers was carried out through courses at the Military Academy in Sofia and training institutes of the Soviet Border Troops in the Soviet Union.\nInterior Troops\nThe Interior Troops (Bulgarian: Вътрешни Войски (ВВ)) did not exist throughout the whole period of Communist rule in Bulgaria. They were formed during two distinct periods in the presence of a significant organized paramilitary force in opposition to the regime. The first such threat was the Goryani movement. In a report to the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party dated from October 12, 1948, the at the time Minister of the Interior Anton Yugov informs that for combating the anti-communist partisans 13 special combat units with 1 350 men in total have been formed. He brings to the attention of the committee, that due to their composition of regular Militsioners, family men in their mid-30s and older, a rising tension and physical strain has been observed because of the long periods of patrolling and fighting in the mountains where the Goryanes were active. For that reason Yugov suggests that a specialized Interior Troops arm should be formed in order to facilitate the utilization of conscripts for the Ministry of the Interior with the same conditions of military service as the conscripts of the Bulgarian Army, but trained in the specific counter-insurgency skills needed for such operations. In his report the minister suggests that initially about 1 000 conscripts should be trained by the 13 special combat units in order to relieve their personnel, after which additional 3 000 should be inducted to boost their numbers, with the corresponding reduction in manpower of the regular Militsiya by 3 000 men. Later the numbers of the IT increased to a division and even after the Goryani movement was destroyed their build-up continued to over 12 000 in two divisions and two specialized brigades with their own tanks, artillery, AAA, combat engineers etc., before their abrupt disbandment in 1961.\nThe second installment of the Bulgarian Interior Troops is from 1985 in connection to the Revival Process. A wave of terror attacks in the first half of the 1980s, including a bomb attack on a special passenger train coach for mothers traveling with little children on March 9, 1985, at Bunovo railway station, organized by the Turkish National-Liberation Movement terror organization, called for the re-establishment of a dedicated counter-insurgency paramilitary force in the structure of the Ministry of the Interior, to deal with the internal terror threat in cooperation with the State Security (Държавна Сигурност (ДС)) and the People's Militsiya (Народна Милиция (НМ)). The Interior Troops were tasked with counter-insurgency in mountainous and woodland terrain, riot control and security of locations of particular and strategic importance. The force was reinstated in 1985 and at the Boyana Roundtable Conference in the first half of 1990 convened between the Bulgarian Communist Party (recently renamed to Bulgarian Socialist Party) and the Union of Democratic Forces to reach an agreement about the reform of the country in light of radical changes in Eastern Europe it was publicly made clear (in response to a question), that the Interior Troops number 2 000 men in 6 battalions, plus the SOBT. The latter however is incorrect. The Specialized Counter-Terrorism Force (abbreviated SOBT in Bulgarian) has from its formation to present day (2017) been the premier counter-terrorism unit of the country, strategically subordinated directly to the Minister of the Interior as an independent agency in its own right. The confusion comes from the fact, that a security regiment of the IT has been based in Vranya, near the former Vrana Palace in barracks recently vacated by the State Security's Fifth Department (Department for Safety and Protection) (Пето управление (Управление за безопасност и охрана (УБО)), the higher state functionaries' close protection service. Since the abolition of the Bulgarian monarchy the palace has been turned into an official residence with permanent presence from the Ministry of the Interior. The battalion in question was the quick reaction paramilitary force for the capital Sofia. In fact the Vranya Battalion and the SOBT are located in adjacent barracks, which causes the confusion. The Interior Troops battalions were organised as rifle battalions with BTR-60s, trucks, automatic rifles, machine guns, mortars and anti-tank rockets. In 1990-91 the Border and the Interior Troops were amalgamated into the Troops of the Ministry of the Interior (Войски на МВР), then separated again. In 1993 the Interior Troops were renamed into Gendarmery, the traditional name from the time of the monarchy, banned after that for their role in hunting down communist partizans. Recently the Gendarmery has been absorbed into the Ministry of the Interior's Main Directorate \"National Police\" and as of 2017 the former Interior Troops and Gendarmery after that exist in the form of Specialized Police Forces (Специализирани Полицейски Сили) within the National Police. In 1989 they consisted of:\n* Interior Troops Directorate (Управление \"Вътрешни войски\") (Sofia) (Detachment 72300)\n** 1st Independent Operational Security Regiment (1ви Самостоятелен Оперативно-охранителен Полк) (Vrana Palace, Sofia) (Detachment 72345 (44270 before the establishment of the IT))\n** 1st Independent Operational Battalion (1ви Самостоятелен Оперативен Батальон) (Kardzhali) (Detachment 72350)\n** 2nd Independent Operational Battalion (2ри Самостоятелен Оперативен Батальон) (Razgrad) (Detachment 72355)\n** 3rd Independent Operational Battalion (3ти Самостоятелен Оперативен Батальон) (Dzhebel) (Detachment 72360)\n** 4th Independent Operational Battalion (4ти Самостоятелен Оперативен Батальон) (Novi Pazar) (Detachment 72365)\n** 5th Independent Operational Battalion (5ти Самостоятелен Оперативен Батальон) (Brezovo) (Detachment 72370)\n** 6th Independent Operational Battalion (6ти Самостоятелен Оперативен Батальон) (Burgas) (Detachment 72375)\nMinistry of Transport\nTransport Troops\nThe troops of the Ministry of Transport, called the Transport Troops (Bulgaria) (:bg:Войски на Министерството на транспорта, ВМT) (or Railway Troops), were a paramilitary construction organization subordinate to the Ministry of Transport, which existed from 1975 to 2001. It dealt mainly with the construction of highways and railways. They were a paramilitary formation divided into railway construction brigades and automobile transportation brigades tasked with the construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure. In case of war the Transport Troops would have come under the Ministry of People's Defence.\nBy Decree No. 4 of January 14, 1888, the first paramilitary railway unit was established - the Railway Company of the Pioneer Regiment in Ruse. The first railway officer in Bulgaria was the future general Petar Lolov.\nThe Transport Troops themselves were established by Decree No. 147 of 27 January 1975 on the basis of the Railway and Liaison Construction Brigade of the Ministry of Transport, established in 1965.\nPosts and Telecommunications Committee\nSignal Troops\nThe Posts and Telecommunications Committee Troops (Войски на Комитета по пощи и далекосъобщения) were a paramilitary formation tasked with building and maintaining the communication infrastructure of state institutions, including phone lines, TV towers, civil air traffic communications, etc. In war time the troops would have fallen under the Ministry of People's Defence.\nReferences\n*\n* |author=William J.
