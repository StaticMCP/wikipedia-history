He was educated at Elstree and Harrow School from 1876, where he developed an interest in classics, science and music (particularly in violin playing); however, he did not attend university. In 1879 he joined the family firm of Allen and Son, solicitors, in Soho, London. The practice office was located close to the violin-making district and Heron-Allen made the acquaintance of Georges Chanot III, a distinguished violin maker, and learned how to make violins making some himself. He subsequently produced a book on violin making that was still in print over a hundred years later.\nIn 1885 he studied the Turkish language with Garabet Hagopian, the Armenian envoy in London. In addition to Hagopian, Heron-Allen sought the guidance of Charles Wells, a Turkish lexicographer.\nHe was an expert on the art of chiromancy or palmistry, having read palms and analysed the handwriting of luminaries of the period, he wrote several books on the subject and in 1886 went on a lecture tour of the United States.\nOn his return from the USA he returned to his legal practice in London, but found time to develop his other interests, including the study of Persian. He made friends with Mirza Malkom Khan (Nāẓem-al-Molk), the famous Persian Minister in London and in 1896 he studied colloquial Persian with Mirza ʿAlinaqi of the Persian Legation. In 1897 he began studying with Edward Denison Ross, Professor of Persian at University College, London. He published a literal translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1898) from the then earliest manuscript in the Bodleian Library, followed by other studies of various versions up to 1908. He also published a translation entitled The Lament of Baba Tahir (1901) from a little-known Persian dialect, Luri.\nWhen Heron-Allen's father died in 1911, Heron-Allen retired from practising the law and permanently moved to Selsey in West Sussex. There he produced a book on the history and prehistory of Selsey. He compiled a library of 12,000 books, including a collection of rare books on the violin, which he bequeathed to the Royal School of Music.\nA supporter of his local parish church in Selsey, he donated a Church organ to them. It was built and supplied by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1912, and dedicated to the memory of Heron-Allen's late father.\nHeron-Allen also served in World War I and his journal was eventually published in 2002.\nHe joined the staff of the Directorate of Military Intelligence MI7b at the War Office in May 1918, where he dealt specifically with aerial propaganda.\nHe spent many years studying foraminifera, for this work he was eventually elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1919.\"\nHeron-Allen's foraminiferal collections and associated library were bequeathed to the Natural History Museum, London and are now housed in a special room on the second floor of the Department of Palaeontology named The Heron-Allen Library, in his honour. The collection is not just of Heron-Allen's books, but also contains the reprints and manuscripts along with the ephemera which Heron-Allen bound with them, including the associated correspondence, photographs, field-notes, the various proof stages, miscellaneous invoices, artwork, as well as postcards and letters from recipients of his reprints.\nHeron-Allen also wrote on archaeology, Buddhist philosophy, the cultivation, gourmet appreciation of and culture of the asparagus, as well as a number of novels and short stories of science fiction and horror written under his pseudonym of \"Christopher Blayre.\nHeron-Allen was also noted for his fiction writing, especially his stories which were early examples of horror and fantasy.\nTitles and accolades\nFollowing list taken from Who, Was Who.\n* FRS 1919  – Fellow of the Royal Society.\n* FLS – Fellow of the Linnean Society.\n* FGS – Fellow of the Geological Society.\n* FZS – Fellow of the Zoological Society.\n* FRMS – Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society.\n* MRIrish Academy(Hon) – Member of the Royal Irish Academy.\n* Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia – Member of the Academy of St Cecilia, Rome.
