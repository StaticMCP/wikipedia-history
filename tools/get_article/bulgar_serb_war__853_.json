It was the second conflict of the medieval Bulgarian–Serbian Wars.\nPrelude and the War\nAfter the death of Prince Vlastimir of Serbia in  850, his state was divided between his sons. Vlastimir and Presian, Boris' father, had fought each other in the Bulgar-Serb War (839–42), which resulted in a Serbian victory. Boris sought to avenge that defeat, an in 853 or 854, the Bulgar army led by Vladimir-Rasate, the son of Boris I, invaded Serbia, with the aim to replace the Byzantine overlordship on the Serbs. The Serbian army was led by Mutimir and his two brothers, who defeated the Bulgars, capturing Vladimir and 12 boyars. Boris I and Mutimir agreed on peace (and perhaps an alliance), and Mutimir sent his sons Pribislav and Stefan to the border to escort the prisoners, where they exchanged items as a sign of peace. Boris himself gave them \"rich gifts\", while he was given \"two slaves, two falcons, two dogs, and 80 furs\".\nAftermath\nAn internal conflict among the Serbian brothers resulted in Mutimir banishing the two younger brothers to the Bulgarian court. Mutimir, however, kept a nephew, Petar, in his court for political reasons. The reason of the feud is not known, though it is postulated that it was a result of treachery. Petar would later defeat Pribislav, Mutimir's son, and take the Serbian throne.\nSee also\n* Bulgarian–Serbian medieval wars\n* Bulgar-Serb War (839–42)\n* Medieval Bulgarian Army\n* Medieval Serbian Army\nReferences\nSources\n;Primary sources\n*\n;Secondary sources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
