The station is located on Phaya Thai Road to the south of the Victory Monument, one of the landmark and major traffic intersection of Bangkok. The station is linked to all four corners of the traffic circle by a skybridge which almost traverses around the monument. There are many food stalls, clothing shops and malls around the station, as the monument is one of the largest BMTA bus stops in Bangkok and a large van terminal for travel to the suburbs and provinces around the capital.\nSee also\n* Bangkok Skytrain"
