It stars Sara Montpetit as Sasha, a teenage vampire who befriends Paul (Félix-Antoine Bénard), a boy with suicidal tendencies.\nPlot\nIn her childhood, Sasha, a vampire, is traumatized after her family attacks and eats a clown they had hired to perform at her birthday. As a result, Sasha's fangs do not sprout and she is uncomfortable with the idea of killing people for food. Years later, she still refuses to kill and still does not have fangs.\nOne night, Sasha notices a teenager, Paul, attempting to jump from atop a building, but he eventually does not. Later, Sasha's fangs suddenly emerge when she encounters him again. In a panic, she runs back home where her parents have decided that she will live with her older cousin, Denise, to learn how to hunt people.\nSasha is reluctant to learn and attracts attention as Denise feeds on JP, a man they had lured earlier, distracting her and turning him into a vampire. She reunites with Paul at a support group meeting for people experiencing suicidal thoughts. After the meeting, the two agree to help each other with Sasha assisting in his suicide and feeding on him. However, Sasha's fangs disappear, and she tries to stall by asking him if he has a dying wish. Paul says he would like to get payback on Henry, his co-worker who constantly bullies him.\nWhen they find out that Henry has gone to a party, Paul becomes hesitant about getting payback in front of everyone. Sasha suggests he could practice to boost his confidence. Paul then decides to get payback on a popular girl at school, his gym teacher, and his principal.\nAt the party, Henry taunts Paul, and Paul bites his hand. As they run away, Sasha collapses from hunger. Paul then cuts his hand to feed her his blood. Henry and his friends find them and start beating Paul up. Sasha's fangs suddenly emerge, and she kills Henry and urges Paul to go home.\nDenise demands Paul must also be killed while she helps Sasha bury Henry's body, but Sasha knocks Denise out. Sasha runs to Paul and they decide to run away, but at a hotel room, Paul doubts their success. He urges Sasha to turn him into a vampire. After being persuaded, she bites him, turning him into a vampire, but he starts struggling to breathe. Sasha calls her family, who are able to save him by feeding him a bloodbag.\nSome time later, Sasha and Paul arrive at a hospice his mother is working at, where they are directed to a terminally ill patient's room. Sasha plays the keyboard for the patient as Paul drains the patient's blood into a bag.\nCast\nProduction\nHumanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person was shot in fall 2022 in Montreal.\nRelease\nHumanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2023.

It also screened in the Noves Visions section at the 56th Sitges Film Festival. The film was released in Canada on October 13, 2023, by H264. Drafthouse Films acquired distribution rights for the United States, with the film being released in Los Angeles and New York City on June 21, 2024, before expanding to more cities the following week.\nReception\nCritical response\nNikki Baughan of Screen Daily wrote that \"Louis-Seize leans heavily into European arthouse influences for her French-language production. Sasha—who is, in fact 68 (although still a teenager in human years)—is presented as something of an ingenue, her long dark hair, blunt fringe and doe eyes giving her both a vulnerability and an intriguing edge. She listens to vinyl, she plays the keyboard, she is by nature (and necessity) a loner. Her connection with Paul is immediate and surprising, and the chemistry between the two is authentic.\"\nThe film was included in TIFF's annual Canada's Top Ten list for 2023.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award / Film Festival\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Venice International Film Festival\n| September 9, 2023\n| Giornate degli Autori, Best Director\n| rowspan=2| Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row rowspan=2 |Calgary International Film Festival\n| September 25, 2023\n| RBC Emerging Canadian Artist\n|\n|\n|-\n| October 3, 2023\n| Audience Choice Award, Canadian Narrative Feature\n| rowspan=3| Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row|Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival\n| September 28, 2023\n| Best French-Language Feature Film\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row|Festival du nouveau cinéma\n| October 15, 2023\n| National Competition, Grand Prize\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row|Directors Guild of Canada\n| October 21, 2023\n| Jean-Marc Vallée DGC Discovery Award\n| rowspan=2| Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=row|Windsor International Film Festival\n| October 29, 2023\n| Best Canadian Film\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\"| Vancouver Film Critics Circle\n| rowspan=\"3\"| February 12, 2024\n| Best Canadian Film\n| Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Best Female Actor in a Canadian Film\n| Sara Montpetit\n|\n|-\n| One to Watch\n| Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Toronto Film Critics Association\n| March 4, 2024\n| Rogers Best Canadian Film Award\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Prix collégial du cinéma québécois\n| April 5, 2024\n| Best Film\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=12| Canadian Screen Awards\n|rowspan=12| 2024\n|Best Picture\n|Jeanne-Marie Poulain, Line Sander Egede\n|\n|rowspan=6|\n|-\n|Best Director\n|Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Best Lead Performance in a Comedy Film\n|Félix-Antoine Bénard\n|\n|-\n|Sara Montpetit\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Best Supporting Performance in a Comedy Film\n|Steve Laplante\n|\n|-\n|Noémie O'Farrell\n|\n|-\n|Best Original Screenplay\n|Ariane Louis-Seize, Christine Doyon\n|\n|\n|-\n|Best Art Direction/Production Design\n|Ludovic Dufresne\n|\n|rowspan=5|\n|-\n|Best Costume Design\n|Kelly-Anne Bonieux\n|\n|-\n|Best Editing\n|Stéphane Lafleur\n|\n|-\n|Best Casting in a Film\n|Tania Arana\n|\n|-\n|John Dunning Best First Feature\n|Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=22| Prix Iris\n|rowspan=22| December 8, 2024\n|Best Film\n|Jeanne-Marie Poulain, Line Sander Egede\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Director\n| Ariane Louis-Seize\n|\n|rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Best Actor\n| Félix-Antoine Bénard\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| Sara Montpetit\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Steve Laplante\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=3| Best Supporting Actress\n| Marie Brassard\n|\n|-\n| Sophie Cadieux\n|\n|-\n| Noémie O'Farrell\n|\n|-\n| Revelation of the Year\n| Félix-Antoine Bénard\n|\n|-\n| Best Screenplay\n| Ariane Louis-Seize, Christine Doyon\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Art Direction\n| Ludovic Dufresne\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Kelly-Anne Bonieux\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| Shawn Pavlin\n|\n|-\n| Best Editing\n| Stéphane Lafleur\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Original Music\n| Pierre-Philippe Côté\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound\n| Marie-Pierre Grenier, Simon Gervais, Luc Boudrias, Thierry Bourgault D'Amico\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Hairstyling\n| Jean-Luc Lapierre\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n| Best Makeup\n| Tania Guarnaccia\n|\n|-\n| Best Visual Effects\n| Marie-Claude Lafontaine, Jean-François Ferland, Simon Beaupré\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n| Best Casting\n| Tania Arana\n|\n|-\n| Most Successful Film Outside Quebec\n| Jeanne-Marie Poulain, Line Sander Egede, Ariane Louis-Seize, Christine Doyon, Stéphanie Demers, Jean-Christophe J.
