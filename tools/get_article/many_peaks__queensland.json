It is one of four small townships within the locality of Boyne Valley along with Nagoorin, Builyan and Ubobo.\nHistory\nGureng Gureng (also known as Gooreng Gooreng, Goreng Goreng, Goeng, Gurang, Goorang Goorang, Korenggoreng) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gureng Gureng people. The Gooreng Gooreng language region includes the towns of Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Miriam Vale extending south towards Childers, inland to Monto and Mt Perry.\nThe township was briefly called Nanandu, but the name was changed back to Many Peaks in July 1909 to avoid being confused with the town of Nanango. The Many Peaks Range runs to the east and south east of the Boyne Valley. The Many Peaks Boarding House had been conducted by Mrs Nina Jensen at Nanandu for several years previously.\nNanandu Post Office opened by August 1907, was renamed Many Peaks in July 1909 and closed in 1977.\nNanandu Provisional School opened in March 1909. On 1 April 1909, it was renamed Many Peaks State School. It closed in 1973. It was at 5 Wentworth Street ().\nMany Peaks Hospital was opened on October 15th 1909 and remained in use until the 1990s when the Boyne Valley Primary Healthcare Clinic was opened in nearby Builyan.\nThree shops were destroyed by fire in Many Peaks in January 1916 with the Theatre Grand, a large building, also damaged due to a lack of an available fire brigade or sufficient water to fight the blaze.\nNicholas Gianis Veneris (Nicholas Hellen) purchased a property with an established café and fruit orchard in Many Peaks in 1915-1916 and in time he was to become one of the first Greek immigrants to serve as a Councillor for the Calliope Shire Council.\nMany Peaks Railway Camp Provisional School opened on 23 Oct 1922 as part of the railway construction camp (57 Mile Camp) for the Gladstone to Monto railway line. In 1923, it was relocated south to the 63 Mile Camp. In 1926, it moved south to 67 Mile Camp and was renamed Barrimoon Provisional School (Barrimoon being the name of the railway station there). In 1927, it moved again to 74 Mile Camp and its name was changed in 1928 to Kalpowar Provisional School. In 1929, it moved to 82 Mile Camp and in September 1930 it was renamed Bancroft Provisional School. On 1 August 1931, it became Bancroft State School and remained there permanently until its closure on 31 December 1998.\nHeritage listings\nMany Peaks has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Glassford Creek Smelter Sites, off Many Peaks Road\n* The Builyan Cemetery (formerly the Many Peaks Cemetery) is on the Gladstone Regional Council's Local Heritage Register.
