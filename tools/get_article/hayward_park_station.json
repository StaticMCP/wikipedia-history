It is located just to the north of the State Route 92 overcrossing, about  south of the site of the original Southern Pacific station in Hayward Park (known as Leslie Station prior to 1936). It was relocated in 1999 because of a lack of parking at the original site, and because the previous station had been sited along a curve in the tracks near 16th Avenue. The present station has two side platforms, with at-grade signalized and gate-protected pedestrian/bicycle crossings of the tracks at both its north and south ends.\nThis station is planned to be modified to accommodate through-running California High-Speed Rail service.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.caltrain.com/stations/haywardparkstation.html Caltrain Hayward Park station page]"
