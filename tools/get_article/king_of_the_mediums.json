It was sold by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 1522-1529 in its catalogues, where it was advertised with the descriptive subtitle apparitions fantômatiques (ghostly apparitions). The film has sometimes been referred to by this subtitle.\nNo English-language release is known for this film, but the translated title King of the Mediums has been used in film reference.
