The group emerged in mid-1994 and was a breakaway faction of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), which was led by Charles Taylor in full Charles Ghankay Taylor (born January 27, 1948, Liberia).\nProminent figures in the NPFL-CRC were Sam Dokie and Tom Woewiyu, a defense chief in Taylor's alternative government based in the Bong County town of Gbarnga. Both men cited strategic and ideological differences as the cause of their defection.\nThe NPFL-CRC did engage in small battles with the NPFL around Gbarnga and northern Liberia, but was not a major force in the conflict.\nReferences"
