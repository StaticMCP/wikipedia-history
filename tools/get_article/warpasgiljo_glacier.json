This glacier was discovered by and named for the four Geological Party Expedition members of the West Base of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS), in aerial flights and from ground surveys in November–December 1940, as part of the Antarctic Expedition of 1939-1941 led by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd.\nThis glacier was later renamed Arthur Davis Glacier by US-SCAN for Rear Admiral Arthur C. Davis, an early leader in aviation in the United States Navy.\nWest Base Geological Party Expedition\nIn February 1940, shortly after West Base was set up in Little America III,  Dr. Paul Siple directed an airplane flight from the West Base to the Edsel Ford Ranges to determine where exploration and geological work was to be done during the next summer season, and numerous aerial photographs were taken.   During the long winter months that followed, fairly accurate maps were made of the Southern Edsel Ford Ranges. This is an area of approximately  of mountainous coastland in the northwestern region of Marie Byrd Land.   During the 1940 winter night, a Geological Party Expedition of four men was organized and they prepared for the extremely long trek on two dog sleds to the Edsel Ford Ranges. The four-man party was composed of Lawrence A. Warner, leader and geologist, Charles F. Passel, geologist and radio operator, Harold P. Gilmour \"Gil\", recorder and collector of biological specimens and Loran Wells \"Joe\", photographer and observer.\nThe Geological Party's Expedition objective was to map and geologically survey as much of the southern portion of the Edsel Ford Range as possible, and additionally investigate the natural resources of the area and triangulate accurately for improved maps of the region. The four-man Geological Party Expedition left the West Base on October 17, 1940 and returned 82 days later on January 7, 1941 traveling a total of  on board their two dog sleds. In the nearly three-month expedition, they had to be supported by airplanes that deposited supplies at  intervals along their charted route. The Geological Party Expedition explorers discovered and visited for the first time some 50 peaks, valleys and glaciers in this region and some 300 geological specimens were collected. Warpasgiljo Glacier was one of those features discovered.\nAll four explorers of the West Base Geological Party Expedition were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award of the United States that can be bestowed by Congress. This medal, designated the \"United States Antarctic Expedition Medal\" was awarded by a Special Act of Congress, authorized on September 24, 1945 (Public Law 185, 79th Congress), for their contribution to the success of the 1939-1941 Polar Exploration to Antarctica.\nEtymology\nThe extensive Warpasgiljo Glacier was discovered and named for the four members of the West Base Geological Party Expedition:\nWARner + PASsel + GILmour + JOe = WARPASGILJO.\nIt is believed that members of US-SCAN were unaware of the origin of this name.\nExpedition Dog Sleds used in Little America III\nDuring the 1939-1941 Expedition, dog sleds were the most reliable form of ground exploration in Antarctica. A dog sled team capable of transporting two men contained nine dogs. They could haul around  per dog, for a total of .  For a 30-day expedition, some  of food were needed for the two men and the dogs. The other  were used for fuel and camping equipment.  With good weather in the Antarctic summer, they could travel  per day, or a total of .\nReferences"
