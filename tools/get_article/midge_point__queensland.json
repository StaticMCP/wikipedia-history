In November 1938, the Queensland Government and the Pioneer Shire Council had not come to an agreement in relation to paying for the road, so the Queensland Government decided to release the land prior to the road's development. On 23 December 1938, the first town land sites were sold in Midgeton. At the time, Midgeton was described as follows:\"Midgeton is noted for its large stretch of unbroken sandy beachand safe bathing. A grassy esplanade runs to high-water mark, and there is a plentiful supply of fresh water. In adjacent waters there are excellent fishing grounds and a number of good catches were reported during the holidays.\" In 1973 the town's name was changed to Midge Point.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Midge Point had a population of 464 people.\nIn the , the locality of Midge Point had a population of 435 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Midge Point.
