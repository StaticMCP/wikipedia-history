Led by The Mentor, these Daleks ally themselves with the humans against the \"Enemy Daleks\" of our universe.  Nevertheless, Kalendorf almost immediately suspects his new allies of being as sinister as the Daleks of his own universe. Desperately, he forms a plan, one that may rid the galaxy of both Daleks.\nCast\n*Kalendorf - Gareth Thomas\n*Siy Tarkov - Steven Elder\n*Saloran Hardew - Karen Henson\n*Marber/Drudger/Sparks - Ian Brooker\n*Mirana - Teresa Gallagher\n*Alby Brook - Mark McDonnell\n*The Mentor - Hannah Smith\n*Dr Johnstone - Simon Bridge\n*Herrick/Trooper #1/Vaarga Man - Jeremy James\n*Susan Mendes - Sarah Mowatt\n*Morli - Dannie Carr\n*The Daleks - Nicholas Briggs\n*Scientist - Simon Bridge\n*Allenby - Mark Donovan\n*Trooper #2 - David Sax\n*Godwin - Helen Goldwyn\n*Command/Computer/Technician - Jack Galagher\nReferences"
