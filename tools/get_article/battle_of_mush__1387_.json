The Qara Qoyunlu refused to submit to the Timurids. Timur accused the Qara Qoyunlu of attacking and looting a Hajj caravan, using it as justification to launch an invasion.\nDeparting from Nakhchivan in 1387, Timur's forces first captured the fortress of Bayazid (also known as Aydın Castle). He then approached the fortress of Avnik, held by Mısırlı Hoca, son of Qara Muhammad. Unable to take the formidable fortress, Timur encamped near the Çapakçur River and dispatched three wings of his army under his son Miran Shah, Muhammad Mirek, Sheikh Ali, Iqbalshah, and Tilek Kavçin.\nQara Muhammad, along with his son Qara Yusuf, withdrew to narrow mountain passes and ambushed the Timurid forces, inflicting heavy losses.\nBattle\nQara Qoyunlu historian Abu’l-Muzzi Hamadani recounts:\nTimur appointed the brave and renowned general Jahanshah Bahadur to lead his forces. When Qara Muhammad received this news, he gathered his emirs and commanders and declared:\nHis commanders replied:\nJahanshah Bahadur led his army toward Qara Yusuf's forces. Qara Yusuf skillfully divided his troops into four wings. These began launching volleys of arrows (referred to as Kiyāni bows and Hadhang arrows). Each arrow felled a Timurid soldier.\nQara Yusuf suddenly charged the Timurid army, further disorienting them. The Timurid ranks collapsed under this coordinated assault. Jahanshah, seeing many of his soldiers wounded, fled the battlefield.\nAftermath\nJahanshah managed to escape and report to Amir Timur. Enraged, Timur personally led another campaign against the Qara Qoyunlu. According to Qara Qoyunlu chronicles, Qara Muhammad lacked the manpower to resist Timur but still chose to fight, retreating into narrow gorges to evade the superior Timurid forces.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Qara Qoyunlu\n* Qara Yusuf\n* Amir Timur"
