It was released on August 5, 1997 through Wu-Tang/Priority Records.\nBackground\nRecording sessions took place at 36 Chambers Studio in Manhattan and 4th Chamber Studio in Steubenville. Production was mainly handled by member 4th Disciple, except for two tracks that were produced by the RZA, who also served as executive producer. It features guest appearances from Hell Razah, Masta Killa, Prodigal Sunn and Streetlife. The album features the singles \"Camouflage Ninjas\" b/w \"Wake Up\" and \"Wu-Renegades\" b/w \"Clash of the Titans\".\nThe group consists of six rappers: Killa Sin, Beretta 9, Islord, 9th Prince, P.R. Terrorist and ShoGun Assasson; and one producer, 4th Disciple, who produced the majority of the album. Like Black Lung's album of the same name, the title was taken from a document that came to light in the mid-1980s detailing an alleged New-World Order plan for world domination, a topic that was explored in Milton William Cooper's infamous book Behold a Pale Horse.\nReception\nSilent Weapons initially received mixed reviews from critics, who saw the group as a low-rent version of the Wu-Tang Clan because of similarities in the group's street-oriented Five-Percenter rhymes and dark production. The album was well received by Wu-Tang and underground hip hop fans—acclaimed for its unique combat themes and stellar production work. The album peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200 and number 10 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums in the United States.\nTrack listing\n| extra1 = 4th Disciple\n| length1 = 3:36\n| title2 = Clash Of The Titans\n| note2 = featuring Street Life\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 = 4th Disciple\n| length2 = 3:38\n| title3 = Burning Season\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = 4th Disciple\n| length3 = 4:12\n| title4 = Blood For Blood\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = 4th Disciple\n| length4 = 3:50\n| title5 = Seems It Never Fails\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 = 4th Disciple\n| length5 = 2:27\n| title6 = Universal Soldier\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 = 4th Disciple\n| length6 = 4:13\n| title7 = Love, Hell or Right\n| writer7 = Bogard\n| extra7 = 4th Disciple\n| length7 = 1:09\n| title8 = Wake Up\n| note8 = featuring Hell Razah and Prodigal Sunn\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 = RZA\n| length8 = 4:59\n| title9 = Fair, Love & War\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = 4th Disciple\n| length9 = 4:06\n| title10 = Wu-Renegades\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 = 4th Disciple\n| length10 = 3:49\n| title11 = Full Moon\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 = 4th Disciple\n| length11 = 3:31\n| title12 = Under Siege\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = 4th Disciple\n| length12 = 4:06\n| title13 = Shelter\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 = 4th Disciple\n| length13 = 3:41\n| title14 = Camouflage Ninjas\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = 4th Disciple\n| length14 = 4:48\n| title15 = Swinging Swords\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = 4th Disciple\n| length15 = 3:53\n| title16 = War Face\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = )}}\n| length16 = 4:28\n| title17 = 5 Stars\n| note17 = featuring Masta Killa\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 = 4th Disciple\n| length17 = 4:12\n| total_length = 1:04:38\n}}\nPersonnel\n*Terrance \"9th Prince\" Hamlin – performer (tracks: 1-6, 8, 10, 11, 14-17)\n*Jamal \"ShoGun Assasson\" Alexander – performer (tracks: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12-14, 16, 17)\n*Jeryl \"Killa Sin\" Grant – performer (tracks: 1, 3, 6, 8-11, 15, 16)\n*Domingo \"Dom Pachino\" Del Valle – performer (tracks: 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17)\n*Samuel \"Beretta 9\" Murray – performer (tracks: 2, 4, 9, 10, 12-14, 16, 17)\n*Rodney \"Islord\" Stevenson – performer (tracks: 5, 8)\n*Patrick \"StreetLife\" Charles – performer (track 2)\n*Chron \"Hell Razah\" Smith – performer (track 8)\n*Vergil \"Prodigal Sunn\" Ruff – performer (track 8)\n*Elgin \"Masta Killa\" Turner – performer (track 17)\n*Selwyn \"4th Disciple\" Bougard – producer (tracks: 1-7, 9-15, 17), co-producer (track 16), engineering, mixing\n*Robert \"RZA\" Diggs – producer (tracks: 8, 16), executive producer\n*Joseph M.
