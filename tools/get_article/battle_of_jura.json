Due to this, Lieutenant General Felipe Rivero y Lemoine would order General Puello to evacuate Azua, also adding the news that there was an independence conspiracy in the city of Santo Domingo. Like General Puello, Lieutenant General José de la Gándara and the Marquis of Las Carreras, Lieutenant General Pedro Santana were summoned to Santo Domingo. On October 9, 1863, Spanish troops and loyalist families evacuated from Azua in three ships to Santo Domingo. That same day, Azua was captured by General Pedro Florentino.\nThe action of Lieutenant General Rivero to evacuate the city prevented General Florentino from finishing off the Spanish troops and Lieutenant General De la Gándara would say in his book, Annexation and War of Santo Domingo, that:\nEusebio Puello would later be promoted to the rank of Field marshal of the Spanish Army for his performance in the battle, and Lieutenant General Rivero awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic for his merits on the Jura River and his operations in Baní.\nSee also\n*Eusebio Puello\n*Pedro Florentino\nReferences"
