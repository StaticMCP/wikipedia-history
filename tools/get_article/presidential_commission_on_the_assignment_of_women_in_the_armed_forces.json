Women military personnel had engaged in combat in the most recent U.S. military actions: Grenada in 1983 Panama in 1989, and the Gulf War in 1991.  Senator William V. Roth (R-DE) introduced a Senate bill in 1991 to clarify women's roles in the armed forces, including combat.\nRepresentative Patricia Schroeder (D-CO1) and Beverly B. Byron (D-MD6) then convinced the House Armed Services Committee to amend the House bill under consideration for military appropriations for 1992 and 1993 to allow combat roles for military women.  In the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator John Glenn (D-OH) opined that a thorough review and study of the issue of women's role in the armed services would take up to 18 months.\nSenator Sam Nunn (D-GA), Chair of the Senate Committee, then introduced several Senate bills—102 S. 1507, 102 S. 1508, 102 S. 1509, and 102 S. 1515—to create just such a commission.  The Congressional conference committee chosen to reconcile the House and Senate versions of bills for 1992-1993 military appropriations (of which Sen. Nunn was a member) included creating the Commission in the approved 1992-1993 military appropriations law.\nOfficial name\n\"Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces\"\nEnabling authority\n* Public Law 102-190, National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1992 -1993 (December 5, 1991).

One survey polled 1,500 adults in the United States via telephone with a 20-minute survey. Those polled split 50-50 when asked if they supported the current policy categorically restricting women from combat assignments.  50% of those polled would allow women assigned to combat only if they volunteered. 50% of those polled favored drafting or conscripting women during national emergencies or wartime.  However, 65% of those polled opposed requiring married women with children assigned to combat.\n:The second survey mailed questionnaires to 8000 members of the U.S. armed services. Overall, 57% of the respondents supported the current policy categorically restricting women from combat assignments.  72% of the respondents currently assigned to combat supported the current policy. 78% of the respondents serving in the Marine Corps supported the current policy.,\n*Moskos Survey\n:Dr. Charles Moskos (a member of the commission) and Ms. Laura Miller, both of Northwestern University, conducted a survey of 1651 U.S. Army soldiers on the roles of women in the U.S. armed services in 1992. Of the women soldiers surveyed, over 70% favored allowing women volunteers to serve in combat roles, but only 12% said they would volunteer.\n*Navy Personnel Research and Development Center\n:The NPRDC conducted longitudinal studies covering 1988, 1990, and 1992 on reasons for time lost from active duty by Navy personnel. They reported to the commission that pregnancy rates among women Naval personnel were similar to those in the civilian population. Their studies found that single parents had negligible effect on naval activities. They further found that naval personnel held the perception that pregnant women adversely affected ship operations.\n*Commission Survey of Retired Flag and General Officers\n:The commission conducted its own survey of the 6,109 known retired flag and general officers in four all branches of the U.S. armed services. Those surveyed were overwhelmingly white males. A little over half responded, with the representation ranging from 70% from the Marine Corps to 41% from the Navy.  A majority of respondents opposed assigning combat roles to women. The degree of opposition correlated directly to the age of the respondents; older respondents voiced greater opposition to assigning women to combat than younger respondents. The biggest concern 56%) of the majority was that women's presence would adversely affect combat unit cohesion.\nFact-finding trips by commission members to Armed Services installations\n*Air Force = 5 installations visited\n:--4th Composite Wing internal, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC\n:--USAF Weapons and Tactics Center, Nellis AFB, NV (2 visits)\n:--Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape School, Fairchild AFB, WA\n:--HQ US Central Command, MacDill AFB, FL\n:--HQ, US Special Ops Command, MacDill AFB, FL\n*Army = 5  installations visited\n:--4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, CO\n:--1st Infantry Division, Fort Riley, KS\n:--24th Mechanized Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA\n:--XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, SC\n:--U.S. Military Academy, West Point, NY\n* Foreign Military Representatives = 6 countries consulted\n:--Canada\n:--Denmark\n:--Israel\n:--Russia\n:--The Netherlands\n:--United Kingdom\n*Marines = 4 installations visited\n:--II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, NC\n:--Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, SC\n:--USMC Air-Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, CA\n:--USMC Officer Candidate and Basic Schools, Quantico, VA\n*Navy = 9 installations visited\n:--U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD\n:--Norfolk Naval Station, Norfolk, VA\n:--Navy Fighter Weapons School, NAS Miramar, CA\n:--Navy Surface Fleet, Pacific, Naval Station 32nd Street, CA\n:--Navy Special Warfare Command, Naval Amphibious Base, CA\n:--Aircraft Static Display, Naval Air Station Glenview, IL\n:--Carrier Air Wing 3, USS John F.

A gender-neutral assignment policy for qualified persons should be used.  The term \"qualified\" is determined solely by law and policy.\n:Commission vote—Yes=10, No=2, Abs=3\nC.\tFitness/Wellness Standards\n:Current good health practices are not linked either to specific assignments or gender but rather to the highest levels of general fitness/wellness for the armed services.\n:Commission vote—Yes=12, No=0, Abs=1, NV=2\nD.\tOccupational Physical Requirements\n:The armed services should adopt specific requirements for those occupational specializations requiring muscular strength, endurance, or cardio-vascular capacity without regard to gender.\n:Commission vote—Yes=9, No=4, Abs=2\nE.\tBasic Training Standards\n:Entry-level physical training may be gender-specific as necessary for specific assignments.\n:Commission vote—Yes=8, No=6, Abs=1\nF.\tPre-Commissioning Standards\n:Physical training in the military academies, officer candidate schools, and the Reserve Officer Training Corps already have appropriate gender-neutral and gender-specific programs in place. These programs do not appear to compromise either combat performance or combat readiness.\n:Commission vote—Yes=10, No=4, Abs=1\nG.\tGender-Related Occupational Standards\n:Gender-neutral muscular strength, endurance, and cardiovascular capacity requirements may be adopted for those specialties for which they are relevant.\n:Commission vote—Yes=14, No=0, Abs=0, NV=1\nH.\tParental and Family Police\n:The Defense Department should review all policies regarding single and dual-service parents. Policies on recruitment, retention, deployment, and child care for such personnel require either new policies or better implementation of existing policies.\n:Commission vote—Yes=9, No=0, Abs=1, NV=5\nI.\tPregnancy and Deployability Policies\n:Consistency of application and force readiness should drive Defense Department policies regarding pregnancy.  Current pregnancy rates among women aviators do not hamper unit performance or readiness.\n:Commission vote—Yes=8, No=0, Abs=2, NV=5\nJ.\tCombat Roles for Women\n:While circumstances exist where female personnel may be assigned to combat situations, unit readiness for combat should be the main policy concern.\n:Commission vote—Yes=8, No=1, Abs=1, NV=5\nK.\tGround Combat\n:Women may not be assigned to direct land combat units.\n:Commission vote—Yes=10, No=0, Abs=2, NV=5\nL.\tCombat Aircraft\n:Women may not be assigned to fly in combat-mission aircraft. \"The one vote margin by which this issue was resolved illustrates the deeply divided views that exist to the assignment of women to combat aircraft\"\n:Commission vote—Yes=8, No=7, Abs=0\nM.\tCombatant Vessels\n:Women may be assigned to all naval vessels except amphibious craft and submarines.  The navy should modify vessels to accommodate women when needed as part of normally scheduled maintenance.\n:Commission vote—Yes=8, No=6, Abs=1\nN.\tSpecial Operations\n::Retain the existing policies excluding female personnel from assignment to Special Forces.\n:Commission vote—Yes=14, No=0, Abs=0, NV=1\nO.\t \"Risk Rule\"\n:The \"risk rule\" is standard operating procedure whereby the exposure of women members of the armed services to situations involving injury, death, or capture is avoided. The \"risk rule\" should be retained except for women serving on naval vessels.\n:Commission vote—Yes=9, No=4, Abs=2\nP.\tTransition Process\n:The further integration of female personnel into existing military units should be done according to an individual's physical and professional qualifications for the assignment. This transition period should proceed in a timely fashion adhering to best operating procedures.  Modifications of existing equipment and facilities for women personnel should be carried out during scheduled routine maintenance\n:Commission vote—Yes=11, No=3, Abs=1\nQ.\tConscription\n:Women should be excluded from any draft or conscription for required military service.\n:Commission vote—Yes=11, No=3, Abs=0, NV=1\nAlternative views\n:Five members of the commission — Cockerham, Donnelly, O'Beirne, Ray, and White - wrote a 38 page section in the Final Report entitled \"The Case Against Women in Combat\".  They argued that the proponents of assigning women to combat did not prove the necessity of their case. The five members repeated and emphasized the evidence and personal testimony the Commission collected that cast doubt on combat roles for women. \"Most importantly\", they stated, \"(combat roles for women) would overturn two centuries of settled law and military policy based on deeply held and commonly shared cultural assumptions defining how men should treat women\".\nSee also\n*Women in the Military: United States\n*Women in warfare (1945-1999)\n*Women in warfare (2000-present)\nReferences\nSources\n*The Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces: Report to the President, November 15, 1992.
