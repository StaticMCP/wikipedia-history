Ward was the inaugural Kevin Sheedy Medallist in 2012 and is a dual Brett Kirk Medallist. He was one of three inaugural Greater Western Sydney co-captains, leading the club for eight seasons, and is the club's games record holder with 267 games.\nEarly life\nWard is the grandson of former South Melbourne captain Bill Gunn, who played 104 games for the club between 1952 and 1959. He grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Spotswood and played junior football for Spotswood Football Club in the Western Region Football League. Leading into the 2007 AFL draft, five player managers vied to represent him, and a week out from the draft he decided on Paul Connors, who also represented Chris Judd. Ward was selected by the Bulldogs with their second selection (number 19 overall) after being a mere 20 days old enough to nominate for the draft.\nAFL career\nWestern Bulldogs (2008–2011)\nWard made his debut against  in round 11 of the 2008 season, collecting 12 disposals and finishing with one goal. In his debut year, he played six games while juggling full-time football and his last year of high school. Having earned a regular spot in the team in 2009, Ward went on to have a breakout season, playing 22 games and earning an AFL Rising Star nomination for his performance against  in round 18. Ward missed the first half of the 2010 season through injury, but returned to play the rest of the season and finals series. Ward had his best season for the Bulldogs in 2011, playing in all 22 games and averaging 21 disposals, including a 29-disposal, best-on-ground performance against  in round 13.\nGreater Western Sydney (2012–2025)\nparade]]\nOn 5 September 2011, Ward announced that he had signed with the Greater Western Sydney Giants; he was the second player to publicly announce his commitment to the new franchise club. Ward was also announced as one of three inaugural co-captains for the club, alongside Phil Davis and Luke Power. On 24 March 2012, in the Giants' debut AFL match against , he kicked the Giants' first ever goal. Ward went on to win the Giants' inaugural best-and-fairest award, named the Kevin Sheedy Medal after their coach, Kevin Sheedy.\nWard enjoyed a solid season in 2013, despite the club winning only one game for the year; Ward was named best-on-ground for his 31 disposals and four goals in that game, against . Ward followed up with another consistent season in 2014, in which he polled fifteen Brownlow Medal votes. This included four best-on-ground performances, two of which were narrow seven-point losses to  and .\nWard had a career-best season in 2015, playing all 22 games and averaging 25 disposals, and polling a club-record nineteen Brownlow votes. Ward had another consistent season in 2016, during which the Giants made finals for the first time, securing their first finals win against Sydney, and fell six points short of making the Grand Final after losing to Ward's former club, the Western Bulldogs. Ward played all 25 games the following season, averaging 27 disposals.\nIn 2018, Ward played his 200th game in round 8 against , and played his 150th game for the Giants (becoming the first player to do so) in round 19 against St Kilda. Ward sustained a knee injury during the 2019 pre-season, meaning that he would miss the first few rounds of the season and his consecutive games streak would end at 95 games. He returned against  in round 4; however, five minutes into the game, he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury, ruling him out for the rest of the season. He later began assisting Giants coach Leon Cameron on the interchange bench during matches while recovering from his injury. In December 2019, Stephen Coniglio took over the captaincy of the Giants from Ward and Davis.\nWard made a successful return from injury in round 2 of the 2020 season against . He missed the round 5 match against Hawthorn due to soreness, before suffering a right knee injury upon his return against  the following week.\nIn round 12, 2025, in what was widely considered to likely be Ward's final season, Ward ruptured his Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the opening minutes against  at Sydney Showground Stadium. Having being carried off in tears, Ward addressed his teammates in the three quarter time huddle, inspiring them to a comeback victory from 28 points behind in the final quarter. Following the season-ending injury, Ward announced his retirement from AFL football in August 2025.\nStatistics\nUpdated to the end of 2025.\n|-\n| 2008 ||  || 14\n| 6 || 2 || 0 || 28 || 32 || 60 || 18 || 10 || 0.3 || 0.0 || 4.7 || 5.3 || 10.0 || 3.0 || 1.7 || 0\n|-\n| 2009 ||  || 14\n| 22 || 18 || 13 || 178 || 184 || 362 || 70 || 86 || 0.8 || 0.6 || 8.1 || 8.4 || 16.5 || 3.2 || 3.9 || 0\n|-\n| 2010 ||  || 14\n| 10 || 1 || 4 || 76 || 97 || 173 || 36 || 34 || 0.1 || 0.4 || 7.6 || 9.7 || 17.3 || 3.6 || 3.4 || 0\n|-\n| 2011 ||  || 14\n| 22 || 12 || 11 || 204 || 253 || 457 || 74 || 96 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 9.3 || 11.5 || 20.8 || 3.4 || 4.4 || 6\n|-\n| 2012 ||  || 8\n| 20 || 8 || 11 || 278 || 210 || 488 || 86 || 100 || 0.4 || 0.6 || 13.9 || 10.5 || 24.4 || 4.3 || 5.0 || 5\n|-\n| 2013 ||  || 8\n| 21 || 11 || 6 || 247 || 242 || 489 || 95 || 94 || 0.5 || 0.3 || 11.8 || 11.5 || 23.3 || 4.5 || 4.5 || 4\n|-\n| 2014 ||  || 8\n| 20 || 7 || 10 || 240 || 258 || 498 || 75 || 115 || 0.4 || 0.5 || 12.0 || 12.9 || 24.9 || 3.8 || 5.8 || 15\n|-\n| 2015 ||  || 8\n| 22 || 10 || 7 || 253 || 303 || 556 || 103 || 115 || 0.5 || 0.3 || 11.5 || 13.8 || 25.3 || 4.7 || 5.2 || 19\n|-\n| 2016 ||  || 8\n| 24 || 16 || 12 || 272 || 287 || 559 || 82 || 109 || 0.7 || 0.5 || 11.3 || 12.0 || 23.3 || 3.4 || 4.5 || 12\n|-\n| 2017 ||  || 8\n| 25 || 14 || 10 || 353 || 324 || 677 || 90 || 98 || 0.6 || 0.4 || 14.1 || 13.0 || 27.1 || 3.6 || 3.9 || 11\n|-\n| 2018 ||  || 8\n| 24 || 8 || 15 || 318 || 324 || 642 || 92 || 95 || 0.3 || 0.6 || 13.3 || 13.5 || 26.8 || 3.8 || 4.0 || 13\n|-\n| 2019 ||  || 8\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 1.0 || 0.0 || 1.0 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 0\n|-\n| 2020 ||  || 8\n| 7 || 3 || 1 || 56 || 48 || 104 || 16 || 11 || 0.4 || 0.1 || 8.0 || 6.9 || 14.9 || 2.3 || 1.6 || 0\n|-\n| 2021 ||  || 8\n| 24 || 15 || 5 || 278 || 267 || 545 || 90 || 71 || 0.6 || 0.2 || 11.6 || 11.1 || 22.7 || 3.8 || 3.0 || 8\n|-\n| 2022 ||  || 8\n| 22 || 8 || 7 || 247 || 230 || 477 || 103 || 58 || 0.4 || 0.3 || 11.3 || 10.4 || 21.7 || 4.7 || 2.6 || 1\n|-\n| 2023 ||  || 8\n| 25 || 11 || 12 || 243 || 248 || 491 || 71 || 70 || 0.4 || 0.6 || 9.7 || 10.9 || 19.6 || 2.8 || 2.8 || 3\n|-\n| 2024 ||  || 8\n| 20 || 13 || 2 || 193 || 175 || 368 || 87 || 54 || 0.7 || 0.1 || 9.7 || 8.8 || 18.4 || 4.4 || 2.7 || 0\n|-\n| 2025 ||  || 8\n| 12 || 6 || 2 || 90 || 91 || 181 || 42 || 12 || 0.5 || 0.2 || 7.5 || 7.6 || 15.1 || 3.5 || 1.0 ||\n|- class=sortbottom\n! colspan=3 | Career\n! 327 !! 163 !! 128 !! 3556 !! 3573 !! 7129 !! 1230 !! 1228 !! 0.5 !! 0.4 !! 10.9 !! 10.9 !! 21.8 !! 3.8 !! 3.8 !! 97\n|}\nNotes\nHonours and achievements\nTeam\n* NAB Cup (): 2010\nIndividual\n* Greater Western Sydney Giants co-captain: 2012–2019\n* Greater Western Sydney games record holder\n* Kevin Sheedy Medal: 2012\n* Robert Rose Award: 2018\n* 2× Brett Kirk Medal: 2014 (game 1), 2017 (game 2)\n* Australia representative honours in international rules football: 2011\n* AFL Rising Star nominee: 2009\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
