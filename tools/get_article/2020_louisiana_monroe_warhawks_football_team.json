The Warhawks played their home games at Malone Stadium in Monroe, Louisiana, and competed in the West Division of the Sun Belt Conference. They were led by fifth-year head coach Matt Viator. After the team played to an 0–10 record (0–7 in conference play), Viator was fired on December 7 in what was the worst season in the history of the program.  Not only did the team finish winless for only the third time in its history, but that was combined with 10 losses for the most losses in a winless season.  Also, the 50 point loss to Louisiana, their main rival, was the largest margin of defeat suffered in the history of the rivalry for either squad.\nPreseason\nRecruiting class\n|}\nSun Belt coaches poll\nThe Sun Belt preseason coaches poll was released on August 25, 2020.
