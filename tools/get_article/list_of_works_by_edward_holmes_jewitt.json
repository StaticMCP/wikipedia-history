He was one of the two chief designers, along with Carl Almquist, for the Lancaster firm of Shrigley and Hunt, producers of stained glass windows and church-fittings.  In recent years his work has begun to be studied and admired, though claims that he was a genius have not gone uncontested.  Jewitt designed many windows for locations in the Home Counties, Yorkshire, and above all the north-west of England, and there are scattered examples elsewhere.\nWorks\nBecause of the destruction by fire of most of the company's records in 1973 many Shrigley and Hunt windows can be attributed to individual designers only on stylistic grounds, if at all.  Any list of E. H. Jewitt's works is therefore necessarily incomplete.  However, unless otherwise stated, all of the following Shrigley and Hunt windows have been firmly attributed to Jewitt as designer.\nEngland\nBedfordshire\n* Bedford, St Paul's Church.
