There were 19 Nirun tribes (marked (N) in the list) that descended from Bodonchar and 18 Darligin tribes (marked (D) in the list), which were also core Mongolic tribes but not descending from Bodonchar. The unification created a new common ethnic identity as Mongols. Descendants of those clans form the Mongolian nation and other Inner Asian people.\nAlmost all of tribes and clans mentioned in the Secret History of the Mongols  and some tribes mentioned in the Tarikh-i-Rashidi, there are total 33 Mongol tribes.\nCore Mongolic tribes\n*\n*Khorilar\n*Dorben (N)\n*Uriankhat\n*'''Ma'alikh baya'ut (D)\n*Jarchi'ut Adangkhan (D)\n*Belgunot\n*Buyant\n*Bugunot\n*Khatagin (N)\n*Eljigin\n*Salji'ut\n**Jadaran (N)\n**Baarin (N)\n**Manan Ba'arin\n**Jaruud\n***Noyakin (N)\n***Barulas (N)\n***Buda'at (N)\n***Adargin/Adarkin (N)\n****Chonos (N)\n****Telenggut\n***Uru'ut (N)\n***Manghut (N)\n***Taichi'ut (N)\n****Süldüsün (D)\n****'Naked' Ba'arin\n***Besut (N)\n***Oronar\n***Khongkhotan\n***Arulad\n***Sunud\n***Khabturkhas\n***Gheniges\n***Yürki\n***Kiyat\n****Barlas }}}}\n***Jurkin\n***Khadagin\n***Mangkhol'\nKeraites\nThe Keraites were a Turco-Mongol Christian (Nestorian) nation.

They were defeated and absorbed into the Mongol nation early in the 13th century.\n*Uduyid; Mongolian: Uduid Mergid\n*Uvas, Uvas Mergid\n*Khaad''', Khaad Mergid\nNaimans\nIn The Secret History of the Mongols, the Naiman subtribe the \"Güchügüd\" are mentioned. According to Russian Turkologist Nikolai Aristov's view, the Naiman Khanate's western border reached the Irtysh River and its eastern border reached the Mongolian Tamir River. The Altai Mountains and southern Altai Republic were part of the Naiman Khanate. They had diplomatic relations with the Kara-Khitans, and were subservient to them until 1175. In the Russian and Soviet historiography of Central Asia they were traditionally ranked among the Mongol-speaking tribes. For instance, such Russian orientalists as Vasily Bartold, Grigory Potanin, Boris Vladimirtsov, Ilya Petrushevsky, Nicholas Poppe, Lev Gumilyov, Vadim Trepavlov classified them as one of Mongol, Other scholars classified them as a Turkic people from Sekiz Oghuz (means \"Eight Oghuz\" in Turkic). However, the term \"Naiman\" has Mongolian origin meaning \"eight\", but their titles are Turkic, and they are thought by some to be possibly Mongolized Turks. They have been described as Turkic-speaking, as well as Mongolian-speaking. Like the Khitans and the Uyghurs, many of them were Nestorian Christians or Buddhists.\nOngud\nThe Ongud (also spelled Ongut or Öngüt; Mongolian: Онгуд, Онход; Chinese: 汪古, Wanggu; from Old Turkic öng \"desolate, uninhabited; desert\" plus güt \"class marker\") were a Turkic tribe that later became Mongolized active in what is now Inner Mongolia in northern China around the time of Genghis Khan (1162–1227).\nMany Ongud were members of the Church of the East, They lived in an area lining the Great Wall in the northern part of the Ordos Plateau and territories to the northeast of it.\nDughlat\nThe Dughlats are mentioned in the Jami' al-tawarikh.\nOther groups mentioned in Secret History of the Mongols\nGroups whose affiliation is not really made clear: these groups may or may not be related to any of the tribes and clans mentioned above:\n*Olkhonud, the clan of Temüjin's mother (D); Mongolian: Olkhunuud\n*Khongirad, the tribe Börte, Temüjin's first wife, descends from (D)\n*some clans whose members join Temüjin after the first victory over the Merkit and the separation from Jamukha:\n**Jalair'\n**Tarkhut\n**'''Bishi'ut; Mongolian: Bishiüd\n**Bayads\n**Khinggiadai (D), Khinggit, subclan of Olhunoud; Mongolian: Khingid\n**Gorlos (D), subclan of Olhunoud\n**Ikires; Mongolian: Ikhires\n**Sakhait\n**Arulat (Mongolian:Arulad)(D)\n**Oronar\n*some clans that take part in Sangums conspiracy:\n**Khardakit\n**Ebugedjin; Mongolian: Övögjin\n**Kharta'at (N?)\n*Khorulas, clan that joins Chinggis at the Baljun lake\n*Tokhura'ut\n*Negus''' or Chonos tribe, clan whose chief is killed together with the 70 Chinos princes\nSee also\n* List of Mongol states\n*List of modern Mongol clans\n* Proto-Mongols\n* Zubu\n* Shiwei\nReferences"
