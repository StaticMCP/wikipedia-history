Until 1947, political officers were British and acted as local representatives of the British Empire and British Raj. Following its independence in 1947, India continued to appoint its own political officers until 1975, when Sikkim became the 22nd state of India following a referendum. The officer also oversaw British trade agencies in Tibet.\nList\n(Dates in italics indicate de facto continuation of office)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! No.\n! Portrait\n! Name\n! Term\n!
