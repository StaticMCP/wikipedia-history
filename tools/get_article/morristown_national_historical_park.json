On October 15, 1966, citing its significance in archeology, architecture, and military history, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nSites Conference\nJockey Hollow, a few miles south of Morristown, New Jersey along Route 202 in Harding Township, was the site of a Continental Army encampment. It was from here that the entire Pennsylvania contingent mutinied and later, 200 New Jersey soldiers attempted to emulate them.\nFort Nonsense occupied a high hilltop overlooking Morristown, and is believed to have been the site of a signal fire and earthworks.\nFord Mansion in Morristown was the site of the \"hard winter\" (December 1779 – May 1780) quarters of George Washington and the Continental Army. That winter remains the coldest on record for New Jersey. Theodosia Ford, widow of Jacob Ford Jr., and her four children shared their household with Washington, his staff, including Alexander Hamilton, their servants and sometimes their family members. Martha Washington traveled from Mount Vernon to Morristown to spend the winter with her husband.\n'''Washington's Headquarters Museum', the adjacent museum is open to the public Wednesday thru Sunday from September–June and seven days a week from July- August from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM.  The museum has three exhibit rooms and a sales area. A video production, Morristown: Where America Survived'' (New Jersey Network, 2009) is shown. The Ford Mansion is shown only by guided tour, which begins in the museum.\nThe New Jersey Brigade Encampment Site is located south of Jockey Hollow in Bernardsville in Somerset County. It was the encampment for approximately 1,300 Continental Army soldiers over the 1779-1780 winter.\nPark history\nIn April 1932, the National Park Service (NPS) published a report recommending that the site of the Continental Army's winter encampments in 1776-77 and 1779-80 become a Federal Historical Reserve; the report recommended including two sites, Jockey Hollow and the Ford Mansion.\nIn January 1933, a conference including NPS representatives, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, and civic and business leaders from the Morris County area, drafted a bill supporting the creation of a national historical park, with  \"the rank and dignity equal to the scenic program in the West.\"\nThe bill for creating the Morristown National Historical Park was submitted to Congress in mid-January (H.R. 14302; S. 5469) and was supported by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur, who called it \"the most important park project before this department at the present time.\"\nIn March 1933, in the last days of Herbert Hoover's presidency, the 72nd Congress established Morristown as the country's first National Historical Park.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Morris County, New Jersey\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.nps.gov/morr/index.htm National Park Service: Morristown National Historical Park]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20021017143230/http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/revwar/morr/morroverview.html NPS Museum Exhibit: Morristown]\n*[http://www.njskylands.com/hsmtnhp.htm NJ Skylands: Morristown National Historical Park]\n*[http://www.stateparks.com/morristown.html StateParks: Morristown National Historical Park]\n*[http://www.nynjtc.org/park/morristown-national-historical-park NY-NJTC: Morristown National Historical Park Trail Details and Info]"
