It stars Anson Mount, Erica Leerhsen, Robert Vaughn, Jake Weber, Jamey Sheridan, and Dan Hedaya. It follows a rookie lawyer who gets in over his head when he falls for the wife of a mafia boss he is assigned to prosecute.\nThe trials in The Warrior Class were based loosely on two cases Hruska tried as a young lawyer. The film was finished in 2004, and premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2005. It was released on DVD on February 6, 2007.\nPlot\nRookie lawyer Alec Brno has just been assigned the case of his career: exposing a billion-dollar oil scam led by a ruthless mafia boss, Phil Anwar. When he reluctantly falls for Phil's beautiful but drug-addicted wife, Annie Sullivan, who is also his key witness, Alec soon realizes that all the legal savvy in the world can't protect him from the dangerous reality of mob violence. In a system where criminals often walk free, sometimes courtroom warriors must take the battle for justice into their own hands.\nCast\nReception\nCritical response\nRonnie Scheib of Variety stated that \"strong cast builds considerable goodwill toward the narrative, but the script's internal logic is as formulaic and half-baked as the pic's action is blocky and unconvincing.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
