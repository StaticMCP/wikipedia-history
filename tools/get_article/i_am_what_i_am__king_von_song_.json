The song was released through OTF and Empire labels on October 9, 2020.\nIt extablishes connection between the Chicago and New York drill worlds as never seen before\n\"I Am What I Am\" peaked at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart by Billboard. In December 2020 was included in season 1, episode 8 of the TV series Power Book II: Ghost.\nBackground\nThe song dropped on the expected release date of Welcome to O'Block'' that was instead delayed by Von after having a dream about his late friend T. Roy and wanting to commemorate his friend birthday by also releasing his album on October 30, as stated by himself on his official Twitter page.\nIn an interview for Grammy Awards King Von said he linked up with Fivio Foreign because he thought the New York artist would have been great for the beat that was already been done.\nComposition\nThe song is defined \"propulsive\" by HipHopDx with Fivio coming first with a fiery opening verse where he pays homage to the late Pop Smoke. King Von makes the hook, which has the internal logic of a street nursery rhyme: \"I am what I am/What I'm not, See i'll never be.\" He also raps the second verse of the tune, in which he puts his vivid storytelling on display with more frightening street tales.\nThe Source describes their performance as a passing bars back and forth, while showing elite drill chemistry.\nThe beat was produced by Chopsquad DJ.\nMusic video\nThe official video was released the same day of the single drop, and is directed by Jerry Production. It finds Von and Fivio on O'Block, bringing dozens of supporters to Von's native O Block, as they sip Henny, count cash, and whip around in a Rolls Royce Wraith. The two emcees light up the block with their electric chemistry, evoking the chaotic energy of the earliest Chicago and Brooklyn drill music videos.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
