He played from 1940 to 1947, mostly with the New York Cubans and the Indianapolis Clowns.\nWhile pitching with the Cubans in 1944, he was credited with a 24-4 record against all opponents, though in his first two years with the team, his league ledger shows marks of 0-1 and 2-1. Records note that most of the teams games were played during that time were non-league teams.\nHoward was born in Daytona Beach, Florida. While attending Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, he was a three-time letterman, thus earning his nickname, \"Schoolboy.\"\nHis birthdate is sometimes listed as 1920.\nReferences\nExternal links\nand [https://www.seamheads.com/NegroLgs/player.php?playerID=howar02car Seamheads]"
