The parade was held to celebrate partisan capture of the village, where they put to trial local police collaborators, with around 500 local residents taking part in celebration. This was part of Rudnev's plan to attract German forces. However, German forces didn't dare to attack Dubovychi until 23 February, despite having three times more troops than the partisans.\nBattle\nOn 23 February, at 12pm, German infantry begun to approach Dubovychi from the direction of Zhukov settlement. As the punitive forces were 50 metres away from the village, partisans ambushed the forces. Two hours later, German cavalry approached from direction of another settlement, Yaroslavets. Partisans set up another ambush and withdrew to Dubovychi.\nAt 15pm, German infantry attacked Dubovychi from the eastern direction. The outcome of the battle was determined by the environment, as the thick leaden rain put German forces into unfavorable position and forced them to retreat.\nAftermath\nAs a result of unsuccessful German punitive expedition attack on Dubovychi, Germans lost around 100 troops. Partisans only suffered 3 dead. Partisans later dug out ammunition and firearms buried under snow in the Sloat Forest. This was a significant victory for partisans that allowed them to tie up German forces for 2 days.  Partisan commanders Kovpak and Rudnev later organised a defensive position in another settlement where a larger battle took place on 28 February.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
