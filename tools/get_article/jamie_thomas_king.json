He was educated at Dulwich College, Fine Arts College and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.\nCareer\nKing began his acting career in the theatre in the Royal National Theatre's production of Alan Bennett's The History Boys. He has acted extensively in American and European film and television productions. He is best known for playing poet Thomas Wyatt in the television series The Tudors.\nIn 2024 he starred in the short film The Light Before the Sun, which marked both the debut release from his Blackbird Productions studio and his first credit as a screenwriter.\nPersonal life\nHe is married to Canadian actress Tamara Podemski, with whom he launched the Blackbird Productions studio.\nIn 2016 Podemski gave birth to their second child Benjamin, who died just five days after birth, in Bath. A coroner's investigation later determined that the death was due to brain damage caused when a hospital delayed Podemski's caesarean section. The experience later inspired him to write a screenplay adaptation of James Titcombe's book ''Joshua's Story: Uncovering the Morecambe Bay NHS Scandal'', about Titcombe's own experience having a child die in infancy due to failures in the management of the National Health Service, which is planned for future release through Blackbird.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
