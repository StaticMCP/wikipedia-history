The stadium is owned by Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense. Inaugurated on September 19, 1954, the stadium was the home field of the Grêmio football club before being the team moved to Arena do Grêmio in December 2012. Currently, the venue is not in use by the club and suffers from lack of maintenance.\nHistory\nThe stadium was inaugurated on September 19, 1954, with a maximum capacity of 38,000 people. In 1980, the stadium was expanded, and its capacity increased to 85,000 people. In 1990, the upper ring bleachers were numbered, and the Olímpico Monumental's capacity decreased to 51,081 people.\nThe inaugural match was played on September 19, 1954, when Grêmio beat Nacional of Uruguay 2–0. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Grêmio's player Vitor.\nThe stadium's attendance record currently stands at 85,721, set on April 26, 1981, when Ponte Preta beat Grêmio 1–0.\nGrêmio won the Copa Libertadores at Estádio Olímpico Monumental on July 29, 1983, after defeating Peñarol from Uruguay in a difficult match.\nGrêmio moved from the Estádio Olimpico Monumental to the new Arena do Grêmio on December 8, 2012.\nOther uses\nThe stadium is also used for large concerts. The first concert in the history of the stadium was the former member of the band The Police, the singer-songwriter Sting. For this concert, 60,000 people were at the stadium to cheer him, and it was one of the largest international shows to have passed through the city of Porto Alegre. Two years later, it was time for Rod Stewart to perform at the stadium.
