She swept the state among every major demographic – gender, race, income, and educational attainment. According to exit polls, 67 percent of voters in the Arkansas Democratic Primary were white and they opted for Clinton by a margin of 62–35 compared to the 27 percent of African Americans who backed Clinton by an even larger  margin of 91–6.\nAfter his landslide defeat, the Sanders campaign reported that Hillary Clinton had notched wins in southern states including Arkansas because Bernie Sanders did not compete with her, although this claim was widely debunked.\nSee also\n* 2016 Arkansas Republican presidential primary\nReferences"
