The avifauna of the Czech Republic includes (as of October 2024) a total of 431 species, but this number may change as a major re-evaluation of both historical and contemporary records is currently underway. Of these 431 species, 8 have been introduced by humans.\nThis list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2022 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Czech Republic.\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.\n*(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Czech Republic\n*(I) Introduced - a species introduced to the Czech Republic as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions\nDucks, geese, and waterfowl\nOrder: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae\nAnatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.
