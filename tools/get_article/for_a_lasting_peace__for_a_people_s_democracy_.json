The first issue was published on 1 November 1947 from the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. Due to the Tito–Stalin split, the last issue to be published from Belgrade came out in June 1948; from July 1948 the newspaper was published from Bucharest, Romania, after a decision of the Second Cominform Conference to move the editorial office out of Belgrade.\nThe newspaper sought to promote exchanges between communist parties. The publication was banned by the French government in early 1951, after which a new French-language edition titled Paix et démocratie ('Peace and Democracy') began to be published in France.\nDuring the second Cominform meeting on 1 February 1948 in Belgrade, a permanent editorial board was chosen for the newspaper. This editorial board was under the leadership of Pavel Yudin. He was succeeded by Mark Mitin, after the Yugoslav expulsion. The publication of ''For a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy!'' ended in April 1956.\nDifferent Languages\nPublished weekly, it was issued in English, and under different titles, in the following languages:\n*French:\n*Russian:\n*Bulgarian:\n*German:\n*Spanish:\n*Czech:\n*Hungarian:\n*Polish:\nInitially, there had also been a Serbo-Croat language edition:\nZa_trajan_mir,_za_narodnu_demokratiju!--1947-11-10.pdf|The first Serbo-Croatian issue of 10 November 1947\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.bannedthought.net/International/Cominform/Cominform_on_Colonial_and_Dependent_Countries-1950-1953.pdf Five articles from 1950-1953]"
