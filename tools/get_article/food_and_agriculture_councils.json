The state FACs are composed of senior level officials of individual USDA agencies within each state, and in the mid-90s they played a major role in managing the reorganization of USDA's field office structure. Local FACs have consisted of USDA representatives at county or area-wide levels; and a national FAC at USDA's Washington headquarters has served as a liaison with the state and local FACs.\nReferences"
