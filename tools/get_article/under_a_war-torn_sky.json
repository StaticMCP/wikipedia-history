He's one of the best fliers, facing Hitler's Luftwaffe in the war-torn skies above Northern France, but when his plane is shot down on a mission behind enemy lines, Henry finds himself on a whole new battlefield. Wounded, hungry, and afraid, he struggles toward freedom on foot, relying on the kindness and cunning of the French Resistance to reach the next town alive. Each day brings him nearer to home and closer to danger. Yet even as Henry struggles a lot for his own survival in a hostile country, he quickly grows to realize the great peril that surrounds all the French people, and to admire the strength and determination of the freedom fighters who risk death to protect him. At the end he gets to see his home and family.\nAwards\nNotable Book in Social Studies for Young People (NCSS/CBC), 2002\nJefferson Cup Honor Book, 2002\nWinner, Borders’ Original Voices Award for Young Adult Literature, 2001\nBest Children's Books of the Year, 2002, Bank Street College of Education, CBC\nMaryland Black-eyed Susan Award, finalist, 2004-5\nIowa Teen Award, finalist, 2003-4\nPennsylvania Young Readers’ Choice, finalist, 2002-3\nSouth Carolina Jr. Book Award, finalist, 2003-4\nBooks About Trauma, Tragedy and Loss, 2002, CBC\nExternal links\n*[http://www.lmelliott.com Website for author L.
