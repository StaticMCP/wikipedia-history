In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD that is associated with H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For decades prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success. Among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.\nBackground\nBefore the 1950s, there were many microbiological descriptions of bacteria in the stomach and in gastric acid secretions, lending credence to both the infective theory and the hyperacidity theory as being causes of peptic ulcer disease. A single study, conducted in 1954, did not find evidence of bacteria on biopsies of the stomach stained traditionally; this effectively established the acid theory as dogma. This paradigm was altered when Warren and Marshall effectively proved Koch's postulates for causation of PUD by H. pylori through a series of experiments in the 1980s; however, an extensive effort was required to convince the medical community of the relevance of their work. Now, all major gastrointestinal societies agree that H. pylori is the primary nondrug cause of PUD worldwide, and advocate its eradication as essential to treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers. Additionally, H. pylori has been associated with lymphomas and adenocarcinomas of the stomach, and has been classified by the World Health Organization as a carcinogen. Advances in molecular biology in the late 20th century led to the sequencing of the H. pylori genome, resulting in a better understanding of virulence factors responsible for its colonization and infection, on the DNA level.\nPre-20th century\nHippocrates\n;Pre 16th century\n:Hippocrates first describes gastric symptoms.\n:Avicenna notes the relationship between gastric pain and mealtimes.\n;1586\n:Marcellus Donatus of Mantua performs autopsies and describes gastric ulcers.\n;1688\n:Johannes von Murault observes duodenal ulcers.\n;1728\n:Stahl hypothesizes that some fevers are related to gastric inflammation and ulceration.\n;1761\n:Pain is associated with stomach ulcers.\n;1799\n:Matthew Baillie publishes a description of ulcers.\nFrançois-Joseph-Victor Broussais\n;1812\n:Broussais discovers that if acute gastritis is untreated, it can become chronic.\n;1821\n:Nepveu argues for a relationship between gastritis and gastric cancer.\n;1822\n:William Beaumont first demonstrates the acidity of the stomach and a relationship between acid levels and mood.\n;1868\n:Kussmaul suggests using bismuth compounds, an antibacterial agent, to treat peptic ulcers (bismuth subsalicylate has since been used in many commercial drugs, including Pepto Bismol as part of antibacterial H. pylori treatment).

They deem it in the bottom 10% of papers submitted.

This became the first truly successful treatment for H. pylori with an eradication rate greater than 90%.\n;1985\n:Marshall publishes the results of self-induced infection.\n;1987\n:Drumm and colleagues following a study of children reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that Helicobacter pylori was specifically associated with primary or unexplained gastric inflammation and primary duodenal ulceration, whereas the bacteria were not found in association with secondary gastric inflammation and ulcers due to causes such as Crohn's disease or critical illness. Because gastritis and duodenal ulceration are rare in children, this study had the capacity to demonstrate that Warren and Marshall were correct in claiming that H. pylori was a specific pathogen rather than, as had been suggested by some, merely an opportunistic colonizer of an inflamed or ulcerated mucosal surface. This was the first time that New England Journal of Medicine, the world's leading medical journal, published a study on Helicobacter pylori.\n:Morris intentionally consumes H. pylori. Like Marshall, he becomes ill, but unlike Marshall, he is not completely cured by antibiotics.

Triple-therapy, modernized to a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics, soon becomes first line therapy for eradication.\n:World Congress of Gastroenterology recommends eradicating H. pylori to cure duodenal ulcers.\n:First report of resistance of H. pylori to the antibiotic metronidazole. Resistance of H. pylori to treatment will lead to the development of many different antibiotic and proton pump inhibitor regimens for eradication.\n;1992\n:Fukuda et al. prove ingestion of H. pylori causes gastritis in rhesus monkeys.\n:Covacci et al. sequence the CagA gene, which encodes for a cytotoxin-associated surface protein, which correlated strongly with strains of H. pylori that caused duodenal ulcers. This was the first description of a virulence factor for H. pylori infection determined by molecular techniques.\nGastric cancer\n;1994\n:Fujioka et al. prove similar results as those from Fukuda et al.\n:Patents for acid reducing drugs expire, removing financial incentive to resist antibiotics as treatment of PUD.\n:A conference held by National Institute of Health (USA) demonstrates the general acceptance of H. pylori as cause of PUD in the US.\n:The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer declares H. pylori a Group 1 carcinogen.\n:Parsonnet et al. describe an association between H. pylori and lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract. These malignant ulcers can also be treated by eradicating Helicobacter.\n;1997\n:Tomb et al. complete sequencing of the entire 1,667,867 base pairs of the H. pylori genome. This assists in identifying new virulence factors for the infectivity of H. pylori on the molecular level.\n;2001\n:Chan et al. show in a randomized control trial that eradication of H. pylori even prevents bleeding from ulcers that is caused by aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n;2002\n:The European Helicobacter Pylori Study Group published the Maastricht 2-2000 Consensus Report, suggesting a \"test-and-treat\" strategy for H. pylori in young patients without atypical symptoms. This strategy advocates the use of noninvasive testing to evaluate for H. pylori and simply treating if found, even in the absence of ulcer disease documented on endoscopy.\n;2005\n:Warren and Marshall are awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on H. pylori and PUD.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Barry J.
