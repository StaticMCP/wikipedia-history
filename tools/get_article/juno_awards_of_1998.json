The primary ceremonies at GM Place before an audience of 10&nbsp;000 on 22 March 1998.\nActor Jason Priestley of the television series Beverly Hills, 90210 hosted these ceremonies which were televised by CBC. A backstage internet telecast was also introduced for this year. Performers included Jann Arden, Econoline Crush, Leahy, Sarah McLachlan, Ron Sexsmith, and Shania Twain.\nNominations were announced on 11 February 1998. The previously combined Blues/Gospel category became separate Best Blues Album and Best Gospel Album categories as of this year.\nThe Canadian Music Hall of Fame welcomed David Foster as its 1998 inductee.\nControversy\nVancouver rap group Rascalz refused their Best Rap Recording award, citing that urban music was hidden in the untelevised Saturday ceremony, rather than being featured during the broadcast of the Sunday evening ceremonies. The band alleged that racism was a factor in the award's scheduling, and for several weeks cultural critics and hip hop musicians debated the issue – some suggested, in fact, that the hip hop award's lack of visibility could be seen as not just a result of Canadian hip hop's poor commercial performance, but also a contributing factor.\nThe award was moved to the main ceremony for the 1999 awards, where it was again won by Rascalz for their single \"Northern Touch\".\nNominees and winners\nBest Female Vocalist\nWinner: Sarah McLachlan\nOther Nominees:\n*Jann Arden\n*Terri Clark\n*Loreena McKennitt\n*Shania Twain\nBest Male Vocalist\nWinner: Paul Brandt\nOther Nominees:\n*Bruce Cockburn\n*John McDermott\n*Bruno Pelletier\n*Roch Voisine\nBest New Solo Artist\nWinner: Holly McNarland\nOther Nominees:\n*Lhasa\n*Dayna Manning\n*Amy Sky\n*Tariq\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Our Lady Peace\nOther Nominees:\n*Big Sugar\n*Blue Rodeo\n*Great Big Sea\n*The Tea Party\nBest New Group\nWinner: Leahy\nOther Nominees:\n*Age of Electric\n*Bran Van 3000\n*Matthew Good Band\n*Wide Mouth Mason\nSongwriter of the Year\nWinner: Sarah McLachlan with Pierre Marchand, \"Building A Mystery\" by Sarah McLachlan\nOther Nominees:\n*Jann Arden, \"Wishing That\", \"The Sound of\", \"Ode to a Friend\" by Jann Arden\n*Dean McTaggart, \"Dark Horse\" (with David Tyson and Amanda Marshall) by Amanda Marshall by Mjila Mason, \"Love's Funny That Way\" (with David Tyson and Tina Arena) by Wynonna and Tina Arena, \"Ma Huitieme Merville\" (with David Tyson) by Liane Foly\n*Odds, \"Someone Who's Cool\", \"Nothing Beautiful\", \"Suppertime\" by Odds\n*David Tyson, \"Dark Horse\" (with Dean McTaggart and Amanda Marshall) \"Beautiful Goodbye\" (with Christopher Ward), \"Trust Me This Is Love\" (with Dean McTaggart) by Amanda Marshall\nBest Country Female Vocalist\nWinner: Shania Twain\nOther Nominees:\n*Terri Clark\n*Beverley Mahood\n*Shirley Myers\n*Michelle Wright\nBest Country Male Vocalist\nWinner: Paul Brandt\nOther Nominees:\n*Julian Austin\n*Charlie Major\n*Jason McCoy\n*Duane Steele\nBest Country Group or Duo\nWinner: Farmer's Daughter\nOther Nominees:\n*Cindy Church with Ian Tyson\n*The Cruzeros\n*Prairie Oyster\n*Thomas Wade and Wayward\nInternational Achievement Award\nWinners:\nInternational Album\nSpice by Spice Girls\nBest Instrumental Artist\nWinner: Leahy\nOther Nominees:\n*Jesse Cook\n*Oscar Lopez\n*Robert Michaels\n*Mythos\nBest Producer\nWinner: Pierre Marchand, \"Building A Mystery\" by Sarah McLachlan\nOther Nominees:\n*Peter Cardinali and Ian Thomas, \"The Way of Things\" and \"Stuck in Between\" by The Boomers\n*Corey Hart, \"Miles to Go (Before I Sleep)\" and \"Where Is The Love\" by Celine Dion\n*Arnold Lanni, \"Superman's Dead\" and \"Clumsy\" by Our Lady Peace\n*Michael Phillip Wojewoda and Spirit of the West, \"Armstrong and the Guys\" and \"Our Ambassador\" by Spirit of the West\nBest Recording Engineer\nWinner: Michael Phillip Wojewoda, \"Armstrong and the Guys\" and \"Our Ambassador\" by Spirit of the West\nOther Nominees:\n*Lenny DeRose, \"Shine\" and \"Pearly White\" by Junkhouse\n*Kevin Doyle, \"The Lark in the Clear Air\" and \"Barbara Allan\" by John McDermott\n*Chad Irschick, \"Godspeed\" and \"Constance\" by Ron Hynes\n*Randy Staub, \"Volcano Girls\" by Veruca Salt and \"The Unforgiven II\" by Metallica\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: David Foster\nWalt Grealis Special Achievement Award\nWinner: Sam Feldman\nNominated and winning albums\nBest Album\nWinner: Surfacing, Sarah McLachlan,\nOther Nominees:\n*Creature, Moist\n*Clumsy, Our Lady Peace\n*Come on Over, Shania Twain\n*Kissing Rain, Roch Voisine\nBest Children's Album\nWinner: ''Livin' in a Shoe, Judy & David\nOther Nominees:\n*Chickee's on the Run, Heather Bishop\n*Enchantee, Carmen Campagne\n*Planet Lenny, Lenny Graf\n*The Truck I Bought From Moe, Al Simmons\nBest Classical Album (Solo or Chamber Ensemble)\nWinner: Marc-André Hamelin Plays Franz Liszt, Marc-André Hamelin\nOther Nominees:\n*Bach: The Six Partitas, Angela Hewitt\n*Grainger: Piano Music, Marc-André Hamelin\n*Haydn: Four Piano Trios, The Gryphon Trio\n*La Jongleuse - Salon Pieces and Encores, Janina Fialkowska\nBest Classical Album (Large Ensemble)\nWinner:  Mozart Horn Concertos, James Sommerville, CBC Vancouver Orchestra, Mario Bernardi\nOther Nominees:\n*Carnaval Romain, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, conductor Charles Dutoit\n*Bizet: Symphony in C, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, conductor Charles Dutoit\n*Tabuh-Tabuhan, Music of Colin McPhee, Esprit Orchestra, Alex Pauk\n*Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No. 4, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste, piano Alexei Lubimov, Toronto Mendelssohn Choir\nBest Classical Album (Vocal or Choral Performance)\nWinner:  Soirée française, tenor Michael Schade, baritone Russell Braun, Canadian Opera Company Orchestra, Richard Bradshaw\nOther Nominees:\n*Carl Orff: Carmina Burana'', F.A.C.E.
