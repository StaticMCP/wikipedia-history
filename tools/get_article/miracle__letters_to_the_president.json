She liked the scenic beauty of locales and wrote, \"Their [Park Jeong-min, Lee Seong-min, Lim Yoon-ah, and Lee Su-kyung] ensemble and the beautiful background where you can feel the four seasons from spring to summer, autumn, and winter add to the immersion and leave a lasting impression in the heart.\" Kang wrote about the film in the opening of review, \"It touches the hearts of the viewers slowly and permeates. A genius boy's 'miracle' brings laughter and sometimes tears. This is the story of the movie The Miracle.\" Kim Seong-Hyun reviewing the film for YTN wrote that the performance of the actors was excellent but, \"despite the strong performances of these actors, the film story is overly dramatic and weakens the narrative link. The conflict structure in the film and the process of resolving it are to the point that it feels forced and artificial..\" Concluding the review Seong-Hyun said, \" The Miracle ends with Richard Sanderson's famous song \"Reality\", which was also used in the movie La Boum in the 80s. The lyrics of the song 'Dream is my reality' are as beautiful as Junkyung's dream, but it is not enough to erase the bitter taste.\"\nKim Ji-eun of Newsis in her review praised the performances of\nPark Jeong-min, Yoona Lim, Lee Seong-min and Lee Soo-kyung, writing, \"The character shines with the strong performances of the actors.\" She opined that the film set in 1980s have \"captured the nostalgic sensibility of that era\", and \"the sentimental atmosphere of a rural village without a train station, with beautiful scenery and colors.\" Kim wrote that the \"warmth\" of narrative softly pervaded \"with the landscape in harmony with nature\". She concluded, \"It started out as a simple station, but in the end it is a story about a dream.\"\nJung Yu-jin of News1 praised the performances of Park Jeong-min, Yoona Lim, Lee Seong-min and specially, Lee Soo-kyung, who in her opinion \"is the heart of the film.\" Commenting on the mixing of filial relationship, first love of  high school boy and fantasy, she said, \"director Lee Jang-hoon mixed these familiar ingredients with a different seasoning called 'Fantasy' in an unfamiliar bowl based on a true story called 'Simple Station Making', and finished it well enough to eat. Jung felt that \"the warm sensibility and humor that flows throughout the film\" made \"The Miracle, a cute and moist growth narrative that brightens the heart.\"\nKim Ye-eun of Export News reviewing the film said, \"The Miracle, which started with laughter and flowed into emotion, stimulates the tear glands with the warm story of these families. A strong reversal appears and sometimes adds to the emotion.\"\nAccolades\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\"|2021\n| scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"7\"| 42nd Blue Dragon Film Awards\n| Best Screenplay\n| Lee Jang-hoon, Son Joo-yeon\n|\n| rowspan=\"7\"|\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Im Yoon-ah\n|\n|-\n| Popular Star Award\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Lee Sung-min\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress\n| Lee Soo-kyung\n|\n|-\n| Best Art Direction\n| Kim Hui-jin\n|\n|-\n| Best Music\n| Kim Tae-seong\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\"|2022\n| scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| 58th Baeksang Arts Awards\n| Best Film\n| Miracle: Letters to the President\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n| Best Director\n| Lee Jang-hoon\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| Im Yoon-ah\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress\n| Lee Soo-kyung\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |24th Udine Far East Film Festival\n| Golden Mulberry: Audience Award\n| Miracle: Letters to the President\n|\n|\n|-\n| 27th Chunsa Film Art Awards\n| Best Supporting Actress\n| rowspan=2|Lee Soo-kyung\n|\n|\n|-\n| 31st Buil Film Awards\n| Best Supporting Actress\n|\n|\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |17th Festival du Film Coréen à Paris\n| Best Feature Film: Audience Award\n| Miracle: Letters to the President\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
