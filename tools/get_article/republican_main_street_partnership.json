As of 2024, the organization seems to be leaning away from its original centrist mission. The Republican Main Street Partnership does not advocate for legislation but offers networking and mentorship opportunities and provides a forum for discussion. The partnership is affiliated with a super PAC called Defending Main Street. The partnership is also affiliated with the Republican Main Street Caucus, a Republican congressional member organization that takes pragmatic conservative positions.\nHistory\nFormation and activity\nRep. Amo Houghton of New York was the founder and chairman emeritus of the Republican Main Street Partnership.\nThe partnership was formed following the 1994 United States House of Representatives elections in which conservative Republicans were swept into power. An informal discussion group formed by representatives Nancy Johnson, Steve Gunderson and Fred Upton later became an organized bloc intent on representing the moderate wing of the Republican Party. The partnership has described itself as a \"broad alliance of conservative, governing Republicans\".\nIn 2004, the Republican Main Street Partnership proposed changes that would have moved the Republican Party's platform regarding abortion and stem-cell research in a moderate direction.\nMembers of Congress affiliated with the partnership have been challenged in Republican primaries by members from the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the Tea Party movement, among others. The partnership had a notably adversarial relationship with the fiscally conservative Club for Growth. In 2011, however, the director of the partnership stated that the two groups had \"'come to an understanding'\".\nThe partnership is affiliated with a super PAC called Defending Main Street.\nRepublican Main Street Caucus\nIn September 2017, the Republican Main Street Caucus was formed with Pat Tiberi (OH–12) as chair. The caucus is a Republican congressional member organization that takes pragmatic conservative positions. Upon its formation, the caucus stated that it would prioritize \"'strong, conservative principles related to economic and national security policy'\". Tiberi added, \"'We are focused on getting things done and delivering real results to the American people'\". After Tiberi's resignation from the House in 2018, Rodney Davis (IL–13) took over duties as chair.\nDissolution of the Republican Main Street Caucus\nIn the 2018 United States House of Representatives elections, the Democratic Party won a majority of the seats in the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained a net total of 41 seats. This total was their largest gain of House seats in an election since the 1974 elections.\nOn November 28, 2018, the Republican Main Street Caucus met with the Republican Main Street Partnership to ask why the partnership's super PAC had left $722,000 of its funds unspent. The partnership's chief executive officer, Sarah Chamberlain, said that $6million had been spent on 2018 campaigns and that the remaining $722,000 was set aside for 2020. Members of the caucus expressed concern that Chamberlain's compensation was 20percent of the partnership's operating expenses. The following month, the caucus voted unanimously to suspend political activity with the partnership until an independent audit of the partnership's governance could be conducted. The partnership declined to be audited. An NPR story about the turmoil involving the partnership led to litigation.\nThe members of the caucus voted to dissolve the caucus in February 2019.\nRe-formation of the Republican Main Street Caucus\nBy 2021, the Republican Main Street Caucus had re-formed. As of 2023, it had once again become one of the major Republican caucuses in the House of Representatives. The caucus identifies itself as a group of pragmatic conservatives. It is affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership. The caucus has also been described as \"centrist\" and \"mainstream\".\nShift away from centrist Republicanism\nAccording to an article published in the New York Times in March 2024, it seems the organization is moving away from its centrist politics. \"The Republican Main Street Partnership ...directed half a million dollars...to defeat Representative Bob Good, a hard-right lawmaker from Virginia, making an unusual push to oust a sitting Republican member of Congress. The move [wa]s notable... because the candidate it [wa]s backing — John J. McGuire, a former member of the Navy SEALs and an election denier who has pledged fealty to former president Donald J. Trump and promised to bring a “biblical worldview” to Congress — bears so little resemblance to the kind of moderate Republican the Main Street Partnership was founded to support.\"\nCaucus Chairs\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Start\n!End\n!Chair(s)\n!District\n|-\n|2017\n|2018\n|\n|OH-12\n|-\n|2018\n|2021\n|\n|IL-13\n|-\n|rowspan=3 |2021\n|rowspan=3 |2023\n|\n|NE-02\n|-\n|\n|IL-12\n|-\n|\n|MN-08\n|-\n|2023\n|present\n|\n|SD-AL\n|}\nAffiliated members of Congress\n]]\nAs of January 2025, the partnership listed eight U.S. senators and 79 U.S. representatives as being affiliated with it.\nU.S. senators\n* Joni Ernst (IA)\n* Todd Young (IN)\n* Roger Marshall (KS)\n* Susan Collins (ME)\n* Tim Sheehy (MT)\n* John Curtis (UT)\n* Jim Justice (WV)\n* Shelley Moore Capito (WV)\nU.S. representatives\n* Juan Ciscomani (AZ-06)\n* David Valadao (CA-22)\n* Jay Obernolte (CA-23)\n* Young Kim (CA-40)\n* Ken Calvert (CA-41)\n* Jeff Hurd (CO-03)\n* Jeff Crank (CO-05)\n* Aaron Bean (FL-04)\n* John Rutherford (FL–05)\n* Mike Haridopolos (FL-08)\n* Laurel Lee (FL-15)\n* Mario Díaz-Balart (FL–26)\n* Carlos Gimenez (FL-28)\n* Buddy Carter (GA-01)\n* Mike Simpson (ID–02)\n* Mike Bost (IL–12)\n* Jim Baird (IN-04)\n* Jefferson Shreve (IN-06)\n* Mark Messmer (IN-08)\n* Erin Houchin (IN-09)\n* Mariannette Miller-Meeks (IA-01)\n* Randy Feenstra (IA-04) (Retiring at the end of the 119th Congress).\n* Derek Schmidt (KS-02)\n* Andy Barr (KY-06) (Retiring at the end of the 119th Congress).\n* Julia Letlow (LA-05)\n* John Moolenaar (MI–02)\n* Bill Huizenga (MI–04)\n* Lisa McClain (MI-09)\n* Brad Finstad (MN-01)\n* Tom Emmer (MN-06)\n* Pete Stauber (MN-08)\n* Michael Guest (MS-03)\n* Troy Downing (MT-02)\n* Mike Flood (NE-01)\n* Don Bacon (NE–02) (Retiring at the end of the 119th Congress).\n* Tom Kean Jr. (NJ-07)\n* Nick LaLota (NY-01)\n* Andrew Garbarino (NY-02)\n* Nicole Malliotakis (NY-11)\n* Mike Lawler (NY-17)\n* Nick Langworthy (NY-23)\n* David Rouzer (NC-07)\n* Chuck Edwards (NC-11)\n* Julie Fedorchak (ND-AL)\n* Michael Rulli (OH-06)\n* Max Miller (OH-07)\n* Mike Turner (OH–10)\n* Troy Balderson (OH–12)\n* David Joyce (OH–14)\n* Stephanie Bice (OK-05)\n* Cliff Bentz (OR-02)\n* Brian Fitzpatrick (PA–01)\n* Ryan Mackenzie (PA-07)\n* Rob Bresnahan (PA-08)\n* Dan Meuser (PA-09)\n* Guy Reschenthaler (PA-14)\n* Dusty Johnson (SD-AL) (Retiring at the end of the 119th Congress).\n* Nathaniel Moran (TX-01)\n* Dan Crenshaw (TX-02)\n* Jake Ellzey (TX-06)\n* Monica De La Cruz (TX-15)\n* Peter Sessions (TX-17)\n* Blake Moore (UT-01)\n* Celeste Maloy (UT-02)\n* Mike Kennedy (UT-03)\n* Jen Kiggans (VA-02)\n* John McGuire (VA-05)\n* Dan Newhouse (WA-04)\n* Michael Baumgartner (WA-05)\n* Carol Miller (WV-01)\n* Bryan Steil (WI-01)\n* Derrick Van Orden (WI-03)\n* Tony Wied (WI-08)\nFormer members\nRepresentatives\n* Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota (retired in 2024)\n* Larry Bucshon, Indiana (retired in 2024)\n* Michael C.
