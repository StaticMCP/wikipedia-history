He gained international representative honours on the 1935 Kangaroo tour of New Zealand and featured again on their 1937–38 tour of Great Britain, both times playing a peripheral role. His only capped match came against the 1937 Māori team on a stopover in New Zealand. In 1940, Collins scored 39 tries in a premiership–winning season for Norths and was man of the match in their grand final win over Brothers. He proved a reliable try scorer for Brisbane in the Bulimba Cup and in his regular appearances for Queensland, which he captain–coached to an interstate series win.\nCollins had his representative career ended by World War II. He enlisted in the army in 1941 and served as a private with the 7th Field Ambulance. The following year, Collins joined the Royal Australian Air Force and was posted to RAAF Base Richmond. He remained in the RAAF after the war as an air traffic controller.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/edward-collins/summary.html Edward Collins] at Rugby League Project"
