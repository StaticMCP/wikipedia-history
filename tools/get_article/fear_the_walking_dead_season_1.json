While fleeing, he is hit by a car and hospitalized. The doctor tells Madison and Travis that Nick's claims about the incident are heroin induced hallucinations, but Travis believes Nick after visiting the church himself. Alicia becomes more worried about Nick's chemical dependency and state of mind, desperate to return him to rehab. The next day, school closes early due to the high levels of absenteeism, rumors of an epidemic and rising chaos. Nick escapes from the hospital and meets with Calvin, hoping to learn if the drugs Calvin sold him were laced and caused him to hallucinate. Calvin tries to kill Nick to prevent him from exposing Calvin as a drug dealer or impugning the quality of his drugs. In the ensuing struggle, Calvin is mortally shot. After Travis and Madison pick Nick up, the zombified Calvin attacks them. Nick runs over Calvin repeatedly with Travis' truck, and the three watch in disbelief as the mutilated Calvin is still able to turn his head towards them.\n| LineColor       = F1D49A\n}}\n| Viewers         = 8.18\n| ShortSummary    = After the run-in with zombified Calvin, Nick, Madison, and Travis choose to flee to the desert, and they want Alicia, Liza, and Chris to follow.

A zombified Artie tries to bite Tobias, so Madison kills Artie and drives Tobias home. Chris’ bus is trapped in a traffic jam caused by a zombie shooting by the police. He films the event and joins in a protest against that and other recent fatal police shootings, when Travis and Liza meet up with him.

Travis tells Madison to take the kids to the desert without him; he will catch up. Alicia witnesses her zombified neighbor, Mr. Dawson, attacking Mrs. Cruz across the street, but Madison prevents her from intervening.

Nick leads Madison and Alicia to the Trans' house next door, where they take a shotgun. Travis arrives and is attacked by Mr. Dawson, who is shot and killed by Daniel. All three families decide to stay the night and evacuate in the morning. Nurse Liza tends to Griselda's injured foot but notes that Griselda will lose the foot if not treated by a doctor. Ofelia tells Daniel they should flee with Travis, but Daniel insists his family can survive alone and will join his cousin later. The next morning, as the Clarks and Manawas start driving away, the National Guard arrives and quarantines the block. While Travis says, \"It's going to get better,\" Daniel laments that it’s, \"too late,\" as he watches a guardsman mark the neighboring house.\n| LineColor       = F1D49A\n}}\n| Viewers         = 6.62\n| ShortSummary    = Days after the National Guard quarantines the neighborhood into a Safe Zone, residents try to live normally.

Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave an average review, writing, \"The 90-minute first episode and the hour-long second episode are, while not actually boring, certainly less magnetic than the original.\"\nOne of the harshest negative reviews came from HitFix, on Daniel Fienberg and Alan Sepinwall's podcast, where Fienberg called the premiere episode \"awful, just horrible ... as bad as The Walking Dead has ever gotten at its very worst. This is that bad. I've been kind of stunned to see people being generous to it. ... I thought this was almost unwatchably bad.\" Sepinwall called his B− review \"slightly generous\".\nRatings\nThe U.S. series premiere attracted 10.1 million total viewers, with 6.3 million in the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic, both cable television records for a series premiere.
