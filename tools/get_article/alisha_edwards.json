She is signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where she performs under the ring name Alisha Edwards. She is a member of The System and is a one-time TNA Knockouts World Tag Team Champion (along with Masha Slamovich).\nProfessional wrestling career\nNew England Championship Wrestling / World Women's Wrestling (2004–2013)\nEdwards debuted in May 2006, at a joint New England Championship Wrestling (NECW) and World Women's Wrestling (WWW) show on May 7, defeating Mia Love. Over the next few weeks, she lost to Tanya Lee, but defeated Della Morte. This win however, would prove to be her last in 2006, as she lost to Tanya Lee, Kacee Carlisle by disqualification, Portia Perez, and Alicia. On January 27, 2007, at NECW's SnowBrawl show, she challenged Tanya Lee for the World Women's Wrestling Championship, but was unsuccessful. She broke her losing streak at the NECW/WWW show, Pick you Poison, on February 25, when she defeated Portia Perez. At the NECW/WWW 1st Anniversary Spectacular show on March 25, Edwards defeated Mistress Belmont, who was accompanied by Della Morte. After the match, Morte attacked Edwards, and attempted to burn her with a curling iron, but Ariel saved her.\nshow in 2009.]]\nEdwards then began challenging for the World Women's Wrestling Championship, defeating the championship Tanya Lee on two separate occasions in non-title matches. When she gained an opportunity to win the championship at the Double Intensity event, however, she was unsuccessful. On August 12, Edwards competed in two matches at a NECW/WWW show. In the first, she lost to Tanya Lee by disqualification in a singles match. In the second, however, she won the championship in a four-way match, defeating Tanya Lee, Natalia and Jana on August 12, 2007. She successfully defended the championship against Tanya Lee, Ariel, Mistress Belmont and Sammi Lane. She lost the championship to Ariel on March 9, 2009, after holding it for a year and a half. She regained the title from Ariel after defeating 10 top WWW stars first to get the title shot. She lost it to Mistress Belmont, who lost it to Edwards on August 8, 2010, in a steel cage match.\nNew England Championship Wrestling returned in May 2011 with A Fight For Alex 2 and in their first show back, Edwards was successful in defending her World Women's Wrestling Championship against Mistress Belmont. Later in that year, at The Fight Before Christmas, she successfully defended her WWW Championship again against Adrianna this time. Edwards would go on to face Adrianna several more times in 2012, became embroiled in a heated feud with Adrianna that would last a whole year and culminate in a \"Taped Fist\" match at NECW's December event in 2012, Unwrapped in Blackstone, MA. Edwards defeated Adrianna yet again and would move on to other challenges.\nIn 2013, Edwards had her hands full with longtime rival Mistress Belmont as well as the returning Nikki Valentine to NECW. Edwards would successfully defeat each over the course of that year. It would either be Edwards involved in a match with one of them, or her partner and ally Kasey Ray. Often doing so via disqualification after Mistress Belmont or Nikki Valentine would receive a mysterious package at ringside or left under the ring containing various weapons such as a steel chain, whip, or even brass knuckles, and using the various weapons and being disqualified. It wasn't until NECW's 13th anniversary event, Bash 13 when Miss Sammi Lane made her return to NECW after a three-year hiatus, revealing herself to be the mystery gift giver, along with her \"sisters\" Mistress Belmont and Nikki Valentine during a tag team match with Edwards and Kasey Ray. With that the numbers battle became too much for Edwards to cope with. At Double Intensity in Beverly, MA on November 9, 2013, with both Nikki Valentine and Miss Sammi Lane in her corner, Mistress Belmont was able to successfully defeat Edwards for her championship, ending her 1,190 day reign as WWW Champion, the longest title reign in company history.\nChaotic Wrestling (2007–2011)\nEdwards began competing in Chaotic Wrestling in March 2007, losing matches to Tanya Lee throughout March and April.
