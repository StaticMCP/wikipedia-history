The Austrians won the battle, before plundering Vilshofen.\nBefore the battle, a sizeable number of Bavarians and Hessians, likely numbering around 4,000–6,000 men, curbed Austrian advances for five days. On 28 March 1745, Austrian general Maximilian Ulysses Browne led troops into Vilshofen. As the mostly Croatian troops entered the city, they began to plunder and loot the city, burning it to the ground. 3,000 of the Hessian defenders were butchered. Browne was wounded by his own men while trying to stop the frenzy. Following the battle, Browne recovered from his wounds in Passau. Up to 6,000 of the Hessians may have died in the Battle of Vilshofen.\nReferences"
