It migrates later in the fall than its western counterpart.\n\"Brown palm warbler\" or \"western palm warbler\" (S. p. palmarum) inhabits the remaining western two-thirds of the breeding range. It has much less yellow below, with less colorful streaking, and cold grayish-brown upper parts.\nDistribution\nPalm warblers breed in open coniferous bogs and edge east of the Continental Divide, across Canada and the northeastern United States.\nThese birds migrate to the southeastern United States, the Yucatán Peninsula, islands of the Caribbean, and eastern Nicaragua south to Panama to winter. They are one of the earlier migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring, often completing their migration almost two months before most other warblers. Unlike most Setophaga species, the palm warbler's winter range includes much of the Atlantic coast of North America, extending as far north as southern Nova Scotia. Every year since 1900 the palm warbler has been observed during Christmas Bird Count activities in Massachusetts, and consistently since 1958 in Nova Scotia. For the interval 1966–2015 the palm warbler population increased throughout much of its northernmost breeding range.\nThe palm warbler has been recorded as a vagrant to Iceland.\nBehavior\n]]\nPalm warbler nests take the form of an open cup, usually situated on or near the ground in an open area.\nPalm warblers forage on the ground much more than other warblers, sometimes flying to catch insects. These birds mainly eat insects and berries. Their constant tail bobbing is an identifying characteristic. Kirtland's, prairie, and palm warblers are the only Setophaga species that incessantly bob their tails.\nThe song of this bird is a monotonous buzzy trill. The call is a sharp chek.\nGallery\nFile:Western Palm Warbler.jpg|left|Western subspecies, in non-breeding plumage\nFile:Palm Warbler JG.jpg\nFile:A palm warbler.jpg|alt=A Palm Warbler photographed during its Spring migration|A palm warbler during its spring migration\nFile:20240209 Palmenwaldsänger am Stand.jpg|Palm Warbler at Cayo Jutias (Cuba) in February\nPalm warbler in a meadow (81589).jpg|Palm warbler in a meadow in New York\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/framlst/i6720id.html Palm warbler - Dendroica palmarum]  - USGS Patuxent Bird Identification InfoCenter\n* [https://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Palm_Warbler.html Palm warbler species account] - Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n*  (for British Virgin Islands) at bird-stamps.org\n*\n*"
