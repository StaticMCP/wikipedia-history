      "text": "# 2017–18 Golden State Warriors season\n\nThe 2017–18 Golden State Warriors season was the 72nd season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA), and its 56th in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Warriors entered the season as the defending NBA champions and repeated, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0 in the Finals. It was the first time in NBA history and in North America's four major professional sports leagues that two teams had met to compete for a Championship for a fourth consecutive year. It was the Warriors' third championship in four years, and sixth overall. Golden State won the Pacific Division title and Western Conference Championship for the fourth consecutive season. In the playoffs, the Warriors defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the First Round 4–1 and the New Orleans Pelicans 4–1 in the Semi-finals. They beat the top-seeded Houston Rockets 4–3 in the Western Conference Finals.\nThe Warriors finished second in the Western Conference with a record of , their fifth most wins in franchise history. Golden State set the NBA record of 16 consecutive home wins in the playoffs, surpassing the 1990–91 Chicago Bulls. Stephen Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in an NBA Finals game with nine. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game, the first time in NBA history that a team has had four All-Stars in consecutive seasons, and just the ninth time in NBA history a single team has had four players in the game. Curry was named captain, being the leading vote getter from the Western Conference. The Warriors ended the regular season with a slew of injuries to all four of their All-Stars, including an MCL sprain for Curry that kept him out for six weeks, and lost ten of their last seventeen games. For the first time since the 2013–14 season, they did not clinch first place for home-court advantage for the playoffs and failed to win 60 games for the first time under Steve Kerr. This season marked David West's final season in the NBA. He retired on August 30, 2018, having won two NBA championships with the Warriors.\nDraft picks\nThe 2017 NBA draft was held on June 22, 2017, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The Warriors did not have a pick, but acquired the Chicago Bulls's 38th pick in the second round for cash, having chosen power forward Jordan Bell out of Oregon. After the draft, the team signed Bell's former Oregon teammate, Chris Boucher, to a two-way contract.\nPreseason\nOn July 1, 2017, Stephen Curry agreed to re-sign with Golden State on a super-max five-year/$201m deal. The Warriors also resigned Kevin Durant, and their veteran core of Shaun Livingston, David West, Andre Iguodala, Zaza Pachulia and JaVale McGee. Golden State also added Nick Young and Omri Casspi on one-year deals.\nRecords\nbroke multiple three-point records this season, including most made in an NBA Finals game with nine.]]\nNBA records\nIndividual\n* Most three-pointers made in a Finals game: 9 (Stephen Curry, Game 2 of 2018 NBA Finals)\n* Most consecutive playoff games with a made three-pointer: 90 - ongoing streak (Stephen Curry, has made a three-pointer in every playoff game he's played in at this point)\n* Most three-pointers made in a four-game Finals series: 22 (Stephen Curry, previous record was 11 (jointly held by Robert Horry and Penny Hardaway)\n* Most consecutive playoff games with a made three-pointer at home: 46 - ongoing streak (Stephen Curry)\n* Most consecutive playoff games with a made three-pointer on the road: 44 - ongoing streak (Stephen Curry)\n* Most three-pointers made in a quarter in the Finals game: 5 (Stephen Curry, Game 2 of 2018 NBA Finals.
