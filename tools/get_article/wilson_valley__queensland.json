Stines offered to building a provisional school building at his own expanse on his own land, an offer accepted by the government. Wilson Valley Provisional School opened on 4 October 1916 under teacher Mrs W. Brown junior. In June 1918, the government agreed to erect a state school building. On 1 October 1918, it became Wilson Valley State School. In 1930, a new school building was erected at the school, and in 1931, the old school building was relocated to Abercorn State School. The school closed on 14 May 1944. It was on Fowlers Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Wilson Valley had a population of 14 people.\nIn the , Wilson Valley had a population of 20 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Wilson Valley.
