It primarily featured characters created by writer Robert Kanigher with the Viking Commando being the lead feature.\nPublication history\nThe first issue was published with a September–October 1979 cover date. Joe Kubert drew the cover art for the entire run and Murray Boltinoff was the editor of the series. The series was in the Dollar Comics format and the lead character was the Viking Commando created by writer Robert Kanigher and artist George Evans. Other features included \"Black Eagle\" by Kanigher and artists Dick Ayers and Romeo Tanghal and \"Guerrilla War starring Force 3\" by Kanigher and Jerry Grandenetti.
