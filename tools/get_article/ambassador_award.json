The Ambassador Award recognizes the value of AGU members’ outstanding contributions that benefit society above and beyond their own research.\nThe award was established by the AGU in 2013 to recognize the groundbreaking contributions of individuals whose achievements extend beyond the scope of traditional scientific honors. The award is annually given to between one and five individuals with notable achievements in societal impact, service to the Earth and space communities, scientific leadership, and promotion of the talent and career pool.\nThe Ambassador Award is the only union-level award of the AGU whose recipients are automatically made AGU Fellows.\nThe Ambassador Award was approved by the AGU Board of Directors on September 20, 2013 as a step forward by the AGU in building the community of scientists whose dedication to reaching across boundaries has made science visible and compelling, empowered new voices, and inspired future generations of researchers.\nThe award was established by the AGU in 2013 to recognize the groundbreaking contributions of individuals whose achievements extend beyond the scope of traditional scientific honors.
