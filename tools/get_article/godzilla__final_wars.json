Distributed by Toho and produced by its subsidiary Toho Pictures, it is the 29th film in the Godzilla franchise, and the sixth and final film in the franchise's Millennium era. The film stars Masahiro Matsuoka, Rei Kikukawa, Don Frye, Maki Mizuno, Kazuki Kitamura, Kane Kosugi, Kumi Mizuno, Kenji Sahara, Masami Nagasawa, Chihiro Otsuka, Shigeru Izumiya, Masakatsu Funaki, Masato Ibu, Jun Kunimura, and Akira Takarada, with Tsutomu Kitagawa as Godzilla, Kazuhiro Yoshida as Gigan and Motokuni Nakagawa as Monster X. In the film, when a mysterious race of aliens known as the Xiliens arrive on Earth, the Earth Defense Force (EDF) find themselves locked in battle with various monsters attacking cities around the world, leading them to revive the only chance to save their planet: Godzilla.\nUnlike the previous Millennium films ignoring the events of every other installment aside from the original 1954 film, Godzilla: Final Wars takes place in the Heisei continuity where Godzilla and other kaiju co-exist with humans since the 20th century, making the film direct-canon with the original film. The film coincided with the 50th anniversary of the franchise and features a variety of actors and kaiju from previous films. Godzilla: Final Wars premiered on November 29, 2004 in Los Angeles, California, and was released theatrically in Japan on December 4, 2004 to mixed reviews and it underperformed at the box office. Before the world premiere, Godzilla received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nOn the day of its Japanese release, it was shown with a Hamtaro double feature, The Mysterious Oni Picture Book Tower.\nWhile Godzilla made a cameo appearance in Always: Sunset on Third Street 2 (2007), the Godzilla franchise went on hiatus after Final Wars. The next Godzilla film was Legendary Pictures' Godzilla (2014), and the next Toho Godzilla film was Shin Godzilla in 2016.\nPlot\nOver the course of the 20th century, environmental disasters caused the appearance of giant monsters and superhumans, dubbed \"mutants\", who are then recruited into the Earth Defense Force (EDF) to battle the monsters. Later in 1995, the son of the king of the monsters called Godzilla Junior, EDF's greatest enemy that never defeated, appeared and frequently menaced mankind over the years. In Antarctica in 2004, where Godzilla is imprisoned under the ice by a cave-in caused by a series of missiles fired off from the original Gotengo commanded by Komura.\nMany years later in the 21st century, an upgraded Gotengo, now captained and commanded by Douglas Gordon, battles and destroys Manda in the English Channel off the coast of Normandy, but the ship sustains serious damage during the battle and Gordon is suspended from the EDF. The EDF ensign Shinichi Ozaki is tasked with guarding a U.N. biologist, Dr. Miyuki Otonashi, who is sent to study a mummified monster. They are suddenly teleported to Infant Island where they encounter the Shobijin, priestesses of Mothra, who reveal the mummified monster as Gigan, an extraterrestrial cyborg sent to destroy the Earth ten thousand years earlier, and who Mothra ultimately subdued. They warn that a battle between good and evil will happen soon and that Ozaki must choose a side.\nSuddenly, giant monsters attack several major cities: Rodan attacks New York City, Zilla attacks Sydney, Anguirus attacks Shanghai, King Caesar attacks Okinawa, Kamacuras attacks Paris, Kumonga attacks Monument Valley in Arizona and Ebirah attacks Tokai. Meanwhile, Minilla, Godzilla's son, is found in Aokigahara by Kenta Taguchi and his game hunter grandfather Samon. The EDF engages the monsters until they mysteriously vanish as at the same time the mothership of the alien race called Xiliens appears over Tokyo. The Xiliens claim that they eliminated the monsters as a gesture of goodwill, and warn Earth's leaders that an incoming runaway white dwarf star called Gorath will soon impact the Earth, offering their help to destroy it.\nAfter a peace pact is signed between humanity and the Xiliens, Ozaki, Miyuki, and Miyuki's sister Anna, distrusted by the Xilliens, discover that the Gorath shown by the Xiliens is a hologram and that the Xiliens have replaced several members of the EDF and U.N. secretary-general Naotaro Daigo with imposters. After the Xiliens are exposed with help from Gordon and the other mutants, the Xiliens' second-in-command, the Controller, kills his commander to assume command, revealing the plan to use humans as food source while taking control of all the mutants except for Ozaki through a property in their DNA known as \"M-base\". The Controller also has the monsters under his control through M-base in their DNA and awakens Gigan, who revealed to be Xilliens' bioweapon, to wipe out the EDF. The group escapes in a repaired Gotengo, although Gigan pursues them.\nGordon convinces the Gotengo crew to travel to Antarctica to release Godzilla, who is immune to Xiliens' control thanks to his lack of M-base and easily defeats Gigan. The Gotengo then guides Godzilla into a series of battles with the other monsters: Godzilla defeats Zilla in Sydney, Kumonga in New Guinea and  Kamacuras in Manazuru. At Hakone, Samon, who witnesses Godzilla battles Rodan, Caesar and Anguirus along with Kenta and Minilla, remarks that long time ago, humanity did something horrible that angered Godzilla, leading to his decades of aggression. After Godzilla subdues Rodan, Caesar and Anguirus, the Gotengo leads him to Tokyo to defeat the Xiliens.\nAnother ensign Katsunori Kazama sacrifices himself to disable the shield, allowing the Gotengo crew penetrate the mothership, but they are captured and brought before the Controller as he summons Gorath to Earth. Godzilla, who defeated Ebirah and Hedorah, destroys Gorath just before it collides to Tokyo, but this unleashes Xilliens' ultimate weapon called Monster X, and the two monsters battle. A repaired and modified Gigan joins Monster X but is intercepted by Mothra, who manages to destroy Gigan once and for all.\nIn the Xilien mothership, the Controller reveals that both he and Ozaki are superior beings known as \"Keizers\", powerful beings distinct from regular mutants born on rare occasions when human DNA and M-base are combined, before directly taking control of Ozaki to turn him against the group. As a fight breaks out, the Controller loses control of Ozaki due to the Shobijins' blessing. Ozaki unlocks his true power and defeats the Controller, who triggers the mothership's self-destruct as the group falls back to the Gotengo moments before the mothership explodes. Godzilla and Monster X continue their battle, but Monster X transforms into its true form Keizer Ghidorah. Godzilla is overpowered by Keizer Ghidorah, but Ozaki transfers some of his own Keizer energy to Godzilla, giving him the strength to kill Keizer Ghidorah.\nDespite the Gotengo crew proving instrumental in his victory, an enraged Godzilla shoots down the Gotengo before attempts to attack the vessel's crew. Fortunately, Minilla, now grows to about half the size of Godzilla, calms Godzilla down and convinces his father to leave and forgive mankind for their sins. A new war, is coming for humanity. Kenta, Samon and the Gotengo crew watch as Godzilla Junior and Minilla return to the ocean without further conflict.\nCast\nHumans and Xilliens\n* Maki Mizuno as Anna Otonashi, a journalist and Miyuki's sister.\n* Kazuki Kitamura as the Xilien Controller, the second-in-command of the Xiliens.\n* Kane Kosugi as Katsunori Kazama, a mutant ensign in the Earth Defense Forces and pilot of the Gotengo.\n* Kumi Mizuno as Reiko Namikawa, the commander of the Earth Defense Forces.\n* Kenji Sahara as Dr. Hachiro Jinguji.\n* Masami Nagasawa and Chihiro Otsuka as the Shobijin, the priestesses of Mothra.\n* Shigeru Izumiya as Samon Taguchi, an elderly game hunter and Kenta's grandfather.\n* Masakatsu Funaki as Kumasaka, the commander and the instructor of the Earth Defense Forces.\n* Kenji Kohashi as himself, nicknamed X.\n* Masatō Ibu as the Xilien Commander, the commander of the Xiliens who is killed by the Controller.

Godzilla movies back in the ’70s were never just monster movies, there were always messages and themes that reflected and the '90s the time and world within which they were made, and they combined this so well with straight-out entertainment. They lost that touch in the 1980 years like 2000s\".\nKitamura has compared Godzilla: Final Wars to that of a musician's \"Best of\" album, stating \"We picked lots and lots of the best elements from the past and combined it in a new way. It's what I love about Godzilla and what I don't love about recent Godzilla movies\".\nPost-production\nLike previous Godzilla films, Godzilla: Final Wars makes extensive use of practical effects rather than CGI. The special effects were directed and supervised by Eiichi Asada, who also directed the special effects for Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S. Commenting on the special effects, Kitamura stated at the film's world premiere in Hollywood, \"We stick to the special effects. That’s what we've been doing for 50 years. And that’s why Hollywood doesn’t do it. So on the first meeting, I told everybody that we stick to the special effects, and the live action instead of CGI. So it's a CGI-monster-Hollywood Godzilla versus our man-made live-action monsters.\"\nFilming\nFilming included on-location shooting in New York City and Sydney, Australia. Scenes were also filmed in various locations across Japan, including Fukushima, Kobe, and Toho Studios in Tokyo.\nMusic\nThe film's score was composed by Keith Emerson, Nobuhiko Morino, and Daisuke Yano. Emerson was offered the job by Kitamura, who was attending Emerson's Japanese concerts at the time. Emerson's main concern was the potential lack of time before going on tour. Emerson was only given two weeks to write the score and ended up writing more music than what was used in the film. The film featured the track ''We're All to Blame by Sum 41 during the battle between Godzilla and Zilla. The band received top billing in the opening credits.\nRelease\nGodzilla: Final Wars was distributed theatrically by Toho in Japan on November 29, 2004. It was released theatrically in the United States on November 4, 2004 and then released to video on December 13, 2005.\nCritical response\nSteve Biodrowski of Cinefantastique called the film \"utterly fantastic\" and \"a rush of explosive excitement.\" Jim Agnew of Film Threat gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying \"the good news for kaiju fans is that Godzilla: Final Wars is a kick-ass giant monster flick.\" Drew McWeeny of Ain't It Cool News remarked, \"Godzilla: Final Wars'' earns a special place in my heart. It's fun. Pure lunatic fun, every frame.\" Sean Axmaker of Static Multimedia said, \"Directed by a true fan of the old school, it's lusciously, knowingly, lovingly cheesy.\" Craig Blamer of the Chico News & Review called the film \"a giddy and fast-paced celebration of the big guy.\"\nConversely, David Nusair of Reel Film gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying that \"the battles are admittedly quite entertaining\" but felt that director Ryuhei Kitamura \"is absolutely the wrong choice for the material.\" David Cornelius of eFilmCritic gave the film two stars out of five, calling it \"the dullest, weakest Godzilla movie I've seen in a long, long time.\" Ty Burr of the Boston Globe gave the film one and a half stars out of five, saying it focused too much on action and not enough on story, and calling it \"20 minutes longer than is necessary.\"\nAmong kaiju-related websites, J.L. Carrozza of Toho Kingdom \"absolutely love[d]\" Final Wars, saying \"[it's] no masterpiece, but it is such insane fun that quite frankly it's hard not to adore it.\" Mike Bogue of American Kaiju said \"the film is flawed, but nonetheless entertaining,\" saying there are \"too many [Matrix-style] battles\" but that the film \"makes excellent use of its monsters\" and \"Kitamura keeps things moving at a brisk pace.\" Japan Hero criticized the \"[lack of] character development\" but concluded that Final Wars is \"a very entertaining movie,\" saying that \"Kitamura did a wonderful job making it an interesting and great looking film worthy of being the final [Godzilla] movie.\"\nStomp Tokyo said \"the monster scenes are generally well done\" but criticized the film's \"incoherence,\" saying: \"It's a shame that Kitamaura couldn't choose a tone for the film, instead shifting the movie's mood wildly from scene to scene.\" Lenny Taguchi of Monster Zero criticized Keith Emerson's soundtrack but gave Final Wars an overall favorable review, calling it a \"fun and good\" movie that \"tries many things, and generally succeeds at almost all of them.\"\nDirector Kitamura commented at the film's world premiere that the reason why he agreed to direct the film was because he wanted to update Godzilla and recapture the same spirit seen in the later Godzilla films from the Showa era. He wanted to incorporate the same speed and power seen in films like Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, which he believed was lost somewhere within the series, stating, \"The Godzilla series had lost that kind of taste. I think that back in the '70s Godzilla movies had more power and speed. He was very fast and he was very strong. So in my Godzilla, you know, less dialogue and more action. That’s more fun than watching people discuss what we should do about Godzilla. As a Godzilla fan I want to see Godzilla punching and kicking, beating up all the other monsters instead of somebody talking again, you know, just discussing. Showing the monsters, in order to understand their story, and why they end up like this, was a crucial choice for this film. That's what I wanted to do is to revive that, but not in the same way, I have to update. This is the updated version of '60 & 70s, monster movies. I hope that the Americans will not modify the Japanese version too much.\"\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Award\n! Category\n! Recipient\n!
