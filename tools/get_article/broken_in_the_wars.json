The Pensions Minister John Hodge appeared in the film to promote the King's Fund, which supported recently demobilised ex-servicemen. The fund had been criticized by veterans' organisations on the grounds that it was a government backed charity providing relief that should have been provided by the state. The film attempts to assure audiences that the King's Fund is not a charity. A cobbler returning from the First World War is persuaded by his aristocratic former employer and the Pensions Minister to receive a grant that will enable him to open his own shop. It was made by Hepworth Picture Plays.
