The temple is famous for its mysterious stone discs in the forecourt and the exact planning allowing the sun to shine on the shrine during certain time of the year. It was built in the 16th century by Kempe Gowda I, the founder of the city.\nTemple history\nThis cave temple dedicated to Shiva. It is believed to have been built by Gautama Maharishi and Bharadwaja Muni in the Vedic period. It was later renovated in the 16th century CE by Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru.\nOne of the oldest temples in Bengaluru, Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple was built by Kempe Gowda in recognition after being released from a prison term of five years by Rama Raya. The temple Gavi is an architectural marvel that attracts the faithful by the hordes.\nTemple architecture\nBuilt in a natural cave in Gavipuram, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and cut into a monolithic stone. The courtyard of the temple contains several monolithic sculptures. The main attractions of Gavi Gangadhareshvara temple are two granite pillars that support the giant disk of the sun and moon, and two pillars having several carvings of Nandi in a sitting posture at the top. The temple is also known for its four monolithic pillars, representing Damaru, Trishul and two large circular discs on the patio.\nTwo paintings dated 1 May 1792 CE by Thomas and William Daniell brothers shows that the temple has gone through some construction work with new walls and enclosures.\nDeities inside the Temple\nThe temple complex has numerous shrines for various detities in addition to the main deity Gavi Gangadhareswara.\nSpecial aspects of the Temple\nCurative effects\nThe idol of Agnimurthi inside the temple has two heads, seven hands and three legs. It is believed that worship of the deity would cure defects of the eye.\nIllumination of sanctum by the Sun\nOn the occasion of Makar Sankranti, the temple witnesses a unique phenomenon in the evening where sunlight passes through an arc between the horns of Nandi and falls directly on the linga inside the cave and illuminating the interior idol for an hour. Lakhs of devotees come in mid January every year on Makar sankranti day to this cave temple.\nComparison of contemporary structures and earlier drawings by Thomas Daniell and William Daniell show that earlier the temple had fewer structures and the Sun illuminated the shrine in summer and winter solstice. Of late, the Sun illuminates Shivalinga two times per year - from 13 to 16 January in late afternoons and from 26 November to 2 December.\nTunnel from temple\nPeople believe that there is a tunnel which may lead to Kashi. However, it is believed that two men named Nishant and Prem went into the tunnel and never returned.\nProtected temple\nThe temple shrine is a protected monument under the Karnataka Ancient and Historical Monuments, and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1961.\nGallery\nFile:GGTemple4.jpg|Temple's front entrance\nFile:GGTemple1.jpg|Roof top of the temple\nFile:GGTemple2.jpg|Temple yard with monolithic sculptures\nFile:GGTemple3.jpg|Another view of the roof top of the temple\nFile:GGTemple5.jpg|Temple's rear entrance\nVintage Paintings\nThe temple saw numerous colonial artists painting different scenes over the years.\nFile:Oriental Scenery Part 5 Fig 18.jpg|A painting of the temple by Thomas Daniell in 1792.\nFile:A Moorish mosque at Bangalore.jpg|A painting of the temple by James Hunter, published posthumously in 1804.\nFile:Oriental Scenery Part 5 Fig 17.jpg|A painting depicting the Harihara temple and great stone umbrella on the Harihararayana Gudda (hill) in 1792.\nFile:View from the Hepern House, Bangalore (Campbell, 1839).jpg|View from the Hepern House, Bangalore (Campbell, 1839)\nFile:The Umbrella Temple, Bangalore - J B MacGeorge, 1917.jpg|A painting by Lieutenant Colonel J B MacGeorge titled \"The Umbrella Temple\" in 1917.\nNearby holy places\n* Gosaayi Math\n* Samadhi of yogi Bjt Narayan Maharaj - Located just behind the temple.\n* Sri Bande Mahakali Temple\nSee also\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://bangaloretourism.org/bangalore-Gavi-Gangadeshwara-Cave-Temple.php Gavi Gangadhareshwara - BangaloreTourism.org]"
