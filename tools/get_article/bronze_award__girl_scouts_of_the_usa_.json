The project is to be girl-led, but, unlike the Silver and Gold Awards, adults may be on-hand to assist and guide.\nApproval\nThe approval process varies by council.  Before beginning work on a Take Action Project or a Bronze Project, it is important to check with the local council.\nSee also\n* Girl Scouts of the USA\n* Gold Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)\n* Silver Award (Girl Scouts of the USA)\nExternal links\n* [http://www.girlscouts.org/program/highest_awards/bronze_award.asp Overview of the Girl Scout Bronze Award]\n* https://www.girlscouts.org/en/our-program/grade-levels/what-juniors-do.html\n* https://www.girlscouts.org/en/about-girl-scouts/traditions/ceremonies.html\n* https://www.girlscouts.org/en/our-program/highest-awards/highest-awards-faq.html"
