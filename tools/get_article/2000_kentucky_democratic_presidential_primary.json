The Kentucky primary was a closed primary, with the state awarding 58 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 49 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nPresumptive nominee and vice president Al Gore handily won the primary with almost 72% of the vote but not all of the 54 delegates. Senator Bill Bradley, despite withdrawing in March, received almost 15% of the vote, winning just 3 delegates. The option for uncommitted delegates caught up almost 12% but did not receive enough votes to allocate uncommitted delegates from the district level. Lyndon LaRouche Jr. amassed just 2% of the vote and won no delegates.\nProcedure\nKentucky was one of three states to vote on May 23, 2000, in the Democratic primaries, along with Alabama and Idaho, which was non-binding and did not have any effect on the nomination.\nThe polls were originally scheduled to be open from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 6:00&nbsp;p.m. local time. In the closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 49 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 4 and 8 were allocated to each of the state's 6 congressional districts and another 6 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 11 at-large delegates.\nThe delegation also included 8 unpledged PLEO delegates: 6 members of the Democratic National Committee, one representative from Congress, Ken Lucas, the governor Paul Patton.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nWithdrawn\n*Bill Bradley\nThere was also an uncommitted option.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Kentucky Democratic presidential primary\n!
