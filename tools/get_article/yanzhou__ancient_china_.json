The name is reflected in the modern city of Yanzhou, Jining, Shandong.\nIn 1265, during the Song dynasty, Yanzhou was upgraded to Jiande Fu, overseeing six counties: Jiande County, Chun'an County, Sui’an County, Shouchang County, Fenshui County and Tonglu County.\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Yanzhou influence started to decline.\nIn 1912, Yanzhou was revoked and in 1914 it was integrated into the Dao (道) prefecture.\nGovernment\nThe Yanzhou government seat was located at the northern end of the central axis, halfway up the mountains, to avoid floods caused by the nearby rivers and to create \"a sense of oppression\" in the inner city.\nIn 1578, the government inner walls were dismantled, with its citizens gaining access to their headquarters. The government also moved to the northern end of the city.\nReferences"
