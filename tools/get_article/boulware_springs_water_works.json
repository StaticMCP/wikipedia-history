It is located at 3400 Southeast 15th Street. On June 20, 1985, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is also the western terminus of the Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail.\nThe spring was the site of an 1854 meeting where area citizens voted to create a new town (Gainesville) to replace Newnansville as the Alachua County seat. The spring was the source of city water until 1913 and was important in the city's growth.\nThe University of Florida moved from Lake City to Gainesville in 1901 because the city promised the university free water for life, from the Boulware Springs. The University of Florida still does not pay for water, even though the springs are no longer used in Gainesville's water system.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Alachua/state.html Alachua County listings] at [http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com National Register of Historic Places]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060326092712/http://www.flheritage.com/facts/reports/places/Counties/Alachua.cfm Alachua County listings] at [http://www.flheritage.com Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070618095407/http://growth-management.alachua.fl.us/historic/natural.htm Natural and Historic Sites in Alachua County] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20060829020736/http://growth-management.alachua.fl.us/ Alachua County's Department of Growth Management]\nThe spring in late 19th century"
