A rainstorm that day slowed their march considerably, giving time for local Spanish forces, composed of militia from the neighboring villages, volunteers (sometent), and Swiss and Walloon soldiers from the Barcelona garrison (2,000 men), to mobilize for action. The Spaniards were led by General Antoni Franch i Estalella and deployed along the Bruc Pass.\nThe resulting stand was a success, and the French under General Schwarz were turned back to Barcelona with the loss of 360 dead, 800 wounded, 60 prisoners, and one gun captured. The Spanish also captured a French Imperial Eagle.\n]]\nFrench army\nmountains viewed from the Bruc]]\n* Schwartz Column - Brigadier-General Francis Xavier Schwartz, Commander-in-Chief\n** 1st Regiment Neapolitan of the line (2 battalions - 1940 men)\n** 2nd Line Regiment Switzerland (3rd battalion - 580 men)\n** 2nd Regiment of the line (3rd battalion - 610 men)\n** 1st Regiment of Chasseurs Neapolitan (2 squadrons - 160 men)\n** 3rd Regiment Provisional cuirassiers (1 squadron - 100 men)\n** 11th Italian artillery company (section 1 - 2 guns)\nSpanish forces\n* General Antoni Franch i Estalella, Commander-in-Chief\n** 260 regulars and militia (Captain José Viñas)\n** 200 regulars and militia (Francesc Riera Balaguer)\nJune 14\nA second French sortie on June 14, led by General of Division Joseph Chabran, succeeded only in putting to the torch several buildings in El Bruc after having been defeated and repelled by the Spanish forces led by Joan Baget. The following day, the Spanish attacked the French in their withdrawal to Barcelona, inflicting more than 500 dead and wounded on Chabran's troops.\nFrench army\n* First Division - General of Division Joseph Chabran, Commander-in-Chief\n** Brigade: Brigadier-General Goulas\n*** 7th Regiment of the line (2 battalions - 1785 men)\n*** 16th Regiment of the line (3rd battalion - 789 men)\n** Brigade: Brigadier-General Nicolas\n*** 2nd Regiment of the line (3rd battalion - 610 men)\n***37th Regiment of the line [3rd battalion - 789 men)\n*** 56th Regiment of the line (4th Battalion - 833 men)\n*** 93rd Regiment of the line (3rd battalion - 792 men)\nSpanish forces\n* Commander Joan Baget, Commander-in-Chief\n** Four companies of volunteers (soldiers of Extremadura regiment and militia)\n** Wallon Guards\n** Swiss regiment Wimpffen (300 men)\n** 300 militia (Antoni Franch)\n** 100 militia (Captain José Viñas)\n** Sallen residents (60 men led by the vicar Ramón Mas)\n** Patriots (100 men)\n** 5 guns\nAftermath\nThe Spanish conventional warfare proceeded with the Battle of Girona.\nSee also\n* Drummer of El Bruc\n* Timeline of the Peninsular War\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
