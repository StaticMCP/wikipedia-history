It is signed east-west and runs from DE&nbsp;300 at Everetts Corner southeast to DE&nbsp;8 in Pearsons Corner. The route passes through rural areas of western Kent County as well as the town of Hartly. In Hartly, DE&nbsp;44 intersects DE&nbsp;11. The route was built as a state highway east of Hartly by 1924 and west of Hartly by 1932, receiving the DE&nbsp;44 designation by 1936.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;44 heads to the southeast from DE&nbsp;300 at Everetts Corner on two-lane undivided Everetts Corner Road. The road passes through a mix of woodland and farmland before reaching the town of Hartly. In Hartly, the route intersects DE&nbsp;11, where it becomes Main Street, and passes by homes along with some commercial establishments, crossing an abandoned railroad line. The road then heads to the east out of Hartly as Hartly Road, passing through more rural areas. DE&nbsp;44 continues to its eastern terminus at DE&nbsp;8 in the community of Pearsons Corner.\nDE&nbsp;44 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 4,188&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE&nbsp;8 to a low of 1,565&nbsp;vehicles at the western border of Hartly. The entire length of DE&nbsp;44 is part of the National Highway System.\nHistory\nBy 1920, what is now DE&nbsp;44 existed as an unimproved county road. The road east of Hartly was improved into a state highway by 1924. By 1932, the portion of road west of Hartly became a state highway. DE&nbsp;44 was designated by 1936 to follow its current alignment. The route has not changed since its inception.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-044/ DE&nbsp;44 at AARoads.com]"
