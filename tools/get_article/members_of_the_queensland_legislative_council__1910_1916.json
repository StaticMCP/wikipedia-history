Appointments, made by the Governor of Queensland, were for life, although many members for one reason or another resigned.\nThe Labor Party had a major win in the Legislative Assembly at the 1915 election, and proceeded with their stated goal of abolishing the Legislative Council by introducing legislation to that effect in 1916, which of course was defeated by the non-Labor majority Council. By the end of 1916, the membership had fallen from 44 to 37 members as the government had only appointed one new member in two years.\nOffice bearers\nPresident of the Legislative Council:\n* Arthur Morgan (19 January 1906 – 19 December 1916)\nChairman of Committees:\n* Peter MacPherson (6 August 1907 – 12 September 1913)\n* William Taylor (30 September 1913 – 16 November 1920)\nMembers\nMembers shaded red were Labor Party members of the Council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
