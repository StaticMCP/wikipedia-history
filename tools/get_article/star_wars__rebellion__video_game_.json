Next Generation stated, \"LucasArts should start looking more closely at what it slaps the Star Wars brand on, as consumers will be less likely to forget or forgive.\"\nAccording to PC Data, the game was the U.S.' 18th-best-selling computer game during the January–November 1998 period.\nThe game won the award for \"Most Disappointing Game of the Year\" at GameSpots Best & Worst of 1998 Awards. It was also nominated for \"The Underachiever Award\" at IGNs Best of 1998 Awards, which ultimately went to Trespasser.\nRebellion has been more positively remembered in retrospect, with PC Gamer noting it is a \"pretty effective Star Wars story generator\" with compelling grand strategy elements. Game Rant also notes the game as for its rich Star Wars digital encyclopedia, unique for its time.\nMacworld saw LucasArts' 2006 game Star Wars: Empire at War as a successor to Rebellion. Ars Technica notes that the Fantasy Flight's Star Wars: Rebellion board game is loosely based on the computer game.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
