He shot down 15 enemy aircraft and was one of the top-scoring aces against the V-1 flying bomb.\nEarly life\nEdward Dixon Crew was born 24 December 1917 in a house on the Market Square, Higham Ferrers and was educated at Felsted School and Downing College, Cambridge. While at Downing College he joined the University Air Squadron and following his graduation he was commissioned in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.\nSecond world war\nIn July 1940 Crew joined No. 604 Squadron RAF operating twin-engined Blenheim IF night-fighters. During the Battle of France the squadron was used for day and night operations against Germany troops and patrols over the Dunkirk beaches to protect the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force. With the Battle of Britain at its height the squadron aircraft were fitted with airborne radar, although the system was immature and the Blenheim was not the best night fighter. Later in 1940 the squadron was re-equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter and Crew downed his first Germany aircraft, a Heinkel He 111, on 4 April 1941. With two more aircraft shot down and two damaged he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in June 1941. In June 1942 he had destroyed five aircraft to become an ace and in June 1942 he received a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Cross.\nCrew joined No. 85 Squadron RAF as a flight commander, the squadron operated the radar-equipped twin-engined De Havilland Mosquito. As the number of victories increased Crew was appointed commanding officer of No. 96 Squadron RAF at first with Beaufighters but these were later exchanged for Mosquitos. Between June and September 1944 the squadron had downed 181 V-1 flying bombs and Crew was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership.\nDuring the Second World War Crew downed 15 enemy aircraft and 31½ V-1s. He was the fourth highest scorer against the flying bomb and the most effective Mosquito pilot; the top three scorers all flew the single-engined Hawker Tempest.\nPost-war\nFrom 1948 to 1950 Crew commanded No. 45 Squadron RAF based in Malaya and operating anti-insurgency operations with the Bristol Beaufighter during the Malayan Emergency, he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for his leadership.\nCrew was seconded to the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1952 and at North Bay Ontario commanded Number 3 All Weather Operational Training Unit using among others the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. Back in the United Kingdom he flight tested the Gloster Javelin delta-wing fighter at the Central Fighter Establishment. From 1959 to 1962 he was station commander at RAF Bruggen part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force based in Germany. From 1965 to 1966 he was commander of the Air Forces in Borneo at the time of the Indonesian confrontation with Malaya.\nCrew held a number of senior staff appointments at the Ministry of Defence until 1973 when he retired. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath that year.\nLater life\nCrew worked in the Planning Inspectorate at the Department of the Environment for the next 14 years using his knowledge of airfields.
