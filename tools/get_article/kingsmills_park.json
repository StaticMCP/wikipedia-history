It was the home ground of Inverness Thistle F.C.\nFollowing the merger of Inverness Thistle with Caledonian F.C. in 1994, the new team played at Caledonian's ground, Telford Street Park. In 1996 the club moved to the newly built Caledonian Stadium. A care home currently sits upon the location of the former ground.\nReferences"
