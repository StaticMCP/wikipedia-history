King Edward VII Preparatory School (KEPS), which is situated adjacent to the High School and shares its grounds, caters to boys from grades R to 7.\nHistory\nIn 1902, when the Boer War came to an end, there was an urgent need for schools in the Transvaal. The Milner Administration, in search of suitable buildings in which to establish temporary classrooms, found a vacant cigar factory in Johannesburg, on the corner of Gold and Kerk Streets, which was chosen as venue for \"The Government High School for Boys\", also known as the \"Johannesburg High School for Boys\". Thus was born a school which ultimately became the King Edward VII School.\nIt grew so rapidly that, in 1904, it was moved to Barnato Park where it was established in the mansion that originally had been designed for the mining millionaire Barney Barnato, who died at sea in 1897. At its new location, it was referenced as \"Johannesburg College\" but, within seven years, the premises were deemed inadequate and, in 1911, the school was moved to its present site on the Houghton ridge where new buildings had been impressively-designed and specifically constructed for the school.  The time frame, within less than a year after the founding of the Union of South Africa and the death of Queen Victoria's eldest son and successor, Edward VII, led to the proposal that the institution's name be changed to honour his memory, thus establishing the appellation, King Edward VII School.\nHeadmasters\nCaptain Edward Lancelot Sanderson M.A (3rd Battalion Prince of Wales Own Yorkshire Regiment)\nBuildings\nOver a century old, the school buildings of King Edward retain their impressive appearance and are considered national monuments. These include the school hall, the back façade, the front façade, the lecture theatre and library wing, the memorial wing and the cenotaph in the main quad.\nSports and culture\nSports that are offered in the school are:\n* Athletics\n* Basketball\n* Chess\n* Cricket\n* Cross country\n* Golf\n* Hockey\n* Rowing\n* Rugby\n* Soccer\n* Squash\n* Swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Tennis\n* Water polo\nCultural activities that are offered:\n*English Public Speaking\n*Afrikaans Public Speaking\n*Debating\n*Model UN\n*Music Society\n*Choral Society\n*Pipe Band\n*Marimba\nNotable Old Edwardians\n*Sydney Kentridge, lawyer and judge\n*Sydney Lipworth, lawyer and businessman\n*Mark Weinberg\n*Donald Gordon, businessman and philanthropist\n*Johann Kriegler\n*Richard Goldstone Constitutional Court judge\n*Ronnie Kasrils, cabinet minister\n*William Kentridge, artist\n*Bryce Courtenay, novelist (\"The Power of One\")\n*Michael McClelland, Professor of Microbiology and Genetics at the University of California, Irvine\n*Antony Preston, Naval Historian\n*Arthur Walker HCG, Bar SAAF Pilot\nSportsmen\n* Buster Nupen, cricketer\n*Gary Player, golf\n*Arthur Langton, cricketer\n*Ali Bacher, cricketer\n*Kevin McKenzie, cricketer\n*Neil McKenzie, cricketer\n*Ray Jennings, cricketer\n*Hugh Page, cricketer\n*Adam Bacher, cricketer\n*Nic Pothas, cricketer\n*Graeme Smith, cricketer\n*Joe van Niekerk, rugby player\n*Bryan Habana, rugby player\n*Rhys M.
