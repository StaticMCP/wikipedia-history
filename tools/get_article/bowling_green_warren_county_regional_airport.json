It is owned by the City of Bowling Green and Warren County.\nMcDonnell Douglas MD-83 at Bowling Green Airport]]\nHistory\nThe site was established in 1934 as a military airfield. Shortly after the end of WWII the airport was served by an intrastate airline, Bluegrass Airlines through fall 1946. On August 1, 1948 Eastern Airlines added Bowling Green to its Chicago to Atlanta route.  Aircraft used were the Douglas DC-3, Martin 4-0-4, and the Lockheed L-188 Electra. In 1969 Eastern contracted to Air South and Wright Airlines to serve Bowling Green. The last Wright Airlines flight left Bowling Green around 4:30 pm, September 10, 1972, leaving the airport without airline service.\nCharter flights for Western Kentucky University Men's and Women's athletic programs use the airport regularly.\nAirlines and destinations\nBowling Green–Warren County Regional Airport had seasonal service on a single airline, Contour Airlines, to Destin–Fort Walton Beach Airport in Destin, Florida.
