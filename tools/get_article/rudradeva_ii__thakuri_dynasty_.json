      "text": "# Rudradeva II (Thakuri dynasty)\n\nRudradeva II () was a son of Simhadeva and a Thakuri king of Nepal who reigned from 1167–1175.\nLife\nRudradeva was the third son of Simhadeva and a younger brother of the preceding monarch Aanandadeva. He succeeded Aanandadeva after the former's death in 1175 at a late age. His reign was generally peaceful and, unlike his predecessors', the feudal lords did not incite any riots and conflicts.\nRudradeva had assumed the throne despite the existence of a legitimate heir, i.e. Aanandadeva's son. Historians generally agree that the three sons of Simhadeva had an agreement to share the throne in succession among themselves after the death of Mahindradeva, their eldest brother. Following the agreement, Rudradeva's younger brother Amritadeva succeeded him after his death in 1175.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
