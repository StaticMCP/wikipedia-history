It is a compound word that combines viking age Old Norse varða (cairn, a pile of stones) and the Old English copp (a summit or hill top). The lords of the manor of Warthecopp / Warcop over time changed their surname from Warthecopp to Warcop.\nHistory\nThe local Church of England parish is St Columba's Church, Warcop, which is a Norman church and is built on the site of a Roman marching camp. It holds an annual \"Rushbearing Festival\" each year in late June. Warcop boasts the oldest usable bridge over the River Eden, which dates from the 14th century or earlier.\nThe village has houses that date from at least the 15th century: Warcop Tower c. 1400 or before and Warcop Hall c. 1500; other houses date from the 17th or 18th century to the present day. It was historically part of Westmorland until 1974.\nWarcop had its own railway station, Warcop railway station from 1862, which closed in 1962. The station yard (the station house is a private residence) has now reopened as part of the Eden Valley Railway.\nThe Ministry of Defence operates the Warcop Training Area to the North West of Warcop, providing tank and infantry training.\nGovernance\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north to Murton with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 1,352.\nClimate\n, 1991–2020 normals\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|width = auto\n|Jan high C = 5.8\n|Feb high C = 6.3\n|Mar high C = 8.3\n|Apr high C = 11.2\n|May high C = 14.4\n|Jun high C = 16.8\n|Jul high C = 18.7\n|Aug high C = 18.0\n|Sep high C = 15.8\n|Oct high C = 12.2\n|Nov high C = 8.7\n|Dec high C = 6.3\n|year high C =\n|Jan mean C = 3.4\n|Feb mean C = 3.6\n|Mar mean C = 5.1\n|Apr mean C = 7.4\n|May mean C = 10.2\n|Jun mean C = 12.8\n|Jul mean C = 14.8\n|Aug mean C = 14.4\n|Sep mean C = 12.3\n|Oct mean C = 9.2\n|Nov mean C = 6.0\n|Dec mean C = 3.7\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = 1.0\n|Feb low C = 0.9\n|Mar low C = 1.8\n|Apr low C = 3.6\n|May low C = 6.0\n|Jun low C = 8.9\n|Jul low C = 10.9\n|Aug low C = 10.8\n|Sep low C = 8.8\n|Oct low C = 6.1\n|Nov low C = 3.3\n|Dec low C = 1.0\n|year low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 93.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 76.3\n|Mar precipitation mm = 62.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 50.6\n|May precipitation mm = 52.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 63.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 89.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 74.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 94.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 101.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 104.2\n|year precipitation mm =\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 14.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 12.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 12.3\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.9\n|May precipitation days = 10.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 11.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 12.3\n|Aug precipitation days = 13.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 11.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 15.3\n|Nov precipitation days = 16.1\n|Dec precipitation days = 15.5\n|year precipitation days =\n|source = Met Office\n}}\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Warcop\nReferences\nLocation grid\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.cumbriacountyhistory.org.uk/township/warcop  Cumbria County History Trust: Warcop] (nb: provisional research only – see Talk page)"
