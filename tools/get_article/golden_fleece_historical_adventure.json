      "text": "# Golden Fleece Historical Adventure\n\nGolden Fleece Historical Adventure was an American adventure pulp magazine which published nine issues between 1938 and 1939.  Golden Fleece specialised in publishing historical fiction - one of the few pulp magazines to do so. It published two stories by Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan the Barbarian: \"Black Vulmea's Vengeance\" and \"Gates of Empire\".  Other writers included Talbot Mundy, H. Bedford-Jones, Ralph Milne Farley, Anthony M. Rud and Murray Leinster.  Contributing artists included Jay Jackson, Harold Delay, Harold McCauley, and Margaret Brundage, who painted two covers for Golden Fleece.\nScience fiction historian Mike Ashley describes it as a \"rousing and unpretentious\" magazine, and suggests that it may have failed because of distribution problems; the publisher, Sun Publications, was a small Chicago-based firm.  Ashley also suggests that it would have been difficult for the magazine to compete with Adventure, one of the leading pulp magazines of its day.\nBibliographic details\nThe publisher was Sun Publications of Chicago; the editors were A. J. Gontier, Jr., and C.G. Williams.  There were nine monthly issues, from October 1938 to June 1939.  There was one volume of three issues, and a second volume of six issues.  Each magazine was in pulp format, with 128 pages, priced at 20 cents.\nThere was one anthology published that collected fiction from Golden Fleece Historical Adventure:\n*\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
