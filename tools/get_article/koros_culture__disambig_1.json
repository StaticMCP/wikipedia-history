Found in Méhtelek, Hungary]]\nThe Körös culture/Criș culture is a Neolithic archaeological culture in Central Europe that was named after the river Körös in eastern Hungary. The same river has the name Criș in Romania, hence the name Criş culture. The two variants of the river name are used for the same archaeological culture in the two regions. The Criș culture survived from about 5800 to 5300 BC. It is related to the neighboring Starčevo culture and is included within a larger grouping known as the Starčevo–Körös–Criş culture.\nGenetics\nIn a 2017 genetic study published in Nature, the remains of six individuals ascribed to the Körös culture was analyzed. Of the two samples of Y-DNA extracted, one belonged to I2a2, and one belonged to G. Of the six samples of mtDNA extracted, five were subclades of K1, and one was a sample of H.\nSee also\n* Starčevo–Kőrös–Criș culture\n* Starčevo culture\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.donau-archaeologie.de/doku.php/kulturen/koeroes_english_version The Körös culture]"
