QIC manages funds on behalf of clients in Australia, North America, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, including the Queensland Government, pension and superannuation funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurers, universities and other government institutions.\nAlthough wholly owned by the Queensland Government, QIC operates commercially and invests alongside global institutional partners. As of June 2025, it manages more than A$130 billion in assets under management (AUM).\nOperations\nQIC’s investment activities are organised into three complementary areas: Private Markets, Liquid Markets, and State Investments. Each specialises in a distinct set of asset classes and investment mandates, managed for government and institutional clients in Australia and globally.\nPrivate Markets\nQIC’s Private Markets capabilities centre on alternative and unlisted assets, including infrastructure, real estate, private equity, private debt (see also private credit) and agriculture. QIC’s infrastructure portfolio spans energy and utilities, transport, and social infrastructure sectors in Australia, the US and Europe, while its real estate platform manages retail, office and industrial property assets across Australia. QIC also invests internationally in private equity and debt through direct and fund strategies, providing clients with exposure to global private capital markets.\nQIC’s private markets capabilities build on QIC’s heritage in real assets and its focus on active management.\nLiquid Markets\nThe Liquid Markets Group manages fixed income and multi-asset overlay strategies, including cash and fixed income portfolios and advanced derivative-based implementation such as currency overlays, asset rebalancing and options-based protection strategies.\nState Investments\nThe State Investments division manages capital on behalf of the Queensland Government and other sovereign-linked clients. As of 2025 the division reports over A$70 billion in assets under management across approximately 40 clients, reflecting QIC’s foundational role as the investment manager for Queensland’s public sector funds.\nGovernance\nQIC is constituted under the Queensland Investment Corporation Act 1991 and operates as a company Government-Owned Corporation (GOC). Its Board of Directors, accountable to shareholding Ministers, including the Queensland Treasurer, oversees strategy, risk management and investment performance.\nHistory\nQIC was established on 1 July 1991 by the Queensland Government under the Queensland Investment Corporation Act 1991 to manage the State’s long-term investments. Its early activities focused on liquid markets (fixed income, currency, cash) and real estate.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Detail\n|-\n|2002\n|Began managing funds for clients outside the Queensland Government.\n|-\n|2004 - 2006\n|Opened offices in Sydney, Melbourne, and London; established private equity and infrastructure investment capabilities.\n|-\n|2008\n|QIC transitioned from a statutory Government Owned Corporation to a company GOC (QIC Limited) to enhance commercial independence while remaining wholly owned by the Queensland Government.\nBecame a signatory to the [https://www.unpri.org/ United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI)].\n|-\n|2011 - 2014\n|Opened international offices in San Francisco, Copenhagen, and New York.\n|-\n|2021\n|Launched Private Debt capability.\nKylie Rampa was appointed Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Damien Frawley.\n|-\n|2023\n|Opened an office in Singapore in 2023.\n|-\n|2025\n|Andrew King appointed Chairman of the Board.\n|}\nKey people\nQIC has\n* [https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/103560 Andrew King] – Chairman\n* [https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/qic-appoints-kylie-rampa-as-new-chief-executive-20211110-p597sp Kylie Rampa] – Chief Executive Officer\n* Claire Blake - Chief Financial and Operating Officer\n* [https://globalswf.com/news/fund-of-the-month-mar-25-queensland-investment-corporation-qic- Ravi Sriskandarajah] – Executive Director, Client Solutions and Capital\n* [https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/2bswtrpjxbwjcsovmgkxs/corner-office/qic-names-new-cio-for-state-investments-team Allison Hill] – Chief Investment Officer, State Investments\n* [https://www.afr.com/companies/infrastructure/resilient-and-essential-infrastructure-in-hot-demand-20210802-p58f1m Ross Israel] –  Global Head of Infrastructure\n* [https://www.theaustralian.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=TAWEB_WRE170_a&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fbusiness%2Fqic-appoints-new-real-estate-head%2Fnews-story%2Fed0dfcadc4f54fc20829aa4012b8d902&memtype=anonymous&mode=premium&v21=GROUPB-Segment-2-NOSCORE&V21spcbehaviour=append Deborah Coakley] – Managing Director, Real Estate\n* [https://www.privateequityinternational.com/pe-is-getting-crowded-and-thats-how-qic-likes-it/ Stephen Whatmore] – Head of Private Equity\n* [https://www.financialstandard.com.au/news/qic-sees-changes-in-private-debt-liquid-markets-179797098 Beverley Morris] – Head of Liquid Markets\n* [https://www.asiaasset.com/post/26929-qic-230224 Simon La Greca] – Head of Private Debt\nOffices\nQIC has offices in Brisbane (headquarters), Sydney, Melbourne, London, New York, San Francisco, Singapore and Copenhagen.\nSee also\n*Australian Retirement Trust\n*[https://www.futurefund.gov.au/ Future Fund (Australia)]\n*Clean Energy Finance Corporation\n*[https://www.brightersuper.com.au/ Brighter Super]\n*Queensland Government\nReferences"
