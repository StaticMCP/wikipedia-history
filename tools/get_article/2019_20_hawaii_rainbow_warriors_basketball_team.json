The Rainbow Warriors, led by fifth-year head coach Eran Ganot, played their home games at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii was a member of the Big West Conference, and participated in their eighth season in that league. On November 6, Ganot took a temporary leave of absence to deal with an undisclosed medical issue. He returned to coaching on December 29 for their game against Maine. First year assistant Chris Gerlufsen served as acting head coach from November 6 to December 28, compiling an 8–5 record. They finished the season 17–13, 8–8 in Big West play to finish in a tie for fourth place. They were set to be the No. 4 seed in the Big West tournament. However, the Big West tournament was canceled amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDepartures\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! Name !! Number !! Pos. !! Height !!
