It was founded around the 6th century during the Dvaravati period.\nThe city was probably abandoned following the decline of the Dvaravati civilization during the 10th–11th century and was then repopulated in the 18th century by Muen Kuan (), an aide-de-camp of  from Vientiane. The city was left abandoned again during the Lao rebellion against Siam in 1827.\nLayout and location\nThe ancient city of Ban Khu Mueang is located 1 kilometer north of Ban Nong Paeng () in the  of Nong Bua Daeng, Chaiyaphum province, Thailand. It was a rectangular settlement 500–600 meters long on each side surrounded by a layer of an earthen moat. Two streams flow through it, Huai Pong () and Huai Mueang (), which both lead to the Chi River 8 kilometers away to the southwest.\nAccording to locals, the city's earthen embankment used to be 3 meters high and the moat 3 meters wide. The city has a single gate on the south.\nThe site is dated to the Dvaravati period and is related to an old Kaset Sombun () located 35 kilometers away to the northeast. In addition, there are historic cities dated the same period nearby, such as Mueang Ham Hok and Nakhon Kalong.\nFindings\nThe site has yet to be officially excavated. Archaeological surveys found fragments of pottery, both smooth and with rope marks, stone shards, cotton spun sieves, and some bone fragments. Villagers also said that when tilling the soil, colored beads, gold or bronze rings, pieces of pottery, and bone fragments were often found.\nAbout 1 kilometer outside the ancient moat to the south, during the construction of Kuru Prachanukun School () on the former graveyard in 1958, bone fragments, broken pots, and jars were found numerously, but no academic study were performed.\nTo the north of the site, approximately 400 meters, at the present-day Wat Pa Semaram (), villagers previously called Don Bai Sema (; ), numbers of large red sandstone Bai Sema were discovered.\nReferences"
