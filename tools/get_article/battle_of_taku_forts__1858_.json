The battle ended as an allied success. However, the first phase of the Second Opium War would end with the Treaties of Tianjin and the forts were returned to the hands of the Qing Army, leading to the Second Battle of Taku Forts in 1859.\nBackground\nAfter the beginning of the Second Opium War, the Anglo-French alliance captured the significant harbor of Canton (Guangzhou) during the Battle of Canton in 1857. The Xianfeng Emperor received the news that Canton had been occupied on 27 January 1858. The British commander Michael Seymour, hoping to force a settlement (the later Treaty of Tianjin), ordered an attack on the Taku Forts as they were the closer path towards Peking. The fortresses were then looted, where the British and French found many weapons and cannons, both foreign and domestically cast.\nBritish soldiers who fought in the battle were awarded the Second China War Medal with the clasp \"Taku Forts 1858\".\nNotes\nReferences\n*Bartlett, Beatrice S.
