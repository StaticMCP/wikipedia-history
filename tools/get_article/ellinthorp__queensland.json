In the , the locality of Ellinthorp had a population of 30 people.\nGeography\nDalrymple Creek forms the southern boundary of the locality and the South Western railway line forms the eastern boundary with the now-abandoned Ellinthorp railway station () once serving the town, which is immediately west of the station.\nContrary to the Queensland Government's normal rules that no locality should be an \"island\" within another locality, Ellinthorp is completely surrounded by the locality of Talgai.\nHistory\nThe township was known as Talgai before it was renamed Ellinthorp on 19 March 1931. The name Ellinthorp presumably comes from the Ellinthorp railway station, which was originally named Dalrymple after Dalrymple Creek, but which was renamed Ellinthorp on 28 January 1916 after the Tasmanian home of pastoralist brothers Charles George Henry Carr Clark and George John Edwin Clark of Talgai. Although there are over 100 town lots in the town plan, many have not been developed while others are used for farming, suggesting Ellinthorp was expected to be a more populous town.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Ellinthorp had a population of 19 people.\nIn the , the locality of Ellinthorp had a population of 30 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Elinthorp.
