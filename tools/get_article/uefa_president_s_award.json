The accolade, first introduced by UEFA in 1998, is usually awarded annually to a football personality who is deemed to have advanced the game's development and success.\nThe 2021 UEFA President's Award went to Denmark's national football team captain and their medical and coaching staff for their heroic response when Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest on the field during a Euro 2020 match against Finland. During the game, Eriksen collapsed unexpectedly, and his teammates quickly formed a protective circle around him to shield him from the cameras, providing privacy while the medical team performed life-saving CPR. Denmark’s captain, Simon Kjær, played a crucial role in comforting Eriksen’s partner and directing the team to support each other. The medical team’s swift response saved Eriksen’s life, and their professionalism and composure were widely praised.\nRecently, Eric Cantona has become infamous for his bizarre acceptance speech for the 2019 UEFA Presidents Award. Dressed in a flat cap, he began by quoting William Shakespeare's King Lear – \"As flies to wanton boys we are for the gods\" – before referencing science, war and crime.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
