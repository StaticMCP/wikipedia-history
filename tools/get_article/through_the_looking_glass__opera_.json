The arrival of a monstrous crow prevents the battle and Alice finds herself ...\n;Scene 7 The White Queen – Alice, The White Queen, Young Alice\n... addressing the White Queen, who explains the difficulties of living backwards and how to believe in as many as six impossible things before breakfast. The Young Alices offer the advice that it is better to suffer now for crimes one might commit, to which Alice replies that she has never heard such a thing.\n;Scene 8 The River – Young Alice, Alice, Lewis Carroll, sheep\nAlice, accompanied by Lewis Carroll and the Young Alices, embark on a boat journey on \"a perfect summer's day\". Alice leaning out of the boat trying to grasp the rushes and Carroll remembering how the story poured from him, while a sheep knits, unobserved by Alice.\n;Scene 9 Humpty Dumpty – Alice, Young Alice, Humpty Dumpty\nAlice meets Humpty Dumpty (\"Are you the Jabberwock?\" asks Young Alice) who explains to her how words are very important and who also sings her his very disturbing song, \"I sent a message to the fish.\"\n;Scene 10 The Battle – White King, Unicorn, Alice, Mutton, Pudding, Young Alice\nAlice finds herself in a square where a picnic takes place. Alice is introduced to the food, oysters, a leg of mutton and a pudding.

Is it the Jabberwock?\n;Scene 11 White Knight – White Knight, Alice\nAlice, the mature woman, seeks permission from the White Knight to grow up.
