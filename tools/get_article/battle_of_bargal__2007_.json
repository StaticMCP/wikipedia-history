They were a group of the Islamic Courts Union personnel heading to travel on further out of the country. After their boats sustained damaged from the rough seas they came ashore in Bargal where they raided a local village and clashed with locals before heading up the hills surrounding Bargal. Three members  in a task force created by Tier 1 operators from multiple US Military branches (including Chris Vansant a Delta Force operator) who had been tracking the boats arrived in Bargal and with the help of a local warlord \"Bashir\" set up a patrol base and eventually confronted the fighters. In the fighting some of the local fighters were injured. On June 1, the Combat Controller in the 3 man US team  contacted  a United States Navy warship, the USS Chafee, and directed fire to the  hills around Bargal where Islamist militants had set up a base. The target of the shelling may have been an al-Qaeda operative who the United States believed was involved  in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.\nAccording to the Puntland regional government, as many as a dozen fighters including Somali militants as well as British nationals, Americans, Swedish, Pakistanis and Yemenis were killed in these operations, and five government troops were injured.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6714473.stm BBC News: US attacks Somali 'militant base']\n*[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6716725.stm BBC News: 'Foreign fighters' die in Somalia]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021111301/http://puntlandonline.com/viewEnarticle.php?articleid=2731 Yahoo!
