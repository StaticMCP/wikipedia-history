He remained there as lecturer, senior lecturer, reader, and professor until 1994.\n*Edwards Professor of Medieval History at the University of Glasgow (1994–2003)\n* Director of the Institute of Historical Research in the University of London (2003–08)\n* Professor of Medieval History at the University of East Anglia (2008–2010). He is now Emeritus Professor there.\n*Visiting Professorship at the University of Caen Normandie from 2009 to 2012\n* The University of Caen Normandie awarded him an honorary doctorate (Docteur Honoris Causa) in 2000.\nDuring this peripatetic career, he has held several positions that have involved responsibilities for the general development of his subject, such as Head of History and Welsh History in Cardiff, Head of the Department of Medieval History, Head of the School of History and Archaeology, and Head of History in Glasgow, and Director of the Centre of East Anglian Studies at the University of East Anglia. His time at the Institute of Historical Research, among other things, required that he animate public debate about History's role in British education and in public life and that he participate in delegations and projects that took him to Japan, Russia, Israel, and the United States.\nPublications\nBooks\nThe most important of his books are:\n* Normandy before 1066 (London and New York, Longmans, 1982)\n* A Bibliography of Domesday Book (Woodbridge, The Boydell Press, 1986)\n* William the Conqueror (George Philip, 1989; reprinted, Tempus, 2001,2004)\n* Regesta Regum Anglo-Normannorum: The Acta of William I, 1066–1087 (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1998)\n* The Normans and Empire (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013)\n* William the Conqueror (London and New Haven, Yale University Press, 2016). Translated into French as Guillaume le Conquérant (Paris, Flammarion, 2019)\n*La Tapisserie de Bayeux (Paris: Citadelles & Mazenod, 2019). Co-authored with Xavier Barral i Altet).\nThe Normans and Empire argues for a new analytical framework for the expansion of the Normans in Western Europe and for the experience of the British Isles. William the Conqueror (Guillaume le Conquérant) proposes a radical revision of the life of William the Conqueror.\nAll of his books are based on extensive researches in the archives and libraries in France and Normandy that have uncovered a lot of new or inadequately known material, some of it published in Regum Anglo-Normannorum: The Acta of William I. He retains an interest in the interpretation of charters as literary sources and is currently working on a book on William the Conqueror's half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux and further innovative approaches to the history of northern Europe during the period from the tenth to the thirteenth century. A Festschrift has been published in his honour:\n*Normandy and its Neighbours, 900-1250: Essays for David Bates, ed. David Crouch and Kathleen Thompson (Turnhout, Brepols, 2011).\nHe has co-edited a volume in honour of Professor Elisabeth van Houts, Lives, Identities and Histories in the Central Middle Ages, ed.
