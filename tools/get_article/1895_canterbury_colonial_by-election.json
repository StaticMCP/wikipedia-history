Parkes became bankrupt because of business failings and mortgage foreclosures, having owed a large sum of money to the Bank of New South Wales (most of it as guarantee for his father, Sir Henry Parkes).\nParkes was the only candidate to contest, and he was declared elected at the close of candidate nominations. He was again re-elected one month later at the New South Wales colonial election on 24 July 1895.\nKey events\n* 3 June 1895 − Varney Parkes resigns\n* 4 June 1895 − Writ of election issued by the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly\n* 5 June 1895 − Varney Parkes declared bankrupt\n* 11 June 1895 − Candidate nominations\n* 14 June 1895 − Polling day (no poll held)\n* 21 June 1895 − Return of writ (scheduled date)\nResults\n}}\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n*Electoral results for the district of Canterbury\n*List of New South Wales state by-elections\nNotes\nReferences"
