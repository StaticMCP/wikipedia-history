It rewards fiction published by UK and Irish small presses, defined as those with fewer than five full-time employees. The prize money – initially raised by crowdfunding and latterly augmented by sponsorship – is divided between the publishing house, the author, and, if relevant, the translator.\nHistory\nThe prize was first awarded in 2017. It ran for nine years as the Republic of Consciousness Prize for Small Presses. In 2025 it announced that it was partnering with Queen Mary University and rebranding as the Queen Mary Small Press Fiction Prize. The first award under that name will be the 2026 prize.\nWinners, shortlists and longlists\n2017\nThe shortlist for the 2017 award was announced on 11 January 2017.
