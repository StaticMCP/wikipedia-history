      "text": "# Northern Fujiwara\n\nThe Northern Fujiwara (奥州藤原氏 Ōshū Fujiwara-shi) were a Japanese noble family that ruled the Tōhoku region (the northeast of Honshū) of Japan during the 12th century, 1094-1104, as their own realm.\nThey succeeded the semi-independent Emishi families of the 11th century, who were gradually brought down by the Minamoto clan loyal to the Imperial Court in Kyoto. They ruled over an independent region that derived its wealth from gold mining, horse-trading and as middlemen in the trade in luxury items from continental Asian states and from the far northern Emishi and Ainu people. They were able to keep their independence vis-a-vis Kyoto by the strength of their warrior bands until they were ultimately conquered by the Kantō samurai clans led by Minamoto no Yoritomo, in the Battle of Ōshū in 1189.\nOrigins\nHistorically, there has been a theory that the Northern Fujiwara descended from the ethnic Emishi people, but in terms of genealogy, they were descended from Fujiwara no Hidesato.\nFujiwara no Kiyohira, after his father's death, was raised as a member of the Kiyohara clan as his mother remarried into a Kiyohara family in Dewa Province. However, Kiyohira, with the aid of Minamoto no Yoshiie, became independent and established themselves in Hiraizumi (in present-day Iwate Prefecture) in 1087, when he won the victory in the Gosannen War.\nHistory\nAfter its foundation by Fujiwara no Kiyohira in 1087, the Northern Fujiwara clan ruled the Mutsu and Dewa Province for over a century.\nAlong with Kiyohira, the next two generations of Fujiwara no Motohira and Hidehira saw the zenith of Northern Fujiwara's power in the Tōhoku region. At the zenith of their rule, they attracted a number of artisans from imperial capital Kyoto and created a capital city, Hiraizumi. They introduced the Kyoto and Heian culture into the area and built many temples, such as the Chūson-ji founded in 1095.\nDuring the Genpei War (1180-1185), fought between the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan, the Northern Fujiwara remained neutral.\nA conflict erupted between lord Minamoto no Yoritomo and the Northern Fujiwara clan over the extradition of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, younger brother and former general of Yoritomo, who had fled to Hiraizumi. Hidehira had remained neutral during the Genpei War, but when Yoshitsune took refuge in Hiraizumi, he decided to protect him.\nHidehira, who had protected Yoshitsune, soon died and his son Fujiwara no Yasuhira succeeded his father as the 4th head of the Northern Fujiwara clan. Yasuhira failed to resist Minamoto no Yoritomo's pressure, and had Yoshitsune assassinated. After Yoshitsune was assassinated in April 1189, his severed head was delivered to Kamakura by July for Yoritomo to see. However, Yoritomo was already set on attacking Hiraizumi and this did nothing to repair their damaged relations.\nOn September 1, 1189, 284,000 cavalrymen led by Yoritomo set out to attack Hiraizumi. Yasuhira prepared himself an army of 170,000 cavalrymen to defend his realm. Thus, the Battle of Ōshū began.\nYasuhira's forces were defeated one after another, and on October 2, he fled Hiraizumi leaving it afire. Yoritomo entered Hiraizumi the next day. Yasuhira was found and killed in Nienosaku, Hinai, Mutsu Province (present-day Ōdate, Akita Prefecture) on October 14.\nThe Battle of Ōshū resulted in the destruction of the Northern Fujiwara clan. This marked the end of the tumultuous period of civil war that began in 1180, and the completion of Yoritomo's nationwide domination and the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate.}}\n(in Japanese)}}\n}}\n|TAD=Tadahira* (忠衡) |TAK=Takahira (高衡)}}\nIzumi (no) Saburo\n(Adopted kin are not shown.)\nSee also\n*Fujiwara clan\n*Hokke (Fujiwara)\nReferences\n*Hudson, Mark J.. 1999. “Ainu Ethnogenesis and the Northern Fujiwara”.
