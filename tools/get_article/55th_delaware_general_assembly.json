Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 4, 1831, two weeks before the beginning of the second year of the administration of Governor David Hazzard.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not affect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a National Republican majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Presley Spruance Jr., Kent County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Joshua Burton, Sussex County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Jacob Alrichs\n*John Caulk\n*William T.
