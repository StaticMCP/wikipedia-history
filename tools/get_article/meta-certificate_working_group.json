The discussions were public as in a list server but with a privacy innovation—the participants' names and email addresses were anonymized. This privacy feature, which any participant could break voluntarily by simply disclosing name and email address in the list, allowed the discussion to proceed on a technical level more easily, with less ad hominem attacks. This also allowed unwitting competitors to collaborate, creating an open climate.\nThe work developed by the MCWG has been applied to Internet standards and practical developments in several work groups and companies worldwide.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://mcwg.org MCWG Website] - The current MCWG website is a \"Read-Only Internet Landmark\" that preserves the content that was created from 1997 to 2000. Some links are not operational, including the list servers."
