It is unusual in coffee cup styles in having a short stem, and typically no handle or saucer. It has been most popular in France. Iced coffee drinks in a variety of recipes, some alcoholic, are also called mazagran; they may or may not be served in Mazagran cups.\nThe Battle of Mazagran took place there in 1840 between French soldiers and Algerians and a legend claims that during the night, the 123 besieged French soldiers drank coffee laced with alcoholic beverages. It is a glass or cup on a foot, optionally also with a handle or a short stem. Mazagrans can be made of terracotta, porcelain or glass.[http://www.faiences-moustiers.com/fr/articles/mazagran.htm Coupe mazagran en faïence de Moustiers et de Provence, Art de la table, artisanat France]\nMazagran was also the name of a failed carbonated coffee soda beverage developed as a collaboration between Starbucks and Pepsi in the mid-1990s.\nReferences"
