The village was laid out on October 5, 1832, by Zachariah Cicott, a French-Indian trader and scout for General William Henry Harrison, on Cicott's Reserve, ground that was given to him by the government for his services.  A post office was established on March 24, 1834, and closed on January 31, 1950.  Now the town uses the post office in nearby Attica, despite the fact that Attica is in a different county.\nThe first newspaper in the county was produced in Independence, starting in 1844.  It was called the Wabash Register and was run by Enos Canutt.\nGeography\nIndependence is located in the eastern part of the county on the western banks of the Wabash River, about  northeast and upstream of the county seat of Williamsport.
