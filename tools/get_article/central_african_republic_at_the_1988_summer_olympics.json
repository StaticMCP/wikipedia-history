This marked the third appearance of the nation at a Summer Olympics. The country entered 15 competitors, the highest number of Central Africans appearing at any Games so far; with the basketball team comprising 12 of them. In addition to the boxers Fidèle Mohinga and Moussa Wiawindi, there was marathon runner Adolphe Ambowodé, who had previously competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics. No medals were won by any of those athletes.\nBackground\nThe Central African Republic made its debut in the Olympic Games at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, Mexico. The country has twice boycotted the Olympic Games, first was because of the inclusion of the New Zealand team at the 1976 Summer Olympics despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation's rugby union team shortly prior. Then in 1980, the country was one of several who joined in with a United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The highest number of Central African athletes entered in a team for an Olympics is 15, occurring at both the 1988 and 1992 Summer Olympics.\nCompetitors\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! width=180|Sport\n! width=55|Men\n! width=55|Women\n! width=55|Total\n|-\n| align=left|Athletics\n| 1 || 0 || 1\n|-\n| align=left|Basketball\n| 12 || 0 || 12\n|-\n| align=left|Boxing\n| 2 || – || 2\n|-\n!
