      "text": "# Battle of Kumeyki\n\nThe Battle of Kumeyky was fought during the Pavlyuk Uprising between the Polish crown forces, and Ukrainian peasants & insurgent Cossacks on December 16, 1637. The Polish crown army, under the command of Mikołaj Potocki, surrounded the Cossacks, commanded by Pavlo Pavliuk, in the town of Borovytsia, located in modern-day Cherkasy Oblast in central Ukraine. The Polish forces were unable to capture the town, so Potocki proposed a negotiation, which Pavliuk and the senior starshyna (officers) agreed to. Potocki, ignoring the rules of parley, had Pavliuk and the other leaders of the rebellion taken prisoner during the negotiation talks, sent to Warsaw, and executed.\nReferences\n* M.Dubienicki - Kudak.
