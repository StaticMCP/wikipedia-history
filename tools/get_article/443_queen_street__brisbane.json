The site is the last riverfront location in the Brisbane central business district. The 47 storey tower includes 106 one bedroom, 106 two bedroom and 54 four bedroom  apartments. All 264 apartments will have views of the Brisbane River. Due to its unique design the tower is described as a high rise Queenslander.\nA development application for the project was lodged with the Brisbane City Council in October 2015. The University of Queensland, that owned the adjoining Customs House, unsuccessfully appealed the approval.\nDemolition of the former office building commenced in October 2017, with construction of the footings for the new building commencing in May 2018.\nConstruction was suspended in February 2022 after contractor Probuild was placed in administration. The building was completed by Hutchinson Builders.\nSee also\n*List of tallest buildings in Brisbane\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/443-queen-street/22199 Building at The Skyscraper Center database]"
