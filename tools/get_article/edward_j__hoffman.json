Hoffman, with Michel Ter-Pogossian and Michael E. Phelps, developed the Positron Emission Tomography scanner in 1973.\nHoffman was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He earned a BS chemistry from Saint Louis University in 1963, his Ph.D. in Nuclear Chemistry from Washington University in St. Louis in 1970. In 1972 he joined the faculty of Washington University's School of Medicine, where he and Dr. Michael Phelps began developing what later became known as the PET scanner, used to detect cancer, heart disease and other serious illnesses. In 1975, Phelps and Hoffman moved to the University of Pennsylvania.\nStarting in 1976, Hoffman was a professor at David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in the Departments of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology and Radiological Sciences. In 1999, he authored a book that reviews the biochemical basis of alternative medical treatments for cancer. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the journal IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science.\nHe died of liver cancer in Los Angeles.\nBibliography\n* Hoffman, EJ (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNmIuHxe4g0C&dq=orthomolecular&pg=PA195 Cancer and the Search for Selective Biochemical Inhibitors], 2nd edition, CRC Press,\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040710113136/http://www.nuc.ucla.edu/news/ehoffman Eulogy by Michael Phelps]"
