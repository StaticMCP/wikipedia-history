The first branch opened at SM Megamall in 1991. Now more than 20 branches are opened inside and outside SM Supermalls. Aside from the regular Toy Kingdom stores, SM Stores have smaller toy sections called Toy Kingdom Express.\nToy Kingdom's main rivals in the Philippines are Toys \"R\" Us (located at several Robinsons Malls, and Ayala Malls) and ToyTown (with branches at Glorietta, Festival Alabang, and Market! Market!). Kidz Station (with three locations in Makati and one at the Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong) was also a rival store until Toys \"R\" Us acquired them in November 2010.\nToy Kingdom holds the biennial major event Toy Expo Philippines, which gathers toy brands to showcase their latest offerings through exhibit set-ups and activities. A free-admission event, usually held during August at the SMX Convention Center in the Mall of Asia Complex, Toy Expo Philippines started in 2012. It held its 4th edition in 2018 from August 24 to 26 participated by brands such as Peppa Pig, My Little Pony, Play-Doh, Shopkins, Littlest Pet Shop, PAW Patrol, Super Wings, and many more.\nHistory\nIn March 2020, Toy Kingdom temporarily shut down its stores and paused their operations in Metro Manila, Luzon and Cagayan de Oro due to the implementation of the community quarantine and the enhanced community quarantine caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Later however, all other Toy Kingdom stores nationwide, along with their online stores in Lazada and Metromart, as well as customer service support, followed closure and also ceased operations due to the pandemic.\nToy Kingdom Amazing Card\nIt is a loyalty program in which members get to earn rewards points, big savings, and are entitled to exclusive privileges throughout the membership period.
