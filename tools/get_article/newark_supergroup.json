      "text": "# Newark Supergroup\n\nThe Newark Supergroup, also known as the Newark Group, is an assemblage of Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks which outcrop intermittently along the east coast of North America. They were deposited in a series of Triassic basins, the Eastern North American rift basins, approximately 220–190 million years ago. The basins are characterized as aborted rifts, with half-graben geometry, developing parallel to the main rift of the Atlantic Ocean which formed as North America began to separate from Africa. Exposures of the Newark Supergroup extend from South Carolina north to Nova Scotia. Related basins are also found underwater in the Bay of Fundy. The group is named for the city of Newark, New Jersey.\nCharacteristics\nThe Newark Supergroup consists largely of poorly sorted nonmarine sediments; typical rocks are breccia, conglomerate, arkose sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Most of the strata are red beds that feature ripple marks, mud cracks, and even rain drop prints; dinosaur footprints are common, though actual body fossils are very rare. Some of the strata are detailed to the level of varves, with indications of Milankovitch cycles. In preserved lake sediments, Semionotus fossils are especially common.\nThe Newark sediments are extremely thick (up to 6 kilometers); they were deposited in a series of half-grabens that were themselves faulted into block mountains.  The beds dip to the east, while the faults dip westward. The beds are intruded by numerous dikes and sills, indicative of considerable igneous activity; a superb example is the New Jersey Palisades sill.\nDepositional environment\nThe Newark Supergroup's lithologies and structure are the classic hallmarks of a rift valley; the fault-blocking illustrates the crustal extension forces in play during the breakup of Pangea during the late Triassic Period. The Appalachian Mountains had already been nearly eroded flat by the end of the period; the uplift and faulting that was the first part of the rifting provided new sources of sediment for the vast thicknesses deposited in the Newark Supergroup; the igneous intrusions are similarly diagnostic of a rift valley. Coarse sediments were deposited near the eastern mountain front, while progressively finer ones were deposited farther west.\nEvidence suggests the climate at the time was subtropical and rainy, though divided between wet and dry months. A few organic-rich deposits suggest patchy or intermittent swamps and lakes.\nAccumulation of Newark sediments within the rift basins continued from the late Triassic into the early Jurassic.\nin Manassas, Virginia]] in York County, Pennsylvania]]\nin York County, Pennsylvania]]\nin New Jersey]]\nin New Jersey]]\n, Nova Scotia]]\n, a basal crocodylomorph from the Pekin Formation of North Carolina]]\n, a tanystropheid reptile from the Cow Branch Formation on the Virginia-North Carolina border]]\nfootprints from the East Berlin Formation at Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut]]\nBasins and formations\nThe separate basins and sub-basins of the Newark Supergroup have historically been given their own geological formations by local paleontologists. However, a study by Weems, Tanner, and Lucas (2016) proposed that the formations of the Newark Supergroup should be defined on a regional scale due to their geological uniformity over eastern North America. From youngest to oldest, the regional formations proposed by this study are:\n*Longmeadow Sandstone of the Portland Group (Early Jurassic semi-arid fluvial deposits)\n* Mount Toby Conglomerate of the Portland Group (Early Jurassic semi-arid alluvial conglomerate)\n* Boonton Formation of the Portland Group (Early Jurassic lacustrine deposits)\n* Hampden Formation of the Meriden Group (Early Jurassic basalts)\n* East Berlin Formation of the Meriden Group (Early Jurassic semi-arid lacustrine and alluvial deposits)\n* Holyoke Formation of the Meriden Group (Early Jurassic basalts and rare sediments)\n* Shuttle Meadow Formation of the Meriden Group (latest Triassic-earliest Jurassic lacustrine and freshwater limestone deposits)\n* Talcott Formation of the Meriden Group (latest Triassic (Rhaetian) basalts and rare sediments)\n* Passaic Formation of the Chatham Group (Norian-Rhaetian? semi-arid fluvial and deltaic deposits)\n* Lockatong Formation of the Chatham Group (Norian?

A 1977 study of fossil pollen argued that the sediments actually range from the Ladinian to the Lower Jurassic. Under this hypothesis, the Supergroup was deposited over the course of 50 million years.\nSee also\n* Passaic Formation\n* Gettysburg Formation\n* New Oxford Formation\n* List of dinosaur-bearing rock formations\nReferences\n* Letourneau, P.
