      "text": "# Druware\n\nDruware, also known as DRU Holland cookware and Royal Dru, was a line of porcelain-enamel-coated cast-iron cookware made by the De Koninklijke Diepenbrock & Reigers of Ulft (DRU) company in Achterhoek, Netherlands.\nImports to the United States\nThe pots and pans were popular in the United States during the middle of the 20th century, after Robert Evans began importing the cookware from The Netherlands, with gross annual sales of $1.5 million in 1956, and nearly $2 million in 1957.\nIn 1960, DRU incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to manage distribution.\nPopularity\nThe most popular line of Druware came in pastel shades of Delft Blue, Tulip Yellow, and Key Largo Green, and was recognizable for the hand-painted tulip, windmill, and fleur-de-lis decorations on the sides and lids of each piece. A flame orange color, as well as \"Holiday White\" (white enamel, with the signature tulip design in blue) and an all-white color \"that resembles china\" were also produced.\nDespite Druware's popularity with home cooks, venerable chef James Beard was less impressed. \"I use the old lines of cast iron -- Griswold, Wagner -- not all this prettied stuff. I had a Druware pot simply split from the heat a day or two ago.\"\nCessation of production\nAfter natural gas became popular in the Netherlands in the 1960s, DRU ceased the production of cookware, and began producing fireplaces, wall heaters, and wood stoves.\nInfluence\nDruware was the design inspiration for Dutch Ovenware, a line of pottery produced by Cameron Clay Products, of Cameron, West Virginia.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nSee also\n* Le Creuset\n* Descoware\n* Cousances\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.drufire.com/int/about-dru-en/our-story Official Dru Website]\n* DRU on Wikipedia NL"
