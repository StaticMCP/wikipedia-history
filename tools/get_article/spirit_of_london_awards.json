The project was created by the Damilola Taylor Trust in 2009 as a way of addressing the imbalance young people are portrayed by the national media by creating a Community Oscars for young people to rival the MOBO Awards and the BAFTAs. SOLA is also a youth movement aimed at decreasing crime by young people, decreasing poverty and ensuring every young person reaches their potential. They do this by working in conjunction with the Greater London Authority, local government and Parliament.\nSupporters include David Cameron PM, Frank Warren, Leona Lewis, Brooke Kinsella, Noel Clarke, Diversity, Boris Johnson and Rio Ferdinand. It is supported by Barclays, The Sun, Team GB, Kiss 100, Working Links, PlayStation and many other organizations and companies.\nThe first Spirit of London Awards was held on 27 November 2009, at the Alexander Palace in London. The second awards took place 27 November 2010, at The O2 Arena IndigO2 in London. The 2011 awards took place at the Royal Albert Hall on 20 November 2011 and the 2012 awards took place on 10 December 2012 at The O2 Arena.\nBefore each awards night there is a reception at 10 Downing Street so the short-listed nominees can meet the prime minister of the United Kingdom. The prime ministers to have greeted and congratulated the nominees so far are Gordon Brown and David Cameron.\nDowning Street reception\nApproximately two weeks before the awards night the three nominees in each category, the sponsors of the event and performers on the night get a chance to meet each other at 10 Downing Street before the prime minister of the United Kingdom delivers a speech.\nSOLA School Roadshow\nPrevious nominees along with a celebrity ambassador go to secondary schools all over London to speak to the students about their experiences. There is also a Q&A at the end when students can ask questions.\nIn 2012 the roadshow went to over 20 schools in London.\nYouth manifesto\nIn 2012 using the collection of ideas from 140 young ambassadors of SOLA and other young people around London's most disadvantaged areas a youth manifesto was created which delivers ideas on how the government can effectively engage young people in the UK. It was written by 23-year-old Oliver Hypolite-Bishop who also wrote Siobhan Benita's manifesto for the 2012 London mayoral election.  It was presented to David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband on 29 November 2012.\nAward categories\nperforming for SOLA]]\nEach category has three nominees shortlisted.
