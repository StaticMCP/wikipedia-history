Originally known as Karratha–Tom Price Road, it acquired its new name in September 2020 after community consultation. Manuwarra means heaps' or 'masses in the Yindjibarndi language and is the indigenous name for the Red Dog Gorge in the Millstream Chichester National Park. Both the gorge and the highway acquired its English name from the eponymous Red Dog, a famous Kelpie/Cattle Dog and Pilbara mascot from the 1970s.\nHistory\nThe need for a more direct sealed road between the areas surrounding Karratha and Tom Price was identified in the 1990s. Before Stages one to three of Manuwarra Red Dog Highway were constructed, access from Karratha to Tom Price (on the public roads) was via the Roebourne–Wittenoom Road, the Nanutarra–Munjina Road and the Tom Price Spur Road. However, historical traffic data showed that most vehicles commuting between Karratha and Tom Price were using the more direct route along the Rio Tinto owned access road for the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway rather than the public roads. However, this route had a high accident rate, and requires a permit to be obtained from Rio Tinto to use the road.\nRoute description\nManuwarra Red Dog Highway roughly follows the route of the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway for its entire length (including the as-yet incomplete stage four). This is to avoid impacts to the nearby Millstream Chichester National Park and the catchment of the Harding Dam (an important source of drinking water), as well as several Aboriginal heritage sites.\nSouthern section\nFrom the Tom Price–Paraburdoo Road intersection (where it continues as Bingarn Road into the townsite), the road goes about  to the west where it passes under the Paraburdoo branch of the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway, and about  further along it then reaches the Mine Road intersection, which provides access to the Mount Tom Price mine and was previously part of the main access to the town. Here the road turns to the north. It crosses over the Mount Tom Price Mine branch of the Dampier to Paraburdoo Railway about  north of the Mine Road intersection.  further north, it meets an intersection providing access to the residential area in the north of Tom Price. The road passes the Tom Price landfill about  further north, where it turns to the north-west for about . It then begins to run alongside the railway, turns to the north and continues so for the next , where the southern portion of the road currently ends at Nanutarra–Munjina Road. Here drivers may continue north by travelling a short distance on the Nanutarra–Munjina Road, then (if they possess a permit) turning onto the Rio Tinto owned access road for the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway, or can continue on Nanutarra–Munjina Road to access Roebourne–Wittenoom Road.\nNorthern section\nThe constructed road continues just after the railway crossing where the Roebourne–Wittenoom Road crosses the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway. It meets the Railway access road at a T-junction shortly after the crossing. It then roughly follows the railway line for about . It continues west for  where it begins to turn to the north-west.  further along it meets the access road for the Millstream Chichester National Park, where it then starts to diverge from the railway line, as the railway turns to the north. It continues north-west for about  before turning to the north, and continues until it rejoins the railway about  to the north, near Camp Curlewis. The road then follows the railway, deviating only to avoid terrain constraints, for the next  to Karratha, where it ends at a T-junction with the North West Coastal Highway. Drivers can then use Madigan Road to access the town of Karratha.\nConstruction\nManuwarra Red Dog Highway is being constructed in four stages.\nStage One, Tom Price to Nanutarra–Munjina Road\nConstruction on Manuwarra Red Dog Highway (then known as Karratha–Tom Price Road) began in January 2003, with work beginning on the . Stage One, which followed the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway corridor from Tom Price north to Nanutarra-Munjina Road, with a budget of $18.7 million. Stage One was completed in December 2003, at a cost of $26 million, and reduced the travel distance by .\nStage Two, Karratha to Curlewis\nStage Two of Manuwarra Red Dog Highway was  long and followed the route of the Dampier to Paraburdoo Railway from the northern end of the road at the North West Coastal Highway, about  from Karratha, to a location known as Camp Curlewis, where it met the existing Roebourne–Wittenoom Road. Whilst the northern portion of the route is relatively flat, the southern section was much more challenging, and required significant earthworks. Stage Three had an estimated cost of $80 million. Construction of Stage two started in August 2006 and was completed in August 2008 at a cost of $150 million.\nStage Three, Curlewis to Wallyinya Pool\nStage Three of Manuwarra Red Dog Highway follows the existing, though unsealed, Roebourne–Wittenoom Road for , from Camp Curlewis to Wallyinya Pool, alongside the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway. This portion involved sealing and upgrading the existing road. During construction, traffic was diverted onto the adjacent access road for the Dampier to Paraburdoo railway.\nWhilst the terrain was less challenging than for Stage Two, the road had been used for carting asbestos from the mines near Wittenoom to the port. Bags of asbestos would often fall off the trucks on the way, resulting in the road becoming heavily contaminated. The danger posed by the asbestos was such that, in 2018, the Shire of Ashburton, which manages the road, ceased maintaining it on advice from WorkSafe. The contamination issue caused delays to this stage, but work eventually began in September 2019, and was completed in September 2020 at a cost of $81.5 million. At around the same time work was conducted on the section of Roebourne–Wittenoom Road between Wallyinya Pool and Nanutarra–Munjina Road (which was not to be sealed as part of Manuwarra Red Dog Highway), to repair and remediate that section of road, as it had not been maintained for many months, and was in urgent need of repair.\nStage Four, Wallyinya Pool to Nanutarra–Munjina Road\nAs of October 2021, Stage Four of Manuwarra Red Dog Highway is currently in the design phase, with work underway to identify a final alignment for the road. Construction is expected to start on this  section in early 2022. The estimated cost for Stage Four is around $229 million.\nSee also\n* List of highways in Western Australia\n* Major roads in the Pilbara region of Western Australia\n* List of road routes in Western Australia\nReferences\n|roads=\n}}"
