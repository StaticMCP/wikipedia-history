It is funded from the Operational Programme for Tourism.\nExhibitions\nUpon arrival the visitor crosses 'The Bridge of Democracy' outside the building. The exhibitions cover a number of themes: Pre-Revolutionary Europe, the spread of revolution, the Irish context, the United Irishmen, the chain of battles nationally in May and June 1798, the French political and military connection, Vinegar Hill, and the aftermath of the rebellion. The exhibitions include dioramas and interactive displays. The Centre closed for a period, reopening in 2013, to facilitate a refurbishment of displays.\nIt forms part of the 32 historical sites which form the Wexford Heritage Trail. The Centre is leading a three-year programme to investigate the battlefield on Vinegar Hill, to identify the extent of the battlefield, locations of fighting, temporary structures, weapons, other artefacts, and the location of possible mass graves.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discoverireland.ie/Arts-Culture-Heritage/the-national-1798-visitor-centre/45209 Discover Ireland]"
