It was originally serialized in Asahi Sonorama's Gekkan Manga Shōnen magazine, between January 1977 and May 1980. In 1978, it won the first Seiun Award for manga, and in 1980 also won the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen/shōjo manga (along with Takemiya's Kaze to Ki no Uta).\nIn 1980, it was adapted into an anime movie, produced by Toei Animation and directed by Hideo Onchi. In 2007, the manga was adapted into an anime television series, co-animated by Minamimachi Bugyōsho and Tokyo Kids, and produced by Aniplex, SKY Perfect Well Think, and Mainichi Broadcasting System. Directed by Osamu Yamazaki and featuring character designs by Nobuteru Yuki, it premiered in Japan on MBS-TBS's Saturday 6:00pm doroku time slot (previously occupied by other notable anime series such as Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Fullmetal Alchemist and Blood+) on April 7, 2007, and ended on September 22, 2007, replacing the canceled Bones series Tenpō Ibun Ayakashi Ayashi.\nPlot\nThe story takes place in the distant future sometime after the 31st millennium(at least 301st century) where humanity exists under the rule of the political order controlled by supercomputers known as Superior Dominance and the carefully selected humans known as the Members Elite. Centuries before the story begins, the human race came to the conclusion that war and pollution rendered life on Earth unsustainable. Using warp travel the decision was made to leave a supercomputer artificial general intelligence and caretaker humans behind and colonize distant stars.\nUnder the rule of Superior Dominance all humans are born in vitro and given to carefully selected parents. At the age of 14, all children are put through brainwashing where their memories are wiped by Superior Dominance and overwritten to produce functional adults. A race of advanced humans with psionic abilities called Mu (pronounced myuu, μ) has evolved, and the supercomputers that control Superior Dominance make every effort to exterminate them. Led by Soldier Blue and then Soldier Shin, the Mu make every effort to locate and rescue as many Mu children as possible before the children are discovered and eliminated. The Mu have only one wish, to return to what they see as their promised land, Terra.\nThe series spans a large number of years, jumping back and forth multiple times, from Soldier Shin's life on Ataraxia, the various events on Station E-1077, Soldier Shin's founding of a Mu colony on a habitable planet, Neska, the Superior Dominance war of extermination on the Mu, and finally to the Mu's return to Terra.\nMedia\nManga\nThe manga series, written and illustrated by Keiko Takemiya, was serialized by Asahi Sonorama in  between January 1977 and May 1980.

The final truth about the Mu genes is revealed: before the creation of SD system, scientists discovered the mutant Mu genes and arguments ensued as to whethere they were only a flick of mutation or the next phase of evolution. Unable to decide, the SD system was programmed to leave Mu genes intact in birth control process, only to carry out the extermination when the gene carrier reached adulthood; the purpose was to check whether they could survive the stress and became the next phase of evolution. As such, the Mu survived, confirming their superiority; the only problem being that the Grand Mother system has flawed programming and cannot accept the Mu. Keith broadcast this revelation for all humans to see, urging them to finally take over the decision and not relying on SD system any longer, while choosing to maintain the system for the sake of controlling human as a bet on human's future. Acknowledging Keith's decision, Grand Mother's programming moved to phase 4: eliminate Mu factor in birth progress, and order Keith to kill Jomy.

Keith calls his subordinates to also destroy the Meggido units along with the Mu. The Meggido units are destroyed with the help of General Murdock who rams into it with his ship and Terra is saved from obliteration. Humans across the galaxy are shown rebelling against the SD system, and Tony steps up as the next leader of the Mu to bring humans and Mu together. The final scene after the credits shows a reborn Earth, as both the humans and Mu had hoped it would become. Two boys who resemble younger versions of Jomy and Keith meet each other for the first time, only to shed tears upon seeing each other, and not knowing why.\n}}\n}}\nReception\nThe 2007 anime adaptation received mostly positive reviews from critics. Theron Martin of the Anime News Network gave the series several positive reviews concluding, \"Toward the Terra is not a top-rate series, but it tells a good enough and engrossing enough, and acceptable enough, story to be worth a look. It never much more than toys with the serious underlying issues it touches upon, and has definite flaws elsewhere, but through this span of episodes it is still less shallow than most typical series\".\nSee also\n* Slan, a 1946 novel with a similar premise and protagonist with the same first name\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://terra-e.com/ Official website of anime television series]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090207110703/http://terra.rightstuf.com/ Right Stuf/Nozomi's Official film website] via Internet Archive\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070430120248/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw3543.html Movie review] at scifi.com via Internet Archive\n}}"
