The statue was found in the territory of the Vestini, but depicts a man with a Picene helmet.\nIt was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of Capestrano, along with a female statue in civilian attire, called the Lady of Capestrano.\nDescription\nThe Warrior of Capestrano is made of limestone and stands at around  on a base made of lithic. Two pillars were used to laterally frame the statue. It depicts a man wearing a brassard and carrying weapons and armour. He is wearing a wide-brimmed parade helmet with a crest of feathers. Between the kardiophylax lay a long sword and a knife. He also wears a mitra, a short apron covering the back. It had a black plate with a broad hinged band. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic friezes decorated the handle of the sword. The statue has other weapons such as spears, javelins with throwing loops, and axes. Most of the clothing and equipment of the statue is Etruscan and Italic clothing. However, the statue is wearing sandals with blades instead of shoes. It is possible that these added garments were designed to make the statue seem larger and more powerful.\nAn epigraph names the statue as Nevio Pomp(uled)io. This possibly identifies him as an Italic king. Another possibility is that the individual it depicts was subject to a damnatio memoriae. Another inscription incised on the pillar to the right of the warrior reads in South Picene: \"Makupri koram opsút aninis rakinevíi pomp[úne]í\" (\"Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]\").\nThe statue has traces of pink paint.\nArchaeology\nIt was discovered in 1934 and led to a series of archaeological excavations in the area, resulting in other statues such as the Lady of Capestrano, two lithic bases, and 33 tombs being found.\nInvestigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an Iron Age cemetery.\nReferences\nSee also"
