The Portuguese forces, a captured schooner and three armed transports, had endured the Brazilian blockade of the port but only sought to break it on 21 October.\nDespite heavy fighting neither side lost a ship, and the Portuguese withdrew to the port, with the conflict ending a month later with the surrender of Montevideo.\nOrder of Battle\nBrazilian Navy (Captain of Sea and War Pedro Antônio Nunes)\n*Corvette Liberal (24) Flagship, Captain Lieutenant Antônio Salema Freire Garção\n*Brig Cacique (18) Captain Lieutenant Antônio Joaquim do Couto\n*Brig Guarani (16) First Lieutenant James Nicoll\n*Brig Real Pedro (14) Second Lieutenant Francisco da Silva Lobão\n*Schooner Leopoldina (12) First Lieutenant Francisco Bibiano de Castro\n*Schooner Seis de Fevereiro (1) First Lieutenant Francisco de Paula Osório\n*Schooner Cossaca (1) Second Lieutenant Jacinto Alves Branco Muniz Barreto\nPortuguese Navy (Captain Lieutenant José Maria de Sousa Tavares)\n*Corvette Conde dos Arcos (26) Flagship, Sousa Tavares accumulated the role of commander of the naval force at the same time.\n*Corvette Restauradora (16) Commander João Caetano de Bulhões Leotti\n*Brig Líguri (16) Commander Procópio Lourenço de Andrade\n*Schooner Maria Tereza (14) Commander Pedro Antônio da Silva\nReferences"
