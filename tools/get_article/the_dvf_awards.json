The DVF Awards were conceived by Diane von Furstenberg in 2010 with the goal of honoring women who have displayed leadership, strength, and courage in their commitment to their causes.\nEvery year, each Honoree receives a $100,000 grant from the Foundation to further their work. The inaugural DVF Awards were presented on March 13, 2010 at a ceremony hosted by Diane von Fürstenberg and Tina Brown at the United Nations on the closing night of The Women in the World Summit.\nEach year, two DVF Awards are given to women within The Vital Voices Global Partnership. In addition, the Inspiration Award is given to a woman who has demonstrated strength and courage in the face of adversity, and is using her experience and influence to effect positive change.\nThe People's Voice Award is also given annually to a woman chosen from a field of nominees selected by The DVF Awards Board of Advisors and voted on by the public at DVFAwards.com. The Lifetime Leadership Award honors an individual who has dedicated her life and body of work to instilling in other women the courage to fight, the power to survive and the leadership to inspire. Past recipients include U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Gloria Steinem, Ingrid Betancourt, Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey and Robin Roberts.\nPresenters at The DVF Awards have included Meryl Streep, Iman, Olivia Wilde, Jessica Alba, Deborah Winger, Gabby Douglas, and Chelsea Clinton.\n2025 Honorees\nThe following are the honorees for 2025:\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Hanin Ahmed\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Christy Turlington Burns\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Fany Kuiru Castro\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Kim Kardashian\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Giulia Minoli\n2024 Honorees\nThe following are the honorees for 2024:\n* The DVF Leadership Award: The Right Honourable Dame Jacinda Ardern\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Yael Admi\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Reem Al-Hajajreh\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Xiye Bastida\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Alessandra Kustermann\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Her Excellency Mrs. Graça Machel\n2023 Honorees\nThe following are the honorees for 2023:\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Amal Clooney\n* The DVF Leadership Award: Amina J.
