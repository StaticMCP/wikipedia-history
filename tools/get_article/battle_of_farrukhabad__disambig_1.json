The british forces first sighted Maratha cavalry on November 7, but the encounter went by without an engagement. The next day, leaving Colonel Burns in charge of a detachment at Meerut, Lake continued following the Maratha force.\nBattle\nThe battle took place at Farrukhabad in what is now Uttar Pradesh, India. The Company's forces, led by General Gerard Lake, surprised Holkar's forces after making forced marches of more than  in the preceding 24 hours.\nHolkar had ordered his force to camp through the night, and when he received news of his defeat at the Battle of Deeg, he retired to rest without informing his officers.\nIn the early hours of November 16, the Maratha force awoke to find themselves under bombardment from Lake's Horse Artillery. Following the cannonade, the dragoons led by the 8th Royal Irish charged into the maratha camp. Holkar himself narrowly avoided capture, fleeing from the field when the battle started.\nNotes\nReferences"
