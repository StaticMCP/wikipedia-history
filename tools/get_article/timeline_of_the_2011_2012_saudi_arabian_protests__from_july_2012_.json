The 2011–2012 Saudi Arabian protests are a series of ongoing protests taking place in Saudi Arabia, which began in January 2011, influenced by concurrent protests in the region.\nIn July 2012, Amnesty International protested in the United Nations Human Rights Council against legal persecution of Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) leaders. Protests calling for prisoners to be freed and protesting against the Saudi government occurred in Buraidah on 23 July and in front of the Ministry of Interior in Riyadh on 25 July, in Riyadh and Mecca on 28 July, in Ta'if, in Buraidah, near al-Ha'ir Prison and in Dammam in August.\nIn July and August 2012, protests in the Qatif region intensified after Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was wounded in the leg and arrested by police on 8 July. Three men were killed in a protest on the evening of the arrest. Funerals and protests took place on 10 July, 11 July and 13 July, including chants calling for the downfall of the House of Saud. Another protester was shot dead in the 13 July al-Awamiyah protest. While detained, al-Nimr was tortured, had bruises on his face and broken teeth, and started a hunger strike. Protest organisers in al-Awamiyah stated their support for al-Nimr and insisted on the use of nonviolent resistance. Protester Mohamed al-Shakhouri was shot in the back and neck and arrested in a 26–27 July protest calling for al-Nimr's release. Further protests called for all Shia and Sunni detainees to be freed, including al-Shakhouri. A protester and a soldier were fatally shot in Qatif during a 3–4 August evening human rights protest, leading to several more protests.\nJuly 2012\n1 July\nFollowing students' protests at King Khalid University in early March, the president of the university, Abdullah al-Rashid, was replaced by Abdulrahman al-Dawood on 1 July by King Abdullah.\n3 July\nOn 3 July, Amnesty International protested to the United Nations Human Rights Council against the court trial of Mohammad Fahad al-Qahtani and the arrest and sentencing of Mohammed al-Bejadi to four years' imprisonment, both prosecuted for their activities as leaders of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA). Amnesty International said that \"Saudi Arabian authorities are engaged in a campaign to cow Saudi Arabian human rights defenders into silence\" and that \"instead of repressing leading human rights defenders, the Saudi Arabian authorities should be investigating the human rights violations they have documented.\"\n8 July\nOn 8 July near Qatif, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was shot by police in the leg and was arrested for his political activities according to his brother and police. Thousands of people protested in response. Akbar al-Shakhouri, Mohamed al-Felfel and a third man were killed in the protest.

Activists said that al-Shakhouri and al-Felfel were killed by rooftop police snipers. The Ministry of Interior denied the claim.\n9 July\nPrincess Sara bint Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, niece of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, applied for political asylum in the United Kingdom on 9 July.\n10 July\nFrom a thousand to ten thousand people participated in Qatif city on 10 July in a funeral for Mohamed al-Felfel and a protest against the killings. A hundred people protested on Tarout Island. Security forces shot live bullets against protesters in the Qatif and Tarout Island protests. Participants chanted, \"Down with Muhammad bin Fahd\" and \"Down with the House of Saud\".\nMinistry of Interior spokesperson Mansour al-Turki stated, \"Some trouble-seekers took advantage of the gathering to hide in their midst and divert the context of this event which led the security forces to do their duty to keep the peace and ensure the safety of those participating in the funeral procession.\"\n11 July\nTen thousand people participated in a funeral for al-Shakhouri was held in al-Awamiyah on 11 July.

Abdallah Ja'far al-Ojami was killed by police bullets. Ministry of Interior spokesperson Mansour al-Turki described the police shooting as a response to a Molotov cocktail and gunfire attack on the police station.

Activists interviewed by Al Jazeera English stated that al-Ojami \"had been walking by the police station and had not participated in any attack\". According to Saudi scholar Ali al-Ahmed, al-Ojama was shot \"while walking in the street of [al-Awamiyah]; he was shot by a sniper, by [a] special forces sniper, about half a kilometre away from the police station. He was captured, he was brought to the station bleeding and they actually beat him up and let him die.\"\n14 July\nA protest calling for political prisoners to be freed occurred in Buraidah on 14 July.

Al-Shakhouri had bullet wounds in his back and neck according to the AFP witnesses. He was arrested and taken to a Dhahran military hospital. Ten others were also arrested.

They yelled slogans such as \"Sunnis or Shiites are all brothers... and this nation won't be given up\" and \"Not Sunnis not Shiites, but unified Muslims.\" These protesters also had banners and photos telling for certain detainees like Mohammad AlWad'ani and Khalid AlJuhani to be released.\n10 February\nThe Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) releases a statement denouncing:\nthe arrest of number of women during a protest to demand for the release of their relatives who were arrested since years\n:without trials or accusations...These demonstrations witnessed several violations as the security forces assaulted the female\n:demonstrators...[and] harass the passers who were taking pictures of these peaceful demonstration...The process of custody\n:witnessed several violations...[including] ban[ning] the children from the drinking water...attempt[ing to let]...the\n:investigation panel to investigate the women without the attendance of a lawyer.\nAs a result of this statement, ANHRI called for \"the immediate release of all the female detainees and respect of freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration.\" This same day, the Associated Press reported that over 100 people were protesting against detention of people without charge in the country, specifically rallying in the cities of Riyadh and Buraydah.\n13 February\nIn a blogpost, Conor Fortune, writing for Amnesty International has one female protester, Abeer al-Sayed, who was arrested in protesting against detention of their loved ones tell the story about her arrest and time in jail.\n25 February\nStarting on 25 February, there was a good amount of protest action in Buraydah related to the demand to free political prisoners. Mostly people participating in such action were women, protesting on a roadsides in a \"morning picket,\" in a grassy field likely near a government building, and other actions including a march down a street.\nThese protests also included young boys and girls holding signs as well in numerous places across the town. It was reported that at one point, there were over 100 people in front of Alhabeb hospital in Buraydah. A mix of feelings took place between the protesters, some burning a picture of the Minister of the Interior and stepping on it while another held up a sign to dismiss him. There's even a short video on YouTube asking a young girl who the daughter of the prisoner why she's there at the protest. In terms of police presence, at one point it was reported that Saudi Investigation Units were in plain clothing especially after Saudi military forces withdrew.\nThere was also a sit-in in the city itself which ended up being surrounded by security officers which some felt was unfair and unjust. People were there so long that they even became \"hungry, dehydrated & freezing.\" This could be because it was reported that police closed down all roads to the sit-in site. Specific numbers of this sit-in were confirmed by several tweets of Mohammed Jamjoom, CNN's international correspondent, who noted that 28 women were participating. Also in the first day no arrests were made. Later, as Twitter user, e3teqal_eng noted, Women & children spent the whole night at the site what was being called the \"Burayadh sit-in\" and they even held their ground. Some helpful others even gave them firewood for the night, so they could stay warm. This fire's embers could even be seen the next morning.\nThe next morning, people brought them breakfast including some sort of bread and covered food. Even with all the trouble the day before, women in the morning began to come and join the protest.\nReferences\n}}"
