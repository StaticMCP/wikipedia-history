The hotel was established in 1954. It described itself as \"Gibraltar's only budget hotel\".\nIt was located near the Alameda Botanical Gardens and Gibraltar’s cable car both less than 100 metres away.\nThe hotel had 62 rooms some with balcony and featured a restaurant with panoramic views across the bay. It offered a spacious bar and lounge area featuring wooden beamed ceilings and traditional brick archways.\nIt closed in June 2014 after being bought out by the Gibraltar Government to make way for the new Theatre Complex, which will include the Queen's Cinema.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140528044220/http://www.queenshotel.gi/ Official site (archived)]"
