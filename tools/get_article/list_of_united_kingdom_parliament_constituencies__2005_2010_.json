      "text": "# List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies (2005–2010)\n\nThis is a list of the 646 previous constituencies of the United Kingdom parliament.\nThere are 650 in the 2010 election constituencies currently represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, as at the 2005 general election. Each constituency is represented by a single Member of Parliament (MP).\nConstituency boundaries are subject to regular review by the four independent Boundary Commissions, usually once every 10 to 15 years, to keep the electorate of each constituency as close to the national average as is reasonably possible. New constituencies may be created, or existing ones abolished, by these reviews.\nConstituencies were long based on boroughs (burghs in Scotland) and counties. Today, constituencies in England are mostly subdivisions of local authorities, with each constituency comprising a number of whole wards. In Scotland, constituencies are subdivisions of council areas, and in Wales they are subdivisions of the preserved counties. Northern Ireland is reviewed as a whole, and constituency boundaries may cross all district borders.\nIn some cases, particularly in urban areas, two or more local government areas may be combined to form a single review area, so that particularly large or small constituencies are not created. For example, if two adjacent areas are entitled to 1.5 constituencies each, they may be combined and awarded three constituencies, rather than having two constituencies each, all of which would be well below the average constituency electorate.\nThe average constituency size is approximately 74,000 registered voters, but they vary in size from the smallest (Na h-Eileanan an Iar at 22,200 voters) to the largest (the Isle of Wight at approximately 110,000 voters). A constituency has no physical size restrictions.\nThe Parliament of 2001 contained representatives from 659 constituencies. Most of the current constituency boundaries were last reviewed in the early 1990s, and are therefore based on administrative boundaries prior to the last series of local government boundary changes. However, a Boundary Commission for Scotland review in February 2005 resulted in the reorganisation of most Scottish constituencies to adjust for the historic over-representation of Scotland. This reduced the number of constituencies in Scotland by 13, from 72 down to the current 59. The Parliament of 2005 therefore had 646 representatives. In the 2010 Election on 6 May 2010 the number of seats contested has increased from 646 to 650 as a result of boundary changes. Technically an absolute majority would require one party to win 326 seats, or else there would be a hung parliament.\n__NOTOC__\n{| id=\"toc\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Contents\n|-\n|1 England\n|-\n|1.1 East

those of Scottish local government council areas and to local government wards. Apart from a few minor adjustments, the council area boundaries dated from 1996 and the ward boundaries dated from 1999. Some council areas were grouped to form larger areas and, within these larger areas, some constituencies straddle council area boundaries.\nDumfries and Galloway, Scottish Borders\n* Dumfries and Galloway\n* Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale\n* Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk\nSouth Ayrshire, East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire\n* Central Ayrshire\n* Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock\n* Kilmarnock and Loudoun\n* North Ayrshire and Arran\nNorth Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire\n* East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow\n* Lanark and Hamilton East\n* Rutherglen and Hamilton West\n* Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill\n* Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East\n* Airdrie and Shotts\n* Motherwell and Wishaw\nEast Lothian, Midlothian\n* East Lothian\n* Midlothian\nCity of Edinburgh\n* Edinburgh East\n* Edinburgh North and Leith\n* Edinburgh South\n* Edinburgh South West\n* Edinburgh West\nWest Lothian, Falkirk\n* Linlithgow and East Falkirk\n* Livingston\n* Falkirk\nWest Dunbartonshire, East Dunbartonshire\n* West Dunbartonshire\n* East Dunbartonshire\nRenfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, Inverclyde\n* Paisley and Renfrewshire North\n* Paisley and Renfrewshire South\n* East Renfrewshire\n* Inverclyde\nGlasgow City\n* Glasgow Central\n* Glasgow East\n* Glasgow North\n* Glasgow North East\n* Glasgow North West\n* Glasgow South\n* Glasgow South West\nStirling, Clackmannanshire, Perth and Kinross\n* Ochil and South Perthshire\n* Perth and North Perthshire\n* Stirling\nFife\n* Glenrothes\n* Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath\n* Dunfermline and West Fife\n* North East Fife\nAngus, Dundee City\n* Dundee East\n* Dundee West\n* Angus\nAberdeenshire, Aberdeen City\n* Gordon\n* West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine\n* Banff and Buchan\n* Aberdeen North\n* Aberdeen South\nMoray, Argyll and Bute, Highland\n* Argyll and Bute\n* Moray\n* Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross\n* Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey\n* Ross, Skye and Lochaber\nOuter Hebrides, Orkney, Shetland\n* Na h-Eileanan an Iar\n* Orkney and Shetland\nWales\n* Aberavon\n* Aberconwy\n* Arfon\n* Alyn and Deeside\n* Blaenau Gwent\n* Brecon and Radnorshire\n* Bridgend\n* Caerphilly\n* Cardiff Central\n* Cardiff North\n* Cardiff South and Penarth\n* Cardiff West\n* Carmarthen East and Dinefwr\n* Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire\n* Ceredigion\n* Clwyd South\n* Clwyd West\n* Cynon Valley\n* Delyn\n* Dwyfor Meirionnydd\n* Gower\n* Islwyn\n* Llanelli\n* Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney\n* Monmouth\n* Montgomeryshire\n* Neath\n* Newport East\n* Newport West\n* Ogmore\n* Pontypridd\n* Preseli Pembrokeshire\n* Rhondda\n* Swansea East\n* Swansea West\n* Torfaen\n* Vale of Clwyd\n* Vale of Glamorgan\n* Wrexham\n* Ynys Môn (formerly Anglesey)\nSee also\n*For constituencies prior to 1997 List of former United Kingdom Parliament constituencies\n*For constituencies following the 2024 general election List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies (2024–present) by region\nExternal links\n*&nbsp;\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050310063237/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/STATBASE/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D8887.csv ONS List of Constituencies] (CSV file)\n*[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/ TheyWorkForYou.com]"
