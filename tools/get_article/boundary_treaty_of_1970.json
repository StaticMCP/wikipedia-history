The river channel was relocated to approximate conditions existing prior to the dispute that arose from changes in the course of the river in 1907. The International Boundary and Water Commission was charged with its implementation. The American-Mexican Treaty Act of October 25, 1972 authorized participation by the United States IBWC section. The project commenced in 1975 and completed in 1977.\nProvisions\nThe river was relocated in two reaches by the construction of a new  channel in one reach and  in the other. The relocated channel was aligned in the reach above Presidio-Ojinaga so as to transfer from north to the south side of the river  and in the second reach downstream from the two cities so as to transfer from the south to the north side a net area of . It is an earth channel with dimensions patterned after the natural channel. The United States acquired  of American agricultural land that was used for the transfer of lands to Mexico and for half of the river relocation.\nAlso, the channel of the Rio Grande in the Hidalgo–Reynosa area was relocated to transfer from Mexico to the United States  by constructing a new  flood control channel. This transfer was made in exchange for the transfer from the United States to Mexico of other land, including five parcels near Presidio, the Horcón Tract (after 1906 located south of the Rio Grande), and Beaver Island (La Isla de Morteritos), located in the river south of Roma, Texas, comprising  in total. This provision transferred to Mexico the portion of the town of Río Rico, Tamaulipas, located within the Horcón Tract.\nThe cost of the two relocations was shared equally by the two governments, with the United States performing the greater part of the work required in the Presidio-Ojinaga area, and Mexico performing the work required in the Hidalgo-Reynosa area and a small part of the work required in the Presidio-Ojinaga area.\nOn November 24, 2009, the U.S. ceded six islands in the Rio Grande to Mexico. At the same time, Mexico ceded three islands and two bancos to the U.S. This transfer, which had been pending for 20 years, was the first application of Article III of the 1970 Boundary Treaty.\nSee also\n* Rio Grande border disputes\n* United States territorial acquisitions\n* Mexico–United States border\nReferences\nSources\n*"
