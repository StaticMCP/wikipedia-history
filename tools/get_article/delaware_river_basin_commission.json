Kennedy, between four states (Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York). The headquarters building for the commission is adjacent to the New Jersey State Police headquarters in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.\nPurpose and activities\nThe purpose of the Commission is to bring the Delaware River under collective and balanced control, and to ensure fair usage by the states.  To this end, the Commission conducts programs related to water quality protection, water supply allocation and water conservation, regulatory review and permitting, watershed planning, drought management, flood mitigation and loss reduction, and recreational activities (such as fishing).\nThe DRBC was one of the first government agencies in the United States to address the problem of water pollution.  The agency predates the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1970) and the Clean Water Act (1972).\nMembership\nThe five members of the commission include the four state governors of the member states and the division engineer, North Atlantic Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who serves as the ex-officio U.S. member. As of 2021 the commission chair is Delaware Governor John Carney and the Federal Representative is Brigadier General Thomas J. Tickner.\nSee also\n* Partnership for the Delaware Estuary - Regional nonprofit organization\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nj.gov/drbc/ Official site]\n*[https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/delaware-river-basin-commission Delaware River Basin Commission] in the Federal Register\n*[https://archives.delaware.gov/collections/aghist/0901.shtml Brief history of the Commission from the Delaware State Archives]"
