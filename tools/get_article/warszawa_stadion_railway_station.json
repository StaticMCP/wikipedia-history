The station has two side platforms flanking the suburban tracks of the Warsaw Cross-City Line. The platforms are used by regional trains run by Koleje Mazowieckie and Szybka Kolej Miejska. The station building was designed by Arseniusz Romanowicz and Piotr Szymaniak and was opened between 1955 and 1958, to serve Stadion Dziesięciolecia. The station was renovated shortly before the UEFA Euro 2012 football championships. It is also close to the Stadion Narodowy metro station, which opened on 8 March 2015.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*Station article at [http://www.kolej.one.pl/index.php?dzial=stacje&id=3272&okno=start kolej.one.pl]"
