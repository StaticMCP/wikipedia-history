They were made on the basis of pictorial and literary evidence (pottery, sculpture, figurines, illuminated Byzantine manuscripts) using the same materials mentioned in the sources. Each instrument is accompanied by the pictorial evidence of its existence. In many cases it is also possible to hear the sounds they make.\nSome notable examples include the seven-stringed phorminx of the Minoan period, the double pipes with an air chamber (5th century BC). The bagpipes were played on the Greek islands, by the Greeks of the Black Sea, and in Thrace.\nApart from its exhibition space, the museum also has a music library, an electronic archive of scores, and a musicology research department.\nThe museum opened in 1997 and was housed in a restored three-storey building in the Ladadika district in the centre of Thessaloniki, until 2010.\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-90-Arxaiwv_Mousikvn_Organvn-405.jpg|Bagpipes (tsampouna) played on the Greek islands\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-90-Arxaiwv_Mousikvn_Organvn-406.jpg|Seven-stringed phorminx of the Minoan period\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-90-Arxaiwv_Mousikvn_Organvn-408.jpg|Double pipes with an air chamber\nSee also\n* List of music museums\nReferences"
