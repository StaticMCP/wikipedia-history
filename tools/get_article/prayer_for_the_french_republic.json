It centers on a Jewish family living in France as they struggle with their identity due to rising tensions from anti-Semitic attacks. The play won the 2022 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play.\nPlot\nIn 2016, an American student Molly decides to visit her family in France to find her roots and tries to connect with her distant cousin Marcelle. Marcelle's son is the victim of an anti-Semitic attack, causing Marcelle's husband Charles who immigrated from Algeria to decide to move to Israel. This earns the dismay of Marcelle's brother Patrick, as Marine Le Pen's rise in mainstream French politics continues. The play's second story explores how Marcelle and Patrick's great-grandparents suffered loss during the Holocaust in the 1940s.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n!Off-Broadway\n!Broadway\n|-\n!2022\n!2024\n|-\n!colspan='3' align=center|2016-2017\n|-\n!Marcelle Salomon Benhamou\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Betsy Aidem\n|-\n!Charles Benhamou\n| align=\"center\" |Jeff Seymour\n| align=\"center\" |Nael Nacer\n|-\n!Elodie Benhamou\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Francis Benhamou\n|-\n!Daniel Benhamou\n| align=\"center\" |Yair Ben-Dor\n| align=\"center\" |Aria Shahghasemi\n|-\n!Patrick Salomon\n| align=\"center\" |Richard Topol\n| align=\"center\" |Anthony Edwards\n|-\n!Molly\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Molly Ranson\n|-\n!Pierre Salomon\n| align=\"center\" |Pierre Epstein\n| align=\"center\" |Richard Masur\n|-\n!colspan='3' align=center|1944-1946\n|-\n!Irma Salomon\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Nancy Robinette\n|-\n!Adolphe Salomon\n| align=\"center\" |Kenneth Tigar\n| align=\"center\" |Daniel Oreskes\n|-\n!Lucien Salomon\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Ari Brand\n|-\n!Young Pierre Salomon\n| align=\"center\" |Peyton Lusk\n| align=\"center\" |Ethan Haberfield\n|}\nProduction history\nThe first production premiered at the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City on January 11, 2022, and extended for two weeks.
