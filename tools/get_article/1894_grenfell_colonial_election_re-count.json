The Elections and Qualifications Committee consisted of 9 members, 5  (Thomas Bavister, William McMillan, Philip Morton, Varney Parkes and Bernhard Wise) and four  (Paddy Crick, James Gormly, James Hayes, and Francis Wright).\nThe committee declared that George Greene () had not been elected the member for Grenfell, however no by-election was conducted. Instead the committee declared that Michael Loughnane () based on its own count of the result.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date !!

No by-election was conducted, instead the committee declared that Michael Loughnane () had been elected.\nAftermath\nThis was the 6th and final occasion on which the Elections and Qualifications Committee overturned the result of an election without ordering a fresh election. A public meeting at Grenfell expressed indignation at the unfairness of the decision. The meeting called for the abolition of the parliamentary Elections and Qualifications Committee and its replacement by a tribunal outside of parliament. The committee continued however until 1928 when the Court of Disputed Returns was established as a special jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\nMichael Loughnane only held the seat for 8 months, as he did not stand for the 1895 Grenfell election and George Greene regained the seat.\nSee also\n*Electoral results for the district of Grenfell\n*List of New South Wales state by-elections\nNotes\nReferences"
