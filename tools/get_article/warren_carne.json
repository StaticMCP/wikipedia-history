He graduated from the same class as the South African Boxer Sean Santana and Olympic 800 metre runner Hezekiél Sepeng.\nCycling career\nDuring his early years, he ventured into time trialing on the road as a junior before shifting his focus to mountain biking. A noteworthy achievement during this time was his 12th-place finish at the 2005 Zimbabwean National XC Championships, which took place in Harare. Carne was a member of the Zimbabwe squad that competed at the inaugural 2007 UCI African Mountain Bike Championships that were contested in Windhoek, Namibia. The championships also served as a qualifying event for the 2008 Summer Olympics and it was here that Carne's team mate Antipass Kwari created history by securing the country an entry for the Beijing edition of the games. Zimbabwe up until that point had never competed at the Olympics in the mountain bike discipline before.\n*Carne & Timothy Jones, who raced at the 2001 Giro d'Italia share the same grandfather.\nCareer highlights\n2005\n12th Zimbabwean National Mountain Bike Championships, Harare (ZIM)\n10th Gauteng & North Gauteng Interprovincial, Johannesburg (RSA)\n2007\nMember of the Zimbabwe cycling team that competed at the African Mountainbike Championship held in Windhoek (NAM)\nSee also\n* Zimbabwe Cycling Federation\n* Union Cycliste Internationale\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 2007 Zimbabwe National Mountain Bike Squad\n|-\n| Wayne Davidson, Warren Carne, Margie Gibson, Wonder Matenje, Trevor Volker, Antipas Kwari, Byron Munyoro, Lee Mc Nab, Prince Ngundu\n|}"
