This smaller third battle was significant in that it was the opening push that would lead to the Second Battle of the Somme and involved the Australian Corps. The attack opened the advance; the main thrust was launched by the Third Army along with support from the Fourth Army. The Second Battle of Bapaume, from 25 August to 3 September, was a continuation of this battle.\nThe attacks developed into an advance, which pushed the German 2nd Army back along a  front line. On 22 August, the 18th (Eastern) Division took Albert, with the British and Americans advancing on Arras. The following day, the Australian 1st Division, which was advancing north-east from Proyart, attacked German fortifications around Chuignes, and succeeded in capturing the town.\nOn 29 August, during the Second Battle of Bapaume, the town of Bapaume fell into New Zealand hands. This resulted in an advance by the Australian Corps, who crossed the Somme River on 31 August and broke the German lines during the Battle of Mont St. Quentin. The  (German armies on the Western Front) was pushed back to the Hindenburg Line, from which they had launched their spring offensive.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150412190731/http://spartacus-educational.com/FWWalbertP.JPG  Map of Allied Advance in World War I]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221526/http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-on-land/general-interest/58-advance-victory.html Hornby, M.
