Emerging from policies of dechristianization, they ranged from atheistic to deistic and sought to anchor republican citizenship in rational, civic, and patriotic principles rather than traditional religious doctrine. The most prominent were the atheistic Cult of Reason (Culte de la Raison); its successor designated by the National Convention, the deistic Cult of the Supreme Being (''Culte de l'Être suprême) associated with Maximilien Robespierre; the Directory’s semi-official Decadary Cult (Culte décadaire); and the later, more voluntary Theophilanthropy (Théophilanthropie). These movements attempted to inculcate civic virtue through secular morality, public festivals, symbolic art and architecture, and a revised calendar. None displaced established religious practice, and official support ended under Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as part of his reconciliation with the Catholic Church.\nDechristianization\nThe Revolution initially subordinated the Gallican Church to the state rather than rejecting religion outright. In 1789 the National Constituent Assembly nationalised church property, and in 1790 it enacted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, requiring clergy to swear loyalty to the nation and effectively become state employees. The division between \"juring\" and \"non-juring\" clergy deepened political and social tensions.\nAfter the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792, a more aggressive dechristianization campaign took shape, driven by radical Jacobins and sections of the sans-culottes. Churches were closed or repurposed, religious images were removed or destroyed, and priests faced persecution. Place names and street names were sometimes altered, devotional objects were seized, and public rituals were redesigned to valorise the Republic. The French Republican calendar replaced the Gregorian calendar system, removing Sundays and Christian feast days and introducing ten-day décades and decimal time, although the latter was short-lived. At the same time, some revolutionaries argued that civic virtue required a shared moral framework; drawing on writers such as Rousseau, they promoted new civic cults to supply it.\nCult of Reason (1793–1794)\n, 10 November 1793, when the former cathedral was designated a \"Temple of Reason\".]]\nAdvocated by figures including Jacques Hébert, Pierre Gaspard Chaumette, Joseph Fouché, and Antoine-François Momoro, the Cult of Reason (Culte de la Raison) promoted largely atheistic and anthropocentric views. It did not venerate a deity, and its guiding principle was devotion to Reason, associated with liberty, truth, and republican philosophy.\nTenets and practices\nThe Cult of Reason rejected belief in God. As Momoro wrote, \"Liberty, reason, truth are only abstract beings. They are not gods...\" Its ceremonies substituted secular rites for Christian worship and celebrated human achievement and enlightenment. Churches were converted into \"Temples of Reason\". The best-known ceremony occurred at Notre-Dame Cathedral on 10 November 1793 (20 Brumaire Year II), when the Christian altar was replaced with an altar to Liberty and a woman personifying the Goddess of Reason (in Paris, the actress Sophie Momoro) received public homage before deputies of the National Convention. Similar festivals elsewhere featured processions, hymns, tableaux vivants, and philosophical readings, and critics characterised some episodes as iconoclastic or theatrical.\nOrganization and symbolism\nMunicipal authorities often staged Reason festivals in former parish churches or in open squares adorned with liberty trees, civic altars, and busts of philosophers. Revolutionary iconography invoked Roman republican virtues and allegories of Liberty and Philosophy, practices that overlapped with the wider political festival culture of Year II.\nSuppression\nThe movement’s overt atheism and its association with the Hébertists and ultra-radicals provoked opposition. A deist who regarded religion as socially useful, Maximilien Robespierre denounced the Cult of Reason as politically destabilising. In late 1793 he attacked it at the Jacobin Club, portraying it as a discrediting embrace of atheism. Following the arrest and execution of Hébert, Momoro, Anacharsis Cloots, and allies in March 1794, the Cult of Reason rapidly declined.\nCult of the Supreme Being (1794)\nAs a response to the Cult of Reason, Robespierre advanced an alternative deistic civic religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being (). Drawing on the deism of Rousseau and Voltaire, the Convention established it on 7 May 1794 as the civic religion of France.\nReligious tenets\n(1758–1794), principal advocate of the Cult of the Supreme Being.]]\nUnlike the Cult of Reason, the Cult of the Supreme Being affirmed belief in a Supreme Being and the immortality of the soul. For Robespierre, reason was a means to instil republican virtue, and belief in divine justice supported social order. He echoed Voltaire in declaring, \"If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him\".\nIts core principles were set out in a Convention decree, the opening articles of which declared:\n1. The French People recognize the existence of the Supreme Being and the Immortality of the Soul. 2. They declare that the best service of the Supreme Being is the practice of man's duties. 3. They set among the most important of these duties the detestation of bad faith and tyranny, by punishing tyrants and traitors, by caring for the unfortunate, respecting the weak, defending the oppressed, doing unto others all the good one can, and not being unjust towards anyone.\nThe decree also instituted festivals dedicated both to the Supreme Being and to abstract republican values such as Truth, Justice, Modesty, Friendship, Frugality, and Courage. These measures drew on classical Greco-Roman ideals and were intended to foster civic-minded behaviour.\nFestival of the Supreme Being\n(1794). Robespierre stands atop the man-made mountain.]]\nThe inaugural Festival of the Supreme Being (''Fête de l'Être suprême) was held on 20 Prairial Year II (8 June 1794), chosen to coincide with Pentecost. While celebrations occurred across France, the principal Paris festival was designed by Jacques-Louis David. It featured a man-made mountain on the Champ de Mars and prominent participation by Robespierre, then President of the Convention, who delivered speeches and ignited an effigy representing Atheism so that an image of Wisdom would appear. The spectacle attracted attention and also intensified unease among some deputies, which contributed to Robespierre’s political isolation.\nOrganization, pedagogy, and criticism\nCommittees, clubs, and municipalities were expected to orchestrate local observances, school lessons, and catechisms that linked civic morality to belief in providence. Supporters presented the cult as a moral education compatible with reason and virtue. Critics portrayed it as theocratic or as a personal project of Robespierre, and some resented its top-down imposition during the Reign of Terror.\nDecline\nThe cult’s fortunes were tied to Robespierre. After his overthrow and execution on 28 July 1794 (10 Thermidor Year II), official support evaporated. Although never formally abolished, public observances ceased and the cult disappeared from political life.\nDecadary Cult (1798–1800)\nThe Decadary Cult (), or Tenth-day Cult, regularised civic worship around the ten-day décade of the French Republican calendar. In place of Sunday, citizens were to gather every  for fêtes décadaires and observe a cycle of annual festivals honouring republican themes (youth and old age, agriculture, the founding of the Republic, execution of Louis XVI, etc.). Its pedagogy joined patriotic music, speeches, oaths, prizes for industry and charity, and communal banquets to make republican virtue both sociable and visible.\nLegislation, practice, and overlap with Theophilanthropy\nWhile local décadi observances existed after the calendar’s adoption in 1793, the cult acquired a national, uniform structure only in Year VI. A series of laws of 17 Thermidor, 3 Fructidor, and 23 Fructidor (4 August, 20 August, and 9 September 1798), together with a circular from Interior Minister François de Neufchâteau on 20 Fructidor (6 September 1798), replaced Sunday with obligatory décadi festivals and listed annual civic commemorations. In many places Theophilanthropists helped animate the official programmes—reflecting the Directory’s favour, especially under Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux after the Coup of 18 Fructidor (1797)—but this overlap also produced rivalry with constitutional Catholics and with officials committed to a strictly civic décadi framework. After the Coup of 30 Prairial Year VII (June 1799) and de La Révellière’s resignation, authorities scaled back such patronage. A decree of 7 Thermidor Year VIII (26 July 1800) made attendance optional for citizens (while still expected of officials). Following the Concordat of 1801, participation dwindled; only two national festivals (14 July and 1 Vendémiaire) survived in attenuated form, and the Republican calendar itself was abolished in 1805.\nTheophilanthropy (1796–1801)\nDuring the Directory, Theophilanthropy (, “Friends of God and Man”) offered a deistic, moralising creed that its promoters hoped could stabilise society without restoring clerical power. From 1797, Director Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux encouraged the movement as a respectable civic religion—positioning it as a moderate alternative to both Catholicism and radical atheism—which helped transform a private initiative into a semi-official presence in Paris and some provincial towns.\nRelationship to the Decadary Cult\nTheophilanthropy remained a voluntary, semi-private religious society, whereas the Decadary Cult was the state-mandated civic framework that scheduled fêtes décadaires. In practice, Theophilanthropists often used décadi spaces, calendars, and ceremonies, sometimes animating official programmes; this overlap generated local rivalries but did not erase the distinction between the two.\nOrigins, doctrine, and rites\nThe society originated in the circle of Jean-Baptiste Chemin-Dupontès, who in 1796 published a Manuel des théophilanthropes. Valentin Haüy, noted for his work with the blind, was among its early organisers. Its deistic outlook emphasised belief in God, the immortality of the soul, and moral duties grounded in family and civic affection.\nWorship was intentionally spare: shared parish churches or rented rooms were adorned with flowers, fruit, and moral maxims; invocations to the “Father of Nature” framed examinations of conscience, readings, and hymns. Rites for births, marriages, and funerals translated domestic affection into civic virtue. Sympathisers included Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, and Jacques-Louis David.\nDecline\nFrom 1799 political support ebbed, especially after the resignation of Director La Révellière. Catholic and constitutional clergy attacked the movement as sectarian, while radicals derided it as naïve. After Napoleon’s 1801 Concordat with the Pope, police measures against Theophilanthropy followed, and in 1803 public practice was prohibited.\nLegacy\nAlthough the civic cults failed to displace Catholicism or establish themselves as lasting religions, they pioneered forms of secular civic ritual, symbolic politics, and republican pedagogy. Historians such as Mona Ozouf and Michel Vovelle view them as part of the Revolution’s broader attempt to \"transfer the sacred\" from church to polity. They also influenced later experiments in civic religion and secular ritual in France and beyond.\nSee also\n* Civil Constitution of the Clergy\n* Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution\n* French Republican Calendar\n* Religion in France\nReferences"
