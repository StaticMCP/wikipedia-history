The Award is presented by the Planning Institute of Australia, Australian Institute of Architects and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects.\nBackground\nEstablished in 2001, it is the successor of Prime Minister Paul Keating's Urban Design Task Force Award that began in 1996.\nThe Awards are convened by the Planning Institute of Australia with the support of the following organisations: Australian Institute of Architects, Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, Green Building Council of Australia, Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council, Consult Australia, Engineers Australia, Urban Design Forum Australia and Government Architects Network Australia (GANA).\nAward categories\nBuilt outcomes\nThis category recognises an outstanding work of city building that exemplifies an urban design project as a catalyst, improving what exists and anticipating and guiding what might come. Projects must be constructed and complete and able to demonstrate how they have improved place and resulted in broad public benefit. Awards are adjudicated in two scales:\n*City and Regional Scale\n*Local and Neighbourhood Scale\nStrategic design and policy\nThis category recognises an outstanding work of strategic design or urban policy that may transform the performance of an urban place and improve the quality of life of the community. Projects can range in scale and scope, but all should be strategic, innovative, deliverable, and able to demonstrate how they will improve the qualities of place and result in broader public benefits. Awards are adjudicated in two scales:\n*City and Regional Scale\n*Local and Neighbourhood Scale\nResearch and advocacy\nThis category recognises outstanding work in urban design research or advocacy that has broad application and will improve urban quality of life in Australia. The research or advocacy must be published and publicly available, impartial and evidence-based, whilst also advancing knowledge and practice.  Awards are adjudicated in two scales:\n*City and Regional Scale\n*Local and Neighbourhood Scale\nUrban design champions\nThis category added in 2025 recognises individuals who have had a significant impact on urban design, innovation and performance of our urban places, working to improve the quality of life of communities. Urban champions can come from a diverse range of sectors, including planning, architecture, landscape and urban design disciplines. They will have made an outstanding contribution to collaboration, knowledge, education, advocacy, project design and delivery. Possible candidates may be for example: political champion, community champion, journalist, public servant, urban activist, developer or urban practitioner.\nRecipients\n* 2025: Jeremy McLeod – Architect, Breathe and Nightingale Projects\n* 2025: Chris Thomas – Design Manager, City of Sydney\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Australian Urban Design Awards since 2001\n!
