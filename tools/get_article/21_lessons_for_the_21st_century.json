It is dedicated to the author's husband, Itzik.\nThe book consists of five parts, each containing four or five essays. The book focuses on present-day issues and societal questions.\nCritical response\nThe book had articles and reviews published by The New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times, The Guardian, New Statesman, and The Times.\nIn The New York Times, Bill Gates calls the book \"fascinating\" and his author \"such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking.\" For Gates, Harari \"has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.\"\nJohn Thornhill in Financial Times said that \"[although] 21 Lessons is lit up by flashes of intellectual adventure and literary verve, it is probably the least illuminating of the three books\" written by Harari, and that many of the observations in it feel recycled from the two others. Helen Lewis review in The Guardian is not as glowing but admires \"the ambition and breadth of his work, smashing together unexpected ideas into dazzling observations.\"\nThe book has also received negative reviews. Gavin Jacobson in the New Statesman sees it as \"a study thick with promise and thin in import\" with advice \"either too vague or too hollow to provide any meaningful guidance.\" In The Times, Gerard DeGroot writes: \"The author of Sapiens is good at identifying the crises to come but his syrupy platitudes are no answer.\"\nRussian translation\nA Russian translation of Harari's book was published in June 2019. However, the Russian media noticed that several passages about Russia and its President Putin were excluded from the translation. In particular, the chapter about post-truth begins in the Russian edition by referring to Donald Trump's speeches instead of Putin's false statements during the Russian annexation of Crimea. The representatives of Harari admitted that this change was authorized.\nLeonid Bershidsky in Moscow Times called it \"caution — or, to call it by its proper name, cowardice\", and Nettanel Slyomovics in Haaretz claimed that Harari \"is sacrificing those same liberal ideas that he presumes to represent\". In a response, Harari stated that he \"was warned that due to these few examples Russian censorship will not allow distribution of a Russian translation of the book\" and that he \"therefore faced a dilemma\", namely to \"replace these few examples with other examples, and publish the book in Russia,\" or \"change nothing, and publish nothing\", and that he \"preferred publishing, because Russia is a leading global power and it seemed important that the book's ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime – just without naming names.\"\nSee also\n* Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\n* Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\nReferences"
