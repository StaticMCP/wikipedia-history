Lineage of the Buchwalter family traces back to residents of one of the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland, from which republic the progenitors of the American branch came to this country in 1710, and established residence in Pennsylvania. Edward had two brothers, Morris Lyon Buchwalter and Captain Luther Morris Buchwalter, an officer with the Ohio Volunteers.\nEducation\nHe was educated at public schools in Hallsville and enrolled in Ohio University, at Athens, Ohio at the inception of the American Civil War, he did not long deny manifestation of his youthful patriotism and volunteered into the Western Army of Civil War.\nCivil War service\nOverview\nEdward Lyon Buchwalter, at the age of 21, left college early and voluntarily enlisted into Western Army or the Union Army of American Civil War on August 15, 1862 as a sergeant and he mustered into Co.

Vicksburg was the site of the Siege of Vicksburg (May 18 – July 4, 1863), an important battle in which the Union forces gained control of the entire Mississippi River. The battle consisted of a long siege, which was necessary because the town was on high ground, well fortified, and difficult to attack directly.  The capture of Vicksburg and the simultaneous defeat of General Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg marked the turning point in the Civil War.\nBuchwalter's executive ability and soldierly qualities led to his being commissioned first lieutenant in the 53rd United States Mississippi Colored Infantry Volunteers on July 25, 1863.

From Vicksburg, during the month of October 1864, he led union forces up and along White River, a tributary of the Mississippi River, to St. Charles, Arkansas. While on this journey they were many times under fire. In the spring of 1865 Captain Buchwalter returned to Vicksburg, whence he was sent to Jackson, Mississippi.\nOn March 8, 1866, he mustered out and received his honorable discharge, and after the lapse of years he has only gracious memories of his military career, with kindly feeling for those who fought for the South and for those who were soldiers of the Union. His continued interest in his old comrades in arms has been vitalized by his appreciative affiliation with the Grand Army of the Republic and the military order known as the Loyal Legion.\nHe was Commander of Ohio Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, also known by its acronym MOLLUS.\nHis sword\nUpon achieving the rank of Lieutenant, Mr. Buchwalter was presented a sword that carried throughout the war and inscribed on it:\n\"''Presented to Lieu.' Edward L. Buchwalter/3rd Miss. Colored Vols./by his Mother''\".\nThese swords were imported by military outfitters like Schuyler, Hartley & Graham of New York, who sold them to officers who were required to furnish their own artillery, uniforms and equipment.\nCapt. E.L. Buchwalter's sword was a non-regulation US officer’s sword known as the Peterson 75, due to its inclusion as figure 75 in Harold Peterson’s seminal work The American Sword 1775-1945. This class of swords is typically an iron-mounted officer’s sword and is invariably a sword imported from the Prussian cutlery center at Solingen with a maker's mark \"W. Walscheid\" (Wilhelm Walscheid) of Solingen, Prussia, who made a limited number of swords exclusively for export to the American market during the American Civil War and went out of business immediately after the war.\nHis sword was marked W. WALSHEID/SOLINGEN in two lines on side of the longer than standard ricasso, and had a small brass disk impressed on the other side of the ricasso that read in an arc \"PROVED\". The blade featured a panoply of arms with a spread-winged eagle, along with a banner reading E PLURIBUS UNUM and embellished with etched floral and patriotic banners and motifs such as a drum on one side of the blade. The other side featured a similar foliate banner, with a large U.S. in the center. The wooden grip was wrapped with sharkskin and secured with seven turns of gilded copper wire that has a twisted center strand and two single flanking strands. The pierced iron guard featured the usual spread winged eagle with E PLURIBUS UNUM above it and \"U S\" below.\nHis marital life and residence\nCapt. E.L. Buchwalter married Clementine Cordelia Berry (1843–1912) on Sept 1, 1868. In 1893, he purchased a home at 359 East High Street, Springfield, Ohio from the Charles Clark estate. Built in 1852 and situated just moments from downtown, it is one of the oldest homes in Springfield. Clementine Berry Buchwalter provided hospitality for decades of club parties originated by women from all over the United States. She opened her residence to the local women for gatherings. Out of this grew the foundation of the Ohio Federation of Women’s Clubs.\nIn 1908 the city renumbered East High Street and the Buchwalter home became 805 East High Street. Today the mansion is home of the [http://www.womanstownclub.com Woman’s Town Club] of Springfield, Ohio. Founded in 1922, the Woman’s Town Club provides a social center for women in the Springfield community and maintains and preserves this historic home.\nClementine Berry Buchwalter, his first wife.\nClementine Cordelia Berry M.L.A.(Master of Liberal Arts), the eldest of the family of seven of Rev. John A. Berry and his wife, Eleanora Evelyn Andrews, was born in Danville, Ohio, February 8, 1843; died in Dansville, N.Y., November 1912.\nShe graduated from the Ohio Wesleyan Female College, at Delaware, Ohio, the summer of 1862, a classmate of Mary Wood, now the celebrated Dr. Mary Wood-Allen.  From 1864-65, Berry taught in Public Schools in Columbus, Ohio and Granville Female College, in Granville, Ohio from 1865 to 1866. She taught Latin and French in the Illinois Female College, at Quincy, and the Indiana State Female College, at Indianapolis.  She was vice-president of the Board of Lady Managers of the St. Louis Exposition in 1904 (Louisiana Purchase Exposition), and President Francis telegraphed her husband she was the Mark Hanna of the Board. She was a charter member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, of which she was made honorary vice-president for life. She was vice-president of the Pioneers of the General Federation. She organized the Ohio Federation of Women's Clubs, of which she was made honorary president for life, and her name is in the Founders' Roll of the General Federation of Women's Clubs.\nThe summer of last year of her life and the 50th anniversary of her class, she attended the commencement at Delaware as guest of honor and delivered the diplomas to the class of 1912.  At the time of her death in 1912, the Ohio Federation decided at a memorial service held in Springfield to establish the Clementine Berry Buchwalter Fund, and at the next annual meeting at Chillicothe, Ohio, Capt. Edward L. Buchwalter was present and wrote the president that he would provide an endowment fund of $10,000 in memory of his wife, Clementine Berry Buchwalter, the annual net income to be used in such a way as the directors might desire. If the clubs decided to do this, for every $400 they raised he would give $100, up to the amount of $10,000, not including the $5,000 first given by him. The club women consulted him as to whether he preferred a scholarship or a fund to be used in the club work, but as no one knew better than he how much money was needed to carry on the Federation work, he advised an endowment fund like the one to her dearest friend, Sarah Piatt Decker. In October 1915, the sum had reached $10,000, $6,000 of which had been contributed by Captain Buchwalter.\nMarilla Andrews, his second wife\nIn March 1914, widower Capt. Edward Lyon Buchwalter wedded Miss Marilla Andrews. She was one of five siblings of John Cain Andrews and Sarah Wright (daughter of William Wright and Grace Hollows) and cousin to the late Clemenine Berry Buchwalter. Marilla grew up in Evansville, Wisconsin and attended the Evansville Seminary, graduating class in 1884. Then graduated from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin receiving a B.A. in English. Two years after she graduated, Marilla opened Evansville's first pre-school in the family home. It was called an \"infant school\". Marilla Andrews was best known as the first woman editor of a newspaper in Evansville, The Badger. Marilla went to college several years after she had graduated from the Evansville Seminary. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin in June 1892 and moved to live with her brother Byron Andrews in New York, where he had charge (business manager) of the offices of the National Tribune and American Farmer in that city. With his assistance, Marilla became a reporter for the National Tribune. Two years later, when she returned to her home in Evansville, she had al-ready made up her mind to publish her own newspaper. The offices were located in the \"Pioneer Block\", at what is now 8 South Madison Street. With the introduction of The Badger, Evansville had four weekly papers, including the Evansville Review, and ''Caleb Libby's The Enterprise and The Tribune.\nThe Badger'' was devoted to local and national news and carried a full page of Evansville advertising and news. Marilla was a load voice for women's rights. She also advocated a city form of government for Evansville, a public water works and sewer system. She wrote of the need for a public library with a reading room and reference department, supported by local taxes.\nLike her brother, Byron, she supported President William McKinley for President in 1896. \"The Republican party is mindful of the rights and interests of women. Protection of American industries includes equal opportunities, equal pay for equal work and protection to the home,\" she wrote in one of her editorials supporting the presidential candidate. It would be more than 20 years before her dream of the right to vote became a reality.\nHer support of local projects was not always in line with the views of the voters. When the local school became crowded in the late 1890s, she became a champion for neighborhood schools for the youngest children. Marilla taught sixth and seventh grade in the Evansville schools in the late 1890s and also served as grade school principal in 1897. This was accomplished while she also edited her newspaper and occasionally acting as City Clerk in the absence of the regular clerk.\nMarilla was very concerned about the education of Evansville's youth. To overcome the crowded conditions, she offered the suggestion in her news-paper that a school be placed on East Main Street and another on West Main Street, thus freeing up the available school class rooms for the inter-mediate and high school students. However, a proposal to build a new high school won the citizens favor.\nIn 1894, Marilla helped to form the Women's Literary Club. The first meeting was held at the Andrews' home in Evansville in  October 1894. Marilla was voted vice-president of the new organization.\nMarilla also became editor of a Wisconsin newspaper devoted to the right of women to vote called The Citizen. Marilla also helped to bring focus on Evansville by helping to bring statewide suffrage meetings to the city, including many nationally known speakers. As a business owner, Marilla joined other Evansville women in promoting industrial growth and civic projects.\nFollowing her sister, Eleanora's terms as post master, Marilla was appointed By President Grover Cleveland as post master of Evansville.\nHis career\nOverview\nCaptain Edward L.
