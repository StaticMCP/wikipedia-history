Roffman then became Lucasfilm's Vice President of Licensing in 1986.\nIn 1991, he convinced Lucas to publish the first in a series of Star Wars-spin-off novels. The book, Heir to the Empire by noted science fiction author Timothy Zahn stayed on The New York Times Best Seller list for nineteen weeks, paving the way for a highly successful re-launch of the franchise.\nIn 1999, Roffman was appointed President of Lucas Licensing, a subsidiary of Lucasfilm, which owns the licensing rights to the Star Wars and Indiana Jones film series.
