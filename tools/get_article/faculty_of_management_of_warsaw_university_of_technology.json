It has evolved with the changing conditions in Polish industry and society, adapting to educate managers and conducting research meeting international standards.\nIts facilities are located on the southern side of the Warsaw University of Technology campus on ul. Narbutta 85.\nHistory\nThe roots of the current Faculty of Management extend to 1922, when Karol Adamiecki established the Department of Work Organization Principles of Industrial Enterprises at the Warsaw University of Technology. Adamiecki, a pioneer in scientific management, laid the foundational principles for what would become a cornerstone of management education in Poland. It was also and also one of the first such department in the world.\nThe legacy of Adamiecki's department was continued with the establishment of the Department of Engineering and Economics in 1953, situated within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (now known as the Faculty of Production Engineering or the Faculty of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering). This integration underscored the interdisciplinary nature of management, combining technical expertise with economic principles. Further consolidation occurred in 1970 with the merger of the Engineering and Economic Department and the Department of Economics and Production Organization from the Faculty of Precision Mechanics (now the Faculty of Mechatronics). This fusion led to the creation of the Institute of Management Organization. The Institute underwent a renaming in 1985, becoming the Institute of Organization of Production Systems, reflecting an evolving focus on systemic approaches to production management.\nFinally, the independent Faculty of Management was formally established in 2008, drawing upon the substantial resources and expertise accumulated within this Institute (which was then part of the Faculty of Production Engineering). This marked a significant milestone, granting management studies a dedicated academic unit within the university structure.\nThroughout this extensive historical trajectory, the Faculty of Management has consistently served as a vital institution, dedicated to educating industrial and managerial leaders for the needs of Poland's economy, while continuously striving to meet and exceed international academic and professional standards.\nMission\nThe core mission of the Faculty of Management is multifaceted.\n* To educate highly skilled specialists in the management field, preparing them for the demands of the knowledge economy and information society at the highest level of excellence.\n* To strengthen the Faculty's position through rigorous scientific research.\n* To foster robust cooperation with the business environment within Poland and globally.\n* To consistently develop the competencies of its academic and administrative staff.\nResearch Focus\nThe Faculty's main scope of research is broad and interdisciplinary, encompassing critical areas of modern management.\n* Organizational Operations - In-depth study, evaluation, and improvement of the operations of diverse business organizations and public institutions, including advanced modeling and empirical management aspects.\n* Information Technology in Management - Research, development, and application of cutting-edge IT tools in management, with a particular focus on decision-facilitating systems and decision analysis, often incorporating artificial intelligence.\n* Economic and Social Process Modeling - Study and modeling of complex economic and social processes and phenomena, particularly in the context of optimizing management decisions through simulation and econometric modeling, and robust risk management strategies.\n* Organizational and Consumer Behavior - Comprehensive study of the conditions influencing organizational and consumer behavior across various management levels.\n* Logistics and Production Environments - Analysis and evaluation of logistics and production environments within companies and the broader economy, including the modeling of production processes with an emphasis on ergonomics, industrial safety, and environmental protection.\n* Innovation and Knowledge Management - Study and modeling of economic and social phenomena related to innovation management, knowledge and technology transfer, and the development of new products and companies.\nAccreditation\nThe Faculty of Management is accredited by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) for its Executive MBA program specifically holding the EPAS accreditation.\nDegrees and concentrations\n'''Bachelor's degree\n* Management (BA) – with a concentration in:\n: Production management\n: Technology transfer and innovation management\n: Quality management\n: Ergonomics and the work environment\n: Business management\n: Finance and risk management\n: Business informatics\n* Production Engineering and Management (engineer) – with a concentration in:\n: Production management\n: Information management systems\n: Technology transfer and innovation management\nMaster's degree''' (or a Master of Science)\n*Management (MA) – with a concentration in:\n: Enterprise in an integrated Europe\n: Production in international markets\n: Digital economy\nDepartments\n* Department of Innovation Management\n* Department of Production Management\n* Department of Business Informatics\n* Department of Finance and Enterprise Management\n* Department of Qualitative Research\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090917235209/http://eng.pw.edu.pl/Faculties/Faculty-of-Management Official website of the Department of Management]"
