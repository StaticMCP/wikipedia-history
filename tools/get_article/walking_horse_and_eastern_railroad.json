It operates over a branch line completed in 1853 by the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, a Louisville and Nashville Railroad predecessor. After the Seaboard System Railroad abandoned the line in May 1985, the Bedford Railroad Authority (of Bedford County) bought the line and designated the WHOE to operate it. In 2019, Walking Horse Railroad, LLC (owned by Ironhorse Resources, Inc.) acquired the operating rights of this branch line. [https://ironhorseresources.com/rail-lines/whrr/]\nReferences"
