The 1964 constitution after the merger of Tanganyika and Zanzibar has had 6 presidents with each serving multiple terms except Samia Suluhu Hassan. Julius Nyerere served 5 terms total from 1962–1985, having served 4 terms under the 1964 constitution. All presidents of Tanzania have been from the Tanganyika African National Union party which later merged to become the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party.\nLatest election\nSee also\n* Politics of Tanzania\n* List of governors of Tanganyika\n* List of heads of state of Tanzania\n* Vice-President of Tanzania\n* Prime Minister of Tanzania\n** List of prime ministers of Tanzania\n* List of sultans of Zanzibar\n* President of Zanzibar\n* Vice President of Zanzibar\n* List of heads of government of Zanzibar\nReferences"
