Eventually, the Perrin Field Historical Society was founded. Beginning in 2000, an exhibit was placed on display in the Silver Wings Building and the lobby of the airport terminal building.\nA  building was dedicated on 14 February 2004 and expanded by roughly another  in March 2005. The museum acquired a T-37 one month later and an F-86L in 2007.\nThe museum was forced to move to another site on the airport in 2010, after its existing location was slated for a different use as part of the airport master plan. The new  building opened to the public on 2 October 2010.\nThe museum opened a new extension, the Bill and Peggy Byers Hangar, on 15 May 2021.\nCollection\nAircraft\n* Cessna T-37B Tweet\n* North American F-86L Sabre\nEngines\n* General Electric J47\n* Klimov VK-1A\nEvents\nThe museum holds a periodical Perrin Air Force Base Reunion.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
