Their mandates expired after deputies elected in regular elections assumed their mandates at the first plenary meeting.\nFrom spring 2003 to 1 May 2004, they had observer status, i.e. they could only speak in committees and could not vote (however, they received information about the proceedings of the European Parliament). From 1 May 2004, they became full members of the European Parliament .\nObservers\nThis is a list of the delegates of the European Parliament from the Czech Republic in the period from 1 May 2004 to 19 July 2004.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
