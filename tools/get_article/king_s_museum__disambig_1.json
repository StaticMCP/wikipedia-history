The collections were originally established in King's College in 1727. They were later housed at the Marischal College building. Following the closure of the Marischal Museum within Marischal College in July 2008, a dedicated public museum opened at No. 17 High Street in April 2011, although the collections themselves remained at Marischal College. The public museum was relocated to the Old Town House in the High Street in 2013. The museum hosted a number of temporary exhibitions featuring a rotation of items taken from the collection at Marischal College.\nThe King's Museum closed in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, initially to support the public health response to the pandemic in the city of Aberdeen. As of December 2023, no plans had been announced to reopen. The main collection at Marischal College continues to be used for teaching and research, both within the University of Aberdeen community, and by visiting academic researchers, but it is not open to the public.\nSchools Service\nThe museum ran a schools service for primary school classes in the Aberdeen City council area and Aberdeenshire. Workshops were offered on a variety of topics, and all workshops linked in with the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence.\nEvents\nThe museum ran an evening lecture series on Tuesdays throughout the university term time, and also participated in national and international events, such as the annual \"Night at the Museums\" event, part of the ICOM European Night of Museums and Museums Galleries Scotland's Festival of Museums.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/kings-museum/ King's Museum] - official site"
