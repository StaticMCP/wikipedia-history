If two or more members have the same length of current uninterrupted service, then whoever was sworn in earliest, as listed in Hansard, is named as Father of the House.\nThe only formal duty of the father of the House is to preside over the election of the speaker of the House of Commons. However, the relevant Standing Order does not refer to this member by the title of \"Father of the House\", but instead to the longest-serving member of the House present who is not a minister of the Crown. Until 1971, the clerk of the House of Commons presided over the election of the Speaker. As the clerk is never a member, and therefore is not permitted to speak, he would silently stand and point at the Member who was to speak. However, this procedure broke down at the election of a new Speaker in 1971 and was changed upon the recommendation of a select committee.\nSince the 2024 general election, Sir Edward Leigh has been Father of the House, having been an MP continuously for Gainsborough (previously Gainsborough and Horncastle) since 1983. While other MPs (namely Jeremy Corbyn and Roger Gale) have also served continuously since 1983, Leigh was sworn in first.\nThe previous Father was Sir Peter Bottomley, who was an MP continuously from 1975 until he lost his seat to Labour's Beccy Cooper in the 2024 general election. Bottomley was the first Father to be unseated rather than retire or die in office.\nHistory\npresiding over the chamber in 2019]]\nHistorically, the father of the House was not a clearly defined term, and it is not clear by what process it was used for individual Members. The first recorded usage of the term dates to 1788, in an obituary of Thomas Noel; it is also attested in an engraved portrait of Whitshed Keene by Charles Picart, from 1816. It may have been interpreted at various times as the oldest member, the member with the longest total service, the member with the longest unbroken service (the modern definition), or the member who entered the House longest ago. There is also some evidence that in the late 19th century, the position may have been elected. The modern definition was not settled upon until the late 1890s.\nAfter the Second World War, a convention arose that the father would normally be a member of the Select Committee on Privileges, but this lapsed following the establishment of the modern Standards and Privileges Committee in the 1990s.\nAmong the twentieth-century fathers, there were several very prominent figures; four former Prime Ministers became Father of the House, and a fifth, Henry Campbell-Bannerman was simultaneously Father of the House and Prime Minister from May 1907 until soon before his death during April 1908. Almost all have been Privy Councillors.\nThere has been criticism of the term Father of the House being used instead of Elder of the House as a relic of the \"legacy of women’s historic under-representation in the House\" and the way in which gendered language affected representation.\nTo date, all holders of the position have been men. In 2015 Harriet Harman described herself as the 'Mother of the House' as she was the longest continuously serving woman MP. David Cameron referred to her as the Mother the week after, and Theresa May referred to Harriet Harman as the Mother of the House in 2017. Harman had in fact been the longest serving female MP since at least 2010. Following the 2024 general election and Harman's retirement, Diane Abbott became Mother of the House. During speeches at the re-opening of Parliament after the 2024 general election, Diane Abbott was described as the \"Mother of the House\" by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and then Leader of the Opposition Rishi Sunak.\nList of Fathers of the House since 1899\nThis list covers all Fathers of the House since W.W. Beach, the first to become Father after the modern approach (longest period of continuous service) was agreed in 1898. Those who died as Father are indicated by a †. Those who were unseated are indicated by a U.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Entered Parliament\n!width=100pt|Father (Standing Order No 1)\n!Left House\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Constituency\n|-\n|William Wither Bramston Beach||1857||1899||1901†\n| || |Andover }}\n|-\n|Michael Hicks Beach||1864||1901||1906\n| || |Bristol West }}\n|-\n|George Finch||1867||1906||1907†\n| ||Rutland\n|-\n|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman||1868||1907||1908†\n| ||Stirling Burghs\n|-\n|Sir John Kennaway||1870||1908||1910\n| || |Honiton }}\n|-\n|Thomas Burt||1874||1910||1918\n| ||Morpeth\n|-\n|T.

The House of Lords Act 1999 repealed the automatic right of hereditary peers to be members of the House of Lords; Trefgarne was one of those elected to continue sitting in parliament under Section 2 of the Act.\n, the longest-serving Life Peer is the Baroness Cox (Crossbencher), who is also the longest-serving female member of the House of Lords; she first took her seat on 2 March 1983.\nThe below table lists the longest continuously-serving members of the House of Lords since the Acts of Union 1707, in the order they achieved that status. Prior to 1707, all members of the Lords were members of the parliament of England.\nUntil 1898, the longest continuously-serving member of the Lords, as with his counterpart in the Commons, was not necessarily considered the senior-most member of that chamber.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible sticky-table-row1 sticky-table-col2 sort-under-center\" style=\"margin:0.5em; font-size:95%\";\n! width=150pt|Peer\n!
