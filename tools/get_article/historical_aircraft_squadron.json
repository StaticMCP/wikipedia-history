The following year, the organization considered building a museum with the promise that they might receive an airplane from Dave Tallichet. This came to pass in May 1998 when it was lent a Douglas A-26 Invader from his Military Aircraft Restoration Corporation. Eventually, it was joined by another A-26 and a North American B-25 Mitchell that were also placed on loan to the museum. The restoration of the first A-26 was completed in September 2009\nand two years later left the museum for the 1941 Historical Aircraft Group Museum.\nIn the meantime, the organization built a new hangar at the airport in 2000, which it signed a 10-year lease for the next year. A Grumman S2F-1 Tracker was based with the squadron for a time in 2002. A plan for a church to build a new hangar at the airport in 2006 caused the museum to express concerns that it might lose some of its ramp space.\nCollection\nAircraft\n* American Eaglet RF-1\n* Beechcraft C-45B Expeditor\n* Bensen gyrocopter\n* Culver Cadet LCA – on loan\n* Folland Gnat\n* Hiller H-23B Raven\n* Rutan Long-EZ\n* Stinson L-5E Sentinel\n* Stinson 10\n* Taylorcraft BC-12D\nGround vehicles\n* Kaiser Jeep M725\nEvents\nThe organization held an annual Wings of Victory Airshow until 2009.
