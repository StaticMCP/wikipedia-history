It occurred during the Chickamauga Campaign as Union mounted forces under Colonel John T. Wilder clashed with Confederate cavalry commanded by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest.\nBackground\nIn early September 1863, Union Major General William S. Rosecrans’s Army of the Cumberland advanced through northern Georgia, attempting to cut off Braxton Bragg’s Confederate army retreating from Chattanooga. Confederate cavalry under Nathan Bedford Forrest screened Bragg’s movements and engaged Union probes approaching from the north.\nBattle\nOn 10 September, Wilder’s “Lightning Brigade,” a mounted infantry unit armed with Spencer repeating rifles, moved toward Lafayette to test Confederate strength. Forrest’s cavalry intercepted the Union column and launched a series of mounted attacks. After a brief but intense firefight, Wilder withdrew toward Rock Spring, Georgia, realizing he faced superior numbers.\nAlthough the engagement was small in scale, Forrest’s defense at Lafayette delayed Union forces long enough to allow Bragg to concentrate near Chickamauga Creek, setting the stage for the major Battle of Chickamauga one week later.\nAftermath\nThe Confederate victory at Lafayette helped conceal Bragg’s main position from Rosecrans’s army. The engagement demonstrated Wilder’s aggressive use of repeaters, which would again be notable at Chickamauga. Forrest’s conduct also foreshadowed his growing role as an independent commander in the Western Theater.\nLegacy\nAlthough overshadowed by Chickamauga, the skirmish at Lafayette was part of the critical maneuvering that determined the outcome of the campaign. The site today lies near present-day Walker County, Georgia, marked by local heritage signs and preserved rural landscape.\nSee also\n* Chickamauga Campaign\n* Nathan Bedford Forrest\n* John T.
