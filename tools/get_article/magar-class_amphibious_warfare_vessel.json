Only two ships of the class were designed and built by Hindustan Shipyard Limited, with fitting completed at Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers. The ships also carry four landing craft vehicle personnel (LCVP) on board, which can be used for the landing of troops.\nHistory\nThe design of the class is based on the  ships formerly operated by the Royal Navy. They can operate two medium-lift helicopters, which are primarily meant for inserting small teams of special forces (e.g. MARCOS). To discharge a ship's cargo and most of the troops, it needs to be beached, so that it can utilize its bow-door, similar to an LST.\nThe ships are stationed at the naval base in Visakhapatnam on India's east coast.\nShips\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\tName || Pennant Number\t||\tCommissioned||Decommissioned|| Status\n|-\n!colspan='6'|\n|-\n|\n| L20\n| 18 July 1987\n| 6 May 2023\n| Decommissioned\n|-\n|\n|L23\n| 14 February 1997\n|\n| Active\n|}\nGallery\njoins Southern Naval Command.\n|File:INS Gharial demonstrating unloading of relief material through its bow door onto the ramp.jpg\n| demonstrating unloading of relief material through its bow door onto the ramp.\n|File:Decommissioninng video of INS Magar (L20).ogg\n|Decommissioninng video of\n}}\nSee also\n*List of active Indian Navy ships\nReferences"
