Everything from antique flintlock firearms to early examples of machine guns and sniper rifles saw use to one extent or the other.  However, the most common weapon to be used by Northern and Southern soldiers was the rifled musket.  Born from the development of the percussion cap and the Minié ball, rifled muskets had much greater range than smoothbore muskets while being easier to load than previous rifles.\nMost firearms were muzzleloaders which were armed by pouring the gunpowder and bullet down the muzzle.  While they only fired once before needing to be reloaded, a trained soldier could achieve a rate of fire of three rounds per minute.  Newer breechloaders were easier and quicker to reload, but perhaps the most revolutionary development were repeating firearms, which could fire multiple times before reloading.  However, for a number of reasons, repeating firearms did not see widespread use.\nThe diversity of long guns in the war led to a classification system which categorized them by their quality and effectiveness.  There were \"first class\" weapons like Springfield rifles, \"second class\" weapons like the older M1841 Mississippi rifle, and \"third class\" weapons like the Springfield Model 1842 musket.  Efforts were made to ensure that troops had the best possible firearms available, including rearming with captured enemy weapons after a battle.\nPersonal weapons\nEdged weapons\nThe most common edged weapon carried by both sides was the bayonet given to infantry soldiers.  Beyond its use as a weapon, the bayonet had utilitarian purposes, such as a makeshift entrenching tool and even a spit.  Infantry sergeants and officers were also equipped with a sword. Sabers were the traditional weapon of the cavalry, although Union cavalry tended to place greater emphasis on their use in combat over the Confederates.  Another traditional cavalry weapon, the lance, was very rare: the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment was one of the only units to carry them, and they eventually discarded their lances in May 1863.\nOne weapon which saw an unexpected revival during the Civil War was the pike.  The Confederacy in particular suffered from a shortage of modern weapons, and by 1862 prominent military leaders like Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson advocated the manufacture and distribution of pikes as a stopgap measure.  Joseph E. Brown, governor of Georgia, was the strongest proponent of pikes and procured thousands of them for local state militia.  Such weapons were primarily given to home guard units until they could be rearmed with guns.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Model\n!

The most popular revolvers were those produced by Colt, with over 146,000 purchased by the US government. The bullet and gunpowder could be packaged together as a paper cartridges or loaded separately into each chamber.  Some models also came with a shoulder stock.\nRevolvers were the standard sidearm of infantry officers; many soldiers also brought with them handguns when they first volunteered, but these were often discarded.  Nearly all cavalry soldiers carried at least one handgun but more frequently two.  John Mosby's rangers were famous for carrying four revolvers, with the additional pair held in saddle holsters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Model\n!

While accuracy was comparable, their range was lower on account of their shorter barrels and lighter gunpower loads.  Early models had been muzzleloaders, but because of the difficulty reloading them on horseback, the majority during the war were breechloaders employing linen cartridges.  The largest number of these was the Sharps carbine, which was also available as a rifle.\nAs the war progressed, increasing numbers of Federal cavalrymen were armed with repeating carbines.  The most widespread of these was the Spencer carbine, which was adopted as the Union cavalry's official carbine in 1864. However, since the South was incapable of producing the metallic cartridges necessary for their function, Confederate troopers were severely limited in their use of repeating firearms.  As late as 1863, the British officer Arthur Lyon Fremantle observed Confederate cavalry in Texas armed with a wide variety of weapons: rifles, shotguns, carbines and revolvers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Model\n!

Rifled muskets had a significantly longer range than the older smoothbore types, but their accuracy at these distances was limited: gunpowder created billowing clouds of obscuring smoke and the bullet's high trajectory required accurately estimating the distance to the target, a difficult proposition for an untrained shooter.\nSome soldiers preferred to stick with smoothbore muskets as it allowed them to fire buck and ball shots.  The combination of a bullet with several buckshot was devastating at short distance, but rifled firearms could not use them as they damaged the spiral groves.  Thus, even as rifled muskets became more available, some regiments kept their smoothbores; the 12th New Jersey for example carried theirs for the duration of the war.\nAlthough breechloading and repeating rifles were available as early as 1861, few were issued for reasons such as cost, technical complexity, and institutional resistance.  This did not stop some individuals from purchasing these weapons themselves.  One of the most famous examples of this was the Lightning Brigade, whose wealthy commander, Colonel John T. Wilder, purchased Spencer repeating rifles for the entire formation.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Model\n!

One of the most common were Ketchum grenades, of which the Union government purchased 90,000 in total. Others included the Adams grenade and the Haynes \"Excelsior\" percussion grenade.  Many artillery shells were also converted into makeshift grenades and either thrown or rolled down onto the enemy.\nLand mines and sea mines\nThe American Civil War saw the use of land mines, sea mines, booby traps and improvised explosive devices, which were collectively referred to as \"torpedoes.\"  These weapons were primarily used by the Confederates, who established a Torpedo Bureau to oversee their production.  Gabriel J. Rains, who ran the Torpedo Bureau, pioneered the use of explosive devices on land, while Matthew Fontaine Maury was responsible for developing the first sea mines.\nAlthough these explosive devices were effective, they were considered by officers on both sides to be cowardly, uncivilized weapons.  Confederate general James Longstreet banned their used under his command, while Union general William T. Sherman hated them so much he reportedly ordered Confederate prisoners of war to march ahead of his troops to trigger any hidden explosives.\nMachine Guns\nThere were machine guns available during the Civil War but their impact was minimal as very few were fielded by either side.  One reason for this was opposition to their adoption by the military establishment, but also important were drawbacks in these early weapons' design.  The use of black powder meant obscuring smoke quickly formed after just a few firings.  The weapons themselves were too heavy to be carried except on a carriage, which limited where they could move.  Their ammunition also was heavier, making it more difficult to carry enough rounds for adequate use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Model\n! Notes for the subject\n|-\n|Agar machine gun || Nicknamed the \"Coffee Mill\" by Abraham Lincoln, the Agar fired a .58 caliber round from a single barrel.  The rate of fire was kept at 120 rounds per minute to avoid overheating the barrel.\n|-\n|Billinghurst Requa Battery || A volley gun which had eight banks of cartridge chambers that were rotated into alignment behind the row of 25 barrels.  A crew of three could fire seven volleys a minute, but its powder train was exposed to the elements.\n|-\n|Confederate revolving cannon || This breechloading cannon had a 2-inch bore and fired five rounds thanks to a revolving cylinder. At least one was used by the Confederates at the Siege of Petersburg and later captured by the Union.\n|-\n|Claxton machine gun || A double-barrel weapon invented by F.S. Claxton, son of naval officer Alexander Claxton.  The Claxton was never adopted as it was considered too frail in construction.\n|-\n|Gatling gun || Arguably the most successful Civil War machine gun, the Gatling gun could sustain 150 rounds a minute thanks to its rotating barrel design.  Although Chief of Ordnance James Wolfe Ripley was against its adoption, that did not stop individual generals like Benjamin Butler from purchasing them for their own use.  Several were also used by the New York Times to defend their office during the New York City draft riots.\n|-\n|Gorgas machine gun || Invented by Josiah Gorgas, the Confederate Chief of Ordnance, this weapon also used a revolving cylinder to fire 18 rounds of 1.25-inch ammunition.  Although it tested well it was not put into production before the war ended.\n|-\n|Vandenburgh volley gun || Invented by General Origen Vandenburgh, this volley gun was originally intended for service with the Union but they were rejected after testing.  Vandenburgh later sold them to the Confederates, with at least one taking part in the Siege of Petersburg.\n|-\n|Williams gun || This Confederate \"secret weapon\" could fire 65 rounds per minute and was considered very reliable.  The only exception was that its breach would expand after repeated firing and so cause the lock to not secure properly.\n|}\nArtillery\n]]\nArtillery during the Civil War was classified based on a variety of factors, such as weight, caliber, and mobility.  The common types of artillery pieces were guns, which fired at long ranges along a flat trajectory; howitzers which were lighter and shorter, and fired a larger round with a light charge; and mortars which were very short and heavy, and fired a large projectile on a higher trajectory.  A recent development was the gun-howitzer which combined aspects of a gun and howitzer into one weapon.\nBoth smoothbore and rifled artillery pieces found widespread use during the war.  Rifled guns had the distinct advantages of greater range and superior accuracy, while smoothbore pieces were more reliable and could achieve a greater rate of fire.  This was due in part to smoothbore artillery using fixed ammunition, with the projectile and charge bound together, while rifled pieces used semi-fixed rounds where these were loaded separately.  Guns could fire solid shot, shell, spherical case (shrapnel), and canister shot.  Howitzers could fire all but solid shot, and mortars could only fire shell and spherical case.\nBronze (sometimes erroneously referred to as brass) allowed for lightweight smoothbore artillery pieces.\nSome rifled artillery was also made of bronze but the rifling would erode too quickly.  Instead, most rifled artillery was made of wrought iron, or cast iron reinforced with wrought iron bands.  Heavyweight smoothbores were almost all wrought iron as well.  Although steel was increasing in availability, it was still too expensive and too difficult to produce in large enough quantities to be used for artillery.\nField artillery\nField artillery were cannons and howitzers light enough to be mounted on gun carriages and maneuvered around on the battlefield.  Each piece was hooked up to a limber allowing it to be pulled by a team of six horses driven by three drivers.  An accompanying caisson carried additional ammunition and was also pulled by a similar six-horse team.  The cannoneers who operated each piece marched alongside the artillery when it was on the move but could ride on the limber and caisson if necessary.  Horse artillery, also known as 'flying artillery,' differed in that every man was mounted on a horse.\nIn 1841, the US Army had selected a field artillery system based on bronze smoothbore muzzleloaders: the M1841 6-pounder field gun, the M1841 12-pounder howitzer and 12-pounder gun, the M1841 mountain howitzer, the M1841 24-pounder howitzer and the M1844 32-pounder howitzer.  The introduction of the M1857 12-pounder Napoleon represented a significant development as the gun-howitzer could replace several of the outdated pieces at once.  The Napoleon, along with the 10-pounder Parrott rifle, the 20-pounder Parrott rifle, and the 3-inch ordnance rifle, came to constitute the vast majority of Union field artillery during the Civil War.  The Confederates meanwhile had to make do with a wider variety of field artillery and went so far as to melt down outdated pieces so they could be recast as newer models.\n]]\nHeavy artillery\nHeavy artillery during the Civil War consisted of siege artillery, garrison artillery, and coastal artillery.  Siege and garrison artillery were larger versions of field artillery, mounted on heavyweight carriages which allowed them very limited mobility: the M1839 24-pounder smoothbore was the largest one which could still be moved by road.  Siege artillery fired the same ammunition as field artillery with the addition of grapeshot, which by 1861 had been abandoned by field pieces.  Coastal artillery was meant to be used from fixed positions and, as weight was not an issue, included some of the largest pieces of the war.  Coastal artillery could also fire heated shot.\nWhile smoothbore siege artillery had been common previously, the superiority of rifled guns in destroying fortifications saw them dominate during the Civil War.  Early examples of siege artillery include the 4.5-inch siege rifle and James rifles.  These were joined by larger versions of Parrott rifles and Blakely rifles.  Coastal artillery included massive columbiads like the Rodman gun.\nSiege and coastal mortars ranged from 8-inch models which could accompany an army's siege train to massive 13-inch monsters which had to be disassembled and carried by rail or ship to travel any distance.  The Coehorn mortar however was a type of small mortar light enough to be carried by four men.  This made it very useful for trench warfare and even during mobile battles like at Cold Harbor.\nNaval ordnance\nThe Dahlgren gun was the standard weapon of the United States Navy.  These smoothbore guns were also referred to as \"shellguns\" as they were designed to fire massive exploding shells.  Rifled artillery also found use on Navy ships, some of which were just identical versions of Army models while others were designed especially for naval use.  The Confederate Navy was heavily reliant on British imports for their naval artillery, although they managed to manufacture some domestic models, which were used both at sea and on land.\nAlthough naval artillery was primarily mounted on and intended to destroy ships, it could play a role in land battles of the Civil War, including being brought ashore as occurred during the Siege of Vicksburg.  The 12-pounder Dahlgren in fact was designed to be used mounted on the bow of a small boat, then be transferred to a field carriage in a matter of minutes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"45%\"\n|+  Types of Artillery during the Vicksburg Campaign\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Type\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\" |Model\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\" |BoreDia(in.)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Length(in.)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Tubewt.(lbs)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Carriagewt.(lbs.)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Range(yds)/deg. elev\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"align: center; background: #C9A0DC\"  | Field Artillery\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\" | Smoothbores\n|-\n| 6-pounder||Gun||3.67||65.6||884||900||1,513/5°\n|-\n| 12-pounder\"Napoleon\"||GunHowitzer||4.62||72.15||1,227||1.128||1,680/5°\n|-\n| 12-pounder||Howitzer||4.62||58.6||788||900||1,072/5°\n|-\n| 24-pounder||Howitzer||5.82||71.2||1,318||1,128||1,322/5°\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\" | Rifles\n|-\n| 10-pounder||Parrot||3.0||78||890|| 900||2,970/10°\n|-\n| 3-inch||Ordnance||3.0||73-3||820|| 900||2,788/10°\n|-\n| 20-pounder||Parrot||3.67||89.5||1,750|| ||4,4011/15°\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"align: center; background: #C9A0DC\" | Siege and Garrison\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\" | Smoothbores\n|-\n| 8-inch||Howitzer||8.0||61.5||2,614||50.5 shell||2,280/12°30'\n|-\n| 10-inch||Mortar||10.0||28.0||1,852||87.5 shell||2,028/45°\n|-\n| 12-pounder||Gun||4.62||116.0||3,590||12.3 shot||\n|-\n| 24-pounder||Gun||5.82||124.0||5,790||24.4 shot||1,901/5°\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\" | Rifles\n|-\n| 18-pounder*||Gun(Rifled)||5-3||123.25||||||\n|-\n| 30-pounder||Parrot||4.2||132.5||4,200||29.0 shell||6,700/25°\n|-\n| colspan=7 | *The Confederate \"Whistling Dick,\" an obsolete smoothbore siege gun, rifled and banded.\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"align: center; background: #C9A0DC\"  | Seacoast Artillery\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\"| Smoothbore\n|-\n| 8-inch||Columbiad||8.0||124||9,240||65 shot||4,812/27°30'\n|-\n| 9-inch*||Dahlgren|| colspan=5 |9.0\n|-\n| 10-inch||Columbiad||10-0||126||15,400||128 shot||5,654/39° 15'\n|-\n| 11-inch||Dahlgren||11-0||161||15,700||||3,650/20'\n|-\n| 32-pounder||Gun||6-4||125-7||7,200||32-6 shot||1,922/5°\n|-\n| 42-pounder||Gun||7-0||129||8,465||42.7 shot||1,955/5°\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\" | Rifles\n|-\n| 6.4-inch||Brooke||6.4||144|| colspan=3 |9,120\n|-\n| 7-inch||Brooke||7-0||147.5|| colspan=3 |14,800\n|-\n| 7.5. inch**||Blakely||7.5|| colspan=4 |100\n|-\n| 100-pounder||Parrott||6-4||155||9,700||100 shot||2,247/5°\n|-\n| colspan=7 | *A Confederate produced copy of Dahlgren's basic design.\n|-\n| colspan=7 | **The famous Confederate \"Widow Blakely,\" probably a British 42-pounder smoothbore shortened, banded, and rifled.\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"align: center; background: #C9A0DC\"  | Naval Artillery\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Type\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\" |Model\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\" |BoreDia(in.)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Length(in.)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Tubewt.(lbs)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Projectilewt.(lbs.)\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Range(yds)/deg. elev\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\"| Smoothbores\n|-\n| 8- inch||Dahlgren||8||115.5||6,500||51 shell||1,657/5°\n|-\n| 9-inch||Dahlgren||9||131.5||9,000||72-5 shell||1,710/5°\n|-\n| 11-inch||Dahlgren||11||161||15,700||136 shell||1,712/5°\n|-\n| 12-pounder||Howitzer||4.62||63.5||760||10 hell||1,08515°\n|-\n| 24-pounder||Howitzer||5.82||67||1,310||20 shell||1,270/5°\n|-\n| 32-pounder||Gun||6-4||108||4,704||32 shot||1,756/5°\n|-\n| 64-pounder||Gun||8||140.95|| colspan=3 |11,872\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\"| Rifles\n|-\n| 30- pounder||Parrott||4.2||112||3,550||29 shell||2,200/5º\n|-\n| 42-pounder**||Gun(rifled)||7||121||7,870|| colspan=2 |42 shot\n|-\n| 50-pounder||Dahlgren||5.1||107||6,000|| colspan=2 |50 shot\n|-\n| 100-pounder||Patron||6.4||155||9,700||100 shot||2,200/5°\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"align: center; background: light blue;\"| Mortars\n|-\n| 13-inch||Mortar||13||54.5||17,120||200 bell||4,200/45°\n|-\n| colspan=7 | Some naval guns served ashore as siege artillery.

Congreve rockets, which had seen use in the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War, saw a resurgence of use by the Confederates, while the Union made use of the improved Hale rockets.  Special rocket artillery units were also formed, such as the New York Rocket Battalion and the Confederate Rocket Battalion, but the poor performance of their weaponry saw such units disbanded and rearmed with traditional artillery.\n*Chemical weapons were not actively employed during the Civil War, although individuals on both sides sent proposals for their use to their respective war departments.  These ranged from using artillery shells, to hot-air balloons, to glass hand grenades as methods to deliver poisonous gas on the enemy, but these suggestions were not acted upon for the most part.  Louis M. Goldsborough reportedly discovered a Confederate plot to steal the  by the crew of the  releasing chloroform gas before boarding her, but it never came to fruition.  The closest that chemical weapons came to actual use was during the Siege of Petersburg: after the Battle of the Crater, Confederate engineer William W. Blackford dug counter-tunnels and placed smoke cartridges which, when activated by a nearby sentry, would asphyxiate any Union sappers.  However, the Union attempted no further mining operations and so the system was never activated.\n*Biological weapons, like chemical weapons, were not released by either side during the Civil War but proposals were made to do so.  Many such ideas would have never worked however due to a misunderstanding in how these diseases were spread.  A proposal to spread yellow fever among Union troops, for example, relied on using contact with infected persons or materials when it was actually spread by mosquitoes.  In his retreat from the Siege of Vicksburg and being chased by William T. Sherman, Joseph E. Johnston ordered livestock driven into local water sources and shot so that their dead bodies would taint the water.  However, Sherman's troops were in such close pursuit that the carcasses did not have time to fully decompose and so the water remained safe if unappealing to drink.\n*The Winans Steam Gun was a unique weapon which used centrifugal force rather than gunpower to launch projectiles at a supposed rate of fire of 200 a minute.  First built by William Joslin and Charles S. Dickinson, a pair of Ohio inventors, it was seized by Union forces when Dickinson attempted to sell it to the Confederates.  The weapon was never used in actual combat however and eventually scrapped.\n*Calcium floodlights were employed during the siege of Fort Wagner, allowing Union forces to bombard the fortress both day and night under illumination.  Such lights were also used to spot blockade runners.\nVehicles\nAnimals\n*Horse\n*Pack mule\nCarriages\n*Horse drawn carriages\n*Steam powered carriages\nTrains\n*BLW Armed train\nShips\n*Ships of the Union Navy\n*Ships of the Confederate Navy\nSubmarines\n*USS Alligator\n*CSS Hunley\n*CSS Pioneer\n*CSS Pioneer II (Also known as CSS American diver)\n*CSS Bayou Saint John\nAircraft\nAir balloons\n*Union Army Balloon Corps\n*Confederate Army Balloon Corps\nAirships\n*Andrews Aereon airship\nSee also\n*French weapons in the American Civil War\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n* Gabel, Christopher R., [http://cgsc.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16040coll3/id/105 Staff ride handbook for the Vicksburg Campaign, December 1862-July 1863].
