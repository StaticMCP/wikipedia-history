      "text": "# Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930\n\nThe Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 was a treaty of alliance between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the British-Mandate-controlled administration of the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq.  The treaty was between the governments of George V the United Kingdom and Faisal I of Iraq.  High Commissioner Francis Humphrys signed for the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Nuri as-Said signed for Iraq.  The 1930 treaty was based upon an earlier Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922 but took into account Iraq's increased importance to British interests given new oil finds made in 1927.\nBackground\nDuring the Mesopotamian campaign of the First World War, the British Army (alongside troops from the Commonwealth), fighting on the side of Allies, defeated the forces of the Ottoman Empire, fighting on the side the Central Powers. After the end of the First World War, British troops remained in the region which became the Kingdom of Iraq. In 1920, after the Ottoman Empire was partitioned, the United Kingdom formally established control over what was to become Iraq under a mandate from the League of Nations.\nThe Kingdom of Iraq began with the coronation of King Faisal I on 23 August 1921. The 1930 treaty provided a path towards nominal independence for Iraq two years later at the termination of the mandate and upon the entry of Iraq itself as a member of the League of Nations. The main purpose of the treaty was to give the British a variety of commercial and military rights within the country after independence.\nProvisions and effect\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was to write that the 1930 treaty provided that the British could maintain air bases near Basra and Habbaniya \"in times of peace\" and have the right of transit for military forces and supplies \"at all times\". In addition, Churchill indicated that the treaty would provide \"all possible facilities\" including the use of railways, rivers, ports, and airways for the passage of armed forces \"during times of war\".\nThe terms of the treaty were used to justify a British invasion and the occupation of Iraq after a nationalist coup whose leaders had contacts among the Axis powers.\nThe British used the terms of the treaty as a basis for a military occupation that lasted until the end of 1947. As they prepared to depart Iraq, an attempt was made to get the Iraqi government to sign a new military treaty giving the British greater powers than under the 1930 treaty. While that treaty was approved, it never came into effect because of unrest and large demonstrations in Iraq against it (the Al-Wathbah uprising).\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
