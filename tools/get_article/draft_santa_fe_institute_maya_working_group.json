Comprised of scholars and researchers, the group investigates ancient Maya civilization through archaeological, anthropological, and historical lenses. These experts explore themes of time, identity, complexity, and cosmology in Maya history.\nThe Maya Working Group's research endeavors explore the ancient Maya, using cutting-edge technology and archaeological discoveries. Group members regularly contribute new findings and discoveries for potential publication within academic journals or news media. All findings are also shared via meetings and other platforms. This is considered a best practice in collaborative team science often leading to topic switches and paradigm shifts. Working group collaborators also publish findings in books published by the Maya and Mesoamerican Studies Series at the University Press of Florida.\nHistory\nThe group began convening in 2012. Its initial focus was on the function and symbolism of Maya \"E Groups\". Over time, their work expanded to include time, ritual, cosmology, and political dynamics. Its meetings are designed to encourage interdisciplinary dialogue and collaborative team science. As a result, its meetings have resulted in several influential publications.\nMembership\nMembers of the Maya Working Group include archaeologists, anthropologists, and institutional leaders:\n* Ivan Batun Alpuche (Universidad de Oriente, Yucatán, Mexico)\n* Kat Brown (University of Texas at San Antonio)\n* Adrian Chase (Tulane University)\n* Arlen F. Chase (University of Houston)\n* Diane Z. Chase (University of Houston)\n* Anne S. Dowd (Ochoco National Forest and Crooked River National Grassland)\n* Francisco Estrada-Belli (Tulane University)\n* David Freidel (Emeritus, Washington University in St. Louis)\n* Felix Kupprat (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México)\n* Jerry Murdock (Santa Fe Institute; Aspen Institute)\n* Kathryn Reese-Taylor (University of Calgary)\n* Cynthia Robin (Northwestern University)\n* Travis Stanton (University of California, Riverside)\n* Nawa Sugiyama (University of California, Riverside)\n* Jerry Sabloff (President Emeritus, Santa Fe Institute)\nMeetings\nThe Maya Working Group has addressed several specific themes, usually with multiple meetings devoted to each topic. The initial topic addressed by the working group was the role that E Groups played in the rise of Maya civilization; meetings on this topic were undertaken in 2012 and 2013, building on the first use of block lidar in Mesoamerica and leading to new finds demonstrating the widespread use of this complex by Mesoamerica’s earliest civilizations . These results were published in 2017.\nThe second topic addressed by the working group was time and the Maya, building on both archaeological data and on the function of E Groups as anchors for the Mesoamerican calendric system . Meetings over the second theme were held at the Santa Fe Institute yearly from 2015 through 2018 and resulted in a volume published in 2024.\nThe third theme focused on by the working group involved Maya identity and the structure of their society, with meetings held in 2021, 2022 (twice) and 2024. This collaborative work built on new archaeological data that revealed the complexity of ancient Maya civilization and is being readied for publication.\nThe newest theme of focus is Mesoamerican interaction, particularly concerning the Maya and Teotihuacan. This meeting is being held in August 2025. It is focused on new finds from Teotihuacan and the Maya area.\nYearly sessions are as follows:\n* 2025: \"Collaborative Visions of Power in Mesoamerica: Teotihuacan and the Lowland Maya\" (Aug. 18–20)\n* 2024: \"Knowing Maya: Journeys into the Past\" (Aug. 28–30)\n* 2022: \"Being Maya 3 & 4: Identity, Agency, and Ontology\" (Aug. 3–5, Nov. 29–Dec. 1)\n* 2021: \"Being Maya 2: Identity, Ontology, and Agency\" (Aug. 18–20)\n* 2018: \"On Time and Being Maya IV\" (Aug. 29–30)\n* 2017: \"Telling Time: Myth, History, Everyday Life in the Ancient Maya World\" (Aug. 24–26)\n* 2016: \"Maya Materialization of Time II\" (Aug. 26–28)\n* 2015: \"Maya Materialization of Time\" (Feb. 13–16)\n* 2013: \"Second E Group Conference\" (August)\n* 2012: \"E Group Conference\" (August)\nPublications\nThe group has produced several significant volumes through the University Press of Florida. These books serve as accessible academic texts and foundations texts for modern research.\n* Freidel, D. A., Chase, A. F., Dowd, A. S., & Murdock, J. (Eds.). (2017/2020).
