The project was developed by Edward J. Minskoff Equities, designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill, and completed in 2008. It consists of 227 condominiums and 163 rental units.\n101 Warren Street was designed with a distinctive, elongated \"checkerboard\" facade. It contains a Whole Foods Market and a Barnes & Noble store.  Its double-height lobbies have murals by Roy Lichtenstein, while the fifth floor contains an \"Artrium\" with a pine tree forest consisting of 101 trees.\nAn earlier building at 101 Warren Street, the Tarrant Building, was destroyed by an explosion and fire in October 1900. The Mattlage Building, a 12-story office building, was later built at the site and numbered as 97–101 Warren Street. In 1942, the building was sold by a person or company identified as \"Irving\". It was announced in 1951 that the building would be auctioned off. In 1957, Office Structure bought the building. By August 2001, an office building was being proposed for the two blocks bounded by West, Greenwich, Warren, and Murray Streets; at the time, one block of Washington Street still ran from Warren to Murray Street. 101 Warren Street was being developed on the site by 2006, and was finished by 2008.\nReferences"
