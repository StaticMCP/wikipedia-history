It was based on the 1897 non-fiction work of the same title by Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet which had been written to celebrate Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.\nProduction\nThe film was conceived in 1912 at a meeting between G. B. Samuelson and his brother Julian Wylie. Samuelson was looking for his first film project, and later brought in Will Barker as his co-producer. The picture was largely filmed at Barker's newly built Ealing Studios, where Barker gained a reputation for extravagant productions, often historical.\nA great deal of money was invested in Sixty Years a Queen, and more than a thousand actors and extras were employed, on many locations. There was also much advance publicity. The picture was a great success at the box-offices, making the producers a profit of some £35,000.\nMore than twenty years later Herbert Wilcox made a similar film, Sixty Glorious Years, which was also very popular.\nCast\n* Blanche Forsythe as Queen Victoria (younger)\n* Louie Henri as Queen Victoria (older)\n* Fred Paul as Archbishop of Canterbury\n* Roy Travers as Prince Albert\n* Gilbert Esmond as Duke of Wellington\n* E.
