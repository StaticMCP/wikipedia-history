The state legislature chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nGeorgia cast six electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison over the Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. The electoral votes for Vice president were cast for Madison's running mate George Clinton from New York. These electors were elected by the Georgia General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1808 United States presidential election in Georgia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Madison\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0F071; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Federalist\n| Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 6\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Georgia\nReferences"
