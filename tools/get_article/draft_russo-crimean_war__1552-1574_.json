The result was a draw, although the Crimeans were unable to regain control of the khanates, they drove the Russians out of Kabarda.\nPrelude\nSince the beginning of the 16th century, Russians and Crimeans have been constantly at war because of the constant raids of the Crimean Khanate, often deep into Russian territory. Relations between the Russians and the Kazan Tatars worsened in connection with the change of dynasty, so Ivan IV sent an army to conquer the khanate. The struggle between the parties began with the Crimeans' unsuccessful campaign against Tula in order to prevent Russia from occupying Kazan. After this, in 1555, the Crimeans made a second attempt to reduce Russian influence, but again failed with great losses. Then, Daniil Adashev successfully ravaged the Crimea.\nCrimean campaign of Tula (1552)\nThe Crimean army, numbering about 30,000 people, went on a campaign. Ivan the Terrible, having received news of this, placed a force of 15,000 people on the banks of the Oka River. The Crimean Khan wanted to retreat, but since it was simply impossible to retreat without doing anything, he continued the campaign. The Crimeans set up camp and began the siege of the city of Tula. The Tula garrison successfully held the defense. Since Ivan the Terrible was restless about this siege, he gained time with a false maneuver, in which he pretended that his troops were marching on Tula, but in fact, Prince Vorotynsky's detachment was marching on the Crimeans, who overtook and defeated them near Tula on June 22-23,, and then achieved success in the battle at Shivron, capturing a convoy and prisoners.The success of the Russian detachment allowed the Crimeans to be driven out and the campaign to continue\nBattle of Sudbischi (1555)\nAfter the failed campaign on Tula, there was correspondence between Ivan the Terrible and Devlet Giray, where the ruler of Russia offered friendship, but the khan refused it.In 1555, the Khan went on a campaign. The Russians sent the voivode Ivan Sheremetev to meet him.  Historians give different numbers. Vitaly Penskoy gave the figures of 40,000 for the Tatars and 4,000 for the Russians, Belov gave the number of 60,000 for the Crimeans, and Nikolai Karamzin says in his book that there were 60,000 Crimeans and 13,000 Russians.\nthe battle began with Sheremetyev not avoiding the fight, despite the enemy's superiority, but defeated his advance regiment and took the banners of the Shirin princes, however, during the battle he himself was seriously wounded. at the same time, the smaller part of the Russian army could not withstand the attack of the Tatars and began to flee, but Alexei Basmanov and Stefan Sidorov managed to stop them. They, with two thousand men, moved to the oak grove and the slope. Having taken up positions and cut down trees, they made the convoy a fortress on wheels. The Russians successfully repel three assaults, and the Khan, out of despair and news of the approaching Russians, decided to retreat to the steppes.\nTsar Ivan IV the Terrible was informed that Sheremetyev had been defeated, as if the khan was marching towards Moscow. This turned out to be untrue, as the khan retreated after the battle. Ivan generously rewarded the participants in the battle. Many of Sheremetyev's companions died of their wounds, including Voivode Sidorov.According to historian Ivan Afremov, Russian losses amounted to 5,000 people against 15,000 Tatars.\nDaniil Adashev's campaign in Crimea (1559)\nDaniil Adashev was ordered to attack Crimea with an impressive army of 8,000 men. He began to make large boats, since they would be more maneuverable on the water. He captured ships, killed the Turks and Tatars near Ochakiv, and then suddenly appeared in the west of Crimea. He dispersed his forces to plunder the territories. He freed Christian prisoners with the Zaporozhian Cossacks. He released all the Turkish prisoners, declaring that he was fighting with Crimea, and not with Suleiman the Magnificent. Daniil Adashev left the island unhindered, having devastated the western part of the Crimean peninsula. The khan did not have time to gather an army. However, Devlet Giray tried unsuccessfully to attack Adashev's troops. Daniil took up defensive positions near the Monastyrskyi Island, but the khan did not dare to storm it and left. The Turks entered the war, but suffered defeat in the campaign against Astrakhan due to a number of factors, signing a non-aggression pact. In 1571, the Tatars burned Moscow, but the following year they suffered defeat at Molodi, which negated their success. Despite these defeats, the Tatars were able to achieve some success. They burned Moscow and were able to stop the Russian advance to the Black Sea, but they were unable to retake Astrakhan and Kazan, which remained in Russian hands.\nOttomans joined the war\nPrelude\nThe Russian conquest of Astrakhan weakened the Ottomans' position in Azerbaijan in the fight against the Safavids. To solve this problem, the Turks and Tatars jointly destroyed the campaign against Astrakhan. According to Vitaly Pensky, the campaign was aimed at weakening Persia, not Russia. According to the Soviet historian Sadikov, the Turks had plans back in 1563 under Suleiman the Magnicifient (specifically, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha) to break through a canal on the Volgodonsk portage in order to ease the route between the Black and Caspian Seas.\nAstrakhan campaign (1569-1570)\nReinforced by ships, the troops set out from Azov, going up to the Tsaritsa River. There the Turks tried to dig a canal, but upon the arrival of the latter, they were unable to drag the ships to the Volga. Since they could not build a canal, the Crimean and Turkish troops retreated. But ambassadors from the Astrakhan and Nogai came to them, they reported that if they liberated Astrakhan, they would provide their ships.\nWith a combined army of 17,000 Turks and over 40,000 Tatars and Nogais, they moved toward the city of Astrakhan. Their plan to dig a canal proved impossible. The Ottomans simply could not transport the huge galleys with heavy guns, but they went on anyway. Having reached Hare Island, they did not dare to storm it. But worsening weather conditions worsened the situation for the Ottoman army.\nThe desertion rate increased, supplies were weak, as the Turks did not know how to fight in such terrain and could not send reinforcements in the form of guns or soldiers. After a short time, this discontent was transmitted to the soldiers, the Janissaries did not want to spend the winter and therefore began a mutiny in the army. Kasim Pasha was forced to lift the siege. Kasim Pasha destroyed the fortifications and withdrew from the city. During the retreat, many soldiers died of hunger and disease. Cossacks were active on the Don, who did not give the Turks any peace with their attacks. Only a negligible number of soldiers returned to Azov, and the Ottoman fleet was destroyed by a strong storm in Azov.\nNon-aggression pact\nThis failure forced the Sultan to conclude a non-aggression pact with the Russians, but it did not lead to a halt in the expansionist policy of the Turks. Despite this, the Turks achieved Russian concession: free passage for Muslim traders through Central Asia. Russians did this because they feared a new Turkish campaign against Astrakhan, since at that time the Ottoman Empire was a powerful European power.\nDevlet Girey's campaigns into Russia\nRaid of 1570\nThe Crimeans, despite defeat, raided Russian lands in the spring of 1570. Ryazan and Kashira were devastated.\nCampaign to Moscow (1571)\nThe Tatars wanted to take revenge on the Russians and Cossacks for their raids into Crimea. Having gathered 40,000 troops, Devlet I Giray began the campaign in the spring of the same year.\nAlthough Selim II did not give permission for the campaign against Moscow, he hinted that he did not object to the campaign.\nOpinions differ on the size of the Russian army. Ivan the Terrible named the number from 6 thousand people, and the historian V.V. Kargalov adheres to it, as well as up to 50 thousand people, which S.M. Solovyov named. Many historians avoid giving an assessment of the Russian army. but, nevertheless, the sources of that time agree on the data the Khan in his Report to Istanbul said about 36 thousand people, and the anonymous German author of the brochure \"a brief reliable report and a general overview of past stories and deeds that happened recently in 1570-1571 in Moscow and Russia\" says that the Russians had 40 thousand people. Based on this data, Pensky in his work says that 35-40 thousand is quite possible. As for the Crimeans, there were supposedly 40,000 people, but according to Pensky, there could have been even fewer Tatars , also 13,000 irregular turks and 7,000 janissares\nThe khan reached the Krom region, then crossed the Oka, then moved along the Pakhnuttseva road to the north to the town of Bolkhov. Halfway between Oryol and Bolkhov, Khan Devlet Giray took a day's rest. Devlet probably suspected something was wrong with going directly to Moscow, so he crossed Kozelsk, Zhizdra near Przemysl and crossed the Ugra west of Kaluga. Then he sent part of the cavalry to Serpukhov\nThe Crimean Khan took the Russians by surprise with a maneuver, unexpectedly appearing at the Bogoroditsk, now the initiative was on the side of the Crimeans. The Russian army did not have time to concentrate for direct action.  On the way, the Tatars defeated several hundred of Popadeikin-Volynsky's men.  On May 23, Devlet I Giray smashed the stake at Kolomenskoye. The battle near Moscow ended in defeat for the Russians, and the noble Ivan Belsky was killed. After this, the khan set fire to Moscow, which burst into flames. After his victory, the khan retreated, which indicates that the Russians were not completely defeated near Moscow.\nBattle of Molodi (1572)\nAfter his victory, the Crimean Khan decided to march on Moscow again in 1572. On the way, he defeated the Russian forces of 200 people, but he did not even imagine that the Russians understood that he would come again, so they prepared fortifications. On July 29, the Crimeans were defeated by the troops of the commander Dmitry Khvorostin. Having learned about this, the Crimean Khan deployed his army. The young commander Vorotynsky lured the enemy into a trap. Having imposed conditions on the khan, he achieved superiority. In a protracted battle, for which the Crimeans were not prepared, Teberdey-Murza was killed. After some time, Devlet Giray began an assault, but was again defeated. Having suffered huge losses, he lost the noble commander Divey-Murza, and after which, on August 2, the Tatars attacked again, only again in failure, with great losses for both sides. But already together with the janissaries, they were able to attack the gulyai-gorod and begin to push back the Russians. because the Crimean khan was carried away by the attacks and threw all his forces into the attack, Vorotynsky with his maneuver quietly led a large regiment and attacked from the rear, with the support of Khvorostin's sortie. unable to withstand the blow, the Crimeans wavered, beginning to flee. They abandoned their weapons, wagons, property, all seven thousand janissaries were killed, as were most of the Crimean Murzas. This battle was a disaster for the Khan. No more than 15,000 warriors out of 60,000 returned to Crimea.\nDespite this, the Crimeans, with their raids, drove the Russians out of Kabarda, thereby de facto stopping their advance along the Black Sea along with the Ottomans and also achieved the destruction of Russian fortresses on the Terek.\nBattle of Pechernykovie Dubravy (1574)\nSerebryaniy-Obolensky learned of the Crimean movement, gathered nobles and after a whole day of fighting put them to flight.\nResult\nThe Russians were able to secure Astrakhan and Kazan as a result of a series of campaigns. The Crimeans were unable to recapture them. However, thanks to the last campaigns (1570s) they were able to achieve success together with the Turks, as already mentioned: limiting Russian influence in the Caucasus, stopping the advance along the Black Sea and destroying the fortresses on the Terek.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
