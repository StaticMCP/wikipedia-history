She is also regarded as an  ancestral deity of the Lim (林) Clan.\nThe temple is located in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray, approximately four kilometres from the Melbourne CBD, and overlooks the Maribyrnong River. It is Australia's largest Taoist temple and includes a  gold-painted stainless steel statue of Mazu imported from Nanjing, China, installed in 2008. The statue was the second of its kind in Australia.\nThe temple complex is based on the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the main temple opened in 2012. The temple's first stage was completed in 2013 at the cost of $5 million after 5 years of construction. The main hall opened to the public in 2015, but construction of the temple complex continued until 2020 with two additional halls completed.\nWhen finished, the temple complex will cover approximately 40,000 square meters. About two-thirds of the land will comprise a Chinese Garden and car park, and the total floor area of the buildings will cover approximately 5000 square meters.\nSee also\n* A-Ma Temple, Macau\n* Ma-Cho Temple, Philippines\n* List of Mazu temples around the world\n* Qianliyan & Shunfeng'er\n* Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong\nReferences\nExternal links"
