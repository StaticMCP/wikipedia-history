Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 1, 1793, two weeks before the beginning of the first year of the administration of Governor Joshua Clayton. This was the first application of the Delaware 1792 Constitution.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Daniel Rogers, Sussex County\nHouse of Representatives\n*George Wilson, Kent County\n*Stephen Lewis, Kent County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Archibald Alexander\n*Robert Haughey\n*John Dickinson\n|\n:Kent County\n*James Morris\n*John Vining\n*Edward White\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Daniel Polk\n*Daniel Rogers\n*Rhodes Shankland\n|}\nHouse of Representatives\nRepresentatives were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*James Black\n*Samuel Hollingsworth\n*William Johnson\n*George Monro\n*Edward Roche\n*Joseph Tatnall\n*Nehemiah Tilton\n|\n:Kent County\n*Isaac Davis\n*Stephen Lewis\n*John Lockwood\n*James Raymond\n*Nicholas Ridgely\n*Caleb Sipple\n*George Wilson\n|\n:Sussex County\n*John W.
