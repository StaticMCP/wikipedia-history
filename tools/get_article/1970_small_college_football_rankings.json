Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches.\nThe 1970 Arkansas State Indians football team compiled a perfect 11–0 record and was rated No. 1 by both the AP and UPI. Montana (10–1) was ranked No. 2 by the AP, and Tampa (10–1) was ranked No. 2 by the UPI.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid
