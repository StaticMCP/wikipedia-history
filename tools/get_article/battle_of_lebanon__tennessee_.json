Dumont's force consisted of detachments from the 1st Kentucky Cavalry under Colonel Frank Lane Wolford, the 4th Kentucky Cavalry under Colonel Green Clay Smith, and the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry under Colonel Wynkoop.  Morgan's force was the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment.\nBattle\nDumont surprised Morgan early on the morning of May 5, 1862. A 15-mile running battle ensued in which the Confederates were forced to retreat.  During the fighting Confederate sympathizers in the town fired upon the Union Cavalry.
