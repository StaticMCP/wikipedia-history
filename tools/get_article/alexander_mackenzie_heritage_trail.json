On the advice of local First Nations people, who guided Mackenzie and his party to the Pacific Ocean, they gave up the river route for an overland one. The overland journey started just above the mouth of the Blackwater River at the West Road River  west of Quesnel, taking them through the Upper Blackwater, along the Eliguk Lake and Gatcho Lake, through parts of what is now Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, over the Rainbow Mountains, into the Bella Coola Valley and \"Friendly Village\". The local people took the group down the Bella Coola River, over the salt water into the Dean Channel.\" He reached the ocean on July 20, 1793, completing the first recorded transcontinental crossing north of Mexico. The route was designated as an official heritage trail by the Heritage Conservation Act in 1987.\nFrom east to west, the modern-day trail begins at the West Road River (Blackwater River) 53.269063 N,123.148917 W between Quesnel and Prince George, passes Kluskus Lake, Eliguk Lake, then crosses through what is now Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, then follows the Bella Coola River to the North Bentinck Arm inlet.\nBecause of its length and difficulty, experienced hikers can expect the route to take about 18 days, whereas intermediate hikers may require at least 24 days. Also, hikers may choose to hike only sections of the trail, such as the route through Tweedsmuir Provincial Park which passes the extinct Rainbow Range shield volcano. Only a few hiking or horse riding parties, plus a few ATVs or trucks, pass along the trail each year.\nThe middle section of the trail passes within 5&nbsp;km of Pan Phillips' Home Ranch, popularized by the books by Rich Hobson, Grass Beyond the Mountains, Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy, and The Rancher Takes a Wife, and the [http://www.tv.com/nothing-too-good-for-a-cowboy/show/3655/episode.html?season=1&tag=list_header;paginator;1 CBC television series] based on the same books. The Home Ranch closed operations in the early 1970s, but the remains of the ranch are in good shape.\nSee also\n*Hudson's Bay Brigade Trail\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/explore/cariboo/trails/almack.htm Alexander Mackenzie Heritage Trail]"
