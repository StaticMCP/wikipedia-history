He was leading a group of rebels against the Spanish royalist army in the first skirmish in Cuba's struggle for independence from Spain (see History of Cuba). An attempt to recover Martí's body was made by the rebels but the Spanish forces were too strong. Spanish forces buried José Martí; the body was subsequently exhumed and reburied with an elaborate funeral in Santiago de Cuba in 1951.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Dos Rios\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Dos Ríos"
