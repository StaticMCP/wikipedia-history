It was formed in 1993 by frontwoman Lori S., drummer Joey Osbourne and bassist Peter Lucas. Acid King have since recorded four studio albums and two EPs with a series of bassists.\nThe band's name was inspired by the crimes of Ricky Kasso, who murdered his friend Gary Lauwers in Northport, New York on June 19, 1984. Kasso was nicknamed \"Acid King\" by his peers due to his chronic hallucinogenic drug use. The band's self-titled debut EP features a photograph of Kasso on its cover. The band itself has also been featured in two books – The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal and the A to Z of Doom, Gothic & Stoner Metal – both published in 2003.\nMembers\nCurrent members\n*Lori S. – guitar, vocals, lyrics (1993–present)\n*Bryce Shelton – bass (2021-present)\n*Jason Willer – drums (2021-present)\nPrevious members\n*Peter Lucas – bass (1993–1996; appears on Acid King (EP) and Zoroaster)\n*Dan Southwick – bass (1996–1998; appears on Down with the Crown)\n*Brian Hill – bass (1998–1999; appears on Busse Woods)\n*Guy Pinhas – bass (1999–2005; appears on Free... and Acid King III)\n*Mark Lamb – bass (2007–2017; appears on Middle of Nowhere, Center of Everywhere)\n*Joey Osbourne – drums (1993–2017)\n*Rafa Martinez – bass (2005–2008, 2019)\n*Bil Bowman – drums (2017–2021)\nSession member\n*Jason Landrian – guitar, keyboards (2020-present; appears on Beyond Vision)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1993\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1993\nLegend     = position:bottom orientation:vertical columns:4\nColors =\nid:Vocals     value:red        legend:Vocals\nid:Guitars    value:green      legend:Guitar\nid:Bass       value:blue       legend:Bass\nid:Drums      value:orange     legend:Drums\nid:bar        value:black      legend:Studio_album\nid:lines2     value:gray(0.4)  legend:EPs\nid:lines3     value:gray(0.7)  legend:Compilation\nid:bars       value:gray(0.95)\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\nLineData =\nlayer:back\ncolor:black\nat:08/29/1995\nat:01/01/1999\nat:04/01/2005\nat:05/07/2015\nat:03/24/2023\ncolor:lines2\nat:04/01/1994\nat:07/29/1997\nat:02/06/2001\ncolor:lines3\nat:03/07/1999\nat:05/07/2003\nat:10/15/2006\nBarData =\nbar:Crover     text:\"Dale Crover\"\nbar:S          text:\"Lori S.\"\nbar:Lucas      text:\"Peter Lucas\"\nbar:Southwick  text:\"Dan Southwick\"\nbar:Hill       text:\"Brian Hill\"\nbar:Pinhas     text:\"Guy Pinhas\"\nbar:Martinez   text:\"Rafael 'Rafa' Martinez\"\nbar:Lamb       text:\"Mark Lamb\"\nbar:Osbourne   text:\"Joey Osbourne\"\nbar:Bowman     text:\"Bil Bowman\"\nPlotData=\nwidth:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Crover    from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1994 color:Vocals\nbar:S         from:01/01/1993 till:end        color:Guitars\nbar:S         from:01/01/1994 till:end        color:Vocals width:3\nbar:Lucas     from:01/01/1993 till:01/01/1996 color:Bass\nbar:Southwick from:01/01/1996 till:01/01/1998 color:Bass\nbar:Hill      from:01/01/1998 till:06/01/1999 color:Bass\nbar:Pinhas    from:06/01/1999 till:08/01/2005 color:Bass\nbar:Martinez  from:08/01/2005 till:01/01/2008 color:Bass\nbar:Martinez  from:06/01/2017 till:end        color:Bass\nbar:Lamb      from:01/01/2008 till:06/01/2017 color:Bass\nbar:Osbourne  from:01/01/1993 till:06/01/2017 color:Drums\nbar:Bowman    from:06/01/2017 till:end        color:Drums\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio releases\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n| 1994\n|Acid King (EP)\n|Sympathy for the Record Industry\n|reissued on The Early Years\n|-\n|1995\n|Zoroaster\n|Sympathy for the Record Industry\n|reissued on The Early Years\n|-\n|1997\n|Down with the Crown (EP)\n|Man's Ruin Records\n|reissued as a split with Altamont\n|-\n|1999\n|Busse Woods\n|Man's Ruin RecordsSmall Stone Records\n|reissued with bonus tracks in 2004 (Small Stone)reissued on vinyl in 2007 (Kreation)reissued on cd, cassette, and vinyl in 2019 (RidingEasy)\n|-\n|2001\n|Free...\n|Man's Ruin Records\n|released as a split with Clearlight\n|-\n|2005\n|Acid King III\n|Small Stone Records\n|reissued on vinyl in 2006 (Kreation)\n|-\n|2006\n|The Early Years\n|Leaf Hound Records\n|compilation containing remasters of Acid King and Zoroaster\n|-\n|2015\n|Middle of Nowhere, Center of Everywhere\n|Svart Records\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|Beyond Vision\n|Blues Funeral\n|\n|}\nCompilation appearances\n*\"Not Fragile\" (BTO cover) on In the Groove (1999 The Music Cartel)\n*\"Motorhead\" (Hawkwind cover) on Daze of the Underground (2003 Godreah Records)\n*\"The Stake\" (Steve Miller Band cover) on ''Sucking the 70's – Back in the Saddle Again (2006 Small Stone Records)\n\"Not Fragile\" and \"Motorhead\" included on re-release of Busse Woods''.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://acidking.com/ Official Acid King website]\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070307121402/http://www.smallstone.com/2-acidking.html Acid King] at Small Stone Records"
