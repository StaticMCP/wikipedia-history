For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n1 Will. 4\nContinuing the 9th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 26 October 1830 until 22 April 1831.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 1 Gul. 4, 1 Wm. 4 or 1 W. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for rendering the Payment of Creditors more equal and expeditious in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  as far as regards the Settlement of the Poor by the renting and Occupation of Tenements.|note4= }}\n|  to provide for the taking an Account of the Population of Ireland, and for ascertaining the Increase or Diminution thereof.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to regulate the Trade of the British Possessions Abroad.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and Solicitors to make and file the same on or before the First Day of Hilary Term One thousand eight hundred and thirty-two;
