No racial or ethnic group holds a majority in the borough.\nCoterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (behind Brooklyn), with approximately 2.3 million residents in 2013, approximately 48% of them foreign-born; Queens County is also the second most populous county in New York State, behind neighboring Kings County, which is coterminous with the borough of Brooklyn. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States; and if each New York City borough were an independent city, Queens would also be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Some say Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.\nGeneral statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\" align=right\n|+ Queens CountyHistorical Population Figures\n|-\n!
