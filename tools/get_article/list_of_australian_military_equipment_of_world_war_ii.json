As a result, the majority of Australia's military weapons and equipment were initially imported from the United Kingdom or the United States. However, as the war progressed, many of these imported items were gradually replaced by locally produced versions, as Australia's industrial capacity expanded to meet the demands of the conflict.\nKnives and bayonet\nBayonets\n* Pattern 1907 bayonet\nSmall arms\nPistols (manual and semi-automatic)\n* Enfield No. 2 Mk I\n* Webley Mk VI revolver\n* Webley Mk IV revolver\n* Browning Hi-Power P35\n* Smith & Wesson Victory\n* Beaumont-Adams revolver  (Volunteer Defence Corps)\n* Webley M1872 Bull Dog  (Volunteer Defence Corps)\n* Colt Model 1851 Navy  (Volunteer Defence Corps)\n* Smith & Wesson No.3  (Volunteer Defence Corps)\nAutomatic pistols and submachine guns\n* Owen Gun\n* STEN submachine gun\n* Thompson submachine gun\n* Austen submachine gun\nRifles\n* Lee–Enfield No. 1 Mk III*\n* Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I\n* Lee–Enfield No. 5 Mk I jungle carbine\n* Pattern P1914 No. 3 Mk I\n* Charlton automatic rifle\n* Lee-Metford Mk II (Volunteer Defence Corps)\n* Martini-Henry Mk IV (Volunteer Defence Corps)\nGrenades and grenade launchers\n* Mills bomb No. 36M\nRecoilless rifles\nFlamethrowers\n*M2 flamethrower\n*Flamethrower, Portable, No 2\nMachine guns\nInfantry and dual-purpose machine guns\n* Vickers Mk I machine gun\n* Lewis Mk I light machine gun\n* Bren Mk 1 light machine gun\n* Hotchkiss M1909 Mk I Benét–Mercié light machine gun\n* Browning M1919A4 machine gun\nVehicle and aircraft machine guns\n* M2 Browning machine gun\n* Lewis Mk III gun\n* Besa machine gun\nArtillery\nInfantry mortars\n* Stokes mortar\n* Ordnance SBML 2-inch mortar\n* Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar\n* Ordnance ML 4.2 inch Mortar\nHeavy mortars & rocket launchers\nField artillery\n* Ordnance QF 15-pounder Mk I\n* Ordnance QF 13-pounder\n* Ordnance QF 18-pounder Mk2, Mk4\n* Ordnance BLC 15-pounder\n* RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun\n* QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer\n* QF 4.5-inch howitzer\n* QF 5.25 inch gun\n* BL 10-pounder Mountain Gun\n* Ordnance QF 25-pounder\n* Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short\nFortress and siege guns\n* BL 60-pounder gun\n* BL 4 inch naval gun Mk 1\n* BL 4.5-inch Medium Field Gun\n* BL 4.7 inch /45 naval gun\n* BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun\n* BL 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer\n* BL 6-inch 30 cwt howitzer\nAnti-tank guns\n* Ordnance QF 2-pounder Mk IX/X\n* Ordnance QF 6-pounder Mk II\n* Ordnance QF 17-pounder\nAnti-tank weapons (besides anti-tank guns)\n* Boys anti-tank rifle Mk I, Mk II\n* PIAT\nAnti-aircraft weapons\nLight anti-aircraft guns\n* Vickers QF 2-pounder naval gun  (pom-pom)\n* Rolls-Royce QF 2-pounder naval gun\n* QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss\n* Oerlikon 20 mm cannon\n* Bofors 40 mm gun\nHeavy anti-aircraft guns\n* QF 6-pounder 6 cwt Hotchkiss\n* QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun\n* QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun\n* QF 12-pounder 12 cwt AA gun\n* QF 13-pounder 6 cwt AA gun\n* QF 3-inch 20 cwt\n* QF 3.7-inch AA gun\n* QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun\n* QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun\n* QF 4.5-inch Mk I – V naval gun\nVehicles\nTankettes\n*CTLS-4TAC\nTanks\n* Sentinel tank (only Australian production)\n* Fiat M11/39\n* Fiat M13/40\n* Vickers Light Tank Mk VI\n* Renault R35\n* M3 Stuart\n* Medium tank M3 Grant\n* Matilda II\n* Vickers 6-Ton\n* Yeramba\nTank-based\nOther\nArmored cars\n* Dingo (scout car)\n* Rhino Heavy Armoured Car\n* Rover Light Armoured Car\n* S1 Scout Car\n* T17E1 Staghound armoured car\nArmored carriers\n* Universal Carrier\nEngineering and command\nTrucks\n*Canadian Military Pattern truck Ford F30 (by Ford Australia)\nPassenger cars\nMotorcycles\n* Harley Davidson 42 WLA\n* BSA WM20\nTractors & prime movers\nMiscellaneous vehicles\n* Landing Vehicle Tracked\nNavy ships and war vessels\n*List of ships of the Second World War\nAircraft\n* de Havilland Mosquito\n* Bristol Beaufort\n* Bristol Beaufighter\n* CAC Woomera (CA-4/CA-11)\n* CAC Wirraway (CA-3)\n* CAC Wackett (CA-6)\n* CAC Boomerang (CA-12)\n* North American P-51 Mustang (license built as CA-17 Mustang)\n* de Havilland Express\n* Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk\n*Supermarine Spitfire\nSecret weapons\nRadars\nMissiles & bombs\nCartridges and shells\n.303 inch cartridge\nSee also\n*List of military equipment of Australia\nReferences"
