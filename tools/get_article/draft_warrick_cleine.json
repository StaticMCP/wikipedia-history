He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Canterbury in 1992.\nCareer\nBusiness\nCleine began his business career in public accounting in New Zealand before relocating to Southeast Asia.\nCleine led a Management Buy-out of KPMG in Vietnam and Cambodia in 2013. He serves on KPMG's Global Council and Asia Pacific Board and chairs the New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam and the British Corporate Advocacy Council.\nAcademia\nCleine is an Adjunct Professor at RMIT University Vietnam in the School of Business and a Visiting Professor of Practice at British University Vietnam (BUV), focusing on strategy, trade and geopolitics.

Following Jacinda Ardern's resignation as Prime Minister in January 2023 and Labour's declining polls, the party sought experienced figures for its list. Cleine was considered for a list-only position due to his business and policy expertise, rather than contesting West Coast-Tasman, held by Labour MP Damien O'Connor. Despite prior interest in 2020, he did not stand in 2023, with no official reason provided. Labour lost to the National Party, securing 34 seats to National's 48, ending six years in government.\nPost-election, Cleine published an essay based on an episide of US sitcom Seinfeld (\"Seinfeld's Lessons for NZ Labour,\") advising Chris Hipkins on policy renewal, advocating for adoption of Vietnamese style \"Bamboo Diplomacy\" based foreign policy for New Zealand, and economic policies based on Mariana Mazzucato's \"mission economy\" and Thomas Piketty's work on inequality, for tax system alignment between New Zealand and Australia, along with evidence-based populism such as marijuana decriminalisation, advocated by the Helen Clark Foundation. In 2022, in his Christchurch Press article titled \"How New Zealand can make sense of China's Pacific foray\". Cleine advocated a measured response to China's influence, expanding trade and investment ties while strengthening institutional and defence capabilities in New Zealand and the Pacific. Cleine supported the UK's 2023 CP-TPP entry for its trade and security benefits, and in supporting further expansion of formal trade relationships, he noted a 44% increase in New Zealand-Vietnam trade over five years following Vietnam's entry into the CP-TPP.\nPhilanthropy and honours\nIn 2021, Cleine co-founded the Vietnam Corporate Pride Network (VCPN) to promote LGBTI workplace inclusion.\nCleine was appointed an Ordinary  Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2025 New Year Honours, announced on 30 December 2024 by King Charles III, for \"services to British trade and investment in Vietnam.\" The award recognised his role in strengthening UK-Vietnam economic ties. Cleine stated the honour reflected his commitment to international trade relationships and the professional services sector, as reported by Vietnam Investment Review.\nPersonal life\nCleine resides in Ho Chi Minh City. His brother, Jamie Cleine, is the Mayor of Buller District.\nReferences"
