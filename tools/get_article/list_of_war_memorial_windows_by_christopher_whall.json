The church is built of local stone with a stone slate roof, and is a Grade I listed building. There are a number of stained glass windows including the main East window and one of the finest modern stained glass art-deco windows in Yorkshire by Whall. In Whall's 1920, two-light window one light commemorates Ernest A.Carter who fell at Ypres. The inscription reads-\nThe second light remembers John W Carter who fell at Suvla Bay in 1915.The text which carries across the foot of both lights reads: \"Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee the Crown of Life\" (Revelation, 2:10).\n|-\n|St Leonard\n|Apethorpe, Northamptonshire\n|Between 1921 and 1924\n|Whall designed a Memorial window to Gerard Charles Brassey, Second Lieutenant Coldstream Guards, who was killed in action on 27 August 1918. He was buried at Mory Cemetery near St Leger in France. In a letter describing the design for the window, Whall wrote- \"The church being dedicated to St Leonard and there being two St Leonards- one an Englishman and the other a Frenchman, and there being two windows, side by side, it has been thought appropriate , especially in the cordial feeling now existing between the two countries, to commemorate both Saints-curiously enough they have one feature in common- they are both represented with chains, being both associated with the release of prisoners from captivity, Leonard of Ryseby (the Crusader) having been seven years captive to the Saracens in Palestine and Leonard of Limoges having obtained from the King of France the privilege of releasing from captivity any prisoners in the district of which he was Abbot. Considering that the two countries, by their alliance in war have won a very narrow escape from captivity both for themselves and the World their commemoration together seems appropriate as a war memorial subject.\"\n|-\n|St Etheldreda\n|Hatfield.Hertfordshire\n|1920\n|Whall designed the memorial window on the North wall of the Nave near to the porch. The window is dedicated to the memory of three of the Cecil family. The inscription reads\nThe window consists of three lights. The window was presented in 1920 by James, Fourth Marquess of Salisbury, in memory of his three nephews. Their father was Lord William Cecil, then Bishop of Exeter who had previously been rector at Hatfield. The three angels in the work represent \"Trial and Sacrifice\" (crown of thorns), \"Victory and Triumph\" (resurrection and torch) and \"Christian Duty\" (baptism of the infant). The red seraphim in the tracery above represents \"Divine Love\" and the blue seraphim represents \"Divine Wisdom\".\n|-\n|United Reformed Church\n|Purley, South London\n|1920\n|Church has an East window by Whall which serves as a War Memorial.\n|-\n|St Peter\n|Norton-on-Derwent, North Yorkshire\n|1921\n|A stone tablet and Whall designed window are dedicated to the 119 parishioners who died in The Great War. The inscription reads:-\nThe window was unveiled on 11 November 1921 by Lieutenant-Colonel A.D.Legard and dedicated by the Bishop Suffragan of Hull. The four British patron saints portrayed symbolise 1) \"Spiritual Victory\" - St Patrick drives out the snakes 2) \"National Victory\" - St George slays the dragon 3) \"Plenty\" - St Andrew with the boy with the loaves and fishes and 4) \"Plenty and Unity\" - St David, the inspired preacher who united the church of his day. The lower panels show 1) the horror and destruction of war 2) the conquest of evil 3) stilling the storm and 4) a boat reaching safe harbour. The tracery above the window shows the crown of thorns, then nails and the reed, symbols of sacrifice. In the volume in The Buildings of England series which covers \"Yorkshire: York and the East Riding\", David Neave and Nikolaus Pevsner describe the window as \"adventurous\".  The window is the West window in the Tower.\n|}\ngallery\nImage:Gray's Inn Chapel 1.JPG|Detail from window in Gray's Inn Chapel, London\nImage:Gray's Inn Chapel 3.JPG|Detail from window in Gray's Inn Chapel, London\nImage:Whall work.-St Andrew's Chippenham.jpg|War Memorial Window St Andrew's, Chippenham.\nImage:Archangel Michael Worcester Cathedral.JPG|Left hand light Baldwin Memorial Window in Worcester Cathedral\nImage:Centre light Worcester Cathedral.JPG|Centre light Baldwin Memorial Window in Worcester Cathedral\nImage:Archangel Gabriel- Worcester Cathedral.JPG|Right hand light Baldwin Memorial window in Worcester Cathedral\nImage:St Leonard Church Window 2.JPG|War Memorial window in St Leonard, Wollaton.Nottinghamshire.
