Like other neighborhoods with the \"Little Italy\" designation, Little Italy has a large Italian-American population. There are several Italian-American owned and operated businesses, including restaurants, law firms, and photographers located in Little Italy.\nOne of the central features of Little Italy is St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church, which also includes a grade school and the Padua Academy, located outside of Little Italy but nearby on Wilmington's west side. St. Anthony's also hosts the Italian Festival, a week-long festival which takes place annually in June and celebrates Italian culture through food, music, a midway with rides and games, and games of chance generally found next to the church building.\nFilmography\nIn 2010, a 78 minute documentary about the history of Little Italy and St. Anthony's Church titled Bells On The Hill was released. The premiere screening sold out four days in advance at the local independent venue Theatre N. The film was written and directed by Gus Parodi and Matt Swift.\nTransportation\nLittle Italy is surrounded by Pennsylvania Avenue to the north and Lancaster Avenue to the south, with both of them connecting to I-95 and DE Route 141, both just east and west of Little Italy respectively.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.stanthonynet.org/ St. Anthony of Padua Parish]\n* [http://www.westendnh.org/ West End Neighborhood House]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150518070124/http://gusparodi.com/  Gus Parodi : Stories From the Hill]"
