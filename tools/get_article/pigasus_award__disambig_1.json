The purpose of the award was to expose parapsychological, paranormal, and psychic frauds whom Randi had noted over the previous year.  Randi usually made his announcements of the awards from the previous year on April 1 (April Fools' Day).\nHistory\nThe award was originally called the Uri trophy, after Uri Geller, and was first announced in the appendix of Randi's book Flim-Flam!. The 1982 edition lists the award's \"recipients\" in 1979, 1980 and 1981.\nIn Flim-Flam!, Randi states:\n}}\nThe bent spoon trophy is a reference to Geller's claimed spoon-bending abilities.\nThe logo of a winged pig was designed for Randi's website by German artist Jutta Degener in 1996.[http://www.randi.org/hotline/1996/0039.html The Randi Hotline – 1996: Contest time!] The name \"Pigasus\" was chosen by Randi from suggestions e-mailed to him.[http://www.randi.org/hotline/1996/0048.html The Randi Hotline – 1996: The Name of the Pig] The term is a portmanteau pun combining the word pig with the mythological Pegasus, a reference to the expression \"when pigs fly\".\nRandi did not present any Uri Award for a number of years after its inception in Flim-Flam! In 1997, it was revived and the name was changed to \"Pigasus\" after the winged pig. Randi announced the recipients through his e-newsletter, SWIFT!, in which he said \"The awards are announced via telepathy, the winners are allowed to predict their winning, and the Flying Pig trophies are sent via psychokinesis. We send; if they don't receive, that's probably due to their lack of paranormal talent.\"[http://www.randi.org/jref/pig2003.html The 2003 Pigasus Awards]\nThere were no Pigasus Awards for 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2002.\nCategories\nFlim-Flam! specifies that the winner of the Pigasus Award falls in one of four possible categories:\n# The scientist who said or did the silliest thing relating to parapsychology in the preceding twelve months.\n# The funding organization that supports the most useless parapsychological study during the year.\n# The media outlet that reported as fact the most outrageous paranormal claim.\n# The \"psychic\" performer who fools the greatest number of people with the least effort in that twelve-month period.\nThe 2003 Pigasus Awards featured only categories 1 and 4.
