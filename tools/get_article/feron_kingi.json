      "text": "# Feron kingi\n\nFeron kingi, the red cone gall wasp, is a species of gall wasp in the family Cynipidae.\nThis species induces galls on various white oak species, such as the valley oak Quercus lobata. The galls housing the parthenogenetic females are detachable red cones measuring about 5&nbsp;mm tall. These form on either side of the leaves, often with many forming per leaf. Adults emerge in winter from the tip of the cone.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.gallformers.org/gall/1511 Feron kingi on gallformers]"
