Thereupon, the Ottoman navy targeted not the Republic of Venice with which peace was made during the 1573 campaign season, but the Kingdom of Naples lands that were part of the Spanish Empire.\nPiali Pasha, who carried out the naval preparations together with Occhiali and was re-appointed as the navy commander, set sail for the Mediterranean on June 3, 1573.\nBattle\n220 pieces (208 galley and 12 barges), After reaching Avlonia, the Ottoman navy crossed the Strait of Otranto and landed on the Apulia shores of the Kingdom of Naples and captured Kastro castle (the same castle had been captured in 1537 during Lütfi Pasha's Pulya expedition). After loading many prisoners and booty captured during the plunder of the region onto ships, the Ottoman navy advanced to the Messina Strait, but due to adverse weather conditions, they gave up going to the Naples and Sicily coasts. Returning to Avlonia, Piali Pasha stopped by Nafpaktos and Pylos and fortified the Pylos castle, leaving Occhiali in charge of it with a few galleys. The fleet returned to Istanbul on November 1, 1573.\nWith this expedition, the Ottoman navy showed that it had left behind the negative effects of the Lepanto defeat of two years earlier. Indeed; In the expedition of 1572, the fleet that did not sail south of Morea, appeared in Italy waters again in 1573, and in 1574, it sailed further west and conquered Tunisia.\nAftermath\nTaking advantage of the presence of the Ottoman navy on the coast of Apulia The Spanish navy under the command of John of Austria targeted the city of Tunis, which had been annexed to the Ottoman lands in 1569, and captured it on October 10, 1573.\nThereupon, the main goal of the Ottoman navy in the following campaign season (1574) was Liberation of Tunis from occupation.\nThe Ottoman Empire, which essentially ended the war with Venice with the peace treaty signed on March 15, 1573, had the opportunity to focus its forces on the Spanish Empire by taking advantage of the de facto dissolution of the Holy League formed in 1571.\nReferences"
