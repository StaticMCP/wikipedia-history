The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1986\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held the national final, A Song for Europe 1986, on 2 April 1986 at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London, hosted by Terry Wogan. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all but the winning song, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. The rule introduced for 1984 prohibiting groups or 'made for Eurovision' acts from participating was rescinded. In total, 335 entries where received, and reduced tot the final eight by a variety of music industry experts.\nLead singer of the group 'Palace' was Michael Palace, previously known as Dan Duskey; Duskey had represented  as one of The Duskeys and thus became the first Eurovision artist to have taken part in the contest for another country before attempting to represent the UK. The group Jump were led by Peter Beckett and David Ian; Beckett had taken part in ' and Ian had been a member of the group First Division in ', as David Lane. Jump's song was written by perennial UK songwriter Paul Curtis, his 19th UK finalist.\nThe show was opened by 1985's Eurovision winners, Bobbysocks, who sang \"Let It Swing\", the English-language version of their winning song \"La det swinge\". They were joined onstage by a large number of backing dancers, choreographed by Anthony van Laast. The duo were also going to sing their brand new single \"Waiting for the Morning\", but the producers decided to cancel that part of the plan and instead, the two members of the group were interviewed by Terry Wogan during the interval.\nThe result was determined by 11 regional juries located in Leeds, Newcastle, Plymouth, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow, London, Norwich and Bristol. Each jury region awarded 15, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5 points to the songs. The scoreboard, due to a technical issue, was incorrectly adjusted during the broadcast and the final tallies shown on screen did not correspond with the scores announced on air.\nThe winning entry was \"Runner in the Night\", performed by the sextet Ryder, composed by Brian Wade, with lyrics written by Maureen Darbyshire.\nThe national final was broadcast on BBC1, with a simultaneous broadcast on BBC Radio 2 (with commentary by Ray Moore).
