      "text": "# Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards\n\nThe Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards were created in 1984 by the trustees of the Sidney Myer Fund to mark the 50th anniversary of the death of Sidney Myer and ran for 40 years up to and including 2023. The awards were created to commemorate Sidney Myer's life and his love for the arts. They were intended primarily to recognise and reward outstanding achievements in dance, drama, comedy, music, opera, circus and puppetry.\nIn their final iteration, there was one Individual Award (), one Group Award () and one Facilitator's Prize ().\nThe Sidney Myer Performing Arts Awards were announced and presented early each year for the preceding year. The awards were decided on a national basis and each nomination was considered by a judging committee. While past achievement was recognised, consideration was also given to the potential of an individual or group to continue their contribution to Australian society through the performing arts into the future.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!
