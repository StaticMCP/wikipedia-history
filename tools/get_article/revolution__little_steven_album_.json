His backing band, the Disciples of Soul, were gone in all but name (although former Disciple/Young Rascals drummer Dino Danelli did the album art), and the music was largely electronic with a rock-soul-funk sound.\nIn 2019, the album was remastered for release as part of Van Zandt's career-spanning box set Rock N Roll Rebel: The Early Work. The digital deluxe edition of the album was released on November 15, 2019, containing two bonus tracks.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and arranged by Little Steven.\n# \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" - 5:53\n# \"Revolution\" - 5:25\n# \"Education\" - 4:39\n# \"Balance\" - 5:16\n# \"Love and Forgiveness\" - 4:48\n# \"Newspeak\" - 5:21\n# \"Sexy\" - 4:03\n# \"Leonard Peltier\" - 3:45\n# \"Liberation Theology\" - 4:49\n# \"Discipline\" - 6:16\n2019 digital deluxe edition bonus tracks\n# \"Revolution (Naked City Mix)\" (UK 12\" single - 1989) - 9:46\n# \"Revolution (Naked City Mix Part 2 - Maceo's Thang)\" (UK 12\" single - 1989) - 5:44\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album liner notes.\n* Little Steven – vocals, guitar, drum programming\n* Mark Alexander – MIDI programming, keyboards, background vocals\n* Leslie Ming – drums, percussion, background vocals\n* Warren McRae – bass, background vocals\n* Craig Derry – background vocals\n* Will Downing – background vocals\n* Danny Madden – background vocals\n* Mark Ladford – background vocals\n* David Beal – percussion on \"Where Do We Go From Here?\"\n;Technical\n* Little Steven – producer\n* Mark Alexander – production assistance\n* Warren McRae – production assistance\n* David McNair – engineer, mixing\n* Tom Lord-Alge – mixing on \"Balance\" and \"Love and Forgiveness\"\n* Joe Perrera – assistant mixing engineer\n* Bob Ludwig – mastering\n* Dino Danelli – art director, designer, artist\n* Veronica Sim – photography\nCharts\nAlbum\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
