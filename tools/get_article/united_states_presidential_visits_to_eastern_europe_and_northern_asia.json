The first trip by an incumbent president to Eastern Europe was made by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945, to the Soviet Union, and was an offshoot of Allied diplomatic interactions during World War II. The first trip by an incumbent president to Northern Asia was made by Gerald Ford in 1974, also to the Soviet Union, and was an offshoot of U.S.–Soviet Détente during the Cold War. The first presidential visits to other Eastern European countries occurred during this era of easing geo-political tensions as well.\nAs of February 2023, 15 visits have been made to Russia (which is partially in Eastern Europe as well as the only country in Northern Asia), 16 to Poland, five to the Czech Republic, five to Romania, five to Ukraine, four to Hungary, two to Bulgaria, one to Belarus, and one to Slovakia. Additionally, six visits were made to the Soviet Union prior to its collapse. One visit was also made to Czechoslovakia prior to its dissolution. Moldova is the only Eastern European country which has not been visited by a sitting American president.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!Countries\n!Locations\n!Key events\n|-\n| nowrap|Franklin D.
