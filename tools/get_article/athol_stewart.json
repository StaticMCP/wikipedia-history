He finished his first season as the club's top try–scorer (12).\nStewart left Sydney in 1939 to play for Maitland United.\nIn 1940, Stewart returned to Newton and was again their top first–grade try scorer. He also represented New South Wales in his second interstate series, securing two tries in their 52–11 win over Queensland at the SCG.\nStewart continued with Newtown in 1941, missing only one first–grade match, and at the end of the season featured in their successful State Cup campaign. His offseason was marked by ill health after he contracted the mumps, which caused him to lose a stone and a half in body weight.\nDuring World War II, Stewart served in the AIF 3rd Battalion and was involved in the hostilities in New Guinea, where he received a gunshot wound to his right arm.\nStewart missed three seasons due to the war. He returned for one final season in 1945.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/athol-stewart/summary.html Athol Stewart] at Rugby League Project"
