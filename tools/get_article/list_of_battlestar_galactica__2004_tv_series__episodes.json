      "text": "# List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes\n\nBattlestar Galactica is an American military science fiction television series, and part of the Battlestar Galactica franchise. The show was developed by Ronald D. Moore as a re-imagining of the 1978 Battlestar Galactica television series created by Glen A. Larson. The series first aired as a three-hour miniseries (comprising four broadcast hours) in December 2003 on the Sci-Fi Channel. The television series debuted in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on October 18, 2004, and premiered in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel on January 14, 2005.\nThe story arc of Battlestar Galactica is set in a distant star system, where a civilization of humans live on a series of planets known as the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. In the past, the Colonies had been at war with a cybernetic race of their own creation, known as the Cylons. With the self-serving and venal help of a human named Gaius Baltar, the Cylons, some now in human form, launch a sudden sneak attack on the Colonies, laying waste to the planets and devastating their populations. Out of a population numbering in the billions, only approximately 50,000 humans survive, most of whom were aboard civilian spaceships that avoided destruction. Of all the Colonial Fleet, the eponymous battlestar Galactica appears to be the only military capital ship that survived the attack. Under the leadership of Colonial Fleet officer Commander William \"Bill\" Adama and President Laura Roslin, the Galactica and its crew take up the task of leading the small fugitive fleet of survivors into space in search of a fabled refuge known as Earth.\nSeries overview\n| end0        =\n| network0    = Sci-Fi Channel\n| color1       = #A90A0A\n| link1        = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes#Season 1 (2004–05)\n| episodes1    = 13\n| start1       =\n| end1         =\n| network1     = Sci-Fi Channel / Sky1\n| color2       = #105576\n| link2        = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes#Season 2 (2005–06)\n| episodes2    = 20\n| episodes2A    = hide\n| start2A       =\n| end2A         =\n| start2B       =\n| end2B         =\n| network2A     = Sci-Fi Channel\n| color3       = #39525A\n| link3        = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes#Season 3 (2006–07)\n| episodes3    = 20\n| start3       =\n| end3         =\n| color3S      = #3FC8FF\n| link3S       = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes#Razor (2007)\n| linkT3S      = Razor\n| start3S      =\n| color4       = #7DBAD9\n| link4        = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes#Season 4 (2008–09)\n| episodes4    = 21\n| episodes4A    = hide\n| start4A       =\n| end4A         =\n| start4B       =\n| end4B         =\n| end4         =\n| color4S      = #4B0082\n| link4S       = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes#The Plan (2009)\n| linkT4S      = The Plan\n| start4S      =\n}}\nEpisodes\nMiniseries (2003)\n| DirectedBy      = Michael Rymer\n| WrittenBy       = Ronald D.

The Cylons launch a surprise nuclear-attack on the Twelve Colonies of Kobol, ending a 40-year armistice between the Cylons and humans; most of the human population is wiped out, and the majority of the human fleet is destroyed due to malware implanted by the Cylons. Galactica survives, and its commander, William Adama, assumes command of the human fleet. Roslin aboard a Colonial passenger ship survives as well, and is sworn in as the President of the Twelve Colonies after most of the government have been killed. Roslin orders to start rescuing civilian ships, while Adama, on the contrary, orders all ships to regroup at Ragnar Station for counterattack-preparations. A shuttle from Galactica, crewed by Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii and Karl \"Helo\" Agathon, lands briefly on the human capital-world of Caprica after escaping the fight with the Cylons; Helo switches places with Gaius Baltar, a renowned human scientist who unknowingly helped the Cylons gain access into the human military-computers; Boomer, Baltar and a few more survivors leave Caprica, while Helo is left behind. As the Cylons attack Colonial One, the ship appears to be destroyed by a nuclear explosion.\n| LineColor       = 990033\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = Adama orders Galactica to jump to Ragnar Station using faster-than-light (FTL) technology; aboard, they find a man named Leoben, who is revealed to be a humanoid Cylon model, and is killed by Adama. Colonial One is revealed to be intact; Adama's son Lee had used EMP generators on board to simulate the ship's destruction and engineer its escape from the Cylons. Boomer and Baltar reach Colonial One. The Cylons discover Roslin's grown fleet of civilian ships; she orders all FTL-equipped ships to jump to Ragnar, abandoning the rest. Roslin's fleet joins Galactica. Baltar is haunted by a virtual image of the female humanoid Cylon model, \"Number Six.\" He fabricates evidence against another civilian, Aaron Doral, thinking he is another Cylon model; Doral is arrested. Roslin convinces Adama to stop counterattack preparations, and instead focus on humanity's survival. Galactica and the civilian fleet leave the star system after the battle with the Cylons, leaving Doral on Ragnar. Adama promises the crew to take them to the scriptural planet known as \"Earth.\" Doral is confirmed to be a Cylon, as multiple copies of him, Six, and Leoben meet on Ragnar; another Cylon model is revealed to look exactly like Boomer.\n| LineColor       = 990033\n}}\n}}\nSeason 1 (2004–05)\nSeason 2 (2005–06)\nSeason 3 (2006–07)\nRazor (2007)\n| Viewers         = 1.72\n| ShortSummary    = A television film (in a TV and an extended version) and a series of seven flashback webisodes (1st, 2nd and 7th not included in the film itself). Chronologically, this fits into season 2 between the episodes \"The Captain's Hand\" and \"Downloaded\" while setting up season 4 (characters and events wise).\nThe film reveals the chronicles of the Battlestar Pegasus and its crew from the initial Cylon attack on the Twelve Colonies, up to its meeting with Galactica, while Apollo's new XO deals with the harsh reality of Admiral Cain's legacy.\n| LineColor       = 3FC8FF\n}}\n}}\nSeason 4 (2008–09)\nThe Plan (2009)\n| DirectedBy      = Edward James Olmos\n| WrittenBy       = Jane Espenson\n| OriginalAirDate =  (Blu-ray/DVD) (TV)\n| ShortSummary    = The film provides an alternate perspective on many events already known to the viewer. Chronologically, this takes place throughout seasons 1 and 2 only (and the miniseries), but contains plot revelations of the entire series.\nAs two John Cavil Cylons wait to be blown out of a Galactica airlock, they discuss their opposing opinions on the plan to annihilate humankind. They reflect on their own experiences with the humans since the attack on the Twelve Colonies, their roles in the orchestration of the Cylon agents onboard the Galactica, and efforts to sabotage the resistance effort on Caprica come to light.\n| LineColor       = 4B0082\n}}\n}}\nWebisodes (2006–09)\nofInstallments |episodes=\n| DirectedBy      = Wayne Rose\n| WrittenBy       = Bradley Thompson & David Weddle\n| Aux3            = 10\n| OriginalAirDate =  –\n| ShortSummary    = Ten mini episodes taking place between the season 2 finale and the season 3 premiere.\nThe Cylons' occupation of New Caprica results in the formation of a human resistance movement determined to undermine the Cylons' attempt to assimilate the remainder of humanity.\n| LineColor       = 303030\n}}\n| DirectedBy      = Wayne Rose & Félix Enríquez Alcalá\n| WrittenBy       = Michael Taylor\n| Aux3            = 7\n| OriginalAirDate =  –\n| ShortSummary    = Seven mini flashback episodes tied to the 2007 television film Razor.\nDuring the later stages of the First Cylon War, a young Lt.

During the chaos, the Raptor is separated from rest of the fleet and while waiting for a rescue, the passengers and crew mysteriously begin to die off one by one.\n| LineColor       = 303030\n}}\n}}\nHome media\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Product !! rowspan=\"2\"|Episodes !! colspan=\"3\" |DVD release date !! rowspan=\"2\"|Blu-ray Discrelease  date\n|-\n!
