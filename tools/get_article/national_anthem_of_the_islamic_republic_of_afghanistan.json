The lyrics were written by Abdul Bari Jahani, and the music was composed by German-Afghan composer . It was replaced by \"Dā də bātorāno kor\" after the Taliban takeover in 2021.\nHistory\nAfter the end of Taliban rule in 2001, a new national anthem was created for the \"New Afghanistan\", which, according to the 20th article of the new Afghan constitution, was to contain the names of the various ethnic groups of Afghanistan, and the formula \"Allāhu Akbar\" (\"God is the greatest\") had to be included. After a competition, \"Millī Surūd\" was declared the official national anthem in May 2006.\nAfter the Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021, it was replaced by \"This Is the Home of the Brave\". Due to the lack of international recognition of the Taliban government, the anthem is still used in sports setting such as the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in October–November, along with the flag of the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The Islamic Republic anthem and flag were also used in the 2022 CAFA U-19 Futsal Championship.\nLyrics\nAn abridged version of the anthem is often performed by military bands which omits the third and fourth stanzas for brevity (see audio sample), or the second and third stanzas for saving time to memorize all the country's ethnic groups. The Olympic Games uses a version of the anthem which includes all the stanzas.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rules=\"cols\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"\n!Pashto original\n!Pashto Romanization\n!Pashto IPA transcription\n!Dari translation\n!English translation\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|'Tis the land of Afghanistan,\n'Tis the pride of every Afghan.\n'Tis the land of peace and the sword,\n'Tis the cradle of its brave sons.\n'Tis the homeland of every tribe,\nOf the Baloch and the Uzbeks;\nOf Pashtuns, and of Hazaras;\nOf the Turkmens and of Tajiks.\nAmong them are Arabs, Gurjars,\nThe Pamiris, Nuristanis;\nThe Brahuis, the Qizilbash;\nAlso Aimaqs and Pashayis.\nLike the sun in the deep blue sky;\nForever shall this great land shine!\nIn the chest of Asia it lies;\nAs the heart shall it remain!\nWe shall follow the one God:\nWe all chant, \"God is the Greatest!\"\nWe all chant, \"God is the Greatest!\"\nWe all chant, \"God is the Greatest!\"\n|}\nSee also\n* List of former national anthems\n* National anthems of Afghanistan\n* Music of Afghanistan\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
