Relocating to Toronto to live with his estranged father Iskander (Dani Jazzar), a financially successful but emotionally rigid property developer, Nabil finds a new queer sense of belonging and alternative home when he meets Malibu (Alexandra Billings), a longtime transgender bar owner and drag performer in the Church and Wellesley gay village whose historic queer nightclub faces the imminent threat of demolition and displacement by Iskander's development firm. Grappling with the tensions between his blood family and emerging chosen family, Nabil joins forces with Malibu's grassroots campaign to save the life of her bar and in the process, he not only cultivates his unique drag queen persona, but integrates the loss of his mother by embodying her memory and resurrecting her presence through his art.\nThe cast also includes Kiriana Stanton, Selena Vyle and Thom Allison, as well as Ben Sanders, Darrin Baker, Matt Willis, Danielle Bourgon, Cru Levey \tCru Levey, Kendall Savage, Mostafa Shaker, Kaz Morgan, Khalid Karim, Minh Ly, Asil Moussa and Darren Stewart-Jones in supporting roles.\nProduction and distribution\nThe film entered production in Toronto in 2022, with shooting locations including Nathan Phillips Square, the Church and Wellesley village, and Cinespace Film Studios. In addition to appearing in the film, Billings was also an executive producer, alongside Sonya Di Rienzo and Aeschylus Poulos.\nThe film was screened at the Cannes Film Market in May 2023. It premiered at Reeling: The Chicago LGBTQ+ International Film Festival in September, before going into commercial release in February 2024.\nIt is slated to air on Crave in June 2024 for Pride Month.\nCritical response\nBarry Hertz of The Globe and Mail wrote that while the film had good intentions, it did not execute them as successfully as the contemporaneous drag-themed film Solo.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!
