First, though meant to imply an obelisk, it was constructed of local materials by a single individual. It was built during the Great Depression in the year 1934, long after most monuments to the American Civil War. Instead of the typical limestone and marble from which most monuments were made, the monument uses geodes from Tennessee, sedimentary/volcanic rocks in which crystals fill a largely hollow interior. The monument is 12&nbsp;feet high, with a base of five feet square.\nThe monument honors an unknown foot soldier from the 11th Louisiana Infantry, who died prior to the Battle of Munfordville. He was part of a tree-cutting detail. Ordered to rest, he lay down beside a tree. His loaded rifle accidentally discharged when it struck a tree branch; the bullet entered his head below his chin and killed him instantly. The soldier was buried with rocks marking his head and feet. Years later, a wire fence was placed around the grave.\nLocal tradition says that a man named Sam Lively built the monument, fearing otherwise the grave would become lost.\nThe monument is technically on private property, but a path through the evergreen trees allows visitors access. A Confederate Naval Jack flies beside the monument.\nThe Inscription says:\nUnknown Soldier C. S. A. was a member of Gen. Clay Anderson division 11th. Louisiana Killed Sept. 9, 1862 Erected 1934 by Sam Lively\nGallery\nFile:Unknown Confederate Horse Cave 2.jpg|Side view\nFile:Unknown Confederate Horse Cave 3.jpg|Inscription on marker\nFile:Unknown Confederate Horse Cave 4.jpg|Straight view\nReferences\nExternal links"
