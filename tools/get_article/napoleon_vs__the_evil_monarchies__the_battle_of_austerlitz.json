Evan Brooks reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \"BOA is a Napoleonic simulation of introductory/medium complexity. Its mechanics are dated (and it shows) and it lacks a Napoleonic panache. Given the current state-of-the-art, BOA is not \"art\"! However, for the true Napoleonic buff, BOA may be of some entertainment value.\"\nReviews\n*Rating in Computer Gaming World #107\nReferences"
