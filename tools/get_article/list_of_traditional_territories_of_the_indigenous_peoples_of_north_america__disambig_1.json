      "text": "# List of traditional territories of the Indigenous peoples of North America__disambig_1\n\nA traditional territory comprises all of the lands which an Indigenous nation ever claimed, not just the present-day reservation. This article is about the name for the traditional territory (the land or country) itself, rather than the name of the nation/tribe/people. The distinction between nation and land is like the French people versus the modern nation-state of France, the Saami people versus their land of Sápmi (sometimes rendered as \"Saamiland\"), or the Māori people versus their country: Aotearoa. For example, Mi'kma'ki is the traditional territory or country of the Mi'kmaw Nation.\nIn English, the land of an indigenous nation was historically, and sometimes still is, referred to as a \"country,\" such as \"(the) Micmac country\" (compare \"Country\" in an Australian context). Some Latinate forms exist in English such as \"Iroquoia\", \"Huronia\", \"Apachería\", and \"Comanchería\".\nList of traditional territories\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"background:white; text-align:left; font-size:95%; border-collapse:collapse; border:0 solid #aaa;\"\n|-\n! width=\"35%\" |Autonym(s) for the traditional territory\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:20%;\" |Conventional or historic English monikers for the traditional territory, with various attested spellings\n! style=\"width:14%;\" |The people affiliated with that territory\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Further information\n|- style=\"background:Darkgrey;\"\n|align=center|A AAA\n|A AAA\n|A AAA\n|A AAA\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |?

The \"co\" part of the word is a prefix that refers to \"people\". The \"ne\" part of the word carries a tone that causes this part of the word to mean \"of\". The \"stog\" part of the word means \"long ridge pole\" (this is the short form of the translation) and refers to geologic formations. The \"a\" part of the word depending on syllable length means \"country\" or \"nation\". Conestoga Language is a tonal language in which tone changes word meaning, vowel length changes word meaning, and tone and vowel length can work together to change word meaning. Also, the English spelling does not accurately reflect the pronunciation of the word, but the pronunciation of the word by non-Conestoga speakers in the Conestoga Homeland is fairly accurate.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |Anishinaabewaki, Anishinaabe Ahiki, Anishinaabe-aki, Anishinaabeg Akiing\n|valign=\"top\" |AAnishinaabe Country, Anishinaabe country, the Anishinaabe Aki\n|valign=\"top\" |AAnishinaabe are a supra-national identity which encompasses the three nations of the Three Fires Confederacy: the Ojibwe, the Odawa, and the Potawatomi, plus the culturally related Algonquin, Mississauga, and Nipissing.\nBecause the name \"Anishinaabe\" also serves as a synonym for \"Ojibwe\" or \"Odawa\" (or the other specific nations) and also means \"Indian\", the various forms of \"Anishinaabe Aki\" can also mean \"Ojibwe country\", \"Odawa country\" (and so forth), and also \"Indian Country\" in general.

The four Canadian Inuit regions are the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (Northwest Territories and Northern Yukon), Nunavut (\"Our Land\"), Nunavik (\"Great Land\", Northern Quebec), and Nunatsiavut (\"Our Beautiful Land\", Northern Labrador). There is also NunatuKavut (\"Our Ancient Land\"), the traditional territory of the NunatuKavummuit of southern Labrador. There are seven Alaskan Native Corporations (see ANC link for map) which are predominantly Inuit in composition: Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, NANA Regional Corporation, Bering Straits Native Corporation, Calista Corporation, Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Koniag, Inc., and Chugach Alaska Corporation.\nThe existing Inuit-affiliated political divisions and regional corporations only partially reflect the traditional cultural and linguistic diversity of the Inuitic peoples. For example, the boundaries of the Danish political entity Kalaallit Nunaat are bigger than the traditional territory of the Kalaallit proper (West Greenland Inuit). There are two other Inuitic peoples in Greenland: the Tunumiit (East Greenland Inuit), who live in Tunu and the Inughuit (Polar Eskimos) of North Greenland.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |Īthiniwaskiy (ᐁᖨᓂᐗᐢᑭᐩ) (\"Land of the human beings\")\n|valign=\"top\" |Rocky Cree territory\n|valign=\"top\" |Rocky Cree\nAlso called Asinikaw Īthiniwak, Rocky Cree are often grouped alongside Woodland Cree, though many see them as a distinct group of Cree.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |Jiwére Máyan, Wadodana Máyan (\"Land of the Otoes\")\n|valign=\"top\" |AOtoe country, the Otoe country, the country of the Otoe Indians\n|valign=\"top\" |AJíwere (Otoe) Nation\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |Ǥáuidàumgya\n|valign=\"top\" |AKiowa country, the Kiowa country, the Kiowa homeland\n|valign=\"top\" |AKa'igwu (Kiowa) Nation\nIn the Skiri Pawnee language: Kaˀiwaru (\"among the Kiowa; in Kiowa country\").\n|-\n|valign=\"top\" |Kanién:ke, Kanienkeh, Kanyę̂·ke (\"Land of Flint\"), Ganeagaonoga, Gä-neă-ga-o-noˊ-ga\n|valign=\"top\" |AMohawk country, the Mohawk country, Mohawk territory, the Mohawk homeland, the Mohawk homelands, the Mohawk Territory\n|valign=\"top\" |AKanienʼkehá꞉ka (Mohawk) Nation\nIn the Huron and French languages of the Jesuit mission era: Annien̈ę, Agné, Agne, Agnée, Agnié, Agniée, Agniés, Agniez (\"the French appellation of Mohawks and their country.\") In the Maliseet language: Meqewihkuk (\"where Mohawks live; in, to Mohawk territory\").

The whole nations are what John Beaucage, Grand Council Chief of the Anishinabek Nation, refers to as \"true nations\" in contrast with the fragmented \"First Nations\":\n}}\nOr what the Government of Quebec calls \"the 11 aboriginal nations of Québec\" in contrast with their component \"55 aboriginal communities\".\nAnd so the criteria for inclusion is not the same as what are named \"Indian tribes\" by the U.S. Federal Register and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), or what are called \"First Nations\" by the Canadian government and Assembly of First Nations (AFN). It would be interesting to compile the names for the \"band territories\" of the 633 fragmented First Nations of the AFN, or the names of the \"reservation territories\" of the 632 fragmented Indian Nations of the NCAI, but that is beyond the scope of this article, except as side notes in the \"further information\" column.\nSo this list does not include the names for reservations or reserves, but only of the entire national homeland (or the homeland of a confederated identity such as the Haudenosaunee Confederacy or Colville tribes). For example, this list wouldn't give the Cherokee name for the Qualla Boundary reservation, but only the name for \"the Cherokee country\" as a whole. Ideally a single name could conceivably encompass not only the Contact-era ancestral territory, but also any area which at some time or another was conceived to be part of the national domain, such as post-Removal lands.\n}}\nThe names do not have to be from olden days. The names could be recently coined and still be included in this list.\nCompiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as it requires some discernment as to what are the \"whole nations\" — the \"true nations\" in Beaucage's words.\nNotes\nReferences"
