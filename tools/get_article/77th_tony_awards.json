The musical adaptation of The Outsiders, which won Best Musical, garnered 4 awards in total, as did the Best Revival of a Musical recipient Merrily We Roll Along; the closest to those three shows - in terms of awards received - was Appropriate, which garnered three, including Best Revival of a Play.\nFor the first time in the history of the ceremony, all eight winners in the performance categories were receiving the award for the first time, with six of them winning for their first career nomination.\nCeremony information\nPluto TV streamed the pre-ceremony broadcast The Tony Awards: Act One, hosted by Julianne Hough and Utkarsh Ambudkar.\nThe nominees for the 77th Tony Awards were announced on April 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET by Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Renée Elise Goldsberry.\nEligibility\nThe Tony Awards eligibility dates for the 2023-2024 Broadway season were April 28, 2023, through April 25, 2024.

Eventually the decision was reversed after public outcry, an [https://www.instagram.com/p/C8Krljdvqso/ open letter] from the Editor-in-Chief of Theatrely, and multiple news articles called out the decision.\nReception\nReviews\nThe night's performances received mixed reviews. Alicia Keys's live performance of \"Empire State of Mind\", with the cast of ''Hell's Kitchen'' onstage and Jay-Z joining remotely, was noted as a highlight by the live audience and by critics. The opening number featuring Ariana DeBose, on the other hand, drew criticism. The awards were celebrated for more strongly featuring straight plays than in past years, with clips and interviews preceding awards in play categories.\nRatings\nThe ceremony drew 3.5 million viewers on CBS, marking a 14% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.\nAccolades\nThe broadcast was nominated for a 2025 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Variety or Talk Show Episode.\nIn Memoriam\nSinger and Actor Nicole Scherzinger performed What I Did for Love\nFrom The Musical A Chorus Line.\n*Hinton Battle\n*Alan Arkin\n*Glynis Johns\n*Arthur Rubin\n*Christopher Durang\n*Bill Kenwright\n*Michael McGrath\n*Carrie Robbins\n*Clifton Oliver\n*Tanya Berezin\n*Edgar Lansbury\n*Mattew Serino\n*Ellen Holly\n*Robert Nolan\n*Frances Sternhagen\n*Chris Peluso\n*Franne Lee\n*Inga Swenson\n*Ira Bernstein\n*Richard M.
