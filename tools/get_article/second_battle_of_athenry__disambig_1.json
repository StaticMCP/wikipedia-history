Martyn believes the royal army to have been as much as or more than a thousand, while that of Athenry was probably several hundred less. The list of deceased participants on the Irish side alone indicates that exceptionally high numbers were involved.\nOutcome\nUnlike the First Battle of Athenry in 1249, no surviving account gives the date of the battle itself. Even the site of the battle itself is uncertain.\nRickard de Bermingham and William Liath de Burgh led an Anglo-Irish force to victory. John Clyn states that\n\"According to common report a sum of five .... thousand in all [were killed] the number decapitated was one thousand five hundred.\"\nThe battle was a devastating defeat for the Connacht Gaels, who were allied with the Scotsman Edward Bruce. Among those killed were kings Fedlim Ó Conchobair and Tadhg Ó Cellaigh King of Uí Maine.\nIn 2016, Martyn wrote that:\nThough various Uí Chonchobair were Rí Connacht till 1477, prospective recovery of the overkingdom died with Fedlimid at Athenry. The real beneficiaries were among the ostensible losers, the kings of Tuadhmhumha, Uí Maine, and Uí Fhiachrach Muaidhe. Within decades each was successfully reconstituted as independent kingdoms, existing as such for the next two hundred and fifty years. Descendants of their leading lineages survive as titled aristocracy today.\nThe heads of King Fedlimid of Connacht and King Tadhg of Uí Maine were mounted over the town's main gate. This image remains the coat of arms of Athenry today.\nAnnalistic accounts\nThe Annals of Ulster\nThe Annals of Ulster give the following account (U1313, recte 1316):\nThe Annals of Loch Cé\nAfter winning the battle of Tóchar-móna-Coinnedha (Templetogher, County Galway), on 25 January,\nSee also\n*History of Ireland\n*Irish battles\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.theirishstory.com/2013/02/25/7347/#.WYypqdKGOig\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U04hJWwZfUc"
