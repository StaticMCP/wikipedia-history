It is an integral part of the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge Complex, although the refuge is normally unstaffed and has few visitor improvements. One reservoir is stocked with rainbow trout, although the lake is sometimes empty.  When the lakes and reservoirs are fully filled, the refuge provides excellent habitat for migratory bird species. The region is surrounded by sagebrush plains and Ponderosa pine groves that flourish in the region solely due to its acid-shale soils. Along with over 100 bird species, regular inhabitants include Sage Grouse, pronghorn and mule deer.\n]]\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.fws.gov/refuge/War_Horse/ War Horse National Wildlife Refuge]"
