This is the largest mass gap seen in a gravitational-wave source to-date.\n2020s\n.]]\n* 2020 – Principle of equivalence tested for individual atoms using atomic interferometry to ~10−12.\n* 2020 – ESO observes Schwarzschild precession of the star S2 about Sagittarius A*.\n* 2021 – Jun Ye and his team measure gravitational redshift with an accuracy of 7.6 × 10−21 using an ultracold cloud of 100,000 strontium atoms in an optical lattice.\n* 2021 – EHT measures the polarization of the ring of M87*, and other properties of the magnetic field in its vicinity.\n* 2021 – EHT releases an image of Sagittarius A*, measures its shadow, and shows that it is accurately described by the Kerr metric.\n* 2022 – Chris Overstreet and his team observe the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect using an experimental design from 2012.\n* 2022 – James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) publishes its first image, a deep-field photograph of the SMACS 0723 galaxy cluster.\n* 2022 – Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory detects GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst recorded.\n* 2022 – JWST identifies several candidate high-redshift objects, corresponding to just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.\n* 2023 – James Nightingale and colleagues detect Abell 1201, an ultramassive black hole (33 billion solar masses), using strong gravitational lensing.\n* 2023 – Matteo Bachetti and colleagues confirm that neutron star M82 X-2 is violating the Eddington limit, making it an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX).\n* 2023 – Team led by Dong Sheng and Zheng-Tian Lu found a null result for the coupling between quantum spin and gravity to 10−9.\n* 2023 – The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (Australia), and the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array report detection of a gravitational-wave background.\n* 2023 – Geraint F. Lewis and Brendon Brewer present evidence of cosmological time dilation in quasars.\n* 2023 – CERN demonstrates by experiment that antimatter obeys the weak principle of equivalence, meaning it does not have antigravitational properties.\n* 2024 – The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration imposes stringent limits on violations of Lorentz invariance proposed in certain theories of quantum gravity using GRB 221009A.\n* 2024 – Álvaro Álvarez-Domínguez, Luis J. Garay, Eduardo Martín-Martínez, and José Polo-Gómez show that quantum electrodynamics prevents a kugelblitz from forming.\n* 2025 – LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA collaboration verifies Hawking's area theorem for two merging black holes with GW250114.\nSee also\n* Timeline of black hole physics\n* Timeline of special relativity and the speed of light\n* List of contributors to general relativity\n* List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www2.rikkyo.ac.jp/web/harada/nenpyo-en.html Timeline of relativity and gravitation] (Tomohiro Harada, Department of Physics, Rikkyo University)\n*[https://tiyezerk.blogspot.com/2008/09/timeline-of-general-relativity-and.html Timeline of General Relativity and Cosmology from 1905]\n*[https://journals.aps.org/general-relativity-centennial 2015–General Relativity's Centennial].
