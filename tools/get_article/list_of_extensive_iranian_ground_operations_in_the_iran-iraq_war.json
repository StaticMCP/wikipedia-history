In this article, extensive operations are classified into 3 categories, northern front, middle front and southern front, based on the operational front. The set of information introduced for each operation includes: the name of the operation, the date of the start and end of the operation, the area of the operation, the code of the operation, the forces operating in each operation and a summary of the most important achievements in each operation.\nThe eight-year Iran-Iraq war commenced on September 22, 1980, though signs of Saddam Hussein’s intent to invade Iran had been apparent for several months prior. Initial clashes with Iraq erupted in the west on September 4, 1980, while minor skirmishes along the southern border began on September 13. The following day, September 14, marked the first martyr of the war in the south, a soldier from the Omidiyeh Corps. In response to this aggression, Iran’s courageous forces mobilized to defend their homeland, conducting numerous operations across land, air, and sea with exceptional dedication. Operation Kaman 99, also known as Operation Shadow of Alborz, was a major Iranian air assault launched on the war’s first day and is regarded as the largest Air Force military operation. This mission involved 200 Iranian aircraft, 140 of which penetrated Iraqi airspace to strike military installations, airfields, and hangars, including Kirkuk, Rashid, Ali, and Al-Taqaddum Air Bases, as well as targets in Mosul, Nasiriyah, Shuaibiyah, Kut, Basra, Umm Qasr, Al-Muthanna, and Baghdad International Airport. The remaining 60 planes provided essential support during the operation. Given the strategic and economic significance of the Al-Bakr and Al-Amaya oil platforms for the Ba’athist regime, Iran’s Navy targeted these installations from the outset. In November 1980, through two naval operations—“Ashkan” and “Shahid Safari”—Iran successfully destroyed these key oil terminals, thereby crippling the enemy’s oil export capabilities and inflicting economic hardship.\nSouthern front\n{|class=wikitable style=margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;\n!Name of the operation\n!Start date\n!End date\n!Battle zone\n!Operation code\n!Operating forces\n!Operation results\n|-\n|Operation Dezful\n|October 15, 1980\n|October 20, 1980\n|Andimeshk, Karkheh river, west of Naderi bridge, Qahveh Kaneh three-way\n| -\n|Army\n|The Iranian Army aimed to halt Iraq’s advance but was repelled by a flank counterattack.
