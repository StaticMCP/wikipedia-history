The dates of death listed are from the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 to the surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, when the United States was officially involved in World War II. Included are generals and admirals who were killed by friendly or hostile fire, suicide, or accidents (usually airplane crashes). General and flag officers who died of illness or natural causes are not included. The rank listed was at the time of their death.\nIn 1954, the United States Congress passed Public Law 83-508, which promoted lieutenant generals who had commanded an army or Army Ground Forces during World War II to the rank of general. When it took effect on 19 July 1954, Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. and Lesley J. McNair were posthumously promoted. One officer was posthumously promoted to general officer rank during the war: Colonel William O. Darby, whose nomination for promotion to the rank of brigadier general had already been approved by Congress and submitted to President Harry S. Truman for approval at the time of his death. On the other hand, Douglas B. Netherwood was promoted to brigadier general in October 1940, but reverted to the rank of colonel on 25 December 1941. He died in an air crash on 19 August 1943.\nLieutenant generals\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"|Image\n!style=\"width: 15%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |Branch\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |Cause of death\n!style=\"width: 20%\" |Location\n!style=\"width: 25%\" |Commands\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |References\n|-\n|\n| Frank Maxwell Andrews\n| United States Army Air Forces\n| 3 May 1943\n| Airplane crash (accident)\n| Mount Fagradalsfjall, Iceland\n| Commanding General, European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA)\n|\n|-\n|\n| Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr.\n| United States Army\n| 18 June 1945\n| Hostile fire (artillery)\n| Okinawa, Japan\n| Commanding General, Tenth United States Army\nPosthumously promoted to general in 1954\n|\n|-\n|\n| Millard Harmon\n| United States Army Air Forces\n| 26 February 1945\n| Airplane crash (accident)\n| Pacific Ocean near the Marshall Islands\n| Commanding General, Task Force 93 (Strategic Air Force, Pacific Ocean Areas)\nCommanding General, U.S. Army Air Forces, Pacific Ocean Areas (AAFPOA)\n|\n|-\n|\n| Lesley James McNair\n| United States Army\n| 25 July 1944\n| Friendly fire (airstrike)\n| Saint-Lô, Normandy, France\n| Commanding General, Army Ground Forces\nCommanding General, First United States Army Group (fictitious/paper command)\nPosthumously promoted to general in 1954\n|\n|}\nMajor generals\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"|Image\n!style=\"width: 15%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |Branch\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |Cause of death\n!style=\"width: 20%\" |Location\n!style=\"width: 25%\" |Commands\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |References\n|-\n|\n| Charles D.

The Philippine Army was created in 1935 to prepare the Philippines to become independent in 1946 with its own independent military. Many U.S. military officers became officers in the new Philippine Army, the most famous amongst them being Field Marshal of the Philippine Army Douglas MacArthur. Because the Philippines was a part of the United States and the Philippine Army was, on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's orders, part of the United States Army Forces in the Far East and later part of the U.S. military in the South West Pacific Area, four Philippine Army general officers (all of whom held the rank of brigadier general) who were killed during World War II are listed here. Two Filipino graduates of West Point, Vicente Lim and Fidel Segundo, were killed in action during World War II while serving as generals for the Philippines and the United States. All served in the United States Army during their careers before being promoted to brigadier general in the Philippine Army.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"|Image\n!style=\"width: 15%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |Branch\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |Cause of death\n!style=\"width: 20%\" |Location\n!style=\"width: 25%\" |Commands\n!style=\"width: 10%\" |References\n|-\n|\n| Simeon de Jesus\n| Philippine Army\n| 31 December 1944\n| Executed by Japanese forces\n| Manila, Philippines\n| Chief of Intelligence (G-2), Military Intelligence Service, U.S. Army Forces in the Far East\n|\n|-\n|\n| Guy Fort\n| Philippine Army\n| 11 November 1942\n| Executed by Japanese forces\n| Marawi, Mindanao, Philippines\n| Commanding General, 81st Infantry Division (Philippines), U.S. Army Forces in the Far East\n|\n|-\n|\n| Vicente Lim\n| Philippine Army\n| 31 December 1944\n| Executed by Japanese forces\n| Manila, Philippines\n| Commanding General, 41st Infantry Division (Philippines), U.S. Army Forces in the Far East\n|\n|-\n|\n| Fidel Segundo\n| Philippine Army\n| 6 January 1945\n| Executed by Japanese forces\n| Manila, Philippines\n| Commanding General, 1st Regular Division (Philippines), U.S. Army Forces in the Far East\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
