Their objective was to destroy the Russian-Cossack army under Vasyl Sheremetev and Tymofy Tzciura, before they joined forces with the troops of Yurii Khmelnytsky.\nBackground\nAfter the lost clashes at Lyubar, the Russian-Cossack troops were forced to retreat towards Chudnov. On the morning of 26 September, they set off from the fortified camp in a tabor formation. Polish forces quickly organised a pursuit, catching up with the enemy's artillery in the Kutyszcze wilderness, a few kilometres east of Lubar.\nBattle\nThe ariergarde of the Russian-Cossack army consisted of two regiments of raiding cavalry (600-700 soldiers) and a Cossack infantry regiment (about 1,000 soldiers). However, according to Radosław Sikora, it was 3,500 people. This formation was struck by two hussar banners Wilczkowski's and Wyżycki's supported by dragoons. The hussar charge was conducted according to the principles of the later ''Hetman's Order'' slowly approaching the enemy, withstanding fire and striking violently with lances. Despite the shelling of the Russian raiders, the losses of the hussars were minimal. The strike broke the enemy's cavalry formation, which threw itself into retreat, also disorganising the Cossack infantry. The Poles continued the attack, capturing three banners and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Eventually, some of the Cossacks took refuge in a nearby forest, where they organised an effective defence.\nAftermath\nThe Battle of Kutyszcze did not determine the outcome of the campaign, but it weakened the morale of the Russian-Cossack army and delayed its march towards Cudnow. The loss of the ariergarde, the chaos in the ranks and the growing fear of the Polish hussars influenced further hostilities. This clash is considered an example of the effective use of Polish cavalry, whose actions supported the overall success of the Crown troops in the Chudnov campaign.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
