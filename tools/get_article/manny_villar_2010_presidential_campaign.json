However, due to the death of former president Cory Aquino, the surveys started to favor her son Senator Noynoy Aquino. At first, they had a tight race, with the popularity of Manny Villar's jingle Naging Mahirap (or Nakaligo ka na ba sa Dagat ng Basura) prompting the creation of internet and Facebook memes about it online. He also used the slogan of Tapusin ang Kahirapan (Tagalog for \"End the poverty\").\nControversies\n\"Villaroyo\"\nIn the start of campaign for 2010, rumors speculated that Villar is a 'secret candidate' of President Arroyo, as Arroyo have -53 trust rating, thus Defense Secretary Gilbert Tedoro, the presidential nominee of then-merged Lakas Kampi have low ratings in survey, thus earning a 'Villaroyo' title, with combining the surname of Villar and Arroyo. Villar denied the accusation and his rating plummeted with now Joseph Estrada placed second, surpassing him.\nC5 road issue\nAlso, the reopening of issue of C-5 project also affected his survey ratings, with Satur Ocampo, one of the members of his senate said that he should face senate hearings about the issue.\nControversy over dominant-minority status\nIn the 2010 general election, the Nacionalista and the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC) formed an alliance after it was approved by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) on April 12, 2010. Villar choose Senator Loren Legarda who is a member of the NPC as running mate. It became the dominant minority party after a resolution passed by the COMELEC. On April 21, 2010, it was blocked by the Supreme Court after a suit filed by the rival Liberal Party. On May 6, 2010, the Supreme Court nullified the merger and therefore giving the Liberal Party to be the dominant minority party. It was based on a resolution by the COMELEC giving political parties to be accredited by August 17, 2009.\nThe coalition was made to help the Nacionalista Party to help boost the presidential campaign of Senator Villar and have a chance to be the dominant minority party by the COMELEC which give the rights to poll watchers during the canvassing of votes. However, it is being challenged by the Liberal Party calls the said alliance a bogus alliance and they are seeking the same party status by the COMELEC. Several local races are also being challenged from both parties, therefore causing confusion in those races.\n* Isko Moreno, Actor and councilor of Manila's 1st district councilor (1998–2007), Vice Mayor of Manila (2007–2016)\n;Celebrities\n* Sarah Geronimo, Singer and actress\n* Willie Revillame, TV host and former comedian\n* Manny Pacquiao, boxer and candidate for congressman\n* Dolphy Quizon, Comedian\n;Organizations\n*Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino\n*Magdalo\n}}\nResult\nVillar eventually lost to another senator Noynoy Aquino while Legarda lost to Makati mayor Jejomar Binay.
