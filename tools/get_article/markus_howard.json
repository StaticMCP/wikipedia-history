Howard explained the reason why he wears number 0 by saying, \"First and foremost, I'm a Christian before anything else. I'm a son [of God], so I want to be sure that my number meant something and it represented something. It truly represents that without my relationship with Christ, I feel like I am not the person that I'm meant to be.\" In 2018, Howard started a Fellowship of Christian Athletes club at Marquette.\nMother is Noemi Santana Howard\nFather is Clarence \"Chuck\" Howard\nSee also\n*List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season scoring leaders\n*List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season 3-point field goal leaders\n*List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career scoring leaders\n*List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career 3-point scoring leaders\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://gomarquette.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/markus-howard/4651 Marquette Golden Eagles bio]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160611100634/http://www.usab.com/basketball/players/mens/h/howard-markus-1.aspx USA Basketball bio]\n}}"
