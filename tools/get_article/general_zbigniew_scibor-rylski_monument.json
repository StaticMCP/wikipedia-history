It is dedicated to Zbigniew Ścibor-Rylski, officer of the Polish Armed Forces, who fought in the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. It was designed by Marcin Nowicki and unveiled on 2 August 2019.\nHistory\nThe monument was proposed and founded by the Warsaw Insurgents Association and the Heroes of the Warsaw Uprising Remembrance Foundation. It was made by sculptor Marcin Nowicki and unveiled on 2 August 2019, a day before the first anniversary of Ścibor-Rylski's death.\nCharacteristics\nThe monument is dedicated to general Zbigniew Ścibor-Rylski (1917–2018), an officer of the Polish Armed Forces, who fought in the Warsaw Uprising during the World War II. It is placed in the Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły Park. The location was chosen because the Battalion Czata 49, in which Ścibor-Rylski was a company commander, fought there in 1944.\nThe monument consists of a bust of Ścibor-Rylski in a military uniform, placed on a pedestal. It bears an illustration of the cross of the Virtuti Militari order, and an inscription as transcribed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Polish inscription\n!English translation\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|GenerałZbigniew Ścibor-Rylski„Motyl”Bohater Powstania Warszawskiego\n|GeneralZbigniew Ścibor-Rylski\"Motyl\"Hero of the Warsaw Uprising\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
