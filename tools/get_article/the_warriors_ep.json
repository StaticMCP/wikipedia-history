It was released on November 17, 1998, as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records. The EP contains a message from lead singer Sonny Sandoval thanking the 'warriors', P.O.D.'s following of fans, for supporting them throughout the years before signing with Atlantic Records. Though produced by Atlantic Records, the album was actually released by Tooth & Nail Records. The entire EP is made to sound like the songs are being played through a phonograph, being mixed with a faux vinyl crackling throughout each song.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the EP's liner notes.\nP.O.D.\n* Sonny Sandoval – vocals\n* Marcos Curiel – lead guitar\n* Traa Daniels – bass guitar\n* Wuv Bernardo – drums\nAdditional musician\n* Sharon Whyte – accordion\nProduction\n* P.O.D. – producer\n* Steve Rusell – engineer, mixing at Golden Track Studios (San Diego, California)\n* Gavin Lurssen – mastering at The Mastering Lab (Hollywood, California)\nAdditional personnel\n* Suzy Hutchinson – CD layout\n* Matt Wingall – band photos\nNotes\n1.
