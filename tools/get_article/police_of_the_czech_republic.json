It was established on 15 July 1991 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic. The agency is tasked with protecting citizens, property and public order and as of 2015, there were around 40,500 employees. Czech state police cooperates with municipal police departments, which are present in some municipalities.\n, in 2019.]]\nHistory\nThe Police of the Czech Republic took over land management after the communist SNB in the Czech Republic with the exception of military police (provosts) who are part of the army. Members were recruited from the former communist SNB (National Security Corps), after passing a vetting \"democratic\" commission established after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 to eliminate from the police force communist ideologues and agents of the secret police. A similar procedure was also undertaken in the then-Slovak Republic. Some police officers were employed by a small federal police force, whose mandate expired on 31 December 1992.\nJurisdiction and organisation\n|alt=Six mounted police officers at police day in Sosnová]]\nThe Police of the Czech Republic has general jurisdiction in the investigation of misdemeanors and crimes. Its proceedings are overseen by an independent prosecutor, who can bring charges in criminal matters. It does not have jurisdiction in fields falling within the competence of other specialized bodies, such as the Customs service, military police, judicial guard or the Secret service. PČR is the main investigative body of the Ministry of the Interior. It should not be confused with the municipal police, which may be established by a municipality and which supervises public order and road safety; municipal police also have jurisdiction only over misdemeanours, and in criminal investigations may serve only in a supportive role for the state police.\nThe Police of the Czech Republic is responsible for search and rescue operations and on this behalf cooperates with Mountain Rescue Service of the Czech Republic that is highly professional rescue agency.\nSome crimes (such as terrorism) are being solved in co-operation with intelligence agencies such as BIS or ÚZSI.\nOn-duty officers are obliged to carry service weapons depending on the nature of their work (administrative vs. field work) or by their superior executive officer ordinance.\nRegardless of being assigned to nationwide or regional units all police officers while on or off-duty have the right (and obligation) to act if the crime or serious offense is happening and life, health or property may be in imminent danger. Civilian employees of police are obliged to act only while on-duty. Generally, police officers are not allowed to carry service weapons while off-duty if not approved by regional or unit police chief, which is on condition that their life may be in serious immediate danger. If a police officer still wants to carry a weapon off-duty, he/she has to use their personal handgun like any other armed citizen. Off-duty officers can use their personal weapon when acting as a police officer (which makes him on-duty).\nOrganisation\n* Police President of the Czech Republic\n** Office of the Police President\n** First Deputy for External Service (uniformed)\n*** Protection Service\n*** Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service\n*** Aviation Service\n*** Police Education and Service Training Unit\n*** Directorate of Alien and Border Police Service\n*** Directorate of Public Order Police Service\n*** Directorate of Traffic Police Service\n*** Directorate of Weapons and Security Material Service\n** Deputy for Criminal Police and Investigation Service\n*** Bureau of Criminal Police and Investigation Service\n*** National Headquarters Against Organized Crime of the CPIS (NCOZ)\n*** National Counterterrorism, Extremism, and Cybercrime Agency of the CPIS (NCTEKK)\n*** National Drug Headquarters of the CPIS (NPC)\n*** Unit for Special Operations of the CPIS (USČ)\n*** Unit for Intelligence Gathering of the CPIS (UZČ)\n*** Rapid Response Unit (URNA)\n*** Office of Documentation and Investigation of Crime of Communism of the CPIS\n** Deputy for Economics\n*** Logistics Support Administration\n** Directorate of Administration and Service Support\n** Regional Police Directorates\n*** Capital City Prague\n*** Central Bohemian Region\n*** South Bohemian Region\n*** Plzeň Region\n*** Karlovy Vary Region\n*** Ústí nad Labem Region\n*** Liberec Region\n*** Hradec Králové Region\n*** Pardubice Region\n*** South Moravian Region\n*** Vysočina Region\n*** Zlín Region\n*** Moravian-Silesian Region\n*** Olomouc Region\nNationwide jurisdiction\n* Institute of Criminalistics Prague\n* Aviation Service\n* National Headquarters Against Organized Crime of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service - created in August 2016 by joining two nationwide operating units of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service:\n** Unit for Organized Crime\n** Unit for Corruption and Financial Criminality\n* National Drug Headquarters of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service\n* Unit for Special Operations of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service - cover IDs, undercover cops, fake money transfers, short-term protection of important crime witnesses (support unit, no investigation)\n* Unit for Intelligence Gathering of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service - wiretapping, personal surveillance, etc. (support unit, no investigation)\n* Office of Documentation and Investigation of Crime of Communism of the Criminal Police and Investigation Service\n* Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service\n* Directorate of Alien and Border Police Service\n* Unit for Protection of the President of the Czech Republic\n* Unit for Protection of constitutional office holders\n* Police Education and Service Training Unit\n* Rapid Response Unit\nRegional jurisdiction\nThere are 14 regional headquarters, with jurisdictions covering the regions of the Czech Republic.\nPolice officers serving under regional HQs are usually organized in the following sections:\n* Public Order Police Service (Služba pořádkové policie) - general and largest, most versatile, police officers on general patrolling duty serving at local and district police stations, most usually first responders.
