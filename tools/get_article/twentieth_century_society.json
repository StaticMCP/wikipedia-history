It is formally recognised as one of the National Amenity Societies, and as such is a statutory consultee on alterations to listed buildings within its period of interest.\nHistory\nThe catalyst to form the society was the proposal to replace Lloyd's of London's Classical-style 1920s headquarters with a new modernist Richard Rogers building. Marcus Binney (founder of Save Britain's Heritage), John Harris (director of the RIBA drawings collection) and Simon Jenkins (editor of London's Evening Standard) felt that the existing building \"represented a whole body of important architecture of the period that deserved more sympathetic assessment\". Ultimately the façade of the 1920s building was retained and received a Grade II listing in 1977. It was incorporated into Rogers' 1986 design.\nEstablished in December 1979, the Thirties Society, as it was initially called, had offices at 21 Cambridge Street, London. Its organisation was modelled on the Georgian Group and the Victorian Society, and its initial intention was to preserve architecture from the 1930s,\nby calling for \"statutory protection from the Department of the Environment for the protection of important buildings and interiors\". Speaking of the need for the society, Jenkins, the vice-chairman, said \"It's easier to find examples of architecture from the 1890s than the 1930s, and although there are buildings which I find absolutely hideous, there are architectural reasons why they should be preserved.\" In 1992, a spokesperson for English Heritage said, \"We have found the Thirties Society proposals are usually well supported. It has been very influential in saving some of the best twentieth-century buildings.\"\nFounding members\nFounding members included:\n* Bevis Hillier, chairman\n* Simon Jenkins, vice-chairman (ex-editor of the London Evening Standard)\n* Sir Osbert Lancaster, president\n* Clive Aslet, secretary (Country Life)\n* Stephen Bayley (University of Kent)\n* Marcus Binney (Save Britain's Heritage)\n* William Feaver (art critic, The Observer)\n* Celina Fox (Museum of London)\n* John Harris (Curator, RIBA)\n* Dennis Sharp (Architectural Association)\n* Gavin Stamp (author, architectural historian)\nThe society of \"young fogeys\" as they were called invited Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew, Sir Sacheverell Sitwell, Lady Diana Cooper, Sir John Betjeman and Peter Fleetwood-Hesketh to be patrons. They also considered Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and David Niven but \"there was some concern that the stars of the Twenties and Thirties might not be around long enough to warrant putting their names on the letterhead.\" Norman St John Stevas, Minister for the Arts, attended the launch party.\nCatherine Croft, the current director, took over the position from Kenneth Powell in 2002.\nName\nThere was a debate over the society's name. The Inter-War Society was considered too martial and it was joked that The Twenties and Thirties Society sounded too much like a dating service. The name The Thirties Society was eventually settled on. The name was changed to The Twentieth Century Society (abbreviated to C20) in 1992, about which Stamp said, \"Much as I like the very English anomaly of a body called The Thirties Society defending buildings of the 1950s, the fact is that our name obscures our aims. We defend buildings put up as late as the 1970s.\"\nManchester branch\nIn 1982, a Manchester branch of the society was formed, with a focus on the Grosvenor Picture Palace on All Saints Street, which was under threat of demolition.\nOther activities\nThe society held its first conference, on the seventies, in 1999.\nThe society published a journal between 1981 and 2018; initially entitled The Thirties Society Journal it became Twentieth Century Architecture from 1994.\nIn 2019, to mark the society's 40th anniversary, they curated a list of 40 Buildings Saved, a collection of 40 \"buildings which would not have survived without our intervention\" including Jubilee Pool in Penzance, Plymouth's Civic Centre and St. Augustine in Manchester.\nThe Risk List\nIn 1998, the society released a Buildings at Risk report, which included Pimlico School, Romney House and Simpson's Building. Of the report, Bronwen Edwards, a C20 caseworker, said, \"What is indisputable is these buildings are a unique record of social, economic and architectural history – a vivid reminder of the way people lived, worked and played through the century.\"\nStarting in 2015, the society has published The Risk List (a play on the Rich List) every two years, which highlights ten buildings that the society believes are \"in danger of either substantial alteration or demolition\".\nThe bi-annual lists are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In anticipation of it being listed, the building was demolished by its owners over a bank holiday weekend.\n1982\n*The society protested the proposal to develop Memorial Court, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott at Clare College, Cambridge, saying the new building would \"destroy the vista which gives coherence to Scott's design\".\n1983\n*Arthur Scargill \"incurred the formidable wrath\" of the society, when the National Union of Mineworkers moved headquarters, leaving its 1950s 222 Euston Road location open to threat of demolition. The building was saved.\n1984\n*Terence Conran's application to change the windows of 1930's Heal's on Tottenham Court Road was opposed by the society. Of Conran, Stamp said \"He has turned out to be rather a crude shopkeeper.\" Their objection ultimately failed.\n1985\n*The society spoke out against British Telecom's (BT) attempt to remove the traditional Giles Gilbert Scott-designed red phone boxes. They campaigned for as many as possible to be saved, by contacting every local authority in Britain. A spokesman for the society said, \"They fit extraordinarily into their surroundings, whether urban or rural, and they are the most satisfactory neighbours to historic buildings.\" Ultimately 500 boxes were saved, under a 1987 agreement between the British government, BT and English Heritage. By 1992, 1,200 of the early designed boxes were listed, with a further 18,000 kept in use by BT.\n*The society's objection to the alteration to Hoover's cafeteria was unsuccessful, with permission to renovate granted by Ealing Council.\n1986\n*A fundraising campaign, in conjunction with Save Britain's Heritage, was launched to save Monkton House in Sussex, a surrealist mansion. Stamp said \"I cannot think of another 20th century house with its contents intact which is so worth keeping.\"\n*Sudbury Town tube station, (rebuilt 1930), was updated in consultation with the society, among others.\n*Together with Save Britain's Heritage, the society proposed that Brynmawr rubber factory designed by Architects' Co-Partnership in Gwent, Wales (built 1946–1952), was repurposed as a re-training centre. The building was given a Grade II* listing, the first post-war building in the UK to receive such a listed status but remained empty. The building was ultimately demolished in 2001.\n1987\n*The society joined several groups in opposing British Coal's plans to demolish the Grade II listed Frizzell baths at Lynemouth Colliery in Northumberland (built 1938). The campaign was successful, with the Secretary of State for the Environment rejecting British Coal's proposal.\n*After publishing a report The End of the Tunnel, in conjunction with The Victorian Society, the society held \"top level talks\" regarding concerns over \"widespread destruction\" of older underground stations.\n*Together with Save Britain's Heritage, the society opposed the demolition of Bracken House (built 1959) in the City, London, with Stamp describing it as \"the one thing that isn't rubbish.\" It was listed in August 1987, becoming \"the first major post-war building to be listed\".\n*After pressure from the society, the British government changed its stance on listing post-war buildings, allowing \"buildings of special architectural or historical importance\" to be listed if they were minimum 30 years old, or in exceptional circumstances 10.\n1988\n*The society joined the Urban Design Group's list of signatories in support of the Prince of Wales' \"role as scourge of glass stumps and carbuncles\".\n1989\n*The society urged Wandsworth Council and English Heritage to save Battersea Power Station from \"demolition by demoralisation\".\n1990s\n1991\n*Concern was expressed about the future of London Zoo, which needed £13&nbsp;million worth of repairs to 70 buildings.\n*The society backed CAMRA's campaign to save historic pubs from \"bogus 'period' facelifts\". One success was Prospect Inn in Thanet, Kent, designed by Oliver Hill (built 1937), which was listed as Grade II.\n*The society called for the preservation of the Cheltenham Estate in North Kensington (built 1968–1975), designed by Ernö Goldfinger. The society called for the Nottingham Playhouse (built 1964) to be declared architecturally significant.\n*The \"Lido campaign\" called for the preservation of outdoor pools, including the Jubilee Pool (built 1935) in Penzance.\n*Odeon House, designed by C Edmund Wilford (built 1930s) was to be saved from demolition in Sutton Coldfield. It received Grade II listing in 1998.\n*The society objected to a proposed 25-foot-tall fountain to commemorate the Queen's 40 years as monarch, planned for Parliament Square, London. The fountain was not built.\n1994\n*The society suggested ten concrete bridges spanning the M1 to be listed as historic monuments.\n*The society successfully encouraged the National Trust to add Erno Goldfinger's home, 2 Willow Road, (built 1939) to its portfolio. It was opened to the public in 1995.\n*The society successfully prevented the demolition of Tunstall's Barber's Palace cinema frontage (built 1920) citing it as an \"interesting example of 1920s Modernist Movement architecture\".\n1995\n*The society protested a glass lift being installed in Liverpool Cathedral, saying it would \"reduce the awe and majesty of this fine building\".\n*The society joined English Heritage in successfully protesting the modernisation of Totnes' post office on Fore Street.\n1996\n*The society backed Humberston Fitties residents' appeal to become a conservation area. The appeal was successful, followed by an Article 4 direction in 1998, which ensured the area's character was preserved.\n*The society saved a 1960s concrete frieze in Coventry city centre from being removed, stating it was \"one of only two examples of Mexican-style public art on pub fronts in the country\".\n*The society objected to the demolishing of the Dunlop Semtex Factory, Gwent (built 1945). It was the focus of \"many students of architecture, including Frank Lloyd Wright\" for the dome structure of its roof and concrete contours. It was authorised for demolition in the same year.\n*The society objected to the demolishing of the Empire Pool in Cardiff. It was authorised for demolition in 1999 to make way for the Millennium Stadium.\n*The society called for the preservation of Uxbridge's Lido, calling for it to be listed. It was granted Grade II listing in 1998.\n1997\n*Together with English Heritage, the society proposed Derby bus station, the UK's first purpose-built bus station (built 1933), be granted listed status. It closed in 2005 and was demolished the following year.\n21st century\n2002\n*The society joined the Ancient Monuments Society in trying to save the grade II listed private home Greenside in Virginia Water (built 1937) designed by Connell, Ward and Lucas, from demolition. The following year the owners demolished it without consent, \"arguing that the Human Rights Act justified his actions\".\n2005\n*The society submitted an application for Sheffield's Crucible Theatre to be listed. The application was successful, with Grade II listing status given in 2007.\n2013\n*The society's appeal for Swindon's Renault Distribution Centre (built 1982), designed by Norman Foster to be listed was successful.\n*After many years of campaigning for the listing of Building Design Partnership's 1969 Preston bus station, it was granted listed status.\n2015\n*The society called to save parts of the Eduardo Paolozzi mosaic, installed at the Tottenham Court Road station (created 1984). Threatened with permanent removal as part of the station's overhaul, the Society arranged for the decorative arch designs to be restored at the University of Edinburgh, where Paolozzi studied.\n2022\n*The society called for the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Deptford to be listed. If successful, it would become \"the youngest building on the list – and the first 21st Century building to make the cut\".\n2023\n*The society campaigned to save Bristol's NCP Rupert Street Car Park, (built 1959–60). The car park, which was built in 1959–1960 was set to be replaced with a 21-storey apartment building, but the Twentieth Century Society argued that the car park should be preserved because it was \"a good example of an absolutely pivotal building type from the 20th century\".\nSuccesses\nThe following are some of the buildings and objects that the society has successfully campaigned to save:\nFile:Red Public Phone Boxes - Covent Garden, London, England - July 10, 2012.JPG|K2 phone boxes, Covent Garden\nFile:Sudbury Town stn main entrance.JPG|Sudbury Town tube station\nFile:EH1262582 Bracken House 05.jpg|Bracken House, London\nFile:Battersea Power Station (2661142723).jpg|Battersea Power Station, London\nFile:Office building at London Zoo - geograph.org.uk - 2903314.jpg|London Zoo\nFile:The Hotel is now open - geograph.org.uk - 690246.jpg|Prospect Inn, Thanet (now a hotel)\nFile:Cheltenham Estate 1.jpg|Cheltenham Estate, North Kensington\nFile:Nottingham Playhouse, Wellington Circus, Nottingham - geograph.org.uk - 4110935.jpg|Nottingham Playhouse\nFile:Colourful flags at the Jubilee Pool Penzance - geograph.org.uk - 3021276.jpg|Jubilee Pool, Penzance\nFile:Odeon Cinema Sutton Coldfield 2 (5249917580).jpg|Odeon Cinema, Sutton Coldfield\nFile:1-3 Willow Road.jpg|2 Willow Road, London\nFile:Peacocks in Totnes - geograph.org.uk - 4065611.jpg|Former Post Office, Totnes\nFile:Former Headquarters of the National Union of Mineworkers (49445078058).jpg|222 Euston Road, former National Union of Miners HQ\nFile:Humberstone Fitties - geograph.org.uk - 1296904.jpg|Humberston Fitties, Grimsby\nFile:Hillingdon Sports & Leisure Complex - Fusion Lifestyle - Mary Turner.jpg|Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex (formerly Uxbridge Lido), Uxbridge\nFile:Renault Distribution Centre 320290 922a517e (2).jpg|Renault Distribution Centre, Swindon\nFile:Preston bus station (51232436203).jpg|Bus station, Preston\nFile:Tate Modern - Bankside Power Station.jpg|Bankside Power Station (now Tate Modern)\nFile:No 1 Poultry (1398376326) (cropped).jpg|No 1 Poultry, London\nFile:University of Leicester Engineering Building from Victoria Park.jpg|Engineering building, University of Leicester\nFile:Plymouth , Derriford - Western Morning News Building - geograph.org.uk - 2238266.jpg|Former Western Morning News HQ, Plymouth\nFile:Bloomsbury, The Brunswick, Marchmont Street, WC1 - geograph.org.uk - 669998.jpg|The Brunswick, Bloomsbury, London\nFile:Cecil Sharp House - geograph.org.uk - 1180157.jpg|Cecil Sharp House, London\nFile:Plymouth Civic Centre (7481611270).jpg|Civic Centre, Plymouth\nFile:Shopping Building, Milton Keynes - view from NE.jpg|Milton Keynes Shopping Building\nFile:MAN - ERF truck centre (geograph 3220251).jpg|Ripaults Factory, London\nFile:Sanderson Hotel, Berners Street.jpg|Sanderson Hotel, London\nFile:Former Lilian Baylis School, Lollard Street (geograph 2615249).jpg|Former Lilian Baylis School, London\nFile:St John's Church, Waterloo - geograph.org.uk - 3583837.jpg|St John's Church, Waterloo, London\nFile:Berkhamsted rex.jpg|The Rex Cinema, Berkhamstead\nFile:Wallis House Brentford.JPG|Wallis House, Brentford\nFile:Stewartby Village Centre - geograph.org.uk - 404268.jpg|Stewartby Common Room, Bedfordshire\nFile:Large modern house in Old Church Street, Chelsea - geograph.org.uk - 1838125.jpg|64 Old Church Street, Chelsea\nFile:Mural at City of London Academy, Islington - geograph.org.uk - 3321686.jpg|City of London Academy mural, London\nFile:Camden Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 3007458.jpg|Camden Town Hall extension, London\nFile:Byker Wall, Newcastle upon Tyne (19584205179).jpg|Byker Estate, Newcastle\nFile:Hayward Gallery from Blackfriars Bridge 7246.jpg|Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall, London\nFile:Desert Quartet Sculptures - Worthing - West Sussex.jpg|Desert Quartet sculptures, Worthing\nHoly Trinity Church, Twydall - geograph.org.uk - 1253756.jpg|Holy Trinity Church, Gillingham\nFile:Greenbank Drive Synagogue Greenbank Drive Sefton Park Liverpool Merseyside England UK.jpg|Greenbank Drive Synagogue, Liverpool\nFile:The Florey Building - geograph.org.uk - 1309650.jpg|The Florey Building, Oxford\nFile:Thomas White Quad.jpg|Sir Thomas White building, Oxford\nPublications\nJournal\nThe society published a journal between 1981 and 2018; initially entitled The Thirties Society Journal it became Twentieth Century Architecture from 1994.\nBooks\nThe following books were published by C20, unless otherwise stated:\n*Art Deco (1994)\n* Interiors and Decorative Art in Britain 1920–1940 (1994)\n* The Modern House to 1939 (1994)\n* Small Houses 1920–1940 (1994)\n* The Heroic Period of Conservation (2004) Ed.
