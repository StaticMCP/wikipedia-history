The candidate of the governing Motherland Party (ANAP) was its leader and Prime Minister Turgut Özal. In the first and second rounds, the ruling party ANAP was unsuccessful in electing its candidate. Finally, in the third round, Turgut Özal was elected as the eighth President of Turkey. He was the second civil president in Turkish history.\nThe parliamentary opposition, formed by the True Path Party (DYP) and the Social Democratic People's Party (SHP) claimed that the loss of popular support for ANAP in the March 1989 local elections did not give the party the democratic legitimacy to elect one of its politicians as President. Since ANAP commanded a parliamentary majority, its candidate was effectively certain to win the third round, where only a simple majority of the vote is required to win. The opposition thus boycotted the election. Fethi Çelikbaş, an ANAP Member of Parliament who stood against Özal, was the only other candidate. There were eight blank votes in the third round, which was held on October 31.\nResults\nReferences"
