Again Shield Recordings released this 7-inch in the Benelux, but Lockjaw Records (UK), and LaserLife Records (AT) released the vinyl as well. Late 2013 Trilob Records released a cassette, entitled 'Cause Vinyl Is For Hipsters, containing all ep's and 7-inches the band released to that date.\n2014 was the year the band recorded and released their second full-length, \"Old Ideas Keep Fighting Us\", containing 13 new songs.
