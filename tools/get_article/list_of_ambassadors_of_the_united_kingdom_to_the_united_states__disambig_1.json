The official title is '''His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the United States of America'''.\nThe ambassador's residence is on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and built in 1928.\nDuties\nThe position of ambassador to the United States is considered to be one of the most important and prestigious posts in His Majesty's Diplomatic Service, along with that of Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\nThe ambassador's main duty is to present British policies to the American government and people, and to report American policies and views to the Government of the United Kingdom. They serve as the primary channel of communication between the two nations, and play an important role in treaty negotiations.\nThe ambassador is the head of the United Kingdom's consular service in the United States. As well as directing diplomatic activity in support of trade, they are ultimately responsible for visa services and for the provision of consular support to British citizens in America. They also oversee cultural relations between the two countries.\nHistory\nThe first British envoy to the United States was Sir John Temple, who was appointed consul general in 1785 and was based in New York at the estate at Richmond Hill (Manhattan) which served previously as a headquarters for George Washington.\nGeorge Hammond was appointed on 5 July 1791. He held the title of Minister in Washington or Minister to the United States of America.\nIn 1809, David Erskine and President James Madison negotiated a compromise on Anglo-American disputes over shipping in the Atlantic, which might have averted the War of 1812. However, the deal was rejected by King George III and the British Government recalled Erskine.\nBy the 1850s, the envoy's title was '''Her Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America''', and the United Kingdom had consulates in several American cities. Under the direction of Sir John Crampton in 1854 and 1855, British consuls attempted to enlist American volunteers to fight in the Crimean War. The American government strenuously objected, and President Franklin Pierce asked for Crampton to be recalled. The United Kingdom refused, and in May 1856 the American government dismissed Crampton, along with the United Kingdom's consuls in New York, Philadelphia and Cincinnati. After much negotiation, the United Kingdom was allowed to re-establish its Legation in Washington the following year, and Lord Napier became the new minister.\nIn 1893, the British diplomatic mission in Washington was raised from a Legation to an Embassy, and Sir Julian Pauncefote, Minister since 1889, was appointed as the United Kingdom's first ambassador to the United States, with the title '''Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States'.\nThe role has in the past been offered to three former Prime Ministers: the Earl of Rosebery, David Lloyd George and Sir Edward Heath, all of whom declined.\nHeads of mission\nMinisters plenipotentiary (1791–1795)\nAs a republic, the United States was not entitled to receive an ambassador. Instead, the United Kingdom dispatched a diplomat with the lower rank of minister plenipotentiary. This placed the United Kingdom on equal footing with France, which also maintained a minister plenipotentiary in the United States.\n1791–1795: George Hammond\nEnvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary (1796–1893)\nIn 1796, the United Kingdom raised its representation to envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, or minister.
