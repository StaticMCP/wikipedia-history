This often subtle release deserves a quiet setting to be truly appreciated, it is easily one of Scott Colley's finest recordings\".\nOn All About Jazz, John Kelman's review called it \"a sure contender for one of 2010's top picks\" and said \"Empire may have been a long time coming, but arrives with an even more definitive sense of purpose and, given the chameleon-like demands on Colley as a sideman, a clear, cohesive and cogent conceptual voice\".\nNPR's Kevin Whitehead noted \"Colley's lyrical and catchy tunes bring Empire halfway home, but it's the players who complete the job; who breathe life into the frameworks he builds. This is heartland music born in Manhattan\".\nBBC Music's Lara Bellini said \"Colley’s writing is superb ... Tagging along on his rhythmical discourse is an exciting, never predictable journey, and definitely never a soulless one. Colley is engaging, propelling the action forward with a relentless sense of swing, and Empire is excellent\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Scott Colley\n# \"January\" – 4:53\n# \"The Gettin Place\" – 8:24\n# \"For Sophia\" – 5:20\n# \"5:30 AM\" – 7:23\n# \"Speculation\" – 6:46\n# \"Tomorrowland\" – 3:23\n# \"Now What?\" – 6:14\n# \"Gut\" – 4:07\n# \"Five-Two\" – 6:12\n# \"Five-Two.2\" – 2:01\nPersonnel\n*Scott Colley − bass\n*Ralph Alessi – trumpet\n*Craig Taborn − piano\n*Bill Frisell – electric guitar\n*Brian Blade - drums\nReferences"
