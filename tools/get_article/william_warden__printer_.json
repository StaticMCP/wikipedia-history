In March 1784, when Warden was 23 years of age, he established the Massachusetts Centinel newspaper, with Benjamin Russell. The printing-office of Warden & Russell was located in March 1784 \"at the southeast corner of State House\" in Boston, and later moved to 9 Marlborough Street. The publishing partnership continued until Warden's death in 1786. Warden never married. He died \"after a lingering illness\" at age 25, and was interred in the Granary Burying Ground.\nReferences"
