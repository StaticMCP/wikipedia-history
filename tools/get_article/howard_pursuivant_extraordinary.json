The Duke himself had never used the Glossop title, since his mother's barony of Beaumont takes precedence.\nThe badge of office was assigned in 1992: A cross-crosslet fitchy argent enclosed within a pair of wings displayed and reflexed gold. The crosslet is taken from the Howard's Arms and crest, while the wings allude to one of the Howard's crests and also the swiftness of the pursuivant as a messenger.\nThere has only been one appointment to this office since its creation.\nHolders of the office\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:50%\"\n!Arms\n! style=\"width:50%\" |Name\n! style=\"width:50%\" |Date of appointment\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Ref\n|-\n|\n|John H.
