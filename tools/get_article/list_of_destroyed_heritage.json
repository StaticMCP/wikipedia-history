      "text": "# List of destroyed heritage\n\n}}\nThis is a list of cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a natural disaster. The list is sorted by continent, then by country.\nCultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types: tangible and intangible. Tangible heritage includes built heritage (such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites) and movable heritage (such as works of art and manuscripts). Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion, and other traditions.\nThis article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectible heritage is dealt with in art destruction, whilst the destruction of movable industrial heritage remains almost totally ignored.\nThe deliberate and systematic destruction of cultural heritage, such as that carried out by ISIL and other terrorist organizations, is regarded as a form of cultural genocide.\nAfrica\nEgypt\n* The Library of Alexandria was destroyed during the Palmyrene invasion of Egypt and the following Roman counterattack during the 3rd century AD.\n* The Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was damaged then destroyed by earthquakes over the 8th to 14th centuries, collapsing around 1341&nbsp;CE.\n* Villa Aghion, a modernist villa built by Auguste Perret in Alexandria was demolished for redevelopment in 2014.\n* A rock-cut portion of the Temple of Gerf Hussein, flooded by Lake Nasser.\n*The building the Institut d'Égypte occupied was burned down and many documents with it on 17 December 2011 during anti-government demonstrations of the Arab Spring.

Notably, digs by Richard Nicklin Hall, who was determined to find evidence that the monument was not built by indigenous Africans until he eventually relinquished this belief. More extensive damage was caused by the mining of ruins for gold. Reconstruction attempts since 1980 caused further damage, alienating local communities.

This process lasted until the end of the Thirty Years War\n* Besides deliberate acts of destruction like the Sack of Magdeburg which all but depopulated a city of some 25,000 inhabitants, the Thirty Years War also destroyed most church records and many buildings due to ransacking, plunder and arson. As most genealogical records were kept in churches at the time, genealogical research meets a bottleneck during that historical era.\nGreece\n*The Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was destroyed in the 226 BC Rhodes earthquake, and its remains were destroyed in the 7th century AD while Rhodes was under Arab rule. In December 2015, a group of European architects announced plans to build a modern Colossus where the original once stood.\n*The Statue of Zeus at Olympia, also a Wonder of the Ancient World, was destroyed around the 5th century CE, although it is not known exactly when or how.\n*The Parthenon was extensively damaged in 1687 in the Morean theatre of the Great Turkish War (1683–1699). The Ottoman army fortified the Acropolis of Athens and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine and a shelter for members of the local Turkish community. On 26 September, a Venetian mortar round blew up the magazine, and the explosion blew out the building's central portion. About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which caused fires that burned until the following day and consumed many homes. The Parthenon was extensively and permanently damaged when Thomas Bruce, the 7th Earl of Elgin and ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (occupiers of Greece in the early 19th century), who admired the Parthenon's extensive collection of ancient marble sculptures, began extracting and expatriating them to Britain in 1801. More damage to the site's heritage came after independence, when all Medieval and Ottoman features of the Acropolis (most notably the Frankish Tower) were destroyed by Heinrich Schliemann in a project to rid the site of all post-Classical influence.\n* Las Incantadas, a Roman pillared portico with mythological reliefs was demolished by Emmanuel Miller in 1864, who attempted to transfer the entire monument to France.

A number of Albanian cultural sites in Kosovo were destroyed during the Kosovo conflict (1998–1999) which constituted a war crime violating the Hague and Geneva Conventions. 225 out of 600 mosques in Kosovo were damaged, vandalised, or destroyed alongside other Islamic architecture and Islamic libraries and archives with records spanning 500 years. Additionally 500 Albanian owned kulla dwellings (traditional stone tower houses) and three out of four well preserved Ottoman period urban centres located in Kosovo cities were badly damaged resulting in great loss of traditional architecture. Kosovo's public libraries, in particular 65 out of 183 were completely destroyed with a loss of 900,588 volumes. During the war, Islamic architectural heritage posed for Yugoslav Serb paramilitary and military forces as Albanian patrimony with destruction of non-Serbian architectural heritage being a methodical and planned component of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.\nDuring World War II, a number of Serbian Orthodox religious sites were damaged or destroyed. During the 1968 and 1981 protests, Serbian Orthodox religious sites were the target of vandalism. This continued during the 1980s.

It was located in Dwejra Bay in the limits of San Lawrenz, close to the Inland Sea and the Fungus Rock. The formation was anchored on the east end by the seaside cliff, arching over open water, to be anchored to a free standing pillar in the sea to the west of the cliff. It was created when two limestone sea caves collapsed. Following years of natural erosion causing parts of the arch to fall into the sea, the arch and free standing pillar collapsed completely during a storm in March 2017.\n*Villa St Ignatius, a 19th-century villa with historical and architectural significance, was partially demolished in late 2017. This was condemned by numerous non-governmental organizations and other entities.\nNetherlands\n*The German bombing of Rotterdam that took place on 14 May 1940, also known as the Rotterdam Blitz, decimated most of the historical city center of the Dutch city.

It was dismantled on the orders of King John, who feared it being taken by French Dauphin Louis. It was then rebuilt and refortified by King Henry III around 1220 to 1225. In the South England flood of February 1287, the cliff supporting the castle's south wall collapsed due to a violent storm, causing a large portion of the wall to fall into the North Sea, then in 1337 and 1339 it was attacked by French troops.

In total around 900 monasteries were closed. In addition, the abolition of chantries in 1547 and the conversion to Protestantism led to iconoclastic destruction of artwork in many churches. For a complete list of dissolved monasteries, see List of monastic houses in England and List of monastic houses in Wales.\n*In Scotland, the Reformation happened later, in 1560, and the monks were generally not evicted, but merely left in their monasteries to die out.

The new owners then either destroyed the derelict monasteries or converted them to residential use.\n*In the English Civil War, many castles and stately homes were destroyed in sieges (an example being Old Wardour Castle) or slighted or demolished by the victorious Parliamentarians. This was done both to render them militarily untenable and as a symbolic destruction of the old order. Parliament could not afford to garrison al the many castles in England against Royalist insurgents, and an ungarrisoned castle could easily be used as a base by supporters of King Charles. This happened at Pontefract Castle, where the castle was left standing after the first civil war, was retaken by a party of Royalists, and had to be taken again in a lengthy siege. To prevent this recurring, the castle was thoroughly demolished. Raglan Castle was an example of a punitive demolitionthe Marquis of Worcester had held out long after every other castle except Pendennis. As punishment his castle was ransacked and, in contrast to the preservation of that at Oxford, his library was deliberately burnt.
