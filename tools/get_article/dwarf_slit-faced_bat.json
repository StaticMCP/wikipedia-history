Two subspecies have been identified: N. n. nana and N. n. tristis.\nThe bat's range goes from Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana in the west, to Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Rwanda and Burundi to Uganda and western Kenya, and to the south it ranges as far south as northern Angola. It is generally a lowland species. Its habitat has been recorded from both dry and moist lowland forest, gallery forest, and moist savanna. It has been found roosting in standing trees in small family groups.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Slit-Faced Bat\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf slit-faced bat\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf slit-Faced bat\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf slit-faced bat"
