He also served as chief secretary of the Association of Ex-Cadets. He was appointed to the board of directors for the school in 1912, only a year before assuming its presidency.\nLater, he personally bankrolled the fledgling Texas A&M University while chairman of the Board of Regents in 1912. His money and campaign prevented a Texas A&M consolidation with the University of Texas at Austin.\nPersonal life\nIn 1888, he married Florence Abbey Powars.\nIn March 1904, his brother was kidnapped for ransom in West Texas and taken across the border to Mexico.\nDeath\nHe died in Houston in 1924. At the time of his death, he was a bank receiver for First National Bank in Granger, Texas.\nLegacy\nIn 1930, a library was built at Texas A&M University in memory of Cushing. This represented the first freestanding library on the Texas A&M campus. The Sterling C. Evans Library was constructed in 1968 and became the university's primary library, but the Cushing Library remained as a repository of important university archives.\nHonors and awards\n* 2006: Distinguished Alumni Award, Texas A&M University\n* World War I: Croix de Guerre, France\nReferences"
