Khandeshwar railway station caters to New Panvel West but is built away from the city, while it is strategically near to Kamothe. The station derives its name from the  Khandeshwar Mahadev Mandir and Khandeshwar Lake and Park. As Khandeshwar Railway station adjoins the nearer Kamothe node the people from Kamothe prefer Khandeshwar station over Manasarowar railway station which is cornered in the Juip Village.\nIt has 2 Platforms. PF 1 for the trains going towards Panvel and PF 2 for trains towards Thane/Goregaon/CSMT.\nGallery\nKhandeshwar Station - Platformboard.jpg|Khandeshwar Station – Platformboard\nKhandeshwar Station - Stationboard.jpg|Khandeshwar Station – Stationboard\nReferences"
