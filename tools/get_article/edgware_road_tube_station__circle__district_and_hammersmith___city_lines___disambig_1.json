A separate station of the same name but served by the Bakerloo line is located about 150 metres away on the opposite side of Marylebone Road.\nThere have been proposals in the past to rename one of the Edgware Road stations to avoid confusion. Neither of them should be confused with Edgware station, the northern terminus of the Edgware branch of the Northern line.\nHistory\nleaving Edgware Road, at the junction beneath Praed Street]]\nThis station was part of the world's first underground railway when it was opened as part of the Metropolitan Railway between  and  on 10 January 1863.\nThe station was rebuilt 1926-8 for the introduction of District services with a new street level building by Charles Walter Clark replacing the original 1863 building designed by Sir John Fowler.\nIt was the site of one of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Mohammad Sidique Khan detonated a bomb at about 8:50am, on board a westbound Circle line train as it was leaving the station, killing six passengers.\nStation layout\nThe station lies in a cutting open to the elements, not in a tunnel. The station serves the cut-and-cover routes of the Hammersmith & City, Circle and District lines, forming the northern terminus for the District line's service to . All District line trains terminate at Wimbledon; passengers must change at  for , , and .\nTo the east of the station, the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines share the same tracks towards . To the west all four lines run to , but the routes to  and the Circle and District line trains via  diverge at Praed Street Junction to separate stations within the Paddington complex.\nSince December 2009, Circle line trains call at the station twice on each journey: initially as a through service from Hammersmith towards , then as the terminus for that same service completing the loop via  (or the same journey in reverse). There are no longer through trains here between the northern part of the Circle line and its western part.\nThe usual service pattern is: platform 1 for Eastbound services to Kings Cross, Liverpool Street and beyond, platform 2 for District line trains to Earl's Court and Wimbledon, platform 3 for Circle line to High Street Kensington and Victoria, and platform 4 for Westbound services to Shepherd's Bush Market and Hammersmith. This may vary in times of disruption – trains can go east from platforms 1, 2 and 3 and to any of the westbound destinations from platforms 2, 3 or 4, but only platforms 2 and 3 can be used to reverse trains.\nServices\nCircle line\nPrior to 13 December 2009, the Circle line trains travelled in both directions around a simple loop with 27 stations and 12.89 miles (20.75&nbsp;km) of track. In December 2009, the Circle line was extended to include the Hammersmith & City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally going around the circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasional trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. Service operation was changed to improve reliability and increase the service frequency on the Hammersmith branch.\nThe service pattern all day is:\n*6tph via High Street Kensington (Anti-clockwise)\n*6tph via Kings Cross St Pancras (Clockwise)\n*6tph to Hammersmith (Anti-clockwise)\nDistrict line\nEdgware Road is the terminus for all District line services via High Street Kensington. Trains usually terminate at platform 2 which can also be used as a through platform although this feature is rarely used.\nThe service pattern all day is:\n*6tph Wimbledon (Westbound)\nHammersmith & City line\nThe service pattern all day is:\n*6tph to Barking (Eastbound)\n*6tph to Hammersmith (Westbound)\nArtwork\nAs part of the introduction of the S7 and S8 Stock trains to the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines in the early 2010s, power upgrades required the construction of a large electrical substation adjacent to the station. Art on the Underground commissioned artist Jacqueline Poncelet to produce designs for the  of vitreous enamel cladding that would become the outer shell of the substation. The artwork - Wrapper - was unveiled in November 2012, a mosaic of 700 decorated panels of various patterns inspired by local history.\nConnections\nThe station is served by London Buses day and night routes.\nThis station has an out-of-station interchange on Oyster and contactless cards with the station with the same name on the Bakerloo line.\nSee also\n*7 July 2005 London bombings\nReferences"
