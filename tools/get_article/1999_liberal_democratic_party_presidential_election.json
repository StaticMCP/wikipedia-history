Keizō Obuchi, who had been first elected in the 1998 LDP presidential election, strongly desired unopposed re-election. He particularly sought to appease Koichi Kato, who had recently inherited the Kato faction, by hinting at being his successor. However, Kato ignored his appeal and ran alongside his ally and Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the Yamasaki faction. Kato, already considered a leading candidate for the future presidency, saw this as an ideal opportunity to demonstrate his support for Obuchi. Although he had anticipated losing, he actively promoted a \"refreshing policy debate\" in the hope of establishing a party-wide coalition following the election.\nObuchi won as expected, but Obuchi never forgave Kato for running against him and severely undermined the Kato faction in his subsequent appointments. This led to the Kato Rebellion the following year. On the other hand, the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai (Mori faction), whose chairman, Yoshirō Mori, had supported Obuchi as LDP Secretary-General, quickly withdrew from the race and supported Obuchi. Following this, Junichiro Koizumi, who had run in the previous two presidential elections, also withdrew. When Obuchi fell ill the following year, the prime ministerial position fell to Mori, who continued as secretary-general. During the \"Kato Rebellion,\" Koizumi, who supported Mori as faction chairman, suppressed the rebellion and ultimately became prime minister himself in 2001.\nAs such, this presidential election contained several important foreshadowings of future political developments. It was Shinzo Abe, a young politician with only two election wins at the time, who strongly urged Mori, the faction chairman, to run. Abe later recalled with a wry smile that he was young himself, saying, \"If Mori had run against him, as we young people demanded, he might not have become the next prime minister. Kato, who ran at that time, ultimately did not become prime minister\".\nCandidates\n* Keizō Obuchi (Faction: Heisei Kenkyūkai)\n* Koichi Kato (Faction: Kōchikai)\n* Taku Yamasaki (Faction: Kinmirai Seiji Kenkyukai)\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Candidate\n!Total votes\n!Diet vote\n!Membership vote\n|-\n|Keizō Obuchi\n| align=\"right\" |350\n|253\n|97\n|-\n|Koichi Kato\n| align=\"right\" |113\n|85\n|28\n|-\n|Taku Yamasaki\n| align=\"right\" |51\n|33\n|18\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
