Voters were asked to pick 6 electors to be pledged for a candidate in the Electoral College. The two main tickets of the election were the Republican one, consisting of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence, and the Democratic one, consisting of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.\nOn March 22, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Utah voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic and Republican parties' respective nominees for president. The state uses a system of semi-closed primaries, meaning that voters registered with a specific party can vote in that party's primary, while voters who are unaffiliated can vote in the primary of one party of their choosing. Utah was won by Trump, who won the state with 45.5 percent of the vote, the lowest percentage for any Republican since George H. W. Bush in 1992 and the lowest winning percentage for any presidential candidate since both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole in 1996. Clinton received 27.5 percent of the vote, and Republican-turned-independent candidate Evan McMullin received 21.5 percent.\nTrump's 18.08 point margin was the closest a Democrat has come to winning Utah since 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won by 9.73%. This is the worst performance in Utah by a Republican since 1964 by margin of victory. Although he never lost the state, Trump never won over 60% of the vote in Utah in any of his three runs, greatly below all other 21st century Republican candidates.\nThis was due to McMullin's strong third-party showing limiting Trump to under 50% of the vote; Clinton received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than five other Democrats in this same time period (Barack Obama in 2008, Bill Clinton in 1996, Michael Dukakis in 1988, Jimmy Carter in 1976, and Hubert Humphrey in 1968).\nThis was one of only three states, the others being Idaho and Vermont, where the Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson did not obtain third place, as McMullin beat him in Idaho and Utah, and write-in votes for Bernie Sanders (who was no longer running for president) beat him in Vermont. Trump also became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying Salt Lake or Summit Counties since William McKinley in 1896 and 1900, respectively. The state was one of 11 (along with the District of Columbia) that shifted towards the Democrats in the 2016 election.\nCaucus elections\nUtah held its presidential caucuses on March 22, 2016.\nDemocratic caucus\nFour candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential caucus ballot:\n*Hillary Clinton\n*Bernie Sanders\n*Martin O'Malley (withdrawn)\nRepublican caucus\nThree candidates appeared on the Republican presidential caucus ballot:\n*Ted Cruz\n*John Kasich\n*Donald Trump\nGeneral election\nVoting history\nThe state of Utah has given its electoral votes to the Republican ticket in every election year since 1968 and only once voted for a Democratic candidate in elections since 1952 (in 1964). The state has a majority of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) population, which on the national level voted 78 percent to 21 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012. This very heavily contributed to Mitt Romney winning the state by a margin of 73 percent to 25 percent in the 2012 election. However, Donald Trump's criticism of Romney's faith on the campaign trail in 2016 angered many Republican voters. Polls suggested that Utah might be a strong state for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson as a protest vote against Trump. As a result, Larry Sabato's online election forecaster, Sabato's Crystal Ball, downgraded their rating of the Utah contest from \"Safe Republican\" to \"Likely Republican\" on June 23.\nEvan McMullin, a conservative independent candidate, had also been viewed by voters in Utah as another alternative, given that it is also his home state. According to one poll released on October 12, Trump and Clinton were seen as virtually tied in Utah at 26%, with McMullin polling at 22%. McMullin's rise was the result of further Republican backlash against Trump following the release of a controversial video from 2005 showing Trump bragging about obscene sexual conduct with women. In a poll conducted by Emerson College from October 17–19 with a sample size of 700 people, McMullin placed first with 31 percent ahead of Trump by a 4 percent margin, who had 27 percent of support, while Clinton polled in third at 24 percent. This was the first conducted statewide opinion poll of the 2016 election where a third-party candidate has placed first.\nAlthough Evan McMullin did not win a majority or a plurality of the vote in any county in Utah, he did win a plurality or a majority of the vote in several election precincts. Six election precincts in Utah cast a simple majority of their votes for Evan McMullin with four being in Utah County while one precinct in Cache County and Salt Lake County cast a simple majority of the vote for McMullin.\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Los Angeles Times\n|\n| November 6, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CNN\n|\n|November 4, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Cook Political Report\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Electoral-vote.com\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=left | Rothenberg Political Report\n|\n| November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RealClearPolitics\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Fox News\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|}\nPolling\nDonald Trump won almost every poll, except for one poll showing him tied with Hillary Clinton and Evan McMullin, and another showing McMullin with 31% of the vote, ahead of Trump's 27% and Clinton's 24%.

Some of the largest leftward shifts in the country occurred in highly educated Salt Lake City metropolitan area counties (see the map), though most of them still voted for Trump by diminished margins. Although Trump won Utah in all three of his elections, he never won over 60% of the vote in any of them, greatly below those of prior Republican nominees.\nUtah gave the Republican nominee a 45 percent plurality and thus awarded him six electoral votes. This was the lowest percent of the vote Trump received in any state that he won in 2016. Trump received a much lower percentage of the vote in Utah than did Mitt Romney in 2012. In particular, Trump underperformed Romney by over 30 percentage points in the Provo-Orem, Logan, and Ogden metropolitan areas. Meanwhile, Clinton improved on Obama's performance in all of these areas. Trump received only 45 percent of the vote among Utah members of the LDS Church, barely half the proportion that Romney won in 2012. This was also much lower than the 61 percent of the LDS Church's vote Trump received nationally.\nMcMullin's 21.3 percent of the vote is the strongest third-party performance in any state since Ross Perot during the 1992 presidential election. He finished second ahead of Clinton in fifteen of Utah's twenty-nine counties, becoming the first third-party candidate since Perot to outpoll a major party candidate in any county nationwide, and only the fifth since 1928 to do so in any non-Southern county. In Utah County, he received almost thirty percent of the vote, about twice as much as Clinton and more than any non-Republican presidential candidate since 1968. Had McMullin won Utah, he would have become the first nationally nonpartisan candidate since George Washington to win a state in 224 years since Washington's reelection in 1792, and exceeded McMullin's performance under a similar \"Independent\" banner in Minnesota, South Dakota, Nevada and Oregon. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt also exceeded McMullin's vote share under the \"Independent\" banner in Kansas, as did James B. Weaver in South Dakota in 1892.}} and ultimately the first nonpartisan candidate to win a state west of the Mississippi River. Due to McMullin's strong showing, Trump's margin of victory in Utah marked a leftward swing by 29.85%, the strongest such swing in 2016.\nAs of the 2024 election, this is the most recent election where Grand County voted Republican.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Utah\n* First presidency of Donald Trump\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential debates and forums\n* 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2016 Republican Party presidential debates and forums\n* 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gop.com/the-official-guide-to-the-2016-republican-nominating-process/ RNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process]\n* [http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P16/ Green papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions]\n* [https://elections.utah.gov/Media/Default/2016%20Election/2016%20General%20Election%20-%20Statewide%20Canvass%203.pdf Official final canvass]"
