The expedition ended in fiasco for the Byzantine army.\nBackground\nOn 824 or 827, Andalusian fugitives were expelled from Alexandria and left for the island of Crete. The fugitive leader, Abu Hafs occupied the island. He founded the city of Chandax which became its capital. The Byzantines were aware of the danger Crete poses to them. Soon they dispatched an expedition led by Damianos and Photenious but were defeated.\nExpedition\nIn Autumn of 828, the Byzantine emperor, Michael II, dispatched another fleet of 70 ships under the strategos of the Cibyrrhaeots, Craterus. The Byzantines landed at Amnisos where the Arabs were waiting for them. A bloody and fierce battle ensued on the coast where the Byzantines routed the Arabs, killing and taking many prisoners. Those who survived the battle escaped to Chandax. The Byzantines, instead of following up their success, chose to establish their camp and celebrate their victory. They neglected the defense of their camp. At the night, the Arabs launched a sortie against the sleeping Byzantines who were taken by surprise. The Byzantines were subsequently massacred and their ships were captured. Craterus escaped on a merchant ship. However; the Arabs chased him to the island of Kos where he was captured and crucified.\nAftermath\nIt became clear after this victory that the Arabs had come to inhabit Crete. That year, 828, they had total control over the island. The battle changed the naval balance of power in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Arabs made frequent and destructive assaults against the coastlines of the Aegean Sea.\nReferences\nSources\n*John Bagnell Bury (1965), A History of the Eastern Roman Empire from the Fall of Irene to the Accession of Basil I.
