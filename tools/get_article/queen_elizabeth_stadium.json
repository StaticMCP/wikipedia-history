First opened in 1980, it has a 3,500-seat arena, gymnasia, squash and badminton courts, and a multi-purpose hall. It was built by the Urban Council, and is now managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government.\nIt hosted the official 1983 Asian Basketball Championship and the 2023 Gay Games.\nHistory\nQueen Elizabeth II made her first visit to Hong Kong, then a British colony, in May 1975. This Royal Visit became the namesake of the stadium. The construction was funded by various means including donations from local philanthropists such as Sir Tang Shiu-kin, and the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club.\nThe foundation stone was laid by the Acting Governor Sir Denys Roberts on 21 December 1977. The stadium was opened by the Governor Sir Murray MacLehose on 27 August 1980. Since then the stadium has become one of the major venues for cultural and sports activities in Hong Kong.\nPopular culture\nJapanese pop singer Kenji Sawada, widely popular across Asia at the time, was one of the first artists to use the stadium as a concert venue (December 1980, just four months after its opening), followed by Taiwanese pop singer Teresa Teng in 1982. Many successful home-grown artists and pop stars also held concerts at the venue including George Lam, Michael Kwan, Danny Chan, Alan Tam, Samuel Hui and Beyond (See 1970s and 1980s in Hong Kong). However, the stadium's status as the top concert venue in Hong Kong, or even Asia, was gradually eclipsed by the larger stadium Hong Kong Coliseum.\nThe stadium is also one of the major venues during the 2009 East Asian Games.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051115181925/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Entertainment/Stadia/QE/ Official website]"
