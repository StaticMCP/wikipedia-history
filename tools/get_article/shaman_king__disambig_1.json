It follows the adventures of Yoh Asakura as he attempts to hone his shaman skills to become the Shaman King by winning the Shaman Fight. Takei chose shamanism as the main theme of the series because he wanted a topic that had never been attempted before in manga. The Shaman King manga was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump between June 1998 and August 2004. The individual chapters were collected and released in 32  volumes. In 2017, Kodansha acquired the rights to the series and re-launched it on 35 e-book volumes in 2018, also published in print from 2020 to 2021.\nA 64-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by NAS and Xebec, aired on TV Tokyo from July 2001 to September 2002. A 52-episode anime television series remake adaptation was produced by Bridge, and aired on TV Tokyo and other channels from April 2021 to April 2022. The manga has also been reprinted in a  edition, and has spawned various spin-offs and sequel manga, video games, a trading card game, and many types of related merchandise.\nIn North America, Viz Media obtained the English-language license for Shaman King and published its chapters in Shonen Jump magazine from March 2003 to August 2007. Kodansha USA re-licensed the series in 2020, and released it in both digital and physical formats. The anime series was licensed in North America by 4Kids Entertainment in 2003 and aired on FoxBox. Video games were released by 4Kids Entertainment in North America and Europe.\nIn Japan, the manga has been popular. By March 2021, it had over 38 million copies in circulation. Both the manga and anime have been featured, at various times, in \"top ten\" lists of their respective media. The first Shaman King anime series was very popular during its broadcast in Japan. Publications about manga and anime have praised the series.\nPlot\nList of Shaman King characters}}\nThe plot of Shaman King revolves around Yoh Asakura, a shaman, a medium between the worlds of the living and the dead. Yoh seeks to become Shaman King, one able to channel the power of the Great Spirit to reshape the world as they wish, by winning the Shaman Fight, a tournament overseen by the Patch Tribe that occurs once every 500 years. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the scene and prescribes a brutal training regimen to prepare him for the tournament. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a journey that will lead him to befriend Manta Oyamada and encounter other shamans: \"Wooden Sword\" Ryu, Tao Ren, Horohoro and Faust VIII.\nYoh's group travels to America to pass the final trial for the right to participate in the Shaman Fight, joined by Lyserg Diethel while encountering a group of shamans led by Yoh's estranged twin brother Hao Asakura, the reincarnation of a powerful shaman who wishes to eradicate all humans and create a world for shamans. The group also encounter the X-Laws, a group dedicated with killing Hao, with Lyserg joining them. Yoh's team is joined by Joco McDonnell (known as Chocolove McDonnell), as they engage in a series of three-man matches.\nAfter several matches, only the teams that consist of Yoh's group, the X-Laws, and Hao's team remain. Due to Hao's level of power despite being supported by the Gandhara group in selecting Yoh, Ren, Horohoro, Lyserg, and Joco as the five legendary warriors, the teams forfeit the tournament in a gambit to stop Hao while he undergoes a process to merge with the Great Spirit while Gandhara acquires the Patch Tribe's five elemental spirits. Though Yoh and his friends defeat ten Patch tribesmen who are obligated to protect the new Shaman King, they are powerless against awaken Hao as he brings their souls and everyone they know within the Great Spirit before he commences with his goal of destroying all human life. But Yoh and his friends acquire the elemental spirits and battle Hao while joined by their friends and associates, revealing their goal is actually to ensure that Hao would not abuse his powers. It is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao's wish for someone to bring back his mother's spirit. With Anna's help, Hao's mother is brought to the Great Spirit. Convinced by his mother to forgive humanity for her death, Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans so he can observe how Yoh and his friends will change the world.\nSeven years later, Hana Asakura waits at a station for the five legendary warriors and his parents, Yoh and Anna.\nProduction\nBefore creating Shaman King, Takei, an assistant of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged ideas about the series with the other assistants which included the creator of One Piece, Eiichiro Oda. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.\nHe chose shamanism as the principal topic of the series because he wanted to choose a subject that had never been approached in manga before. He said he incorporated his own personality and beliefs in Shaman King. He has an interest in the topic, and \"choosing shamanism as the subject of this story seemed like a natural extension of that.\" For the title, he said he used \"shaman\", an English word, due to the fact that \"the nuance is really great\" and because he could not find a Japanese word with the accurate meaning of the word \"shaman\". Another reason to have shamanism as the main subject was because he could explore elements from different cultures and their relationship with the dead and the spirits.\nTakei created the stories after he created the characters because he believed the \"stories are born because of the existence of the characters\". In addition, he felt that \"the most important thing [to create a character] is to have originality\". Through his characters he wanted to show different cultures, backgrounds and values. When asked \"how do shamans of pacifistic religions ever win the Shaman Fight?\" he answered that the Shaman Fight is fought using the \"strength of the soul\". Takei declared \"the final message of Shaman King is that fighting is no good.\"\nMedia\nManga\nShueisha edition\nList of Shaman King chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei, Shaman King was serialized in Shueisha's  manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from June 30, 1998, released on June 30 of that same year.}} to an abrupt and improvised end on August 30, 2004. released on August 30 of that same year.}} The first 275 chapters were collected into 31  volumes, released from December 3, 1998, to October 4, 2004. The release of volume 32—intended for publication on December 3, 2004—was delayed and Shueisha reported they would only publish volume 32 if they receive evidence of demand from approximately 50,000 people. The release of the last ten chapters in  format happened on January 5, 2005. A spin-off to Shaman King, , published in Akamaru Jump in 2003 and 2004, lasted for five chapters—all of which were included in volume 32. Taking place seven years after the end of the manga series, it features Hana Asakura, son of Yoh and Anna, and his journey with Ryu to find the Five Elemental Warriors for a reunion before the opening of the Funbari Hot Springs Inn.\nTakei declared it was not a decrease in the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a \"fatigue\" he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being \"normalized\" by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical  aspects and losing its originality. In 2007, he revealed he was planning to end the series with the finale he initially envisioned, to be published in another Shueisha magazine at the end of the year or at the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27  volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or \"Perfect Edition\"), concluding with the \"true ending\" to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official  website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008 with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, \"After making the readers  so much for this, the last thing I wanted to do was to disappoint them\". He thought the ending was a \"huge responsibility\". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something \"fun,\" as it was different from scratch. Shaman King has also been published as part of the Shueisha Jump Remix series of magazine-style books. Sixteen volumes of Shaman King were released under the Shueisha Jump Remix series between April 1, 2011 and October 28, 2011.\nViz Media licensed the series for an English-language release in North America; the chapters initially serialized in the American Shonen Jump, beginning in third issue in 2003 and ceasing its serialization in the August 2007 issue.

Moreover, approximately 165 million cards from the Shaman King trading card game were sold in Japan.\nCritical response\nJustin Freeman from Anime News Network (ANN) criticized the first volume for relying too heavily on the spirits as a , stating that is what \"places the series on the wrong path.\" On other hand, Alexander Hoffman of Comics Village declared \"in this first novel, letting the relationships between Yoh, Amidamaru, and Manta flesh out is more important that developing every spiritual entity that shows up.\" Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime said she was fascinated by how Takei was capable of taking several myths and cultural beliefs and \"blending them into the character backgrounds\". Lori Henderson of Manga Life cited the fact every character, even the villains, \"has a reason for fighting\" and their \"internal struggles\" as well as the fights itself as the main reason why Shaman King is \"an enjoyable title.\" A reviewer for The Star declared, praised the characters' development and Takei's capacity to create \"new interesting ones each volume,\" commending \"their backgrounds and unique personalities.\" Writing for ANN, John Jakala commented that he was struck with the \"unique\", \"graffiti-style\" visual of the series. Although labeled its art as \"silly\", Sheena McNeil from Sequential Start expressed that \"it's smooth and nicely detailed with excellent expressions.\" McNeil deemed Takei did \"a wonderful job of bringing shaman into the modern day but keeping it a story of fantasy\". Ellingwood stated the series' \"vibrant action\", \"imaginative plot twists and a creative world\" makes it \"a unique and stylish  series.\"\nMania's Eduardo Chavez said that, Shaman King can \"hit all the right buttons one volume\" but \"it could be a complete bore\" in the next. School Library Journals Cathleen Baxter commented that Shaman King has \"nonstop action\" with \"typical  characters and battle styles\". The storyline is \"easy to follow and will hold the reader's interest.\" Margaret Veira of Active Anime, however, argued that the storyline gets more complex as the series progresses, while comics critic Jason Thompson commented that from volume 20 it \"seemed to veer off tracks\". In addition of a decline on artwork in his opinion, the numbers of fights also decreased; Thompson wrote, \"their enemy ... may be unbeatable by force alone, so the plot shifts away from battles and towards unexpected betrayals, character relationships, and clever (and confusing) schemes—rather than mere fighting techniques.\" The last volume, especially, \"may leave some readers feeling cheated,\" said Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin. Thompson was also disappointed by the 2004 conclusion but he wrote that the  version has \"a great ending\", whose \"transcendental climax is not too different from Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira, or for many American comics about beings with ultimate power.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
