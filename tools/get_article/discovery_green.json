The park is adjacent to the George R. Brown Convention Center and Avenida Houston entertainment district. Discovery Green features a lake, bandstands and venues for public performances, two dog runs, a playground, and multiple recreational lawns.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090627055711/http://www.discoverygreen.com/en/cms/?104 Discovery Green Park Features – Discovery Green Conservancy]\nIn the early 2000s, a public–private partnership between the City of Houston and a group of local philanthropic organizations, including the Kinder Foundation, was formed with the goal of constructing a new public green space in Downtown. This partnership financed the purchase of a series of surface parking lots on the east side of Downtown. Following the completion of land purchases in 2004, the Discovery Green Conservancy and the City jointly raised $125 million to construct the park. The design of the park, led by landscape architecture firm Hargreaves Associates, began in 2005. Discovery Green's public opening occurred on April 13, 2008; during the first two months of operation, an estimated 250,000 people visited the park.\nHistory\nThe City of Houston acquired a portion of the land in front of the George R. Brown Convention Center in 2002.  When the rest of the property went up for sale, a group of philanthropists led by Maconda Brown O’Connor of the Brown Foundation, and Nancy G. Kinder of the Kinder Foundation approached then-Mayor Bill White with their idea of turning the space into an urban park. The Mayor agreed and became a strong advocate of a public-private partnership was developed for the $125 million project. Several other philanthropic foundations joined the effort, including the Wortham Foundation and the Houston Endowment, Inc.\nThe City of Houston purchased the remainder of the land in 2004 and created the framework for the park’s construction and operations, including the role of the new organization, Discovery Green Conservancy, incorporated in 2004.\nWhen the Houston City Council approved the contracts to provide partial funding and support to the park, it also mandated that the “public at large” be engaged in the design and development of the park. With the guidance of Project for Public Spaces, the Conservancy mounted the large public meetings and smaller focus groups to solicit public feedback. This feedback became the basis for the park’s programming.\nHargreaves Associates, an internationally renowned landscape architecture firm based in San Francisco, oversaw the design effort. Page [formerly PageSoutherlandPage] designed the park's architecture and Larry Speck was their lead architect. Lauren Griffith Associates. provided landscape and horticultural design services. Artists Margo Sawyer and Doug Hollis were integral members of the design team and produced three works of art for the park. A large team of local and international engineers and specialists supported the core design team. Elmore Public Relations was contracted for marketing and public relations.\nEver since the opening in 2008, the park has added upon. An estimate of $1 billion worth of buildings, offices, hotels, and housing projects were added to the park's surroundings.\nIn 2009 the One Park Place opened. A high-end residential tower that houses 346 units. On 2011, the Hess Tower was built, a 29-story office building. On 2016, the Marriott Marquis convention hotel was built north of the park. A hotel that holds over 1,000 rooms.\nThe park earned LEED certification in October 2009.\nThe Kinder Foundation provided $10 million to help fund the $125 million project.\nDesign Process\nHargreaves Associates and their team of architects, engineers, and artists took thirteen months to design and finalize the park. Notable challenges would be the dense intersection and the intricate design of implementing the garage with the surface park.\nThe park is placed in the center of two juxtaposing cross axes.\nThe linear plaza is lined by a multitude Mexican Sycamore trees and uniquely designed pavement.\nDue to the straight nature of the path, it supports farmers markets, art fairs and parades.\nPark features\n]]\n* Anheuser-Busch Stage - a performance stage\n* Jones Lawn - a  grass lawn for lounging, offering views of the skyline\n* The Brown Foundation Promenade - a shaded walkway, lined with 100-year-old live oak trees\n* Wortham Foundation Gardens -  of flowering trees, plants, fountains and works of art\n* Kinder Lake - a  lake lined with native wetland plants\n* Gateway Fountain - The fountain offers a view of water activity atop a sloping granite surface to the park\n* The Natural Gardens - wetland and upland gardens extending the length of the park\n* The Landforms - several sculpted grassy knolls with views of downtown Houston\n* McNair Foundation Jogging Trail - tree-shaded promenades on which to stroll to the lake and children’s area\n* Maconda's Grove - where persons can play bocce on the Carruth Foundation Bocce Courts\n* The John P. McGovern Playground, renovated in 2021\n* Hagstette Putting Green\n* Two dog runs - one for large dogs and another for smaller dogs with seating areas for their owners\n* Approximately 630-car underground parking garage.\nThe Schiller Del Grande Restaurant Group, best known as the creators of Cafe Annie, operates two restaurants on site.  The Grove serves lunch and dinner in a \"signature restaurant\" setting, while The Lake House offers casual fare.\nOn occasions Discovery Green has an ice skating rink.\nPublic art\n*Monument au Fantóme - A piece of artwork by Jean Dubuffet donated by Dan Duncan was moved from 1100 Louisiana in downtown Houston in October 2007 after some restoration.  The estimated value of this sculpture is $1 million, including restoration. It was created between 1969 and 1971 as part of the Hourloupe series.\nFile:DuBuffet.jpeg|Monument au Fantóme by DuBuffet\n*Synchronicity of Color - Nationally acclaimed artist Margo Sawyer's installation graces both exits of the underground garage, with accents at The Grove and The Lake House. The 151 panels hold 1,500 aluminum boxes in 65 colors. The paint on these boxes is also used in under water applications for oil rigs and was gifted by International Paint LLC. Some elements are kamelion car paint color and also Dicroic film, a new technology and application.\n*Listening Vessels - Sculptor Doug Hollis’ Listening Vessels, a gift from Maconda Brown O’Connor, sits in the midst of the Urban Gardens, an ideal setting for these serene and graceful pieces. The two parabolas, cut from solid limestone and spaced  apart, epitomize Hollis’ desire to call attention to events that are taken for granted, such as conversation. Visitors are intended to come across the vessels and gain an understanding of their function as they realize they can hear the words of another person speaking at a normal volume, a great distance away.\n*Mist Tree - Hollis also created the Mist Tree, a gift from Fayez Sarofirm, located next to the playground. The Mist Tree is a -high-by-22-foot-wide stainless steel structure that is sited to attract people to the park. Visible from beyond the park’s boundaries, the rain curtain and mist streams generated by the tree will entice children and adults to refresh themselves in its delightful shower.\nImage:Misttreediscoverygreen.JPG|Mist Tree\nPlanned events and uses\nDiscovery Green offers a variety of programming throughout the year.
