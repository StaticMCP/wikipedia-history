He was a son of Fujiwara no Michinaga.\nCareer\nYoshinobu was the guardian of Yōmeimon-in, thus, after she gave birth to Emperor Go-Sanjo in 1034, he was made the young Prince's guardian. The two appear to have had a good relationship, and that (in addition to the lack of male heirs from the Fujiwara consorts of Go-Sanjo's brother, Go-Reizei) it was the main reason that Go-Sanjo ascended to the throne. Emperor Shirakawa is reported to have said this himself.\nGeneaology\nDetails on marriage and children are unclear, but he does appear to have had at least two children, Fujiwara no Yoshinaga and Fujiwara no Moshi.\nReferences"
