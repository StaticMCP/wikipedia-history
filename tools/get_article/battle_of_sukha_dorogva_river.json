A key element of his strategy was to conclude an alliance with Mstislav Mstislavich, which made it possible to regain lost lands.\nThis alliance was met with displeasure by Leszek the White, who perceived it as an attempt to make the Romanovichi independent from Polish sovereignty. In response, the Duke of Kraków organised a retaliatory expedition. In the spring of 1218, Polish troops invaded the lands along the Bug River, but the Ruthenian forces, led by the boyars Gavrilo Dushilovich, Semyon Ohiyevich and Vasyl Gavrilovich, defeated them. Poles were forced to retreat as far as the Wieprz River, and Daniel's triumphant army returned to Vladimir, leading the captured captives. The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle states that the site of the battle was Sukha Dorogva River.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
