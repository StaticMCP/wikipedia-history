He arranged finance from New World but says \"then there was a regime change at the studio, and behind my back they hired another writer and rewrote the script. They only told me this one week before shooting, and said that if I didn’t like it, then they’ll get this new screenwriter to direct it as well. I freaked out. It was a gorgeous, sensitive, coming-of-age movie, but they had turned it into some silly comedy. I was so destroyed by this. I felt I’d been, well, raped.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
