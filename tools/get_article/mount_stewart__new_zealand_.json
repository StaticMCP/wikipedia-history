It is set at the southern end of Jellicoe Ridge in the Southern Alps of the South Island. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north and east slopes drains to the Crow River, whereas the south and west slopes drain into the Waimakariri River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the Waimakariri River Valley in 2.5 kilometres, and  above the Crow Valley in 1.5 kilometres. The nearest higher peak is Mount Guinevere, 2.1 kilometres to the north.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Stewart is located in a marine west coast (Cfb) climate zone. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upwards by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain or snow. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nClimbing\nThe first ascent of the summit was made in 1927 by R.R. Chester, I.W. Tucker, C.W. Evans, and A.H. Candy via the Southeast Ridge.\nClimbing routes:\n* South East Ridge\n* North East Ridge\n* From the West\n* Via Lower Crow River\nGallery\nFile:Turkey Flat from Bealey Spur, Canterbury, New Zealand 02.jpg|Mount Stewart centred on skyline\nFile:Bealey Bridge.jpg|Mount Stewart to right\nFile:Anti Crow Hut track, Arthur's Pass, Canterbury, New Zealand 17.jpg|Mount Stewart right of centre\nFile:Mt Stewart from Bealey Spur Track, Canterbury, New Zealand 18.jpg|Mount Stewart from Bealey Spur Track\nSee also\n* List of mountains of New Zealand by height\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Mount Stewart: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-2182338/New%20Zealand/Canterbury/Selwyn%20District/Mount%20Stewart weather]"
