Encompassing an area of about 25 square kilometers, the wind farm consists of 55 turbines producing 99 megawatts of power, surpassing the Kent Hills Wind Farm in New Brunswick by 3 megawatts. While about 10% of the power is sold to the city of Summerside, the rest is exported through New Brunswick to New England markets. The wind farm was established in 2009 by GDF Suez of France (now Engie) on land leased from local owners. The project was valued at CDN$200 million when completed, and was the largest single project on the Island since construction of the Confederation Bridge (1990s).\nReferences"
