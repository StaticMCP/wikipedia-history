The Natives tour was captained and organised by Fred Warbrick's brother Joe, who had played with the New Zealand team on their 1884 tour of New South Wales. Joe Warbrick eventually selected 26 players for the team, which consisted mostly of Māori or part-Māori, but also several European \"Pakeha\". Along with Joe and Fred there were three other Warbrick brothers in the side: Alfred, Arthur, and Billy.\nAfter an internal tour of New Zealand, the side toured Australia, the British Isles, Australia again, and finally New Zealand. The side played at least 107 rugby matches in total, and Fred played in at least 65 of those, including a minimum of 41 in the British Isles.}} He was included in two of the Natives matches against international sides—the win over Ireland and the loss to Wales. Following the tour Fred moved to Australia, where he played club rugby for Arfoma, and represented Queensland in 1892 and 1893.\nHe died on 8 January 1904 from tuberculosis contracted after trying to rescue several people following a boating accident.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
