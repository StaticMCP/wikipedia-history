It is part of the Hartington Nether Quarter parish, and is in the Peak District National Park.\nIt is just off the A515 road between Ashbourne and Buxton. National Cycle Network routes 68 and 548 pass through the village.\nBiggin was once known as Newbiggin, when it had a monastic settlement of the Cistercian order, established by the monks of Garendon Abbey, Leicestershire. The monks established a sheep ranch at Biggin Grange, which still has one ancient outbuilding. Farming is still important to the village, though at one time (18th century) it was also a centre of lead mining. When the lead started to be worked out, there was a migration of lead miners to Upper Teesdale, and they probably took the name Newbiggin there. Today tourism is an important industry alongside farming.\nSee also\n* Listed buildings in Hartington Nether Quarter\n* Dovedale\n* Tissington Trail\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.hartingtonanddistrict.co.uk/biggin.php Biggin tourist site]\n*[http://www.peakdistrictinformation.com/towns/biggin.php Other Biggin tourist site]"
