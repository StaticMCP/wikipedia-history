He operated a real estate firm known as Peters Land Co., founded in 1890, and was a member of the Atlanta City Council, and donated the land for Peters Park in 1887.\nHe sold off the land for the development of what is now the southern half of Midtown Atlanta (below 8th Street, as far west as Atlantic St. on the Georgia Tech campus, to Argonne St. east of Piedmont).\nPeters also served as president of the Atlanta Savings Bank, the Exposition Cotton Mills, and was one of the organizers of the Fourth National Bank in Atlanta.\nPersonal life\nOn November 19, 1878, Peters was married to Macon native, Helen Wimberly (d. 1936), the daughter of Ezekiel Wimberly and Mary Victoria (née Holt) Wimberly.

Peters died on February 1, 1937, in Atlanta and was buried at Westview Cemetery.\nResidence\nPeters' residence, the Edward C. Peters House, built in 1883 and designed by architect G. L. Norrman in the Queen Anne style, on the southwest corner of Ponce de Leon Avenue and Piedmont, is now used by the Savannah College of Art and Design and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
