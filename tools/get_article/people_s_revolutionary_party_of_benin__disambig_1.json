It was founded in 1975 by General Mathieu Kérékou. With the new constitution of 30 November 1975, PRPB became the sole legal party in the country.[http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/benin/beninpaysfiche/chronopol.htm Chronologie BENIN]  Ideologically, the party stated it was committed to Marxism–Leninism, although in practice was broadly nationalist.\nHistory\nIn 1972, the former French colony of Republic of Dahomey had a coup d'état with Major Mathieu Kérékou taking over the country. In 1975, he announced that Dahomey was to be renamed Benin and the new People's Revolutionary Party of Benin would be founded to take part in elections. It was later decided that the PRPB would be the sole legal political party in a one-party state following Communist principles.\nIn the parliamentary elections of 1979, 1984 and 1989, PRPB was the only party contesting. In 1979, the lists of the party received 1,243,286 votes (97.9%), in 1984 the lists of the party received 1,811,208 votes (98.1%) and in 1989 the lists of the party received 1,695,860 votes (89.6%).\nIn 1989, the party renounced Marxism–Leninism as its official ideological guidance after the 1989 election. They also repealed the one-party state law and allowed for new political parties to be formed. It remained the governing force of Benin until 1990. The party then dissolved with Kérékou standing in the 1991 Beninese presidential election as an independent rather than under the PRPB label. It was succeeded by the Union of Forces of Progress.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!Party candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Result\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |President elected by the National Revolutionary Assembly\n|-\n|1980\n|rowspan=3|Mathieu Kérékou\n|336\n|100%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1984\n|196\n|100%\n|Elected\n|-\n|1989\n|206\n|100%\n|Elected\n|}\nNational Revolutionary Assembly elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!Election\n!Party leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!Position\n!Result\n|-\n|1979\n|rowspan=3|Mathieu Kérékou\n|1,248,613\n|98.3%\n|}}\n| 336\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|1,811,808\n|98.2%\n|}}\n| 140\n| 1st\n|\n|-\n|1989\n|1,695,860\n|89.6%\n|}}\n| 10\n| 1st\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* National League of Patriotic Youth\nReferences"
