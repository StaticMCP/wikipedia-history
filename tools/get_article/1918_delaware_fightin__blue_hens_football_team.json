In its first and only season under head coach Milton Aronowitz, the team compiled a 1–2–2 record and was outscored by a total of 44 to 19. Harry W. Loose was the team captain. The season was shortened due to travel restrictions resulting from World War I and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.\nSchedule\n|Frazer Field|Newark, DE|T 0-0|\n|November 9||USS Minnesota|Frazer Field|Newark, DE|T 6-6|\n|November 16|at|Swarthmore||Swarthmore, PA|L 0-29|\n|November 23|||Frazer Field|Newark, DE|L 0-9|\n}}\nReferences"
