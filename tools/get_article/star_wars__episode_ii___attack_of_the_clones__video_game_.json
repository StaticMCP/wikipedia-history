      "text": "# Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (video game)\n\n|EU|June 21, 2002}}\n|genre = Action\n|modes = Single-player\n}}\nStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones is an action game based on the 2002 film of the same name, developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by THQ for the Game Boy Advance. The game was first announced by THQ and LucasArts in February 2002, months prior to the film's release.\nGameplay\nThroughout 11 levels, the player can play as three of the film's main protagonists: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and Anakin Skywalker. They are also able to fight various enemies, as well as bosses such as Count Dooku and Jango Fett. The game's plot covers important events from Attack of the Clones such as Anakin battling the Sand People, Obi-Wan tracking Jango and his son Boba, and the Jedi Order's climactic battle with Dooku and the Separatists.\nThe levels play across planets from the film, including Tatooine, Coruscant, and Geonosis, and can differ in terms of gameplay. Most levels are played in a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up manner on foot, in which the player's lightsaber can be used for slashing and deflection attacks. Some levels play out as 3D first-person vehicular chase sequences, such as the speeder chase through Coruscant in pursuit of bounty hunter Zam Wesell early in the film.\nReception\n| MC = 38/100\n| Allgame =\n| CVG = 3/10\n| EGM = 2.17/10\n| GI = 1/10\n| GamePro =\n| GSpot = 3.7/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 6/10\n| IGN = 6.5/10\n| NP = 2.7/5\n}}\nThe game was met with generally negative reception. Reasons include its control issues, simple difficulty, poor level designs and dated password system. Game Informer gave it an abysmal 1/10, calling it \"the dark side of gaming.\" The game so far has a score of 38.89% from GameRankings and 38 out of 100 from Metacritic.  However, a few reviewers, including IGN, thought the game was fine and gave a more forgiving review of it.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
