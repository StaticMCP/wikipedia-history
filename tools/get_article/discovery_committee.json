Particularly extensive was the new data related to all aspects of the island of South Georgia.  Among the results of the investigations was also the discovery of the natural boundary of Antarctica, the Antarctic Convergence.\nSee also\n* Discovery Investigations\n* History of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\nReferences\n* Robert K.
