The film is shot in a semidocumentary style with police procedural voice-over narration in parts. Without Warning! was first released commercially on DVD in 2005. Initially, it was considered lost and unavailable for viewing.\nPlot\nCarl Martin resides in Los Angeles, California. He makes his living tending gardens. He also murders young blondes with a pair of shears. Despite police efforts, Martin continues waging his killing spree. Detective Lieutenant Pete Hamilton is assigned the case, assisted by Sergeant Don Ward. They thumb through official files, putting together a list of recent unsolved cases. The victims were all blonde women. They met their deaths around the end of various months. Since it is now the end of the next month, the detectives anticipate another killing. And they are correct. But this time, the elusive murderer is identified by multiple witnesses, including two motorcycle officers. Yet they remember very little regarding the suspect's physical appearance. One officer was knocked out from behind; the other was wounded while chasing the fleeing suspect.\nAfterwards, Martin returns to his residence, a shack on a hill overlooking Chavez Ravine. He feels lucky that the police know little about his identity. In the days that come, it will take the death of one additional woman plus the manhandling of another before Hamilton and Ward are able to nail Martin.\nCast\n* Adam Williams as Carl Martin\n* Meg Randall as Jane Saunders\n* Ed Binns as Lt.
