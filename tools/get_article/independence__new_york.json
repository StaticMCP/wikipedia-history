The population was 1,095 at the 2020 census. The town is in the southeast corner of Allegany County, southeast of the village of Wellsville.\nHistory\nThe first permanent settlement occurred in 1819 at Whitesville, although an attempt was made to settle the town in 1798. The town of Independence was formed in 1821 from part of the town of Alfred. Independence was reduced by the formation of the towns of Andover (1824) and Willing (1851). Historians have found no particular reason as to why the name Independence was chosen.\nFrom November 16, 1896, through June 1936 Whitesville was served by the New York & Pennsylvania Railway (and predecessors) as part of its Canisteo to Ceres (via Greenwood, Genesee, Oswayo and Shinglehouse) main line. Following severe floods in July 1935 the railroad was partially out of service, and its abandonment in June 1936 was readily approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission which from an early date approved railroad abandonment to promote highway truck use. The loss of railroad service did much to accelerate economic decline of the Whitesville area.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.\nThe southern town line forms a border with Pennsylvania and the eastern town line is the border with Steuben County.\nNew York State Route 248 is a major east–west highway in the town that intersects with New York State Route 248A (Cryder Creek Road) west of the community of Whitesville.\nCryder Creek is a stream flowing out the southwest of the town, and Chenunda Creek flows across the northern part of the town.
