In Austria, it is mandatory in the state of Salzburg, while PEGI is mandatory in Vienna.\nRatings\nThe USK uses an age-rating system to designate whether a computer game may be publicly supplied to children and young persons. Retailers are obliged to comply with the restrictions indicated by the rating. For example, a game approved for children aged 12 and above may not be sold to a 10-year-old. Outside of business relations (e.g., parents or adult friends giving the game to a child or youth) there is no such restriction. Advertisement for games rated USK 18 or below is not restricted only if the advertisement itself has no content that is harmful to minors.\nSymbols\nA series of colored symbols is used to indicate ratings. Until 2003, all the rating symbols were yellow, except for USK 18, which was red. In 2003, the symbols were redesigned to add colour coding: white for 0, yellow for 6, green for 12, blue for 16 and red for 18. The symbols were again redesigned in 2009.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! Description\n! Symbol\n|-\n| Approved without age restriction in accordance with Art. 14 German Children and Young Persons Protection Act (JuSchG). - Games without age restriction are games which are directly aimed at children and young persons as well as at an adult buyer group.\n|\n|-\n| Approved for children aged 6 and above in accordance with Art. 14 German Children and Young Persons Protection Act (JuSchG). - These games mostly involve family-friendly games which may be more exciting and competitive (e.g. via faster game speeds and more complex tasks)\n|\n|-\n| Approved for children aged 12 and above in accordance with Art. 14 German Children and Young Persons Protection Act (JuSchG). - These games feature much more of a competitive edge. Game scenarios contain little violence, enabling players to distance themselves sufficiently from events.\n|\n|-\n| Approved for children aged 16 and above in accordance with Art. 14 German Children and Young Persons Protection Act (JuSchG). - These games may include acts of strong violence, war themes, and framework story. In multiplayer games, framing can take place through competitions.\n|\n|-\n| Not approved for young persons in accordance with Art. 14 German Children and Young Persons Protection Act (JuSchG). - These games almost always involve violent game concepts and frequently generate a dark and threatening atmosphere. This makes them suitable for adults only. These games often contain brutal, strong bloody violence and/or glorify war and/or human rights violations.\n|\n|}\nContent descriptors\nIn January 2023, the USK began using various content descriptors alongside their age ratings. These include descriptors specifying the level of violence, horror, sexual content, profanity and drug and alcohol use.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Official translation\n!Description\n|-\n|Alkohol\n|Alcohol\n|The consumption of alcohol is portrayed positively or frequently.\n|-\n|Angedeutete Gewalt\n|Implied violence\n|Violence is depicted in an abstract and unrealistic manner, with no visible physical contact between characters.

Titles that are on this list may only be sold on request to adults 18 or older, are not to be advertised in any media or put on display in retail stores. German retail stores, mail order and internet vendors tend to sell only games that do have a USK rating, due to the massive restrictions. These games are still sold from vendors outside Germany into the German market.\nVideo games that are rated by the USK are protected from the indexing process. Many publishers and developers choose to release edited versions of their games to try to receive an USK-18-rating, fearing the same negative sales impact an AO rating would have in the US, out of fear that an unrated title might be indexed. Games without an USK rating are treated like an indexed game.\nRestrictions\nUp through 2018, USK had refused to rate games that contained imagery of anti-constitutional groups, including Nazis, Neo-Nazis, and the Ku Klux Klan, as required by Strafgesetzbuch (German code) section 86a, effectively making them unavailable to purchase in retail channels. While Section 86a included a “social adequacy” clause that allowed such images to be used in areas like education, science, and art (including literature and film), video games were not considered as qualifying under that section USK enforced. To publish affected games in Germany, developers and publishers had to strip out and replace objectionable images. One example is Wolfenstein: The New Order, which replaced swastikas on uniforms with a fictional symbol.\nIn August 2018, USK announced that the German government would relax this Section 86a restriction on video games, as long as the imagery included falls within the “social adequacy” allowance. USK evaluates how relevant imagery is used and reject games they believe fail to meet the social adequacy allowance. In 2019, the simultaneously released Wolfenstein: Youngblood and Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot were the first games allowed to depict Nazi imagery under the “social adequacy clause”. Despite being officially rated by USK, major German retailers, such as MediaMarkt, Saturn, and GameStop, refused to sell the uncensored version, offering only the separately sold German version without Nazi imagery and references.\nSince 2021 games in Germany are mandated to be rated as a prerequisite to being sold on digital platforms with minor access.\nSee also\n* , the equivalent rating system for film\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://usk.de/en/ Official website]\n* [http://www.usk.de/en/classification/age-rating-symbols/ Ratings explained]\n* [http://www.bundespruefstelle.de/bpjm/Jugendmedienschutz/Wegweiser-Jugendmedienschutz/pc-und-konsolenspiele,did=33032.html BPJM Ratings explained ]"
