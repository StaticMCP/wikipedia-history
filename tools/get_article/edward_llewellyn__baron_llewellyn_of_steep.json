Llewellyn left Eton in 1983 and spent a brief amount of time working at Conservative Central Office, before going up to New College, Oxford, where he was Steward (i.e.'' President) of the College JCR. New College contemporaries include Rageh Omaar, Steve Hilton and Ian Katz.\nThe UK Government website states that Llewellyn spent four years (from 1988 to 1992) working for the Conservative Research Department, including a year as Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher.\nPolitical and diplomatic career\nAfter Oxford, Llewellyn was engaged as an aide to Governor Chris Patten in Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997, as a member of Patten's 'Cabinet' following Patten's appointment as a European Commissioner from 1999 to 2002, and then as Chief of Staff to former Liberal Democrat Leader Paddy Ashdown in his role as High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2002 to 2005.\nAppointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1997 Birthday Honours, Llewellyn was promoted to Officer of the same Order (OBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours.\nIn July 2021, Lord Llewellyn was appointed an Honorary Captain in the Royal Naval Reserve.\nChief of Staff to David Cameron\nFollowing David Cameron's victory at the Conservative leadership election in December 2005, Llewellyn was hired to be Cameron's personal chief of staff in his capacity as Leader of HM Opposition, continuing in this role until 2010.\nCoalition negotiations\nHe served as part of the Conservative Party's negotiating team, along with George Osborne, William Hague and Oliver Letwin, when negotiating a prospective deal with the Liberal Democrats after the 2010 general election. Their negotiations being successful, the Conservative–LibDem coalition agreement was drawn up leading to the formation of the coalition government in 2010.\nDowning Street Chief of Staff\nCameron became Prime Minister and appointed Llewellyn to the post of Downing Street Chief of Staff. In July 2011, several newspapers reported that Llewellyn asked Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates not to speak to Cameron about the News International phone hacking scandal.\nOn 14 May 2015 following the Conservatives' general election victory, Llewellyn was sworn of the Privy Council.\nHouse of Lords\nIn August 2016, Llewellyn was nominated for elevation as a life peer in David Cameron's Resignation Honours, being created on 20 October 2016 as Baron Llewellyn of Steep, of Steep, in the County of Hampshire.
