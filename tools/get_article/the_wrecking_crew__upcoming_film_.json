It stars Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista, Claes Bang, Temuera Morrison, Jacob Batalon, Frankie Adams, Miyavi, Maia Kealoha, Stephen Root, and Morena Baccarin.\nPremise\nTwo half-brothers, a loose cannon cop (Momoa) and a disciplined Navy SEAL (Bautista), must work together to unravel a conspiracy behind their father's murder in Hawaii.\nCast\n* Jason Momoa\n* Dave Bautista\n* Claes Bang\n* Temuera Morrison\n* Jacob Batalon\n* Frankie Adams\n* Miyavi\n* Stephen Root\n* Morena Baccarin\n* Hugo Borich\n* Sean Meehan\n* Joshua Hamill\n* Maia Kealoha\n* Mark R.

It is written by Jonathan Tropper. MGM won a four-way bidding war for the project in 2021 which reportedly came from an original idea from Tropper, Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista. David Leitch was once attached to direct with filming locations scouted in Hawaii, but that iteration of the project fell through due to scheduling commitments with The Fall Guy. In August 2023, Ángel Manuel Soto came onboard to direct.\nCasting\nJason Momoa and Dave Bautista were linked to roles in 2021 prior to a bidding war for the project which was won by MGM. They were confirmed in the roles in August 2023. In August 2024, Claes Bang, Temuera Morrison, Jacob Batalon, Frankie Adams, Miyavi, and Stephen Root joined the cast of the film. In September, Morena Baccarin joined the cast, with Lydia Peckham, Roimata Fox and Branscombe Richmond.\nThe film will be the final acting role of David Hekili Kenui Bell, who died on June 12, 2025. This film will mark his only other acting role in a film, as Bell previously made his film debut in the live-action remake of Lilo & Stitch, which starred fellow cast member for this film Maia Kealoha.\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on October 5, 2024, in Hawaii and New Zealand.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
