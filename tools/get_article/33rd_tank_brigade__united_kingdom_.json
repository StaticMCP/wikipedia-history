On 15 October, Brigade HQ was completed to full establishment and it became an active brigade in Eastern Command and later I Corps. Its initial composition was one Territorial Army tank battalion and two converted infantry battalions of the Royal Armoured Corps >It was based in the \"Dukeries\" area of Nottinghamshire, the 43 RTR at Welbeck Abbey, 144 RAC at Rufford Abbey and 148 RAC at Thoresby Hall.\nService\nOn 22 June 1942, the brigade dropped 'Army' from its title and became the tank brigade in 3rd Infantry Division, which had reorganised as a 'mixed' division. However, in April 1943, 3rd Division reverted to being an infantry division and, on 4 May 1943, 33rd Tank Brigade became an independent formation again.\nThe brigade's regiments had trained in the Infantry Tank role, latterly on Churchill tanks, but in the spring of 1944 converted to Sherman and Sherman Firefly medium tanks. Reflecting this changed role, 33rd Tank Brigade was redesignated 33rd Armoured Brigade on 17 March 1944.\nUnits\nThe following units served in 33rd Tank Brigade:\n* 43rd Royal Tank Regiment 18 October 1941 – 5 August 1943\n* 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps 22 November 1941 – 16 March 1944\n* 148th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps 22 November 1941 – 8 October 1943, 17 February – 16 March 1944\n* 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry 21 September 1943 – 16 March 1944\n* 1st East Riding Yeomanry 8 October 1943 – 17 February 1944\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded 33rd Tank Brigade:\n* Brigadier R.M.
