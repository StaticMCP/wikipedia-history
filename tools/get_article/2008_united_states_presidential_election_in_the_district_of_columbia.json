In D.C., voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Prior to the election, the nation's capital was considered to be a certain lock for Obama. Washington D.C. is fiercely Democratic and has voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election by large margins since 1964 when the District gained the right to electoral representation through the 23rd amendment.\nThe District of Columbia went to Democrat Barack Obama by a margin of 210,403 votes out of 225,224 votes cast, about 92% of the total vote. As of 2024, this remains the largest share of the popular vote ever won by any candidate in the District of Columbia since it was granted electoral votes in 1961. This was larger than John Kerry's in 2004, when he won the District with about 89% of the vote.\nObama received the largest vote share for a major party nominee in any jurisdiction since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 United States presidential election in Mississippi.\nPrimaries\n* 2008 District of Columbia Democratic primary\n* 2008 District of Columbia Republican primary\nCampaign\nPredictions\n16 news organizations made state-by-state predictions of the election.

D.C. is allocated three electors. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of three electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and their running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all three electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than their candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All three were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:\n*Muriel Bowser\n*Jerry S. Cooper\n*Vincent C. Gray\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in the District of Columbia\nReferences"
