The second patent covering a means to harden the surface through the application of a petroleum oil mixed with natural solidified asphalt (Albertite), of the Ritchie Mineral & Resin Oil Company, of West Virginia. His first sheet of asphalt pavement was laid down on 29 July 1870, on William Street in Newark, New Jersey. This trial used natural bitumen from West Virginia and was not very successful. An improved material containing bitumen from Pitch Lake in Trinidad and Val-de-Travers in Switzerland, was used later in New York City and on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC.\nSwiss Val-de-Travers asphalt having been used for decades in the US, as well as Europe, to surface sidewalks, the first in the US being laid in Philadelphia, in 1838, and combined with Macadam aggregates to also surface roads in France and England, from the 1850s.\nReferences"
