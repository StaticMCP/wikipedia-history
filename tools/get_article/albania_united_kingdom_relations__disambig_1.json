Albania and the United Kingdom established diplomatic relations on 8 November 1921.\nBoth countries share common membership of the Council of Europe, European Court of Human Rights, the International Criminal Court, NATO, OSCE, and the World Trade Organization. Bilaterally the two countries have a Double Taxation Agreement, an Investment Agreement, a Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a Readmission Agreement, and an Agreement on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.\nHistory\nNational Awakening era\nAubrey Herbert was a British soldier, diplomat, traveller, and intelligence officer. He was very active fighting for the cause of Albanian independence and is regarded as having considerable influence on Albania's success at obtaining eventual independence in the resulting Treaty of London (1913). He was twice offered the throne of Albania by the Albanian People.\nPrincipality era\nDuring the Albanian–Yugoslav border war of 1921, Great Britain's prime minister Lloyd George had recognized the Albanian government and also made multiple heated diplomatic protests against the Yugoslav government, demanding its withdrawal from disputed areas. Due to Britain's intervention and the possibilities of sanctions against their country, Yugoslavia ended support for The Mirdita Rebels and withdrew its troops from all Albanian territories.\nZogist era\nDiplomatic relations were established first in 1922. The first minister, Sir Henry Eyres, presented his credentials in January 1922. Eyres was succeeded by his successor, Sir Robert Hodgson in 1928 who served until 1936. Relations were interrupted in 1939 after the Italian invasion of Albania.\nThe United Kingdom supplied the Royal Albanian Army.\nRelations with the People's Republic of Albania\nThe Corfu Channel incident between ships of the Royal Navy and the Albanian Naval Force took place in the Channel of Corfu in 1946 as an early episode of the Cold War and in Anglo-Albanian relations. During first incident, Royal Navy ships came under fire from Albanian fortifications passing through the Straits of Corfu. The incident caused Albania to complain to the United Nations, leading to the Corfu Channel case, where the United Kingdom brought a case against the People's Republic of Albania to the International Court of Justice. The Court rendered a verdict under which Albania was to pay £844,000 to the United Kingdom.\nAs a result of the British broke off talks with Albania aimed at restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries. In 1981, the British Government of Margaret Thatcher proposed to the Albanian Government the restoration of diplomatic relations without preconditions on the matter of reparations, but the Albanian communist authorities did not accept it. The offer remained open and the United Kingdom continued to engage in unconditional talks. In March 1985, in Paris, talks were held on the return of Albanian gold, but they were interrupted by the death of First Secretary Enver Hoxha that month and were not resumed.\nDiplomatic relations were only restored on 29 May 1991.\nPost-1992\nOn 8 May 1992, Britain and Albania came to an agreement over the Corfu Channel case, announcing that \"Both sides expressed their regret at the Corfu Channel Incident of 22 October 1946\" and Albania agreed to pay US$2,000,000 in reparations.\nAnglo-Albanian Association\nThe Anglo-Albanian Association was founded to support the Albanian cause in Great Britain and to promote recognition of the Independent Albania. Some of the members were Edith Durham, Lord Lamington and Dervish Duma. After 1985 the Chairman of the Anglo-Albanian Association was Harry Hodgkinson, British writer, journalist, and naval intelligence officer. Its current president is Noel Malcolm. The Association also has a website [http://www.anglo-albanian.org.uk/ Website of the Anglo-Albanian Association].\nCooperation\nThe militaries of Albania and the United Kingdom have cooperated on numerous occasions, including military exercises in 2013 and 2014. The 2013 Albanian Lion exercise involved nearly 1,000 Royal Marines and . The 2014 Albanian Lion exercise saw 600 Royal Marines visit Albania.\nIn 2016, around 1,500 military personnel from the United Kingdom joined Albanian forces for Exercise Albanian Lion.\nEconomic relations\nFrom 1 April 2009 until 30 December 2020, trade between Albania and the UK was governed by the Albania–European Union Stabilisation and Association Process, while the United Kingdom was a member of the European Union.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK and Albania signed the Albania–UK Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Agreement on 5 February 2021. The Partnership, Trade and Cooperation Agreement is a continuity trade agreement, based on the EU free trade agreement, which entered into force on 1 January 2021.
