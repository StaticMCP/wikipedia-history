Panticapaeum was founded in the 7th or 6th century BC; the earliest known king of the Bosporus is Archaeanax, who seized control of the city  480 BC as a usurper. The Archaeanactid dynasty ruled the city until it was displaced by the more long-lived Spartocid dynasty in 438 BC. After ruling for over three centuries, the Spartocids were then displaced by the Mithridatic dynasty of Pontus and then its offshoot the Tiberian-Julian dynasty. The Tiberian-Julian kings ruled as client kings of the Roman Empire until late antiquity.\nAfter several successive periods of rule by groups such as the Sarmatians, Alans, Goths and Huns, the remnants of the Bosporan Kingdom were finally absorbed into the Roman Empire by Justinian I in the 6th century AD following a revolt against the Hunnic ruler Gordas.\nList of kings\nJoint rulers are indicated with indentation.\nArchaeanactid dynasty (c. 480–438 BC)\n*Archaeanax c. 480 BC–?}} His family ruled until c. 438 BC.\nSpartocid dynasty (438–111 BC)\n]]\n*Spartokos I 438–433 BC\n*Satyros I 433–389 BC\n**Seleukos 433–393 BC\n*Leukon I 389–349 BC\n**Gorgippos 389–349 BC\n*Paerisades I 349–311 BC\n**Spartokos II 349–344 BC\n*Satyros II 311–310 BC\n*Prytanis 310–309 BC\n*Eumelos 309–304 BC\n*Spartokos III 304 BC–284 BC\n*Paerisades II 284–c. 250 BC\n*Spartokos IV c. 250–c. 240 BC\n*Leukon II c. 240–210 BC\n*Hygiainon (regent) c. 210–c. 200 BC\n*Spartokos V c. 200–c. 180 BC\n*Kamasarye (queen) c. 180–c. 160 BC\n**Paerisades III c. 180–c. 170 BC\n*Paerisades IV c. 170–c. 150 BC (with Kamasarye and then alone)\n*Spartokos VI (?) c. 150–c. 140 BC\n*Paerisades V c. 140–111 BC\nScythian rule (111–110 BC)\n* Saumakos 111–110?

Details of the Bosporan Kingdom are scant thereafter but it appears to have undergone several successive periods of rule by Sarmatians, Alans, Goths and Huns. There was probably a continuous sequence of rulers but few names are known.\n* Douptounos fl. c. 483\n* Gordas fl. 527 (Hunnic ruler)\n* Mugel c. 527 (Hunnic ruler)\nMugel's rule in the Bosporus was brief; shortly after Gordas's death Justinian I sent an army to place the Bosporus under Roman rule. Mugel thereafter ruled only Patria Onoguria in the north.\nFamily tree\nThis family tree covers the rulers of the Mithridatic and Tiberian-Julian dynasties. Owing to much of the sequence of Tiberian-Julian rulers being based on coinage, the relationships within the Tiberian-Julian dynasty (especially for later rulers) are largely conjectural and speculative. Conjectural and speculative lines of descent are marked with dotted lines. Though genealogical information is completely unknown for kings after Cotys III, the repeating names lead most researchers to believe that the later kings until at least 341 were part of the same continuous dynasty.}}(Mithridates I)r. 110–63 BC|boxstyle_Mit=border-width:2.2px; background:PaleTurquoise|Mar=Mark Antonyr. 233–234|boxstyle_Rec=border-width:2.2px; background:LemonChiffon;|Inin=Ininthimeusr. 234–239|boxstyle_Inin=border-width:2.2px; background:LemonChiffon;|}}\nr. 276|The=Theothorsesr. 279–309|boxstyle_Sar=border-width:2.2px;background:LemonChiffon;|boxstyle_The=border-width:2.2px;background:LemonChiffon;|Ph=Pharsanzes (?)r. 253–254|boxstyle_Ph=border-width:2.2px;background:LemonChiffon;}}\nSee also\n*Bosporan wars of expansion\n*History of Ukraine\nNotes\nReferences"
