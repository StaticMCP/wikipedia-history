In 1961, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Arkansas in The Episcopal Church. From 1990 to 2008, he served as bishop of the Diocese of South Carolina. He was a noted conservative who remained in the Episcopal Church, unlike his former diocese.\nHe was a member of Communion Partners, an Episcopal group which opposed the 77th General Episcopal Convention's decision to authorize the blessing of same-sex marriages in 2012. The measure to allow the blessing of same-sex unions won by a 111–41 vote with 3 abstentions.\nHe chaired the board of The Anglican Digest for 41 years. After retiring from his episcopal see, Salmon served as the dean of Nashotah House Theological Seminary in Wisconsin.\nReferences"
