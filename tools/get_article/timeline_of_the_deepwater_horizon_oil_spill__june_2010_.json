It has an estimated budget of $50 million.\n:*Moody's estimates that the insured loss on the spill will be $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion. Moody's notes that BP's insured loss would have been more if it were not insuring with its captive insurer Jupiter Insurance of Guernsey. Jupiter has established loss reserves of $700 million. AM Best raises Jupiter's outlook from negative to stable. Liabilities beyond the insured losses would have to be absorbed by various involved including its three owners (BP: 65%; Anadarko Petroleum: 25%, Mitsui Oil Exploration Co. (MOECO) subsidiary of Mitsui: 10%).\n:*Transocean to be added to the Swiss Market Index on June 21.\n:*BP releases 24 ROV live streaming video feeds (2 each from the Boa Deep C, Discoverer Enterprise, Ocean Intervention III, Q4000, Skandi Neptune, Viking Poseidon).\n*June 4\n:*Tar balls arrive on beaches in Pensacola, Florida.

Hayward says BP scientists have \"no evidence\" of plumes.\n:*BP abandons plans to close three remaining vents on the containment cap noting that with one vent it is capturing as much oil as it can handle.\n*June 7\n:*A report on June 6 that oiled birds had washed ashore in Texas is called erroneous by various government officials who note the slick is more than  from Texas.\n:*Senator Bill Nelson tells MSNBC he has seen reports that oil is now rising from the sea bed itself rather a broken pipe from above indicating the BP well bore and casing integrity has failed.\n:*White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said BP could be fined $4,300 per barrel. The White House says it favors raising the $75 million cap on liability damages for drilling rigs.\n:*Officials say the cap is working and is approaching handling the maximum of  per day that its gathering drillship the Discoverer Enterprise can handle. The Helix Energy Solutions Group Q4000 is to be configured to handle the excess. The Q4000 is onsite because it was used in the failed Top kill procedure. Part of the reconfiguring involves replacing the current cap on the blowout preventer with a new larger cap.\n:*Members of the Flow Rate Technical Group, which is a government group appointed to standardize the flow estimates from the leak, say it is impossible to make calculations without high resolution video and the lack of any formal measurement of the flow. One of the members of the group, Ira Leifer, said that the current operation may have actually increased the leak multifold rather than 20 percent that BP had suggested noting that video feeds show the leak to be the same or worse than it was before.

This is over and what it is required under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Net revenue consists of the sale of oil minus royalties (18.75%) to the US Government. This only affects BP's 65% ownership share and not Anadarko's or Misui's portion.\n:*Five of the seven members of the National Academy of Engineering sign a complaint saying they had recommended a 6-month moratorium on drilling in  of water and not 500 as was announced.\n:*Price of a barrel of oil (West Texas Intermediate - Cushing, Oklahoma) $84.34.\n*June 9\n:*BP's chief operating officer Doug Suttles contradicts the underwater plume discussion noting, \"It may be down to how you define what a plume is here…The oil that has been found is in very minute quantities.\"\n:*BP announces plans to have the well testing vessel Toisa Pisces replace the Discoverer Enterprise for bringing oil to the surface and retrofitting the Q4000 to burn oil in a plan to increase the gathering capabilities from  a day.

BP made the request one day after ABC News correspondent Dan Harris interviewed the proprietor.\n:*The Guardian reports that since April 20, 2010, 27 new offshore drilling projects have been approved by MMS. All but one project was granted similar exemptions from environmental review as BP. Two were submitted by the UK firm, and made the same claims about oil-rig safety and the implausibility of a spill damaging the environment. According to the Centre for Biological Diversity, even after the catastrophe, the Obama administration did not tighten its oversight of offshore drilling. \"This oil spill has had absolutely no effect on MMS behaviour at all,\" said Kieran Suckling, the director of the centre. \"It's still business as usual which means rubber stamping oil drilling permits with no environmental review.\"\n*June 10\n:*Testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs indicates there is a not single command and control hierarchy in the cleanup and frequently BP is still taking the lead.

Oil will be stored and offloaded and gas will be flared. The plan will provide capacity of handling 38,000 barrels/day by mid-July. In addition to the previously announced permanent riser to the Toisa Pisces and Loch Rannoch, BP announces plan for a second permanent riser to the Helix Producer with oil offloaded to a yet to be determined tanker. This will increase capacity to 40 to 50,000 barrels a day by mid-July.

Two Lightering oil tankers will come from Europe (bringing the total number to three).   of 6&nbsp;inch coflexip had been acquired and will provide redundancy in the event of a subsea hose failure or loss. The changes will increase capacity to 60,000 to 80,000 barrels a day by mid July. Suttles however warns \"Several hundred people are working in a confined space with live hydrocarbons on up to four vessels...This is significantly beyond both BP and industry practice\" and adds that with so many vessels working in a relatively small area there's a risk of a \"major surface accident.\"\n:*Obama in his fourth visit to the Gulf visits Gulfport, Mississippi where he ate snow cones with Haley Barbour on an oil free beach and said \"There's still a lot of opportunity for visitors to come down here -- a lot of beaches that are not yet affected or will not be affected,\"\n:*Obama visits Theodore, Alabama where he says, \"\"I am confident that we're going to be able to leave the Gulf Coast in better shape than it was before.\"  NOAA and University of New Hampshire Coastal Response Research Center announces a mapping site geoplatform.gov\n:*5,000 pound tank from the Deepwater Horizon washes ashore in Miramar Beach, Florida\n:*Keith P.
