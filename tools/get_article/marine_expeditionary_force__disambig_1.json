NATO Map Symbol\n|-\n|\n|}\n__TOC__\nStructure\nA MEF is larger than a Marine expeditionary unit (MEU) or Marine expeditionary brigade (MEB).\nEach MEF consists of a MEF Information Group (MIG) as the command element, a Marine division (MARDIV) as the ground combat element, a Marine aircraft wing (MAW) as the aviation combat element, and a Marine logistics group (MLG) as the logistics combat element.\nThe MEF also contains a Special Operations Training Group (SOTG) and is the training section component for the MEU and MEB.
