It was one of several comedies featuring Belinda Lee.\nReception\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Unfortunately the action does not fizz; the bubbles never quite come to the surface; and there is the inevitable song and dance dream sequence, which might be dispensed with. Reg Dixon, as the inventor, and Lionel Jeffries, as the village tobacconist, play quite amiably\"\nKine Weekly wrote: \"The picture, a queer mixture of the amateurish and the slick, has its moments, but they barely outweigh its flat spots. Reg Dixon works tirelessly and sings occasionally, yet finds the going rough as Reg, but Lionel Jeffries draws amusing character as Pogson, Myrtle Rowe effectively plays hard to get as Milly, and Belinda Lee introduces a touch of sex as a sweater girl sccretary. The rest are so-so. The second half is infinitely brighter than the first and luckily enables it to end on a lively note. In all, a harmless, typically English romp.\"\nPicture Show wrote: \"Reg Dixon makes one of his rare film appearances in this bright comedy as a chemist who invents an anti-smoking pill. Amusing performances also come from Lionel Jeffries, Myrtle Rowe and Belinda Lee. There are pleasant tunes.\"\nThe Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 2/5 stars, writing: \"Notable only for its anti-smoking theme in a period where no one bothered about puffing away on a cigarette, this gentle comedy ends up a wasted opportunity, though the cast give their all.\"\nIn British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959 David Quinlan rated the film as \"mediocre\", writing: \"Potty comedy doesn't catch fire.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20191006214013/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b1b4a2f No Smoking] at BFI\n* [https://www.reelstreets.com/films/no-smoking/ No Smoking] at Reel Streets\n* [https://letterboxd.com/film/no-smoking-1955/ No Smoking] at Letterbox DVD"
