Recent acquisitions of stakes in KazGerMunai and CITIC Canada Energy Limited, mid-sized oil producers in Kazakhstan, helped its stock return around 111.7% by the end of 2007 from the date of the IPO and listings on London Stock Exchange and Kazakhstan Stock Exchange.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kmgep.kz/eng KazMunaiGas Exploration Production Corporate website]"
