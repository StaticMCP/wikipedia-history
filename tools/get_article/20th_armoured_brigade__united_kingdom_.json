However, the brigade was moved to Münster, Germany in December 1951 to supplement the British contribution to NATO forces in Europe, where it again came under the command of 6th Armoured Division, this time as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).\nThe 1957 Defence White Paper announced the end of National Service, resulting in a number of reductions and changes across the armed forces. Part of this restructuring saw the disbandment of the 6th Armoured Division in April 1958. The Brigade survived as the new 20th Armoured Brigade Group, initially under the command of the 4th Infantry Division, and moved to Hobart Barracks, Detmold. It assumed the insignia of the old Division – the \"Iron Fist\" symbol that it wears to this day.\nThe pattern of life was determined by the BAOR training cycle and the demands of higher formation exercises as politicians and military commanders considered how best to face the threat of a Soviet invasion. Brigade troops frequently found themselves supporting multi-national NATO exercises, often working alongside the fledgling Bundeswehr (German Army). In October 1961, the Brigade participated in Exercise Spearpoint which was designed to demonstrate that the BAOR was able to conduct large-scale intensive operations under both conventional and nuclear conditions.\nIn September 1959, The Royal Corps of Signals reorganised all of their independent squadrons into a single numbering system from 200 upwards. This meant that when the Brigade's Signal Squadron adopted the title \"200\" in 1962 it automatically became the 'Senior Signal Squadron' in the British Army by precedence. Two years later it amalgamated with the brigade's Headquarters Squadron and took over responsibility for the administration and defence of the HQ and together the two separate units are designated as \"20th Armoured Brigade Headquarters and Signal Squadron (200)\".\nOn 22 June 1974, 20th Armoured Brigade and the German 21st Panzer Brigade, based in Augustdorf, held a partnership parade to emphasise the confidence and understanding that exists between the allied forces of the NATO countries.\nBAOR experimented with a major restructuring towards the end of the 1970s as it reorganised into four divisions, each with two task force headquarters. These task forces could command any grouping of units from within their division and were designated sequentially Alpha through Hotel. As a result, on 1 December 1977, 20th Armoured Brigade was temporarily renamed \"Task Force Hotel\" under the command of the 4th Armoured Division. However, Task Force Hotel reverted to its brigade designation on 1 January 1980 and its units were realigned under the Brigade Headquarters.\nFurther unit rotations continued throughout this period with many famous regiments and battalions of the British Army converting to the armoured role to serve within the brigade. Typical were the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, who served on a four-year rotational plan. As the Life Guards Regiment moved to BAOR, it became a Tank Regiment for the first time in its history, only to re-role as an infantry battalion in order to deploy on three separate operational tours of Northern Ireland.\nPost-Cold War\nFollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and the anticipated peace dividend at the end of the Cold War, the British government announced a series of cuts in defence spending under the 1990 \"Options for Change\" programme. As a result of the restructuring, in December 1992, the Brigade merged with the 33rd Armoured Brigade and moved its headquarters to Barker Barracks, Paderborn, where it came under the command of the 1st (UK) Armoured Division. By 1994, the overall troop strength in Germany had been halved and BAOR was replaced by British Forces Germany (BFG).Headquarters 20th Armoured Brigade, with some elements of the Brigade deployed to the former SFR Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1995 to take command of Sector South West under the United Nations mandate. Based at Gornji Vakuf in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, the commander was responsible for a large multi-national UN force as well as having responsibility for all forces in FRY. The end of the tour coincided with a declaration of peace and a shift in emphasis to a larger NATO force.\nIn October 1996, the Brigade returned to FRY as part of Multi-National Division (South-West). It was initially based at Šipovo, moving to Banja Luka in December 1996, whilst overseeing the transition from IFOR to SFOR and Operation RESOLUTE to Operation LODESTAR. The Brigade returned to Paderborn in April 1997.\nIn August 1999, the Brigade again deployed to Banja Luka on Operation PALATINE. It returned to Paderborn in December 1999, and moved to Antwerp Barracks, Sennelager on 20 August 2001.\nOperation Telic (Iraq)\nIn October 2003, the Brigade first deployed to southern Iraq on Operation Telic 3, where it was based at Basra Palace. The Brigade's first two-months of the deployment was dominated by low-level battles against fanatical Fedayeen and foreign fighters infiltrating across the border with Iran who were actively supported by Iranian Al Quds forces, post-operational reports also mention former Ba'athist regime loyalists. Before their deployment, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1511 was passed, which set the basis for rebuilding Iraq and establishing security. The aim was to eventually transfer authority from the Coalition Provisional Authority to an Iraqi Transitional National Assembly. The middle two months of the Brigade's tour was dominated by security sector reform, to achieve this aim meant the building of capacity in the Iraqi Security Forces (especially the paramilitary Iraqi Civil Defence Corps and police) and civilian Iraqi institutions. Security sector reform would remain an objective for the rest of the tour. The final two months of Operation Telic 3 were dominated by high-intensity operations against resurgent Shia militias (notably the Jaish al Mahdi (JAM).\n20th Armoured Brigade was awarded the Freedom of the City of Paderborn by the town council on 28 May 2005. The right to exercise the freedom was presented \"as a contribution for consolidation of the Anglo-German friendship, the joint solidarity in NATO and a further element for the building of the joint house Europe\".\nThe Brigade returned to southern Iraq again in April 2006 during Operation TELIC 8, and was situated in Basra, Al Amarah and Al Muthanna Provinces. During the seven month summer tour, the troops contributed to the successful handover of security in two of the four Iraqi Provinces within the Multinational Division (South East) [MND(SE)].\nThe Iron Fist returned to Basra for a third time in 2008 for Operation TELIC 13. It became the last British brigade to serve in Iraq at the end of the UK's six-year combat mission in the country on 30 April 2009.\nOperation Herrick (Afghanistan)\n20th Armoured Brigade took over command of Task Force Helmand in Afghanistan from 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines on 9 October 2011, officially marking the start of Operation Herrick 15.\nFuture\nUnder the Army's new 2020 structure, in January 2015 the Brigade was retitled to 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade incorporating three armoured infantry battle groups. In 2016 the Brigade began its high readiness training in preparation for becoming NATO's lead for the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force Land [VJTF(L)] in 2017.\nThe Brigade Headquarters moved to Wing Barracks, Bulford, in 2019.\nUnder the Future Soldier programme, the brigade has been redesignated as the 20th Armoured Brigade, and in the future will control a reconnaissance regiment equipped with the General Dynamics Ajax.  The current armoured regiment (QRH) will be re-equipped with the Challenger 3 MBT and the armoured infantry battalions with the Warrior IFV re-equipped with the Boxer AFV.\nStructure\nThe brigade is based at Bulford Camp.
