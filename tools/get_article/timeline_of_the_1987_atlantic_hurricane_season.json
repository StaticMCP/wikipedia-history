It was a below-average season, having fewer named storms than in a normal year, that resulted in little impact throughout the Atlantic basin; the United States recorded no hurricane-related fatalities, making the 1987 season the fourth to do so since 1976. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 1987 and ended November&nbsp;30, 1987. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most systems form. Even so, a pre-season storm, Tropical Depression One, led to the season's starting on May&nbsp;25. Storm activity ended several weeks early; the final storm of the season, Tropical Depression Fourteen, dissipated on November&nbsp;4.\nThe season had fourteen tropical depressions, of which seven intensified into tropical storms&mdash;an average season has ten tropical storms&mdash;three became hurricanes and one, Emily, became a major hurricane. The inactivity throughout the basin was linked to persistent, strong vertical wind shear; most of the season's storms were unable to intensify due to the shear, resulting in a low number of named storms and hurricanes. The two most notable storms of the season were Hurricanes Arlene and Emily. Hurricane Arlene spent roughly 14.5 days as a tropical storm before intensifying into a hurricane, the longest span between these intensities on record. Hurricane Emily was the only major hurricane of the season; its wind speeds peaked at  before impacting the Dominican Republic. Three fatalities occurred in the Dominican Republic because of the storm and damages were estimated up to $80.3 million (1987&nbsp;USD).\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nMay\n;May 24\n*8:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One forms 170&nbsp;miles (275&nbsp;kilometers) east-southeast of Cockburn Town, Turks and Caicos Islands.\n;May 30\n*8:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One makes landfall on Great Abaco Island in the northern Bahamas with winds of .\n*2:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (1800&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One passes over the Berry Islands with winds of .\n;May 31\n*8:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One makes its closest approach to the Florida Keys, tracking within  of Lower Matecumbe Key with winds of .\n*8:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (0000&nbsp;UTC June&nbsp;1)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One dissipates in the Florida Strait.\nJune\n;June 1\nThe Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJuly\n* There was no tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic basin during July 1987.\nAugust\n;August 9\n*7:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;CDT (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two forms about  southeast of Houston, Texas.\n*1:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;CDT (1800&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two intensifies into a Tropical Storm but is not assigned a name.\n;August 10\n*1:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;CDT (0600&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Two makes landfall near Galveston, Texas with winds of .\n:*1:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;CDT (0600&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Two weakens into a tropical depression.\n*2:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (1800&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Three forms over Andros Island in The Bahamas.\n*8:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (0000&nbsp;UTC August 11)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Three tracks over the Berry Islands with winds of .\n*Exact time unknown&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Three makes landfall near Freeport on Grand Bahama Island.\n;August 11\n*2:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (1800&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Three intensifies into Tropical Storm Arlene roughly  northeast of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas.\n;August 13\n*11:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (1500&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Arlene makes its closest approach to Bermuda, tracking roughly  to the north with winds of .\n*8:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;AST (0000&nbsp;UTC August&nbsp;14)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Four forms about 840&nbsp;mi (1,350&nbsp;km) east-southeast of Barbados.\n;August 14\n*8:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (0000&nbsp;UTC August&nbsp;15)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two re-emerges into the Gulf of Mexico.\n;August 15\n*8:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Four dissipates roughly  northeast of the British Virgin Islands.\n*2:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;EDT (1800&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two makes landfall in Gulf County, Florida with winds of .\n;August 17\n*2:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT (0600&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Two dissipates over southeastern Georgia.\n;August 18\n*2:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (0600&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Five forms roughly  west of Dakar, Senegal.\n*8:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Five tracks over the southern Cape Verde Islands with winds of .\n*2:00&nbsp;pm&nbsp;AST (1800&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression Five strengthens into Tropical Storm Bret about  west-northwest of Brava, Cape Verde.\n;August 20\n*2:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (0600&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Bret reaches its peak intensity with winds of  while located about 710&nbsp;mi (1,145&nbsp;km) west-northwest of Brava, Cape Verde.\n;August 22\n*2:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (0600&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Arlene intensifies into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale while located about 815&nbsp;mi (1,310&nbsp;km) southwest of the Azores Islands.\n*8:00&nbsp;am&nbsp;AST (1200&nbsp;UTC)&nbsp;– Hurricane Arlene reaches its peak intensity with winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of 987 mbar (hPa;
