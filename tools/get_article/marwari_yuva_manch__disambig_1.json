Its primary goal is to support young people in contributing to their community and country. The AIMYM focuses on providing accessibility of assertive devices (e.g., prosthetic limbs and rehabilitative aids to the disabled.\nMembership is open to men and women between the ages of 18 and 40, who must have adopted the lifestyle, language and culture of Rajasthan, Haryana, Malwa in Madhya Pradesh or nearby regions. They or their forefathers must identify themselves as Marwari. The first branch of the Marwari Yuva Manch opened on 10 October 1977 in Guwahati. The organization has since grown over 750 branches across both inside and outside of India, comprising almost 55,000 members.\nPublic utility projects\n* Ambulance service\n* Blood donation service\n* Cancer Detection\n* Clean India Campaign\n* Moksh Rath (Mortuary Van)\nProject highlights\nAIMYM projects include:\n*  Calipers and artificial limbs – more than 1,00,000 limbs provided\n*  Ambulance services – Approximately 300 ambulances services running across the country\n*  Movement to Protect Girls – intensive campaign in Rajasthan and across India\n*  Clean Water Project, amrit dhara – Approximately 5,000 coolers and pyaus installed\nDisability in India\nMost of the disabled people living in India are isolated and poor. Their disability, combined with poverty and lack of education, deny them access to rehabilitation services. The AIMYM developed an appropriate, simple, informal and humane camp approach under which artificial limbs, calipers, and other aids are provided easily and free of cost at the camp site. The AIMYM organizes a large number of camps every year in various parts of the country where artificial limbs, (Jaipur prostheses), polio calipers, etc. are produced and provided on the spot.\nCancer Detection\nThe very dangerous disease that is eating up the whole world is Cancer.
