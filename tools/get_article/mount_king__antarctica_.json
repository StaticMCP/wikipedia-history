Part of the Australian Antarctic Gazetteer (Australian Antarctic Gazetteer Id 1581) and the SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica, it is located in Enderby Land, East Antarctica, which is claimed by Australia as part of the Australian Antarctic Territory. The head of Beaver Glacier is located very close to the base of Mount King.\nMount King was discovered and mapped in December, 1958, by an ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) dog-sledge party led by G.A. Knuckey. Named after Peter W. King, radio officer at Mawson in 1957 and 1958, a member of the dog-sledge party.\nFlora and fauna\nTo date, no flora or fauna have been observed within 1.0 degrees of Mount King:\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.aad.gov.au/ Australian Antarctic Division]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071030143303/http://aadc-maps.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/search_names.cfm Australian Antarctic Gazetteer]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070649/http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=12388 Australian Antarctic Names and Medals Committee (AANMC)]\n* [https://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/ United States Geological Survey, Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100818063123/http://www.scar.org/information/ Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)]\n* [http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/ Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907213041/http://aadc-maps.aad.gov.au/database/mapcat/antarctica/v4_99_00.pdf PDF Map of the Australian Antarctic Territory]\n* [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=6909 Mawson Station]\n* [http://www.anareclub.org.au/ ANARE Club]\n* [http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=8210 List of Peaks in Enderby Land]"
