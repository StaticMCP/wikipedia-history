It is relatively cheap and high in calories.\nThe Polish weekly Wprost writes that warm ice creams were an invention of nutritionists of the Polish People's Republic, one of ersatz foods, along with Polo-Cockta. Its production was renewed in modern Poland as part of PRL nostalgia.\nSimilar chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, including German Schokoküsse, Danish Flødeboller, and the Israeli Krembo were also called \"warm ice cream\" in Poland.\nIn Hungary a similar dessert is called télifagyi (\"winter ice cream\"). It was invented and reached the height of its popularity during Soviet times, but is still widely available.\nSee also\n* List of Polish dishes\nReferences"
