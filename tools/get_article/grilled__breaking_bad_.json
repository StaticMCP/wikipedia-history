It was written by George Mastras and directed by Charles Haid. The episode aired on AMC on March 15, 2009.\nThis episode marks the first appearance of Mark Margolis as Hector Salamanca, and the final appearance of Raymond Cruz as Tuco Salamanca in Breaking Bad.\nPlot\nHaving been kidnapped by Tuco Salamanca, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are held prisoner in a desert hideout where he takes care of his paralyzed and mute uncle, Hector Salamanca. Hector is incapacitated from the neck down and unable to speak, but he can communicate with a desk bell attached to his wheelchair. Tuco explains that Hank Schrader and the DEA have rounded up Tuco's entire organization. Unaware of Gonzo's death, Tuco believes that Gonzo has ratted him out. He intends to keep Walt and Jesse in the compound until his cousins arrive at sunset to take them all across the border to Mexico, where they will cook meth for Tuco 24/7.\nMeanwhile, Walt's family has realized he is missing. Hank takes time off to look for Walt. Skyler White is sick with worry and has been distributing handbills with Walt's photo. Marie Schrader, who believes Jesse is Walt's marijuana dealer, pleads with Hank to question Jesse. Hank talks to Jesse's mother, Diane Pinkman. Mrs. Pinkman supplies Hank with information letting him follow the LoJack tracking system in Jesse's car.\nAt the hideout, Walt poisons Tuco's food with the ricin he has prepared, but Hector observes this and knocks the plate off the table. Tuco realizes Walt and Jesse are plotting something and takes them outside, holding a gun to Jesse's head and forcing Walt to confess to the poisoning. With Tuco distracted, Jesse overpowers him, hitting him in the head with a rock and shooting him in the abdomen with his pistol. When they see a vehicle approaching in the distance, Walt and Jesse quickly crawl into hiding, assuming that it's Tuco's cousins. Hank exits the vehicle and confronts the injured Tuco to which Tuco responds by shooting at him, forcing Hank to fatally shoot Tuco in self defense. Hank begins to investigate the scene as Walt and Jesse silently escape.\nProduction\n\"Grilled\" was written by George Mastras and directed by Charles Haid. It aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on March 15, 2009.\nReception\nSeth Amitin, of IGN, criticized the episode for prolonging Walt and Jesse's entrance into the drug trade. He gave the episode an 8.9/10.\nIn 2019, The Ringer ranked \"Grilled\" as the 25th best out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes. Vulture ranked it 30th overall.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.amc.com/shows/breaking-bad/season-2/episode-02-grilled \"Grilled\"] at the official Breaking Bad site\n*"
