The species is endemic to the island of Hispaniola.\nTaxonomy\nIt was formerly classified in the genus Celestus, but was moved to Caribicus in 2021.\nEtymology\nThe specific name, warreni, is in honor of Mr. C. Rhea Warren who collected herpetological specimens on Île de la Tortue.\nGeographic range\nC. warreni is found in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\nDescription\nTrue to its common name, C. warreni is a large anguid, weighing in at .\nHabitat\nThe natural habitat of C. warreni are Hispaniolan moist forests underneath leaf litter and forest debris.\nDiet\nThe giant Hispaniolan galliwasp is an opportunistic predator that feed on insects, earthworms, small mammals, and other reptiles.\nConservation status\nC. warreni is threatened by habitat loss, predation by invasive species (such as the small Indian mongoose), and collection for the illegal pet trade. Persecution is also an issue; the galliwasp is erroneously believed to be venomous by locals, and is often killed on sight across the island.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Schwartz A (1970). \"A new species of large Diploglossus (Sauria: Anguidae) from Hispaniola\".
