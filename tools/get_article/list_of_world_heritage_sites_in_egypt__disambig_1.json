Blue dots represent the sites of the Nubian Monuments. |alt=Map of Egypt showing the locations of the WHS sites.  |float=right|width=300}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Egypt ratified the convention on 7 February 1974, the second country to do so, after the United States. There are seven World Heritage Sites in Egypt, and a further 34 sites on the tentative list.\nThe first sites in Egypt were listed in 1979, when five properties were inscribed. Since then, two more sites have been listed, Saint Catherine Area in 2002 and Wadi al Hitan in 2005. The latter is the only natural site in Egypt, the other sites being listed for their cultural properties. One of the key events that triggered the development of the World Heritage Convention was related to Egypt. Following the decision to construct the Aswan Dam on the Nile which would result in flooding of numerous archaeological sites in Lower Nubia, an international campaign was launched in 1959 to preserve the sites by dismantling them and reassembling them at safe locations. From 2001 to 2025, Abu Mena was listed as endangered because the rising water table was decreasing the stability of clay-based soils, resulting in threats to the structural integrity of the monuments. The situation has improved by 2024. Egypt has served on the World Heritage Committee five times.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (governorate)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Memphis and its Necropolis – the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur\n|\n| Giza\n| 1979\n| 86; i, iii, vi (cultural)\n| Memphis was the capital of the Old Kingdom of Egypt and was founded around 3000 BCE.

Construction shifted to other parts of the city in the 19th century, leaving the historical part preserved, although in the 21st century the area suffers from deterioration of the traditional urban fabric, neglect and lack of maintenance, and overcrowding. Historic Cairo features ensembles of Tulunid, Fatimid, and Mamluk buildings, including the Mosque of Ibn Tulun from the 8th century, numerous shrines, madrasas, hammams, and fountains.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Abu Mena\n|\n| Alexandria\n| 1979\n| 90; iv (cultural)\n| The Early Christian centre developed around the tomb of Menas of Alexandria, who died in 296.

The main buildings were constructed in ashlar limestone while simple houses were in mudbrick.

The monastery hosts exceptional examples of Byzantine art, as well as collections of manuscripts.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Wadi Al-Hitan (Whale Valley)\n|\n| Faiyum\n| 2005\n| 1186; viii (cultural)\n| Wadi Al-Hitan is the most important fossil site to the study of the evolution of cetaceans from terrestrial to marine mammals. Excavations have uncovered numerous often complete fossils of the earliest order of whales, archaeoceti, in the last stages of losing their hind limbs. The site also provides clues about the environment these animals lived in.\n|-\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.
