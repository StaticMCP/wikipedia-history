It thus targeted home-based enterprises and cited poverty reduction, rural development and inclusive growth and social development as secondary focuses. The ministry was part of the Rajapaksa cabinet.\nList of ministers\n;Parties\n|Sri Lanka Freedom Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|United National Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Eelam People's Democratic Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Name\n!
