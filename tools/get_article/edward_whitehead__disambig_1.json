He was also a successful executive, being head of Schweppes' American operations.\nLife and career\nWhitehead was born on 20 May 1908 in Aldershot, England. He served with the Royal Navy in World War II, attaining the rank of Commander.\nIn 1947, Whitehead was an economic advisor to Sir Stafford Cripps (then Chancellor of the Exchequer), working on training and productivity in British industry. He joined Schweppes in 1950, being responsible for foreign expansion. In 1953, he was made president of Schweppes' American operations, in the same year catching the eye of adman David Ogilvy, who was creating advertising for Schweppes. Schweppes had until 1952 been imported from Britain, and was thus an expensive niche product. In 1952 an agreement was signed with the Pepsi-Cola Company to bottle Schweppes in America, reducing the price to consumers by 75 percent. Ogilvy's remit was to convince Americans that the lowering of price was not accompanied by a lowering of quality. Ogilvy had just recently created the \"Hathaway Man\" character for C.F. Hathaway Company, featuring Baron George Wrangell as a sophisticated and talented figure with a mysterious eyepatch and convinced Whitehead (who was at first reluctant) to become an icon with similar snob appeal for Schweppes.\nand successful executive; the ad copy shows his drinkmaking expertise, concluding with a near-Bondian \"Don't stir.\" (\"Shaken, not stirred\" was James Bond's instruction for mixing his emblematic Vesper cocktail, a sign of his cultivated tastes.) Other ads portray him as a yachtsman, horseman, world traveler, horse racing aficionado, wine connoisseur, and in similar upper-class roles.]]\nBased on Whitehead's mature good looks and world-class beard, the \"Commander Whitehead\" character radiated a cultured sophistication and projected a comfortable and understated aura of confident savoir-faire and elegant taste coupled with worldly accomplishment and the aura of old money. The campaign was in heavy rotation for almost 20 years, from the mid 1950s through the 1960s. The term \"schweppervescence\" (a portmanteau of \"Schweppes\" and \"effervescence\") was used in the campaign. (Whitehead actually was a well-rounded and accomplished man, combining his military, executive, and public service achievements with pursuits such as fox hunting, sailing, skiing, and culinary expertise.)\nWhithead eventually became a director of Cadbury Schweppes Ltd., Schweppes's British parent company. He also served as chairman of the British Export Marketing Advisory Committee, as a trustee of the International Marketing Institute at Harvard, and on the board  of General Cigar Company and Cunard Lines.\nIn 1961, Queen Elizabeth awarded Whitehead the rank of CBE (Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for his achievements in exporting British products.\nWhitehead was married to Adinah Whitehead; they had two children. He died on 16 April 1978, in Petersfield at the age of 69.\n}}\nNotes\n).}}"
