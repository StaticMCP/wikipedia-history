He stood again in 1874, and was elected, but was unseated when the election was declared void on petition after \"corrupt conduct and treating\". He stood again for the seat in 1880, but was unsuccessful. Shortly before his death, Waring joined the Liberal Unionist Party. His son, Walter Waring, was later elected as the Liberal MP for Banffshire at a by-election in 1907.\nWaring was the brother of William and Henry Waring, who formed railway engineering firm Waring Brothers in 1841.\nDuring his life, Waring was made a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold of Belgium, and a Chevalier of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. He also often contributed to political journal The Fortnightly Review, writing on topics such as the railway industry and the Suez Canal.\nOn 1 April 1851, he was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
