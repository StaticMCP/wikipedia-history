The system state that identifies the working directory provides a convenient way to define the context of work. Users can use paths that are conceptually simpler and usually shorter, instead of always using  absolute paths.  For example, for working directory /home/user/data on a Unix-like system, the file name foo.txt (a relative path) refers to absolute path /home/user/data/foo.txt. System state for working directory often also applies in a graphical user interface (GUI), but often is not useful since the GUI environment maintains directory context in a different way.\nAs a feature, working directories vary by environment yet have some common, typical attributes. Typically, each process has a separate working directory, which allows users to have a different working directory for each shell running on the computer. Although common in systems that provide a hierarchical file system, the working directory feature is not required; for example, the DX10 operating system does not provide it, as all pathnames are either absolute or relative to the system volume.\nAlternate names include current working directory (CWD).}} and just current directory.\nUse\n; Change directory: Many shells provide a cd command for setting the working directory. Some systems provide a command with a different name. For example,  is an alternate name for  in DOS/Windows.\n; Report: Commands for reporting the working directory vary more than setting it. Typically, a Unix shell provides the command pwd (short for print working directory) that reports the absolute path to the working directory. The equivalent command in DOS/Windows is cd without arguments. Using cd without arguments in Unix-like systems generally sets the working directory to the user's home directory.\n; Scripting: To ease scripting development, some shells provide a variable that contains the working-directory path. Typically, a Unix-like shell provides an environment variable named PWD. Windows shells COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe provide a pseudo-environment variable named CD. Shells 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT provide _CWD, _CWDS, _CWP, and _CWPS\n; Windows shortcut: A Windows file shortcut can store the working directory.\n; Command-line prompt: The working directory is displayed by the $P token of the DOS prompt command. To keep the prompt short in a deep directory, the DR-DOS 7.07 COMMAND.COM supports a $W token to display only the deepest subdirectory level. So, where a default PROMPT $P$G would result f.e. in C:\\DOS> or C:\\DOS\\DRDOS>, a PROMPT $N:$W$G would instead yield C:DOS> and C:DRDOS>, respectively. A similar facility (using $W and $w) was added to 4DOS as well.\n; State for each DOS drive: Under DOS, the absolute path to the working directory for each logical volume is stored as the current directory structure (CDS). It is allocated at boot time with a slot for each logical drive (or as defined by LASTDRIVE). This structure imposes a length-limit of 66 characters on the full path of each working directory, and thus implicitly also limits the maximum possible depth of subdirectories.\n: DOS Plus and older issues of DR&nbsp;DOS (up to DR&nbsp;DOS 6.0, with BDOS 6.7 in 1991) had no such limitation due to their implementations using DOS emulation on top of a Concurrent DOS- (and thus CP/M-86-)derived kernel, which internally organized subdirectories as relative links to parent directories instead of as absolute paths. Since PalmDOS (with BDOS 7.0) and DR&nbsp;DOS 6.0 (1992 update with BDOS 7.1) and higher switched to use a CDS for maximum compatibility with DOS programs as well, they faced the same limitations as present in other DOSes.\n; High-level language access: Most programming-language environments provide an application programming interface to the file system for getting and setting the working directory.\n: The POSIX-defined function chdir() (accessible via C and the many languages that interoperate with it) is a system call that changes the working directory. Its argument is a text string that is a path to the target directory, either absolute or relative to the existing value.\n: Visual Basic provides the same functionality via a function with the same name.\n: In Java, the working directory can be obtained via the java.nio.file.Path interface, or the java.io.File class. The working directory cannot be changed.\nExamples\nCOMMAND.COM in DR-DOS 7.02 and higher provides ECHOS, a variant of the ECHO command that omits the terminating linefeed. This can be used to create a temporary batchjob storing the working directory in an environment variable like CD for later use.  For example:\nECHOS SET CD=> SETCD.BAT\nCHDIR >> SETCD.BAT\nCALL SETCD.BAT\nDEL SETCD.BAT\nAlternatively, under Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, various internal and external commands support a parameter /B (for \"Batch\"). This modifies the output of commands to become suitable for direct command-line input (when redirecting it into a batch file) or usage as a parameter for other commands (using it as input for another command). Where CHDIR would issue a directory path like C:\\DOS, a command like CHDIR /B would issue CHDIR C:\\DOS instead, so that CHDIR /B > RETDIR.BAT would create a temporary batchjob allowing returning to this directory later on.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNotes\nReferences\n(NB.
