The awards are named after the monolithic sculpture of the sacred bull, Nandi, at Lepakshi, a cultural and historical symbol of the Telugu people.\nThe Nandi Awards are categorised into four levels: Swarnam (Gold), Rajatam (Silver), Kamsyam (Bronze), and Raagi (Copper). In addition to film and television awards, the government also presents the Nandi Natakotsavam Awards to honour outstanding contributions in social, mythological, and poetic dramas in Telugu theatre.\nHistory\nThe Government of Andhra Pradesh commissioned the Nandi Film Awards to recognise and commend the best films produced in the Telugu language in Andhra Pradesh from 1964 onwards. The objective of the film awards is to encourage the production of films in the Telugu language with high technical excellence and aesthetic values bearing cultural, educational, and social relevance and also promoting the integration and unity of the nation. Awards are given annually and are presented in a public event on Ugadi, Telugu New Year Day. The Government has transferred the activity relating to conferring Nandi Awards to the Film Television and Theatre Development Corporation. Since 1998, the awards have been organised by them.\nThe Awards are given in the categories of feature films, feature films on national integration, children's films, documentary films, educational films, and books/articles on Telugu cinema in Telugu language for the best films, producers, directors, artistes, and technicians. The awards are usually in the form of Golden Nandi, Silver Nandi, Bronze Nandi, and Copper Nandi, in addition to medals, and commendation certificates.\nSelection criteria\nAnnually, a state panel appointed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh selects the winning entries and the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh presents the awards at the public ceremony. A list of rules is presented every year in a document of regulations. The criteria for eligibility include many clauses. Among them is a direct requirement that the film, and particularly films entering the competition, should be produced in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and in case of co-production involving a foreign entity, there are as many conditions which should be fulfilled in order for the film to qualify.\nIn order to be eligible for consideration of the jury, a film should be certified by the Central Board of Film Certification between 1 January and 31 December. The Government does not have influence over which films are selected for consideration and which films ultimately win the award. However, there are strict criteria which determine whether a film is eligible for consideration by the jury panels.\nHonorary Awards – Gold\nRaghupathi Venkaiah Award\nThe award is named after Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu, and presented annually to \"an eminent film personality for his outstanding contribution to Telugu cinema.\" (since 1980).\nNTR National Award\nThe NTR National Award is named in the memory of former chief minister and actor N.
