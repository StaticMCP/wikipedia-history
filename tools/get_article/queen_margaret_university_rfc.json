Capping off such an achievement with a 43-7 away win to the 4XV of Edinburgh University RFC.\nThe Men's side train at 6pm-8pm on Mondays and 4pm-6pm on Wednesdays\nWomen’s Rugby\nThe QMU Women's team were established in 2016, when they played a series of friendly matches across the academic year.\nTheir first ever league games were in the 2017/18 season, when they joined the SRU leagues. Shortly before leaving and joining the BUCS leagues for the 2018/19 season.\nIn May 2021, the women's side journeyed by foot from Musselburgh to Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh carrying a medical stretcher to raise funds for the Heads for Change charity; and to raise awareness of concussion in rugby union.\nThe women's side train at 6.45pm to 8.15pm on Mondays at Inch Park.\nVarsity\nEvery year towards the end of the season, both sides compete in varsity matches against Edinburgh Napier University RFC.\nThe reason why they play against Napier is due to the similar historic roots that the universities have. Both Institutions started off as colleges that specialised in certain skills, before merging and expanding with several other colleges around Edinburgh across the 20th century.\nVarsity is used as a way to celebrate the origins of both universities and promote local rivalry in all sports played within their doors.\nHonours\nMen\n* Scottish Conference 4A\n** Champions (2): 2010–11, 2018–19\n* Scottish Conference 5A\n** Champions (2): 2009–10, 2015–16\nNotable former players\nMen\nCzechia\nThe following former Queen Margaret University RFC players have represented Czechia at senior international level.\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n*  Martin Cimprich\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|}\nPhilippines\nThe following former Queen Margaret University RFC players have represented the Philippines at senior international level.\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n*  Craig Wallace\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|}\nWomen\nIreland\nThe following former Queen Margaret University RFC players have represented Ireland at senior international level.\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n*  Heather O'Brien\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|}\nRoyal Navy\nThe following former Queen Margaret University RFC players have represented The Royal Navy in senior rugby.\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n*  Rowann Sinclair\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; width:20%;\"|\n|}\nReferences"
