Daud Khalifa) during the Dungan Revolt. Yaqub Beg enlisted non Muslim Han Chinese militia under Xu Xuegong (Hsu Hsuehkung) in order to fight against the Chinese Muslims. Yaqub Beg had 1,500 Han Chinese militia with his Turkic forces attacking Dungans in Urumchi. The following year, in 1871, the Han Chinese militia switched sides and then joined the Dungans in a revolt against the Turkic forces. T'o Ming's forces were defeated by Yaqub, who planned to conquer Dzungharia. Yaqub intended to seize all Dungan territory.\nNotes\n\n---\n\n## Battle of Urumqi (1870)\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Ürümqi (1870)"
