It is a direct sequel to Light of the Jedi and The Rising Storm taking place 200 years before Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. It follows the continued conflict between the Jedi Order and the Nihil.\nPremise\nThe Jedi deal with the aftermath of tragedy and a widespread attack on the Republic Fair, dubbed the \"conflagrine on the flames\" by the \"space Vikings\" known as the Nihil. As Knights and Padawans stationed on Starlight Beacon recuperate from injuries and emotional trauma, Marchion Ro prepares his deadliest attack on the Order.\nMarketing\nThe novel's title was revealed at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2021 along with three other novels in the third wave of Light of the Jedi. The tagline associated with the third wave was \"The Light of the Jedi goes dark\", hinting at the increasingly grim direction the novel is set to take the franchise towards.\nThe first issue of a comic book, Star Wars: Halcyon Legacy (2022), features prominently a character from The Fallen Star, Nib Assek.\nReception\nCNET said that \"The Fallen Star is the most engrossing Star Wars novel in years [...]\" /Film wrote: \"The book is equal parts fun and tense, reading very much like a disaster escape movie from the '70s [...]\" Both reviewers compared the novel to the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back.\nAccording to the publisher, the book is on The New York Times Best Seller list.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
