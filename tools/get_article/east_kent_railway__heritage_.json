It is located at Shepherdswell station on the London and Chatham to Dover mainline. The line was constructed between 1911 and 1917 to serve the Kent Coalfields. See East Kent Light Railway for details of the original lines. The Kent Collieries were mostly a failure with only Tilmanstone on the line producing any viable commercial coal and commercial traffic over the line.\nThe line is operated by heritage diesel locomotives. It is home to a collection of heritage diesel locomotives including a British Rail Class 08, DEMU and electric multiple units including an in service British Rail Class 404 built in the 1930s and a more modern British Rail Class 365, which is to be used as a restaurant and a major events venue.\nAt Shepherdswell, there is a large cafe, a large  woodland area with walking routes, a  gauge miniature railway, a  gauge woodland miniature railway, a model railway and a small museum. Shepherdswell is where the railway undertakes it maintenance and overhaul works and is very much a working railway yard.\nAt Eythorne, there is a Class 365 EMU that has been converted to a restaurant and bar. There is a General Utility Van built by BR that used to carry elephants which is in the process of being converted to a small holiday let. The old Selling Signal Box is also here with a history of the East Kent Railway both past and present inside along with the original Faversham signalling panel. Eythorne Station plays host to a variety of features on special event days. Eythorne is the picture of a pretty countryside station.\nThe railway holds special events throughout the year, ranging from railway enthusiast events to beer festivals along with family fun weekends.\nOn the line there is Golgotha Tunnel (situated between Shepherdswell and Eythorne),  long, making it the eighth longest tunnel on a UK Heritage Railway in Preservation. The tunnel was built in typical Colonel Stephens style by building double track portals but only excavating a single track internally to save money.\nRolling stock\nSteam Locomotives\n*Avonside  No. 2004 'St. Dunstan'.

By 1989, a majority of the lineside vegetation had been cleared and by 1995 the first heritage train was run.\nFollowing the reopening of the railway, a new platform was constructed on the site of the former equivalent at Eythorne and the former signalbox from Selling was moved to the northern end of the platform in the mid 1990s. The railway also owns the Barham Signal Box from the closed Elham Valley Line which houses a detailed mural painting of the old East Kent Railway route, this can be found at Shepherdswell.\nThe EKR operates on most Sundays and Bank Holidays between April and September.\nThe EKR also owns an extensive ancient woodland known as \"The Knees\". The railway uses The Knees as an educational resource, woodland walks - the bluebells in spring are a popular attraction and for special events such as Halloween.\nThe railway hosts other groups, including the Southern Electric Group, 400 Series Preservation and the 427 Locomotive Group. The Network SouthEast Railway Society also have a facility here in the form of a display container which is splendidly painted in the classic Toothpaste Livery.\nThe railway hosts two apprenticeship schemes for Permanent Way and Civil Engineering training. The railway also hosts other organisations and offers facilities for 3rd parties to undertake training.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.eastkentrailway.co.uk/ East Kent Railway website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170117064356/http://ekrailway.fotopic.net/ East Kent Railway photos by volunteer Damon Cox]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071020090242/http://www.hfstephens-museum.org.uk/pages/his_railways/eastkent.htm Colonel Stephens Railway Museum page on the East Kent Light Railway]\n* [http://www.southernelectric.org.uk Southern Electric Group]\n* [https://www.networksoutheast.org/ Network SouthEast Railway Society]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170117064300/http://www.shepherdswellwithcoldredpc.kentparishes.gov.uk/userfiles/File/TheKneessurvey010793.pdf www.shepherdswellwithcoldredpc.kentparishes.gov.uk]"
