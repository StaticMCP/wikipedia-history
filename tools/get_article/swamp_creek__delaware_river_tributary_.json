It rises at an elevation of , and meets the Delaware River at an elevation of  with a length of , which gives it an average slope of 84.03 feet per mile.\nGeology\n*Appalachian Highlands Division\n**Piedmont Province\n***Gettysburg-Newark Lowland Section\n****Brunswick Formation\n*Atlantic Plain\n**Atlantic Coastal Plain Province\n***Lowland and Intermediate Upland Section\n****Trenton Gravel\nSwamp Creek rises in a stretch of the Brunswick Formation which consists of mudstone, siltstone, and shale. Mineralogy includes argillite and some hornfels. As it turns from the southeast leg to the north oriented leg it passes into the Trenton Gravel of the Atlantic Plain, consisting of sand and clay-silt layers.\nCrossings and Bridges\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
