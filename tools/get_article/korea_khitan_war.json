He also applauded the fact that the show depicted the times of Goryeo–Khitan War through an \"old-school sageuk charm and style\", and stated that \"much like the anxious times it is inspired by, Korea-Khitan War is driven by purpose and complex interpersonal dynamics that leave little time for theatrics\". Choi Bo-yun noted that there is a narrative of putting people first in the midst of war throughout the series, shedding light on less well-known battles and figures of Korean history such as Yang Gyu, and that the growth of King Hyeonjong who won the two wars against the Khitans with the help of Gang Gam-chan is worth watching.\nHistorical novel author Gil Seung-soo, who wrote the original novel which the series is based on, expressed his disappointment about the progression of the show after episode 16, since he was dissatisfied by the fact that it not only deviated from his novel, but also from actual Goryeo history. He criticized the attitude of the scriptwriter and the way he anachronistically portrayed the local gentries of early 11th century Goryeo, claiming that the series' depiction is just as absurd as \"BTS suddenly appearing right after the Korean war\" and that the production team should have had responsibility when they're representing history through media. The article noted that many viewers also complained about the storyline after episode 16, even visiting author Gil's personal blog to leave a comment about their concerns for the series.\nViewership\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:600px; text-align:center\"\n|+ Average TV viewership ratings\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"3\" |\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"3\" | Original broadcast date\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Average audience share\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Nielsen Korea\n! scope=\"col\" | TNmS\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em\" | Nationwide\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em\" | Seoul\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em\" | Nationwide\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 1\n| November 11, 2023\n| 5.5%\n| 5.1%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 2\n| November 12, 2023\n| 6.8%\n| 6.1%\n| 5.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 3\n| November 18, 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 4\n| November 19, 2023\n| 7.0%\n| 6.4%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 5\n| November 25, 2023\n| 7.5%\n| 7.0%\n| 6.1%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 6\n| November 26, 2023\n| 7.8%\n| 6.9%\n| 6.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 7\n| December 2, 2023\n| 8.4%\n| 7.8%\n| 6.5%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 8\n| December 3, 2023\n| 7.9%\n| 7.1%\n| 6.0%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 9\n| December 9, 2023\n| 8.9%\n| 8.6%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 10\n| December 10, 2023\n| 10.0%\n| 9.2%\n| 7.9%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 11\n| December 16, 2023\n| 9.7%\n| 9.2%\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 12\n| December 17, 2023\n| 9.6%\n| rowspan=\"3\"\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 13\n| December 24, 2023\n| 9.2%\n| rowspan=\"20\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 14\n| December 30, 2023\n| 9.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 15\n| January 6, 2024\n| 10.2%\n| 9.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 16\n| January 7, 2024\n| 10.0%\n| 8.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 17\n| January 13, 2024\n| 9.8%\n| 9.0%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 18\n| January 14, 2024\n| 10.0%\n| 8.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 19\n| January 20, 2024\n| 7.9%\n| 6.4%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 20\n| January 21, 2024\n| 10.1%\n| 9.1%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 21\n| January 27, 2024\n| 9.6%\n| 8.6%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 22\n| January 28, 2024\n| 9.6%\n| 8.5%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 23\n| February 3, 2024\n| 9.7%\n| 8.8%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 24\n| February 4, 2024\n| 10.0%\n| 8.6%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 25\n| February 17, 2024\n| 8.7%\n| 7.6%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 26\n| February 18, 2024\n| 11.5%\n| 10.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 27\n| February 24, 2024\n| 11.0%\n| 9.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 28\n| February 25, 2024\n| 12.7%\n| 10.9%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 29\n| March 2, 2024\n| 11.0%\n| 9.3%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 30\n| March 3, 2024\n| 12.9%\n| 10.9%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 31\n| March 9, 2024\n| 12.0%\n| 10.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | 32\n| March 10, 2024\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Average\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |\n* In the table above, the  represent the lowest ratings and the  represent the highest ratings.\n* N/A denotes ratings that were not published.\n|}\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Name of the award ceremony, year presented, category, nominee of the award, and the result of the nomination\n! scope=\"col\" | Award ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee / Work\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | Baeksang Arts Awards\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2024\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Ji Seung-hyun\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Technical Award\n| Lee Seok-geun (Costume design)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"15\" | KBS Drama Awards\n| rowspan=\"15\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2023\n| Best Couple Award\n| Choi Soo-jong and Kim Dong-jun\n|\n| rowspan=\"15\" style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Lee Won-jong\n|\n|-\n| Excellence Award, Actor in a Serial Drama\n| Ji Seung-hyun\n|\n|-\n| Grand Prize (Daesang)\n| Choi Soo-jong\n|\n|-\n| Popularity Award, Actor\n| Ji Seung-hyun\n|\n|-\n| Scriptwriter Award\n| Lee Jung-woo\n|\n|-\n| Top Excellence Award, Actor\n| Kim Dong-jun\n|\n|-\n| Best New Actress\n| Lee Si-a\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Kim Hyuk\n|\n|-\n| Best Young Actor\n| Hong Jae-min\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Excellence Award, Actor in a Serial Drama\n| Choi Soo-jong\n|\n|-\n| Kim Dong-jun\n|\n|-\n| Kim Jun-bae\n|\n|-\n| Excellence Award, Actress in a Serial Drama\n| Lee Si-a\n|\n|-\n| Top Excellence Award, Actor\n| Choi Soo-jong\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Korea Drama Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2024\n| Excellence in Acting Award (Male)\n| Ji Seung-hyun\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Seoul International Drama Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2024\n| Best Series Drama\n| Korea–Khitan War\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
