It is Cosmic Baby's second studio album.\nReception\nJohn Bush of Allmusic stated \"Cosmic Baby's second album is one of the high points of a uniquely Teutonic wish to apply Wagnerian concepts of orchestration and grandeur to techno and trance, in a similar fashion to Sven Väth's Accident in Paradise. While Väth is best at constructing beats and rhythms (to the detriment of his bloated quasi-orchestrations), Cosmic Baby proves more than equal to the symphonic task at hand, while his percussion skills rarely arouse any excitement at all. Despite several obvious high points (\"Loops of Infinity,\" \"Au Dessous des Nuages,\" \"Cosmic Greets Florida\"), the album attempts much but accomplishes little.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBand\n*Cosmic Baby – composer, primary artist, producer\n*Lisa – vocals\n*Jens Mahlstedt – guitar\n*Jens Wojnar – guitar, producer\nProduction\n*F.J.
