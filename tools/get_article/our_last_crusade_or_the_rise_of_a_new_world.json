In the present day, a master swordsman from the Empire named Iska and the \"Ice Calamity Witch\" from Nebulis' ruling family, Aliceliese, meet on the battlefield, determined to kill each other. However, even as enemies, both harbor a secret desire to peacefully end the war between their two nations without further bloodshed. As circumstances continuously conspire to bring them together, Iska and Alice begin to wonder if they can find peace with each other at first, and through this, create a path to bring an end to this war.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n;\n: |Jason Liebrecht}}\n: The unofficial leader of the Heavenly Empire's 907th Unit and an unparalleled swordsman who wields the black and white colored astral swords that can negate most types of magic. At the age of 16, he was recognized as the youngest Saint Disciple in the Empire's history. However, for unexplained reasons, he freed a witch who was being held in an Imperial prison, resulting in him being stripped of his title and then imprisoned for a year as punishment. Now, the leaders of the Empire have given him another chance at freedom, provided he kills a certain purebred witch. However, Iska seeks to find a way to end the ongoing war without further bloodshed.\n;\n:\n: Aliceliese, or \"Lady Alice,\" is the purebred \"Ice Calamity Witch\" with powerful ice-based magic that rivals most other astral mages in her homeland of the Nebulis Sovereignty. As a daughter of the Nebulis royal family, Alice is in line for the throne that Millavair, the current queen and her mother, holds. After running into Iska multiple times, she starts to develop feelings for him, and even makes an attempt to recruit him to her cause. Like Iska, she quietly seeks to end the war between the two countries without further bloodshed as well. However, these ideals raise tensions with her mother, who sees no path to peace with the Empire, even going as far as burning artwork in her personal room that was made within the Empire.\nHeavenly Empire\nEmperor\n;\n:|Katelyn Barr}}\n:The emperor of the Empire.\n907th Unit\n;\n:|Lindsay Seidel|Alejandro Saab|Ryan Negrón}}\n:The first seat of the Saint Disciples.\n;\n:}}\n:The third seat of the Saint Disciples.\n;\n:\n:The fourth seat of the Saint Disciples.\n;\n:|Dani Chambers}}\n:An assassin who is the eighth seat of the Saint Disciples.\n;\n:\n:The tenth seat of the Saint Disciples.\n;\n:}}\n:The eleventh seat of the Saint Disciples.\n104th Unit\n;\n:\n:The captain of the 104th Unit.
