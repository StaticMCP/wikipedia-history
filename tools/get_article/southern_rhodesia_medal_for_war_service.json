It was awarded to members of the Southern Rhodesia Defence Forces for home service during World War II.\nEligibility\nAfter the war, the colony's government pressed the Dominions Office in London for a distinct Southern Rhodesian war medal for home service, to reward those who would otherwise not have received a campaign medal. In response, the Southern Rhodesia Service Medal was authorised in 1948 and distributed from 1949.\nThe medal was awarded to members of the Southern Rhodesian Defence Forces who had at least six months full or part-time service between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945, and who were not eligible for any other British World War II campaign medal.\n*A total of 3,908 medals were awarded, mainly to those who had served part-time:\n** Southern Rhodesia Territorial Force: 3,140\n** British South Africa Police Reservists: 497\n** Those who served with both bodies: 271\nWhile most of the recipients were white, 62 Africans serving with the British South Africa Police received the medal.\nDescription\n* It is a circular, cupro-nickel medal,  in diameter.\n* The obverse has the crowned effigy of King George VI facing left, with the legend \"GEORGIVS VI D:G:BR:OMN:REX ET INDIAE IMP.\" (George VI by the grace of God King of Great Britain and Emperor of India).\n* The reverse was designed by Humphrey Paget and shows the coat of arms of Southern Rhodesia, surrounded by the words \"+ FOR SERVICE IN SOUTHERN RHODESIA + 1939-1945\".\n* The ribbon,  wide, is beetle green with red and black stripes at each edge, the colours of the Rhodesia Regiment.\n* The medal was issued unnamed.\nClasps\nThere are no clasps for this medal\nReferences"
