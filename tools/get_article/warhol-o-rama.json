The sequence draws heavily from source material in the archives of the Andy Warhol Museum as well as a large body of mythology surrounding the pop art icon to render a postmodern serial portrait of Warhol.\nThe book was published on 6 August 2008, the occasion of Andy Warhol's 80th birthday, by the university press at Carnegie Mellon University, of which Warhol was an alumnus.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 90%; background: #FF99FF; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n: \"We Pittsburghers are a little proud of Andy, a little ashamed. I had the privilege of eating ice-cream cones with him and driving him to the train station in 1949, so I can attest to the incredible knowledge and accuracy of Oresick's poems; but I'd also like to attest to their wit, originality, and loveliness. It's déjà Warhol all over again\".\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | Gerald Stern\n|}\nSee also\n*Songs for Drella\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080810013739/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08216/901330-35.stm Essay by Oresick on Warhol's 80th birthday and the publication of Warhol-o-rama]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080805045158/http://www.popcitymedia.com/features/PeterOresick0730.aspx Interview with Oresick about Warhol in Pop City Magazine (http://www.popcitymedia.com)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110616045435/http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2008/08/06 Garrison Keillor reads from Warhol-o-rama on ''The Writer's Almanac]\n* [https://www.pghcitypaper.com/arts-entertainment-2/peter-oresicks-warhol-o-rama-is-a-tour-de-force-homage-in-verse-1340669/ Review of Warhol-o-rama in City Paper]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100615232930/http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&-lay=a&-format=d.html&storyid=8626&-Find Interview with Oresick about Warhol in The University Times'']"
