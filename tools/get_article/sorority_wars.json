However, when Katie overhears something troubling, it drives a wedge between her and every house on Sorority Row as she is now an outcast. To counter all the hate, she joins the rival house Kappas, but this just sparks a full-scale battle.\nCast\n* Lucy Hale as Katie Parker\n* Courtney Thorne-Smith as Lutie Parker\n* Amanda Schull as Gwen\n* Phoebe Strole as Sara Snow\n* Kristen Hager as Heather\n* Rob Mayes as Beau\n* Adrian Hough as William\n* Sarah-Jane Redmond as Dana\n* Chelan Simmons as Casadee\n* Faith Ford as Summer\n* Marie Avgeropoulos as Missy\n* Scott Lyster as P.J.\n* Christine Willes as Mary Lee Snow\n* Catherine Lough Haggquist as Hilary\n* Meredith Bailey as Sally\n* Diana Bang as Lauren\n* Andrea Brooks as Shawna\n* Natasha Gulmans as Lana\nReception\nReviews of the film were positive.
