The following elements may be excluded from patentability by WTO members under TRIPs:\n* (...) inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect ordre public or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by their law.(paragraph 2)\n* diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals; (paragraph 3(a)) and\n* plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. (...) (paragraph 3(b)).\nHowever, despite not being mentioned as an exception in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 27 TRIPs, 'pure software' is not considered an invention under European law. The decision of the contracting states of the TRIPS Agreement, i.e. the WTO member states, was that patents should be granted in all fields of technology, without discrimination (Art. 27(1) TRIPS). However, according to Paul Hartnack, former Comptroller-General of the UK Patent Office, it is arguable whether pure software is a technology, or is, in many cases, capable of industrial application. He argues that its acceptance as such under European jurisdiction would be a political matter based on economic interest.\nArt. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties requires \"ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty\". The same provision requires interpretation within the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.\nThere have been no dispute settlement procedures regarding software patents. Its relevance for patentability in the domains of, for example, computer-implemented business methods, computer science and software information technology remains uncertain, since the TRIPS agreement is subject to interpretation, like all legal texts.\nRelationship with copyright protection\nArticle&nbsp;10 paragraph 1 of TRIPS provides that a computer program is a type of work which is eligible for protection under copyright law:\nThis argument was used by some adversaries  of software patents to contend that software patents would not be allowed by the TRIPS agreement.\nTRIPS textbooks see no conflict, for instance Correa & Yusuf\nnotes that software patents complement copyright because copyright does not protect underlying ideas.\nSee also\n* Aerotel v Telco and Macrossan's Application\n* Proposed EU Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n* Idea-expression divide\nReferences\nExternal links\n* WTO web site\n** [http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_01_e.htm Official text of the TRIPS Agreement]\n** [http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/intel5_e.htm Disputes concerning the TRIPS Agreement]\n*"
