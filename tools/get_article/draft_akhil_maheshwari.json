He has held leadership roles at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), the University of South Florida (USF), and Johns Hopkins University (JHU). He has more recently been affiliated with Boston Children's Health Physicians in Valhalla, New York, which is associated with New York Medical College (NYMC).\nHe founded the Global Newborn Society (GNS) and served as editor‑in‑chief of its open‑access journal, the newborn.\nEducation and training\nMaheshwari received medical education at the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (Varanasi), and at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. He then trained in the United States, completing a pediatrics residency at the University of Florida and a fellowship in neonatology at the University of South Florida.\nCareer\nIn 2004, Maheshwari joined the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) as an assistant professor, where his work examined innate immunity and the pathogenesis of gut mucosal and systemic inflammation in newborns, with particular focus on necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). His early research support included a young‑investigator award from the American Gastroenterological Association and federal funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nIn 2010, he moved to the University of Illinois Chicago as head of neonatology (and director of the fellowship program), building clinical and academic programs in neonatal‑perinatal medicine.\nIn 2014, he was recruited to the University of South Florida as the Pamela and Leslie Muma Endowed Professor/Chair (chief of neonatology) and Assistant Dean for Medical Education. He administered academic and clinical programs at the neonatal intensive care unit at Tampa General Hospital. Laboratory work during this period investigated the roles of intestinal macrophages and platelets in neonatal intestinal inflammation, themes reflected in subsequent peer‑reviewed publications.\nIn 2018, he relocated to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, as the Josephine S. Sutland Professor of Newborn Medicine, director (head) of neonatology, and vice chair in the Department of Pediatrics.\nResearch\nMaheshwari’s research investigates macrophage biology, platelet dynamics, and immune signaling in neonatal intestinal inflammation, particularly in NEC. He was senior author on a 2019 Nature Communications paper reporting a neonatal mouse model in which severe anemia followed by red blood cell transfusion precipitated NEC‑like intestinal injury. The work was summarized by Johns Hopkins Medicine and USF Health in institutional news posts.\nHe is editor of the reference textbook Principles of Neonatology (Elsevier, 2023), which compiles clinical and translational advances for neonatal intensive care teams.\nGlobal Newborn Society\nMaheshwari founded the Global Newborn Society (GNS), a nonprofit network that convenes neonatal clinicians and scientists, hosts conferences and webinars, and publishes the open‑access journal the newborn. GNS organized an inaugural international meeting featuring lectures and workshops on neonatal care. In a public address on global newborn health, he emphasized international collaboration and capacity‑building.\nMedia and public engagement\nMaheshwari has discussed maternal–infant health and outcomes in U.S. regional media. In 2023 he appeared on Red River Radio’s Health Matters for a program about infant and maternal mortality in Louisiana. On KSLA News 12 (Shreveport), he has discussed pregnancy health, birth‑defect risk reduction, and infant mortality awareness. While at Johns Hopkins, he appeared in institutional Q&As and videos discussing division initiatives in neonatal care and research.\nMemberships and recognition\nAccording to the Global Newborn Society profile, Maheshwari is an elected member of the Society for Pediatric Research/American Pediatric Society and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Global Newborn Society, the Indian College of Haematology, and the Interdisciplinary Academic Research and Innovation Society (Amsterdam).\nSelected publications\n* MohanKumar, K.; Namachivayam, K.; et al.; Maheshwari, A.
