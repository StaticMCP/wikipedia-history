Winners are listed in bold with series' networks in parentheses.\nThe top show of the night was Mary Tyler Moore which won its second straight Outstanding Comedy Series award, and five major awards overall. Police Story, won Outstanding Drama Series, even though it only received one major nomination.\nThe television miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man set numerous records. It received 17 major nominations, breaking the record held by Playhouse 90 which was set in 1959 (since broken). It also received 13 acting nominations, although some of the acting categories at this ceremony were later eliminated or combined. Despite this, it lost Outstanding Limited Series to Upstairs, Downstairs.\nThe Shubert Theatre had previously hosted the 1973 Emmy ceremony; it would host the ceremony a third and final time in 2001.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Mary Tyler Moore Show (CBS)'\n** All in the Family (CBS)\n** Barney Miller (ABC)\n** M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Welcome Back, Kotter (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Police Story (NBC)'\n** Baretta (ABC)\n** Columbo (NBC)\n** The Streets of San Francisco (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Saturday Night (NBC)'\n** The Carol Burnett Show (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Gypsy in My Soul (CBS)'\n** The Lily Tomlin Special (ABC)\n** The Monty Python Show: Wide World Special (ABC)\n** Rocky Mountain Christmas (ABC)\n** Steve and Eydie: Our Love Is Here to Stay (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Eleanor and Franklin (ABC)'\n** Babe (CBS)\n** Fear on Trial (CBS)\n** The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case (NBC)\n** A Moon for the Misbegotten (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Upstairs, Downstairs (PBS)'\n** The Adams Chronicles (PBS)\n** Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill (PBS)\n** The Law (NBC)\n** Rich Man, Poor Man (ABC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Jack Albertson as Ed Brown in Chico and the Man (NBC)'\n**Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H (CBS)\n**Hal Linden as Capt.
