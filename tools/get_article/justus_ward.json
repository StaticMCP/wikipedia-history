Phillips in 1994 — was just never going to fit in with the relatives that he discovered late in life. Not because he was Black, mind you, because he had scruples. And the Q crew? Not so much.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/whoswho/justus.php Justus Ward SoapCentral Profile] SoapCentral.Com\n*[http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/bios/justus_ward.html ABC.Com: General Hospital Character Bios--Justus Ward]"
