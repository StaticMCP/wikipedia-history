Although originally a representative team, the Vikings became a feeder club for the Gold Coast Chargers National Rugby League team, and were withdrawn from the Queensland Cup when the Chargers were withdrawn from the NRL.\nResults\nAmco Cup\n* 1978: Second Round\nQueensland Cup\n* 1998: Semi-finalists\nQueensland State League\n* 1995: Runners-up\n* 1994: Semi-finalists\n* 1993: Knocked out in preliminary rounds\n* 1992: 5th\n* 1991: 6th\n* 1988: 13th\n* 1987: 8th\n* 1986: 13th\n* 1985: 11th\n* 1984: 14th\n* 1983: 10th\n* 1982: 9th\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links"
