      "text": "# Hollywood Film Awards\n\nThe Hollywood Film Awards were an American motion picture award ceremony held annually from 1997 to 2019, usually in October or November. It was founded by Carlos de Abreu and his wife Janice Pennington. The gala ceremony took place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. The 2014 ceremony, broadcast by CBS, was the first to be shown on television. The 2016 ceremony, celebrating its 20th anniversary, took place on November 6, and was hosted by James Corden.\nThe awards became known for being given to films that have yet to be released and for a lack of transparency in the selection process. The Los Angeles Times stated, \"the selection process could be charitably described as 'vague,' with the primary criteria being the winners' promise to attend the ceremony.\" It has been discontinued since 2019.\nCeremonies\n1997\n;Hollywood Lifetime Achievement Award: Kirk Douglas\n;First Hollywood Visionary Cyber Award: Graham Nash\n;Best New Media Producer:Erik Dehkhoda\n1998\n;Hollywood Career Achievement Award: Shelley Winters\n;Hollywood Director Award: Norman Jewison\n;Hollywood Producer Award: David Brown and Richard D.
