The position of president was created under clause 16 of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1947, which required the Senate at its first constituted meeting to elect two senators to the role of president and deputy president. The position becoming vacant when the president either resigned or ceased to be a senator. The president had the casting vote in the event of a tied vote in the senate.\nList of Senate presidents\nThe first president was Sir Gerard Wijeyekoon, who was elected at the first sitting of the senate on 14 October 1947.
