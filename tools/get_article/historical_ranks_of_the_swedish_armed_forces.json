These personnel carried the rank of  (private). Later conscripts could also be trained for and given corporal ranks.\nEmployed personnel\nEmployed personnel were divided into two groups,  and .  consisted of  (Officers) who had a  (high school degree) and served as cadets for two years at the Karlberg Military Academy before being commissioned.\nwere divided into two groups,  and  (enlisted men). The category  consisted of the ordinary privates and corporals. The status of the  was lowered with the introduction of conscription for several reasons. The old system had consisted of the allotment regiments and enlisted troops. The enlisted troops had a much lower status than the allotment soldiers and the new conscription system copied more features from the enlisted part of the army than the allotment part. Earlier, the  were educated in their own national school and the allotment , following French practice, were recruited directly, i.e. they did not have to serve as privates or corporals before they could advance to . In the conscription army this practice was ended and like to enlisted troops pre 1901 the  were all recruited from the  category.\nFor the enlisted men the start of the military career was as a private after they had signed a three-year contract. The first year was a training year () after which the most able privates could apply (applications were accepted once a year) for corporal school (). Those who were not admitted to the corporal school continued to serve as privates or lance corporals (), if they had special skills such as farrier. After their three-year service was finished they could enlist for additional periods, but if they had not been promoted before 28 years of age, they had to quit. Usually, soldiers who had failed to be accepted to corporal school after their first term (i.e. been rejected three times) would choose to serve for one or two years more at most, since the pay and conditions of privates were poor. The main reason such individuals did not quit directly after three years was that after five years of service(later shortened to four) the privates were eligible for extra benefits, e.g., priority for employment in post offices, government-owned railways, police, etc.\nThose who were accepted to corporal school were promoted to  and after one year of training promoted to . Advancement to corporal meant that one had to serve one additional year (i.e., four years if the corporal did not re enlist). Corporals could apply to , a one-year training, after which they were promoted to .  and  worked as instructors and squad leaders and had a mandatory retirement age of 32. Enlisted personnel did not receive pension after their service, but they were entitled to severance pay upon discharge.\nA  who had graduated the  with high marks could apply for , after which they were promoted to sergeant. After two years as sergeant they were given a  (warrant) and were guaranteed employment until retirement, after which they received pension.  were responsible for the training of the conscripts and recruits and could also work as platoon leaders or deputy platoon leaders.\nRanks 1901–1925 - Navy\nFleet forces\nÖverbefäl\nOfficerare\n* Amiral\n* Viceamiral\n* Konteramiral\n* Kommendör\n* Kommendörkapten of the 1st/2nd rank\n* Kapten\n* Löjtnant\n* Underlöjtnant\n* Fänrik (from 1914 onward)\nUnderbefäl\nUnderofficerare\n:Fanjunkare\n:Sergeant\nManskap\n:Befäl av manskapet\n::Distinktionskorpral(to 1914) Furir(from 1914)\n::Korpral\n::Vicekorpral\n:Menig\nNaval Infantry and Coastal Defense Artillery\nÖverbefäl\nOfficerare\n:General\n:Generallöjtnant\n:Generalmajor\n:Överste\n:Överstelöjtnant\n:Major\n:Kapten\n:Löjtnant\n:Underlöjtnant\n:Fänrik (from 1914)\nUnderbefäl\nUnderofficerare (av 1. graden)\n* Styckjunkare\n* Flaggjunkare\n* Flaggmaskinist\n* Flaggrustmästare\n* Stabstrumpetare\nUnderofficerare (av 2. graden)\n* Sergeant\n* Maskinist\n* Rustmästare\n* Torpedmästare\n* Stabstrumpetare\nManskap\n:Befäl av manskapet\n::Distinktionskorpral(to 1914) Furir(from 1914)\n::Korpral\n::Vicekorpral\n:Menig\nRanks 1926–1952- Army and Air Force\nOfficerare\n*Fältmarskalk\n*General\n*Generallöjtnant\n*Generalmajor\n*Överste\n*Överstelöjtnant\n*Major\n*Kapten\n*Löjtnant\n*Underlöjtnant (abolished 1937)\n*Fänrik\nUnderofficerare\n* Förvaltare(from 1936)\n* Fanjunkare\n* Sergeant\nManskap\nUnderbefäl\n:Överfurir(from 1942)\n:Furir\n:Korpral\n:Vicekorpral\nMenig\nEmployed personnel\nIn a reform 1926 the Underofficer category was split from underbefäl to form their own corps. A centralised education was reintroduced with the Swedish Army Non-Commissioned Officer School (warrant officer school of the Army) replacing the local education of underofficerare which had taken place since the introduction of the conscript army. In addition to military subjects, the school also gave the students a civilian secondary education. The tjänsteställning (seniority) of fanjunkare was raised to that equal of underlöjtnant. When Förvaltare was introduced in 1936 the rank was given a tjänsteställning equal to löjtnant. Thus many of the grievances regarding the lowered status in 1901 were addressed. In 1949 the possibility to work as underbefäl (manskap higher than menig) on similar terms as officers and warrant officers was introduced. That is, not all corporals had to re-enlist regularly and quit while in their 30s but could work until retirement.\nConscripted personnel\nDuring World War II, there was a serious shortage of officers because of drastic cuts in the 1920s. It was therefore decided to introduce conscript warrant officers(underofficerare). Later conscript officers were introduced with ranks of fänrik to kapten.\nRanks used 1926–1952 - Navy\nFleet forces\nÖverbefäl\nOfficerare\n* Amiral\n* Viceamiral\n* Konteramiral\n* Kommendör\n* Kommendörkapten of the 1st/2nd rank\n* Kapten\n* Löjtnant\n* Underlöjtnant (abolished in 1937)\n* Fänrik\nUnderbefäl\nUnderofficerare\n:Förvaltare(from 1936)\n:Fanjunkare\n:Sergeant\nManskap\n:Befäl av manskapet\n::Överfurir(from 1942)\n::Furir\n::Korpral\n::Vicekorpral\n:Sjöman\nNaval Infantry and Coastal Defense Artillery\nÖverbefäl\nOfficerare\n:General\n:Generallöjtnant\n:Generalmajor\n:Överste\n:Överstelöjtnant\n:Major\n:Kapten\n:Löjtnant\n:Underlöjtnant (abolished in 1937)\n:Fänrik\nUnderbefäl\nUnderofficerare\n:Förvaltare(from 1936)\n:Fanjunkare\n:Sergeant\nManskap\n:Befäl av manskapet\n::Överfurir(from 1942)\n::Furir\n::Korpral\n::Vicekorpral\n:Menig\nRanks 1953–1972 - Army and Air Force\nOfficerare\n*Fältmarskalk (Abolished 1972)\n*General\n*Generallöjtnant\n*Generalmajor\n*Överste (with higher pay)\n*Överste\n*Överstelöjtnant\n*Major\n*Kapten\n*Löjtnant\n*Fänrik\nUnderofficerare\n* Förvaltare\n* Fanjunkare\n* Sergeant\nUnderbefäl\n* Rustmästare(from 1957, abolished 1972)\n* Överfurir\n* Furir\n* Korpral\n* Vicekorpral(trainee rank)\nMenig\nEmployed personnel\nIn 1953 the enlistment system was abolished. Instead of starting a military career by enlisting for three years as a private, one was employed as junior NCO in the new underbefäl corps directly after the conscript service with the rank of korpral. (Such an option was not open to all conscripts.) In a reform in 1960 the tjänsteställning of förvaltare was increased to that between kapten and löjtnant, and förvaltare were given the possibility to become company commanders.\nRanks 1953–1972 - Navy\nFleet forces\nÖverbefäl\nOfficerare\n* Amiral\n* Viceamiral\n* Konteramiral\n* Kommendör (with higher pay)\n* Kommendör\n* Kommendörkapten of the 1st/2nd rank\n* Kapten\n* Löjtnant\n* Fänrik\nUnderbefäl\nUnderofficerare\n* Flaggunderofficer\n* Förvaltare\n* Fanjunkare\n* Sergeant\nUnderbefäl\n* Högbåtsman\n* Rustmästare(from 1957, abolished 1972)\n* Överfurir\n* Furir\n* Korpral\n* Vicekorpral(trainee rank)\nMenig\n* Sjöman\nNaval Infantry and Coastal Defense Artillery\nOfficerare\n*General\n*Generallöjtnant\n*Generalmajor\n*Överste (with higher pay)\n*Överste\n*Överstelöjtnant\n*Major\n*Kapten\n*Löjtnant\n*Fänrik\nUnderofficerare\n* Förvaltare\n* Fanjunkare\n* Sergeant\nUnderbefäl\n* Rustmästare(from 1957, abolished 1972)\n* Överfurir\n* Furir\n* Korpral\n* Vicekorpral(trainee rank)\nMenig\n*Menig\nRanks 1972–1983 - Army and Air Force\nRegementsofficerare\n* General\n* Generallöjtnant\n* Generalmajor\n* Överste av 1. graden\n* Överste\n* Överstelöjtnant\n* Major\n* Kapten\n* Löjtnant\nKompaniofficerare\n* Kapten\n* Löjtnant\n* Fänrik\nPlutonsofficerare\n* Fanjunkare\n* Sergeant\nGruppbefäl\n*Överfurir\n*Furir\n*Korpral\nMenig\nEmployed personnel\nIn 1972, the three corps were renamed; officers who had studied at the Military Academy were now known as regementsofficerare and started at the rank of löjtnant instead of fänrik. The Swedish Army Non-Commissioned Officer School was renamed Swedish Army Company Officer School and those who were trained there started with a rank of fänrik and were joined together with the former underofficerare in the category Kompaniofficerare(Company officers). The former warrant officers were given ranks fänrik to kapten based on their time in service. Kompaniofficerare had the same rank insignia and tjänsteställning as ordinary officers, however they could not advance further in rank. Someone who had been a sergeant for more than 7 years became Kapten but could not be promoted to major. The tjänsteställning of the ranks sergeant and fanjunkare was reduced and the ranks were given to former underbefäl with long time in service in a new category Plutonsofficerare. Junior underbefäl were called gruppbefäl and used the ranks previously used by underbefäl. There was still several separate corps with different educational background, different duties and they did not use the same mess, even though they in some cases shared the same rank.\nRanks 1983-2008 - Army and Air Force\nYrkesofficerare\nGeneral\nGenerallöjtnant\nGeneralmajor\nBrigadgeneral (from 2000)\nÖverste av 1. graden (no new appointments since 2000)\nÖverste\nÖverstelöjtnant\nMajor\nKapten\nLöjtnant\nFänrik\nVärnpliktigt befäl\nFanjunkare\nSergeant\nÖverfurir\nFurir\nKorpral\nMenig\nEmployed personnel\nIn 1983 the Consolidated Officer System was introduced, in which the different corps were merged to one(Yrkesofficerare) and former plutonsofficerare were also given officer ranks. The separate paths were abolished and all officers had the same education and training and started as fänrik.\nConscripted personnel\nConscript NCOs were continued and since all holders of the ranks were conscripts the name was changed to  ( = conscription) After 1991 only temporary appointments were made to the ranks  and .\nHistory of other ranks\nThese historical enlisted and NCO ranks of Sweden comprise the contracted ordinary ranks in the Swedish Armed Forces and their respective insignia. The length of contract is currently restricted to two years due to the employment protection law (LAS).\nMenig\nRank for recruits undertaking training.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Army\n!

The reform established a four-career-path system with four categories as described below and carried out major promotions of most personnel below the rank Överstelöjtnant.\nThe Underbefäl category was split into two categories\n:* gruppbefäl to include\n:: korpral - former vicekorpral\n:: furir - former korpral\n:: överfurir - former furir\n:* plutonsofficerare to include\n:: sergeant - former överfurir\n:: fanjunkare - former elderly överfurir and rustmästare\nThe Underofficer category was renamed kompaniofficerare to include\n:: fänrik - former sergeant and fanjunkare with less than 3 years of service\n:: löjtnant - former sergeant and fanjunkare with 3-7 years of service\n:: kapten - former sergeant, fanjunkare with a minimum of 7 years of service and förvaltare\nThe Officer category was renamed regementsofficerare to include\n:: löjtnant - Löjtnant with less than 3 years of service and former fänrik\n:: kapten - kapten with less than 11 years of service and former Löjtnant with 3-11 years of service\n:: major - former kapten and löjtnant with a minimum of 11 years of service\n:: överstelöjtnant - överstelöjtnant and former major\n:: higher ranks\nReform 1983 - Rank inflation phase II\nAll categories were merged into one professional officer category with the lowest rank set to fänrik. Furir, överfurir, sergeant and fanjunkare were removed as a professional ranks.
