The population was 15,195 at the 2024 special census. Warrenville is a far west suburb of Chicago on the DuPage River. It is part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor, and is just north of I-88.\nHistory\nWarrenville was founded in 1833 when Julius Warren and his family moved west from New York to seek a fresh start from a failing gristmill and distillery. Daniel Warren, Julius' father, claimed land at what is now McDowell Woods and Julius claimed land at what is now the Warrenville Grove Forest Preserve.  The first major establishment, an inn and tavern, was built in 1838 by Julius Warren himself, as the family was skilled in timber and grain. The inn still stands today and was renovated in 2002.\nThe town quickly blossomed with two mills and a plank road connecting it with Naperville and Winfield, on which Julius operated a stagecoach line. The town failed at its bid to have the railroad come through the town. However, in 1902, the Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad came through town, which lasted until the late 1950s.\nWith a population of 4,000, Warrenville was finally incorporated as a city in 1967, following six unsuccessful attempts. The 1970s and 1980s brought westward expansion from the city of Chicago, causing the small farming community's population to nearly double to 7,800.\nGeography\nAccording to the 2010 census, Warrenville has a total area of , of which  (or 97.19%) is land and  (or 2.81%) is water.\nNeighborhoods\nThere is an \"old neighborhood\", south, with mixed housing styles near Galusha Avenue. There is a Forest Preserve neighborhood, east, with wooded-lot expensive multi-acre homes close to Cantigny War Museum, Cantigny Golf Course, and Mckee Marsh. In the mid-1970s two large subdivisions were developed in the west, next to Fermilab, a scientific research center where the world's largest superconducting particle accelerator ring was located. The subdivisions are called Summerlakes and Fox Hollow. Other notable subdivisions of Warrenville include Warrenville Lakes, Timber Creek, Saddle Ridge, Thornwilde, Edgebrook, River Oaks, and Maple Hill.\nCantera\nCantera was built from a TIF district on the former grounds  limestone quarry. Located on the district is a 30-screen movie theater, family entertainment center, several restaurants, a big box retail store, three hotels, three banks, a fitness club, numerous corporate offices, and two residential complexes. Major companies that have office space and research facilities at Cantera include: BP America, the corporate office for EN Engineering, the corporate headquarters for Symbria, and a corporate office for Exelon Nuclear. Also, the headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 701 of DuPage County is in Cantera.\nDowntown\nDowntown Warrenville is located at the intersection of Butterfield Road and Batavia Road. The addition of another TIF district, a new police station was built in 1998, a new City Hall in 2001, a new Public Works Building in 2002, and additions were made to the library in 2003/2017.\nDemographics\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Warrenville city, Illinois – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 2000\n!Pop 2010\n!\n!% 2000\n!% 2010\n!\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|11,106\n|9,176\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |8,648\n|83.11%\n|69.83%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |63.81%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|304\n|501\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |386\n|2.27%\n|3.81%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |2.85%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|17\n|22\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |18\n|0.13%\n|0.17%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.13%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|458\n|482\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |676\n|3.43%\n|3.67%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |4.99%\n|-\n|Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|5\n|3\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3\n|0.04%\n|0.02%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.02%\n|-\n|Other race alone (NH)\n|9\n|22\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |40\n|0.07%\n|0.17%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.30%\n|-\n|Mixed race or Multiracial (NH)\n|115\n|182\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |536\n|0.86%\n|1.39%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.95%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|1,349\n|2,752\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3,246\n|10.10%\n|20.94%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |23.95%\n|-\n|Total\n|13,363\n|13,140\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |13,553\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |100.00%\n|}\nAs of the 2024 United States special census there were 15,195 people, 5,068 households, and 3,266 families residing in the city.
