      "text": "# Faking It (British TV series)\n\n| last_aired =\n| channel2 = 5\n| first_aired2 =\n| last_aired2 =\n}}\nFaking It is a reality television show that aired on Channel 4 from 18 September 2000 to 26 December 2006. It was revived on 5 from 20 May to 3 June 2025.\nDevised by Stephen Lambert, the programme's original concept was \"a modern-day Pygmalion\", referring to the George Bernard Shaw play in which flower girl Eliza Doolittle is trained to appear like an aristocrat.\nFormat\nThe programme shared much with earlier British TV shows such as In at the Deep End and Jobs For The Boys/Girls, and the children's show Bring It On, all of which featured TV presenters or other celebrities learning other trades, but Faking It was the first that successfully used members of the public in the role. Its basic format was that a member of the public lived with and trained with an expert for four weeks and then took part in a contest against experienced participants in whatever activity they have learned. A panel of expert judges then gave their verdict on which participant was the \"faker\". Ostensibly, success meant fooling a majority of the judges, though there was no prize for success and the real point of the show was the experience that the fakers received over the course of the month's filming.\nTransmissions\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
