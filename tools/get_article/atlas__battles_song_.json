The song is the second track of Battles' debut album Mirrored, and was released as the lead single on April 2, 2007. \"Atlas\" received critical acclaim and was included on many critics' year-end and decade-end best songs lists. It was included in the video games LittleBigPlanet and Major League Baseball 2K8. The song was also used by Dodge for their advertisement of the 2013 Dodge Dart (PF), by Quicken Loans during their Super Bowl 50 commercial for their advertisement of their \"Rocket Mortgage\" program, and in 2021 by Ford in their Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup announcement advertisement.\nAccolades\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Publication\n!Country\n!Accolade\n!Year\n!Rank\n|-\n|Pitchfork\n|United States\n|Top 100 Tracks of 2007\n|2007\n|align=center|2\n|-\n|Festive Fifty\n|United Kingdom\n| 50 best songs of the year\n|2007\n|align=center|1\n|-\n|Pitchfork\n|United States\n|The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s\n|2009\n|align=center|42\n|-\n|NME\n|United Kingdom\n|150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\n|2011\n|align=center|54\n|}\nTrack listing\nReferences"
