It commemorated the events of 1891, when a group of socialists led by Dimitar Blagoev assembled secretly in the area to form an organized socialist movement that led to the founding of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party, a forerunner of the Bulgarian Communist Party (itself a forerunner of the current Bulgarian Socialist Party).\nConstruction\nConstruction of the monument began on 23 January 1974 under architect Georgi Stoilov, a former mayor of Sofia and co-founder of the Union of Architects in Bulgaria. The peak was leveled into a stable foundation using TNT, reducing the mountain's height from  to . Over 15,000 cubic metres of rock were removed in the process. The monument was built at a cost of 14,186,000 leva, equivalent to US$35 million in 2020.\nThe monument exemplifies the futurist architecture common to many state-constructed communist buildings. All maintenance ended with the fall of communism in 1989, and the building remains closed to the public due to the hazards of the weakened structure. The Buzludzha Project has helped to begin work on the monument's preservation, with the eventual aim of creating an interpretation center for Bulgarian history.\nMosaics\nInside the building, mosaics commemorating the history of the Bulgarian Communist Party cover approximately 937 square meters; 35 tons of cobalt glass were used in their manufacture. One-fifth of the mosaics have already been destroyed due to age, weather-related deterioration, and vandalism.\nThe largest mosaics were glorifying Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx. The monument has a hall used for important celebrations of the Communist Party until the fall of communism in 1989. At the top of the monument’s hall, there was a star-shaped red window associated with communism. A corridor with 14 mosaics showed the labor of ordinary workers.\nMosaics on the outer ring of the monument were built with natural stones gathered from rivers across Bulgaria; these mosaics have mostly vanished due to natural wear.\nThe building's main ceiling mosaic features the communist hammer and sickle encircled with a Communist Manifesto quote, \"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\"\nOpening ceremony\nThe monument was opened on 23 August 1981. At the opening ceremony, Bulgarian communist leader Todor Zhivkov announced:\nIn popular culture\nFinnish rock band Haloo Helsinki! shot the entirety of the music video for their 2014 single \"Vihaan kyllästynyt\" at the monument; Dutch rock band Kensington's 2015 \"Riddles\" music video was likewise entirely filmed on location there. The closing sequence of Rita Ora's Bang EP video was shot at the monument in early 2021.\nThe site was used as a filming location for the 2016 action movie Mechanic: Resurrection; special effects were added to show the structure next to a shoreline, with a helipad added to the top of the saucer building. The monument is visited by the main protagonist in the 2018 comedy film I Feel Good.\nThe 2019 opera Frankenstein by Mark Grey appears to take place inside the Buzludzha Monument.\nAccess\nBuzludzha can be reached by two side roads from the Shipka Pass, either a  road from Kazanlak in the south or a  road from Gabrovo on the north side of the mountain. The road in the south (Kazanlak) is in better condition than the other one as of October 2023.\nPreservation\nMultiple initiatives to preserve the monument had been undertaken throughout the years, most of them political and associated with the Bulgarian Socialist Party. In 2018, the monument was recognized by Europa Nostra as one of the seven most endangered heritage sites in Europe. The most recent preservation works started in 2019 under the Buzludzha Project Foundation, in collaboration with ICOMOS Germany and the municipality of Stara Zagora. Together they were able to secure a $185,000 Getty Foundation grant to establish a Conservation Management Plan for the monument. Early results indicated that the building could be preserved and used, leading to a second Getty grant in July 2020 to stabilize surviving mosaic panels. Conservation and preservation efforts are ongoing.\nFile:20140622 Buzludzha 016.jpg|The monument as of 2014\nFile:Buzludzha Monument.jpg|Monument seen from the air\nFile:Бузлуджа IMG6338.jpg|View from below\nFile:Bouzloudja02.jpg|Dome\nFile:Buzludzha Monument Auditorium.jpg|Auditorium\nFile:Buzludzha-03.JPG|Torch monument\nFile:Buzludzha vatre.jpg|From left to right, mosaics of Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx and  Vladimir Lenin\nFile:Buzludzha & Torch Monument.jpg|Torch and Buzludzha monuments\nFile:Budludzha.jpg|Drone view\nSee also\n* Bulgarka Nature Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://buzludzha-monument.com/ The Buzludzha Monument Archive]\n* [http://www.buzludzha-project.com Website dedicated to the preservation of Buzludzha Monument ]\n* [http://www.buzludzha-monument.com Website dedicated to the archive Buzludzha Monument ]\n* [https://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/keeping_it_modern/grants_awarded_2019.html Getty grant ], Published in 2019\n* The Economist, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62Qvp4y031k Buzludzha: A crumbling reminder of communism], Published on Oct 20, 2014.\n* [http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180726-bulgarias-crumbling-ode-to-socialism Bulgaria’s crumbling ode to socialism], BBC News, July 26, 2018.\n* [https://www.museumarchipelago.com/47 Podcast About Buzludzha Monument's Current State and Plans To Turn It Into A Museum], Featuring Bulgarian Architect Dora Ivanova\n* [http://ephemera.cyi.ac.cy/?q=Buzludzha_Monument Buzludzha 3D]\nBibliography\nAdrien Minard, ''Bouzloudja.
