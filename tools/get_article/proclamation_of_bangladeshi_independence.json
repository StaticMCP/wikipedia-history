On that day, Bangladesh Awami League leader M. A. Hannan, and the following day Major Ziaur Rahman, broadcast the message on radio on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra radio station in Kalurghat, Chattogram.}} On 10 April, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh issued a proclamation on the basis of the previous declaration and established an interim constitution for the independence movement.\nFirst declarations\nIn the first general election in Pakistan, in December 1970, the Bangladesh Awami League (BAL) won nearly every seat representing East Pakistan. That gave them an absolute majority in the National Assembly. President Yahya Khan, however, kept them from taking power by postponing the convening of the assembly indefinitely. Tensions mounted; by early March 1971, there was broad support in East Pakistan for independence, but the AL leadership thought ongoing negotiations with Yahya Khan might still reach a solution short of secession. Yahya Khan spun out talks with the AL through 25 March, on the night of which he unleashed a military crackdown.\nIn the evening of 25 March, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the BAL, convened a meeting of senior Bengali nationalist leaders, including Tajuddin Ahmad and Colonel M A G Osmani, at his residence in Dhanmondi. They were briefed by Bengali insiders within the military of an impending crackdown. They implored Mujib to declare independence but Mujib declined to do because he wanted independence in a bloodless systematic manner. Tajuddin Ahmed even brought all the recording instruments but had failed to convince Mujib to record independence declaration. Rather, Mujib ordered all the high ups to flee to India. However, Mujib decided to remain in Dhaka in hope of coming to a negotiated compromise with West Pakistan in becoming the Prime Minister of the whole Pakistan then it would have been easier to gain independence then.\nOn the night of 25 March, the Pakistan Armed Forces launched Operation Searchlight in the capital of East Pakistan. Tanks rolled out on the streets of Dhaka. The troops were said to have massacred students and intellectuals in Dhaka University, as well as many civilians in other parts of the city. It set major cities ablaze and crushed resistance from the police and the East Pakistan Rifles (present-day Border Guard Bangladesh).\nAt 12.20 AM on 26 March from his house at Dhanmondi, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman sent a message about attacks on EPR and police barracks in Dhaka, and declared the independence of Bangladesh through a telegram. The telegram was sent to Chittagong, where AL leader M. A. Hannan and Major Ziaur Rahman of the East Bengal Regiment broadcast the message on radio on behalf of Mujib. The declaration of independence was widely reported in newspapers around the world. As per the sixth schedule of the Constitution of Bangladesh, the text of Mujib's telegram by Major Ziaur Rahman stated the following.\nThis may be my last message, from today Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever you might be and with whatever you have, to resist the army of occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of the Pakistan occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and final victory is achieved.\nMujib's telegram was widely reported on radio on 26 March 1971. M. A. Hannan, secretary of the BAL in Chittagong, read out the statement in Bengali at 2.30 pm and 7.40 pm from a radio station in Chittagong. The text of the Hannan's broadcast stated the following.\nToday Bangladesh is a sovereign and independent country. On Thursday night [March 25, 1971], West Pakistan armed forces suddenly attacked the police barracks at Razarbagh and the EPR headquarters at Pilkhana in Dhaka. Many innocent and unarmed have been killed in Dhaka city and other places of Bangladesh. Violent clashes between EPR and police on the one hand and the Armed Forces of Pakistan on the other are going on. The Bengalis are fighting the enemy with great courage for an independent Bangladesh. May Allah aid us in our fight for freedom. Joy Bangla.\nOn 27 March 1971, Major Ziaur Rahman broadcast Mujib's message in English which was drafted by Abul Kashem Khan. Zia's message stated the following.\nThis is Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra. I, Major Ziaur Rahman, on behalf of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, hereby declare that the independent People's Republic of Bangladesh has been established. I call upon all Bengalis to rise against the attack by the West Pakistani Army. We shall fight to the last to free our motherland. By the grace of Allah, victory is ours.\nOn 10 April 1971, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh issued the Proclamation of Independence which confirmed Mujib's original declaration of independence. The proclamation also included the term Bangabandhu for the first time in a legal instrument. The proclamation stated the following.\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of the 75 million people of Bangladesh, in due fulfilment of the legitimate right of self-determination of the people of Bangladesh, duly made a declaration of independence at Dacca on 26 March 1971, and urged the people of Bangladesh to defend the honour and integrity of Bangladesh.\nAccording to A. K. Khandker, who served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War; Sheikh Mujib avoided a radio broadcast fearing that, it might be used as evidence of treason by the Pakistani military against him during his trial. This view is also supported in a book written by the daughter of Tajuddin Ahmed.\nConstituent Assembly\nOn 10 April 1971, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh was formed in Mujibnagar. It converted the elected Bengali members of the national and provincial assemblies of Pakistan into the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh. The constituent assembly issued a second proclamation of independence, which also served as the fundamental law of Bangladesh until the adoption of the constitution in 1972. This proclamation was drafted by Barrister M Amir-ul Islam and reviewed by Indian Barrister Subrata Roy Chowdhury. The text is given in the following:-\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

YUSUF ALI\nDuly Constituted Potentiary\nBy and under the authority\nof the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh\n|}\nProclaimer controversy\nUntil 2010, there was a controversy between the two dominant parties of Bangladesh, Awami League (BAL) and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), over who had issued the proclamation: AL claimed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and BNP claimed Ziaur Rahman. However, Bangabandhu is described as the proclaimer of the independence of Bangladesh in all diplomatic secret documents of the Richard Nixon administration, news,|name=mujib-ind}} and other documents. In 2010, a ruling of the Supreme Court officially recognized Bangabandhu as the promulgator, and denounced the views of BNP, calling it distortion of history.\nBackground\nSince its establishment, the Bengali-majority of Pakistan wanted full political and cultural autonomy, which resulted in a rise of nationalist and pro-democratic movements in the country. The Awami League, established in 1949, became the leading and representative party of the Bengalis in Pakistan. In the 1970 Pakistani general election, the League won an absolute victory and emerged as the largest political party in the country, but the junta government of Yahya Khan refused to transfer power due to its pro-Bengali and secular stance. On 1 March 1971, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, then president of Awami League, declared civil disobedience movement in East Pakistan. On 7 March 1971, Bangabandhu delivered his famous speech, concluding with, \"The struggle this time, is a struggle for our liberty. The struggle this time, is a struggle for our independence. Joy Bangla!\" It's widely considered as the de facto declaration of Bangladeshi independence.\nControversy\nBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) strongly claimed Ziaur Rahman as the proclaimer of independence. The third volume of Bangladesh Independence War: Documents, published in 1978, recognized Zia as the proclaimer. Even some of the BNP leaders openly denounced Bangabandhu as the false proclaimer during Khaleda Zia’s premiership.\nThe controversy, lasted nearly two decades, led the country to a political and an ideological crisis. When a different party comes to power, they change the history books of Bangladesh to either prefer Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or Ziaur Rahman.\nHowever, some minor controversies also involve around the broadcasting of the proclamation. According to A. K. Khandker Bir Uttom, a military officer during the liberation war and former planning minister of Bangladesh, on 26 March, a technician at Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra read out the proclamation of independence first over the radio. According to Abdullah Abu Sayeed, Ekushey Padak Medalist Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra artist Abul Kashem Sandwip also read the proclamation before Ziaur Rahman.\nControversial quote of A. K. Khandker\nIn 2014, A. K. Khandker claimed in his book  (lit: \"1971: Inside Out\") that Bangabandhu did not make any proclamation about independence from 7 March until his arrest, nor did he leave any written notes or recorded voice messages and did not follow any predetermined directions. Additionally, he also controversially quoted that Bangabandhu cried Joy Pakistan (\"Victory to Pakistan\") alongside Joy Bangla in his speech on 7 March 1971. But after its publication, there was widespread criticism among the contemporary Awami League leaders and in the parliament session, and a case was filed against the author and the book for distortion of historical informations, and the author withdrew the said part of the book and other related parts. Later he formally announced an apology for giving false informations in his book.\nUnited States documents\n, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Alexander Haig]]\nAccording to South Asian crisis, 1971, a secret document published by the United States Department of State covering the Indo-Pakistan affairs that time, United States was observing the situations of Pakistan from March 1971. On 26 March 1971, just after the Operation Searchlight, US president Richard Nixon called an emergency meeting with then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the Special Action Group Washington, the National Security Committee, and the CIA representatives at the White House, where it was said to have declared the independence of East Pakistan. Richard Helms, Director of the CIA, said on that meeting:}}\nSupreme Court ruling\nIn 2010, the third volume of Bangladesh Independence War: Documents, published presenting Ziaur Rahman as the proclaimer, was declared null and void by the Supreme Court, and the volume was ordered to be confiscated and withdrawn from all places in the country and abroad. Directions given by the High Court Division:\nSee also\n* History of Bangladesh\n* July Declaration\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://cbgr1971.org/files/Mar261971DecOfIndep/FinalDeclarationBSMR.pdf American intelligence reports on Bangladeshi Declaration of Independence]\n*"
