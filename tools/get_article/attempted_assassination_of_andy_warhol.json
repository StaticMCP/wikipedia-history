      "text": "# Attempted assassination of Andy Warhol\n\n| judge = Supreme Court Justice Gerald T. Culkin\n}}\nOn June 3, 1968, the artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol was shot by the radical feminist writer Valerie Solanas at The Factory in New York City.\nPrior to the incident, Solanas was a big player in the Factory scene. She wrote and self-published the SCUM Manifesto, a feminist pamphlet advocating for the eradication of men, and she appeared in the Warhol film I, a Man. On the day of the attack, Solanas was turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to Warhol. She believed he was plotting with her publisher, Maurice Girodias, to prevent her manuscript from being published. It had apparently been misplaced. Solanas was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and sentenced to three years in prison.\nBackground\nIn 1967, radical feminist Valerie Solanas was on a quest to have her book SCUM Manifesto published and her script Up Your Ass produced. She presented Up Your Ass to filmmaker Andy Warhol to read. He glanced at it but found it so filthy that he believed she may be an undercover cop and that this was an entrapment. In his book Popism (1980), Warhol recalled:In fact, when we'd gone to Cannes with Chelsea Girls the year before and I'd given that interview to Cahiers du Cinéma, it was Valerie Solanis [sic] I was referring to when I said, \"People try to trap us sometimes. A girl called up and offered me a film script . . . and I thought the title was so wonderful, and I'm generally so friendly that I invited her to come over with it, but it was so dirty I think she must have been a lady cop. . . .\"Solanas told Warhol that she needed money for her rent at the Chelsea Hotel. She accepted his invitation to appear in his film I, a Man (1967) for $25. In August 1967, Solanas signed a contract with publisher Maurice Girodias for $500 as an advance on the royalties he would pay for a novel she agreed to write for him. She invited Girodias to the screening of I, a Man, but their relationship soon deteriorated when Solanas realized that he could own both SCUM Manifesto and Up Your Ass under the terms of the contract she signed. To make sense of the contract, she turned to Warhol for guidance. Warhol's lawyer Ed Katz determined that the contract had no legal standing, but Solanas refused to accept that it was invalid despite Warhol's efforts to assist her. Solanas then focused on putting pressure on Warhol to make a movie based on the SCUM Manifesto and to stage her play Up Your Ass. She would repeatedly call Warhol's studio and managed to obtain his home phone number. She was paranoid that Warhol and Girodias had manipulated her and she became resentful. As Girodias recalled:Then she got worse and worse characterwise. She didn’t want to work on the novel she was supposed to write for me. The novel was supposed to be an autobiography, a personal confession. And she began getting extremely angry with Warhol. She felt he owed her a lot of money. But there was no contract, no written papers of any sort. I kept trying to pacify her vis-à-vis Warhol. And I am sure Warhol was doing the same when she went to complain about me. She got angry at me because I would not publish her SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men) Manifesto, and because she could not write that novel. She transferred the anger.Solanas requested that Warhol return the script for Up Your Ass that she had given him. He had left it lying around and was unable to locate it. Warhol believed it may have been thrown out while he was abroad at the Cannes Film Festival. After admitting that he had misplaced the script, she began demanding money. Solanas started threatening Girodias at his Olympia Press office and pressing him to publish SCUM Manifesto. In January 1968, she signed a contract for him to publish the manuscript. In the months that followed, she would complain to others that Warhol and Girodias had stolen from her.\nAccounts of Solanas prior to shooting\nAccording to an unquoted source in The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at , Solanas reportedly arrived at the Hotel Chelsea and asked for Girodias at the desk, only to be told he was gone for the weekend. She remained at the hotel for three hours before heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available. In her 2014 biography of Solanas, Breanne Fahs argues that it is unlikely that she appeared at the Hotel Chelsea looking for Girodias, speculating that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales for the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published.\nFahs states that \"the more likely story&nbsp;... places Valerie at the Actors Studio at 432 West 44th Street early that morning.\" Actress Sylvia Miles stated that Solanas appeared at the Actors Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave a copy of Up Your Ass for him. Miles said that Solanas \"had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind\". Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon, accepted the script, and then \"shut the door because I knew she was trouble. I didn't know what sort of trouble, but I knew she was trouble.\"\nFahs records that Solanas then traveled to producer Margo Feiden's (then Margo Eden) residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as she believed that Feiden would be willing to produce Up Your Ass. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce the play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, she responded, \"Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it.\" As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a partial copy of an earlier draft of the play and other personal papers.\nFahs describes how Feiden then \"frantically called her local police precinct, Andy Warhol's precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol\". In some instances, the police responded that \"You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol\", and even asked Feiden, \"Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?\" In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times, Feiden said that she knew Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it. (A New York Times assistant Metro editor responded to an online comment regarding the story, saying that \"The Times does not present Ms.Fieden’s account as definitive\").\nIncident\nOn June 3, 1968, at approximately 4:30 p.m., Andy Warhol was shot by Valerie Solanas at his studio, The Factory, located in Manhattan, New York City, on the sixth floor of the Decker Building.\nSolanas had visited the premises multiple times that day in search of Warhol. She told Paul Morrissey, overseer of the Factory, that she was \"waiting for Andy to get money.\" In an attempt to get rid of her, Morrissey told her that the artist would not be present all day, and she could not hang around there. At 4:15 p.m, Warhol arrived at the Factory and encountered Solanas who was waiting outside the building. Factory assistant Jed Johnson arrived at the same time with fluorescent lights from the hardware store, and the three of them entered the building together. As noted by Warhol in his book Popism (1980):\nIt was a very hot day, and as Jed, Valerie, and I waited for the elevator. I noticed that she was wearing a fleece-lined winter coat and a high turtleneck sweater, and I thought how hot she must be—although, surprisingly, she wasn't even sweating. She was wearing pants, more like trousers (I’d never seen her in a dress), and holding a paper bag and twisting it—bouncing a little on the balls of her feet. Then I saw that there was something even more odd about her that day: when you looked close, she'd put on eye makeup and lipstick.Meanwhile, Morrissey, art critic and curator Mario Amaya, Factory photographer Billy Name, and Warhol's business manager Fred Hughes were in the studio. The phone rang and Warhol answered while Morrissey went to the bathroom, and Johnson went in the back to install the fluorescent lights. While Warhol was on a phone call with Warhol superstar Viva, Solanas began shooting with a .32-caliber pistol. She shot Warhol at close range, striking him once.\nAt first, Amaya thought the rounds were coming through the window. He then observed the revolver in her hand, which was \"like one of those you see in Dick Tracy.\" Amaya received a flesh wound on his back, but he managed to get away and shut himself in the screening room. Johnson was hiding in Warhol's office, and Solanas attempted to enter, but he was holding onto the door knob from the inside, leading her to believe it was locked. Afterward, she approached the front and aimed the gun at Hughes, who pleaded, \"Please! Don't shoot me! Just leave!\" As she contemplated shooting him, the sound of the elevator diverted her attention. It appeared that she was about to pull the trigger, but she left when the elevator doors opened and Hughes said, \"There's the elevator. Just take it!\" Solanas left behind a paper bag on the table containing another gun, her address book, and a Kotex pad. Hughes called for the ambulance, which took over twenty minutes to arrive at the scene. The shooting occurred over a month before New York City's 911 system was put into place.\nWarhol superstar Gerard Malanga and artist Al Hansen arrived to a chaotic scene shortly after Solanas fled the building. Hansen stated: \"Mario Amaya jumping around, blood all over the back of his shirt. He presents his bloody back to me, asking over his shoulder, 'Is it in me, is it in me?' Someone's legs sticking out from behind the far desk. Jed is kneeling, holding the someone's hand, tears in his eyes.\" As he stood by the window, cursing, Morrissey asked Hansen if he had seen the ambulance downstairs since they had called ten minutes earlier. When the paramedics eventually arrived, they were told that it would cost an extra $15 to sound the siren. The paramedics chose to take Warhol down six flights of stairs in a wheelchair instead of using the elevator.\nHospitalization\nAs Warhol and Amaya were taken to Columbus Hospital in an ambulance, Hughes and Johnson were held for questioning at the 13th Precinct police station. They were released from police custody once Solanas surrendered to authorities later that evening. Amaya was discharged from the hospital that same day after treatment for a minor back wound. Warhol superstars such as Ultra Violet, Viva, Louis Waldon, Ivy Nicholson, Billy Name, and Jay Johnson, as well as art dealers Leo Castelli and Ivan Karp, gathered at the hospital to await word on Warhol's condition.\nWarhol was declared clinically dead, but Dr. Giuseppe Rossi massaged his heart and revived him. He was hit by a single bullet, according to Dr. Massimo Bazzini, executive medical director of Columbus Hospital. \"The bullet entered his belly on the left side,\" Bazzini stated as Warhol was undergoing surgery, \"passing through the left chest, then the right chest, and out.\" He suffered damage to his lungs, esophagus, liver, spleen, and stomach. A surgical team led by Rossi operated on Warhol for six hours, giving him a 50/50 chance of life. Warhol remained on the critical list in intensive care for over a week. \"He is allowed no visitors except his mother and his two brothers. Soon Jed Johnson is permitted to see him. Distraught at the time of the shooting, he is calmer now and brings us daily reports of Andy's progress,\" recalled Ultra Violet.\nOnce Warhol was allowed to take calls, he enjoyed chatting on the phone. \"When he begins to complain, we can tell that he is getting better,\" said Ultra Violet. \"If only [[Robert F. Kennedy|[Robert F.] Kennedy]] were shot a different time, I would have gotten all the publicity,\" he said, according to Ultra Violet. \"Death is just another headline.\" While in the hospital, Warhol received a ton of get-well cards and letters from family, friends, and fans. After nearly two months, Warhol was discharged from the hospital on July 28, 1968.\nArrest and legal proceedings\nAround 8 p.m. on the same day of the attack, Solanas turned herself into a policeman at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 47th Street near Times Square. Solanas told authorities she shot Warhol because \"I am a flower child. He had too much control over my life.\" While being booked at the 13th Precinct, she told reporters to read her SCUM Manifesto. \"That'll tell you what I am and what I stand for,\" she added.\nSolanas showed no remorse before Judge David Getzoff in Criminal Court on June 4, 1968. \"I have nothing to regret. I feel sorry for nothing. He was going to do something to me which would have ruined me,\" she said. She added that there were reports that \"I shot him because he wouldn't produce my play. It was for the opposite reason. He has a legal claim on my work.\" Solanas was arraigned on a \"weapons charge and two counts of attempted murder.\" Judge Getzoff intended to quickly conduct a preliminary \"psychoing\" on Solanas \"in view of the defendant's conduct,\" but no psychiatrist was present. She was then ordered to be detained overnight without bail pending another hearing the following day. Solanas was sent to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for a psychiatric examination to ascertain if she should have further testing. Subsequently, she underwent psychiatric tests at Elmhurst General Hospital in Queens.\nPublisher Maurice Girodias summoned Irving Younger, a lawyer and a professor at New York University, and Donald S. Engel, another attorney, to represent Solanas but she rejected their assistance. Additionally, she refused to accept legal representation from by a court-appointed Legal Aid Society lawyer. \"I don't want anybody to represent me. I could beat this thing myself,\" Solanas said in court. However, she was represented by civil rights activist and radical feminist Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy.\nOn June 28, 1968, a grand jury indicted Solanas in the attempted murder of Warhol. In August 1968, she was declared \"incompetent\" to stand trial because of insanity and committed to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. After some time, she was transferred back to Matteawan, and in December 1968, a friend posted her $10,000 bail.\nIn September 1968, it was reported that Warhol had decided not to press charges against Solanas.\nIn December 1968, Warhol called the police when Solanas called him on Christmas Eve to coerce him into purchasing a screenplay she had written for a movie. She also made threats to Girodias, Barney Rosset, Howard Hughes, and Robert Sarnoff of NBC, which led to her arrest on January 9, 1969.\nSolanas was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and spent six months in psychiatric detention. She was held at the New York Women's House of Detention in Manhattan until May 1969, and then she was transferred to Elmhurst General Hospital and Bellevue Hospital for further psychiatric tests.\nOn June 9, 1969, Solanas pleaded guilty to first-degree assault, she stated \"I didn't intend to kill him … I just wanted him to pay attention to me. Talking to him was like talking to a chair.\" Supreme Court Justice Gerald T. Culkin sentenced her to serve up to three years at the State Prison for Women at Bedford Hills, New York with credit for time previously served. She was sent to Matteawan to serve the remainder of her sentence. According to reports, Warhol was taken aback by the \"light\" sentence she received when he was contacted for comment. The Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed, a friend of Warhol, remarked, \"You get more for stealing a car.\"\nAftermath\nThe National Organization for Women and other mainstream feminist organizations were divided on whether to support or condemn Solanas after she shot Warhol. Her supporters, such as author Ti-Grace Atkinson and attorney Flo Kennedy, formed the foundation of radical feminism and portrayed Solanas as \"a symbol of female rage.\" The day after the attack, Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, which further enmeshed the shooting in a broader story about gun violence.\nTo capitalize on the publicity, Maurice Girodias had SCUM Manifesto published by Olympia Press in August 1968. Solanas had self-published the book in 1967, but this was the first commercial release. Girodias admitted that had she not shot Warhol, he would not have published the book because it would not have been worth it.\nIn April 1971, Solanas escaped from Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and was recommitted before she was released in June 1971. Later that year, Solanas was arrested and charged with aggravated assault for threatening Barney Rosset, editor of Evergreen Review. Solanas underwent psychological testing and was certified as mentally ill. Years later, she spent some time as the editor of the biweekly feminist magazine Majority Report. She spent her last years in destitution and died in poverty in 1988.\nWarhol gifted Dr. Giuseppe Rossi, the doctor who saved his life, a $1,000 check and a complete set of 10 Campbell’s Soup II screenprints. The check bounced but Rossi kept the valuable prints. After Rossi died in 2016, his family sold the prints at Christie's in New York. They sold in a range from $16,250 to $37,500.\nWarhol's reflections\nIn September 1968, Warhol told the Associated Press that he saw \"'no new Warhol' as a result of the shooting. 'Before I thought it would be fun to be dead. Now I know it's fun to be alive,'\" he said.\nIn the article \"The Return of Andy Warhol,\" published in the November 10, 1968, issue of The New York Times Magazine, Warhol reflected on the shooting: \"Since I was shot, everything is such a dream to me. I don't know what anything is about. Like I don't even know whether or not I'm really alive or—whether I died. It's sad. Like I can't say hello or goodbye to people. Life is like a dream.\"\nIn a 1969 interview with Newsday, Warhol said \"I don't dislike her. I don't dislike anyone. It wasn't her fault ... She wasn't responsible for what she did.\"\nHe later recalled in his book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (1975):\"Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always suspected that I was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television.\"\nEffects on Warhol\nThe shooting had a profound impact on Warhol and his art, and following his recovery, Warhol concentrated on turning the Factory into a business enterprise as regulations tightened. Warhol's boyfriend Jed Johnson aided in his recovery. Johnson also installed a Dutch door and built a wall around the elevator so that guests would be buzzed in. Despite these new precautions, two gunmen forced their way into the Factory and demanded to see Warhol in 1971. Johnson and Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro took a frightened Warhol to the editing room and called the authorities. The intruders were given cash and plane tickets before they fled the scene.\nAfter her release from prison in 1971, Solanas would periodically call the Factory to ask Warhol for publicity. For the rest of his life, he lived in fear that she would attack him again. \"It was the Cardboard Andy, not the Andy I could love and play with,\" said close friend and collaborator Billy Name. \"He was so sensitized you couldn't put your hand on him without him jumping.\"\nAlthough Warhol survived the attack, it is said that the injuries he sustained accelerated his demise. In March 1969, he underwent a follow-up procedure to remove a part of the bullet surgeons had left inside him. According to Warhol's brother John Warhola it was a negative experience because Warhol developed a fear of hospitals after that. \"I'll never come out alive, so I never want to go in again,\" Warhol said. During the second procedure, his stomach muscles were mis-sewn, requiring him to wear a surgical corset for life to prevent his stomach from ballooning during eating. He died following gallbladder surgery in February 1987.\nIn pop culture\nThe song \"Andy's Chest\" by rock musician Lou Reed is inspired by the attempted assassination of Andy Warhol. He first recorded the song in 1969 with his band the Velvet Underground. He recorded a solo version for his 1972 album Transformer.\nThe attack is the basis for the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol directed by Mary Harron. The film stars Lili Taylor as Valerie Solanas and Jared Harris as Andy Warhol.\nThe 2017 episode \"Valerie Solanas Died for Your Sins: Scumbag\" from the television series American Horror Story is inspired by the attack. Solanas is portrayed by Lena Dunham and Warhol by Evan Peters.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
