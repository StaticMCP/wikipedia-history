Parker is a British scientist specialising in vibrational spectroscopy and catalysis. He works at the ISIS neutron source and is an Honorary Professor in the school of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow.\nCareer\nParker gained his PhD at the University of California, Santa Barbara following this with postdoctoral research at the University of East Anglia. He worked for the Analytical Division of the Sunbury Research Centre before moving to the ISIS Facility in 1993.\nHe has an Individual Merit award from the Science and Technology Facilities Council, which was renewed in 2019.\nSelect publications\n*Parker, S.
