The primary was easily won by neighboring Massachusetts governor and eventual nominee Michael Dukakis, who won all 10 counties in the Granite State, and received 8 delegates. Dick Gephardt, a representative from Missouri, finished in 2nd place with 4 delegates. Illinois senator Paul Simon finished in a close 3rd place, also receiving 4 delegates. No other candidates received delegates.\nDukakis won the crowded New Hampshire primary with just under 36% of the vote, but finished well ahead of his nearest opponent, Dick Gephardt.\nReferences"
