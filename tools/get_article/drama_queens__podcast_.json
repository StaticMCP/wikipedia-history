Robert Buckley joined the show in July 2024. The show produced by iHeartRadio launched on June 21, 2021. The podcast follows the series' order and consists of the ladies discussing the episodes with their new adult perspectives, along with discussing behind-the-scenes moments, positive or negative, as well as sharing aspects of their personal lives. The podcast aims to cover all 9 seasons of the show, having one, sometimes two, podcast episodes for every One Tree Hill episode.\nPremise\nThe actresses describe the podcast as a healing experience, where they get to discuss a show that is very impactful for them on their own terms while also using it to speak out about the shared experience of mistreatment they've faced while shooting, by the show's creator Mark Schwahn,  They even refer to him as Voldemort. They view it as reclaiming their show and their experiences. They share specific moments that showcase the bullying and sexual misconduct they faced, calling out the toxic workplace they were in, all the while uplifting and empowering each other, centring their friendship and growth as a core theme.\nProduction\nConception\nThe idea came to them during the pandemic. Sophia Bush, who already had a positive experience in making a podcast, with the one she started pre-covid, titled Work In Progress, was doing regular three-way FaceTime calls with her now co-hosts. They all noticed that many fans were re-watching and discussing the show during this worldwide event, and this all led to the suggestion of creating the podcast, where together, they could talk about their hit show with total creative freedom and bring their fans along.\niHeartRadio proceeded to produce the show while Bush, Burton-Morgan and Lenz were all made executive producers. Their respective professional careers make it so that they often are not together therefore, they shoot the episodes from different places in the world while on Zoom.\nTheme song\nEach podcast episode starts with a theme song titled \"Drama Queens\", that was written and performed by Lenz.\nTour\nIn August 2022, they announced that they were taking the Drama Queens podcast on tour in October, to do live episodes with special guests in front of an audience. From the 15th to the 19th, they toured four different U.S cities, Boston, New York, Washington and Philadelphia. Tickets were sold quickly and the originally planned four shows turned into seven shows, they were added and took place at a later time of day. The special guests were all One Tree Hill alums: Paul Johansson, Torrey DeVitto, Tyler Hilton, Robert Buckley, Barbara Alyn Woods, Daphne Zuniga, Matt Barr, Lee Norris, Antwon Tanner and SwitchFoot. The seven shows that took place were all recorded and later posted online as podcast episodes.\nFormat\nMain episodes\nMost of the podcast's episode center around a specific episode of One Tree Hill. Those podcast episodes follow the chronological release order of the show. They re-watch the show off camera and then discuss its content on the pod, they share their thoughts about the storylines and some behind the scenes insight. Each of those episodes feature a title with a pop-culture reference and or an allusion to the episode itself, along with the episode number. They often time have guests come on that also acted in the show, usually when they are focusing on an episode that heavily involves the guest's character. The actors frequently reminisce about their common past and have heartfelt reunions The only time the featured guest wasn't an actor was when they brought in gun-safety political activist Shannon Watts, when they rewatched season 3 episode 16 of the series that featured a school shooting and suicide storyline.\nOne Tree Thrill\nThere are several episodes titled One Three Thrill, they are shorter episodes that alternate between the main episodes. The episodes consists of fan interactions, the three actresses answering questions from listeners.\n23 Questions with\nIn August 2023, they started doing the 23 questions with episodes, where they have a special guest, an actor from the show, and ask them 23 questions. The specific number of questions is in reference to the basketball jersey number of one of the male leads of One Tree Hill, 23. Only a few actor have participated in this : Torrey DeVitto, Daneel Ackles, Antwon Tanner, Barbara Alyn Woods, Kate Voegele, Stephen Colletti, Robbie Jones and Tyler Hilton.\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Title\n!Featured Guest\n!Run Time\n!Original Release date\n|-\n|1\n|Someday is Today\n|None\n|54:00\n|June 21, 2021\n|-\n|2\n|Take Me to the Pilot • EP101\n|None\n|1:15:00\n|June 28, 2021\n|-\n|3\n|Kissing is Gross • EP102\n|None\n|1:07:00\n|July 5, 2021\n|-\n|4\n|Backseats and Basketballs\nwith Lee Norris (Marvin \"Mouth\" McFadden)• EP103\n|Lee Norris\n|1:04:00\n|July 12, 2021\n|-\n|5\n|Never Have I Ever • EP104\n|None\n|56:00\n|July 19, 2021\n|-\n|6\n|Into the Wood and Weed Wackers\n(Barbara Alyn Woods as Deb Scott) • EP105\n|Barbara Alyn Woods\n|1:33:00\n|July 26, 2021\n|-\n|7\n|The Ultimate Mix-Tape • EP106\n|None\n|1:01:00\n|August 2, 2021\n|-\n|8\n|Fairy Tales & Lamps • EP107\n|None\n|1:02:00\n|August 9, 2021\n|-\n|9\n|Dare You To Move • EP108\n|None\n|52:00\n|August 16, 2021\n|-\n|10\n|Lucas' Tattoo • EP109\n|None\n|1:09:00\n|August 23, 2021\n|-\n|11\n|We Got Skills with Antwon Tanner • Ep110\n|Antwon Tanner\n|1:02:00\n|August 30, 2021\n|-\n|12\n|Turtlenecks • EP111\n|None\n|1:02:00\n|September 6, 2021\n|-\n|13\n|A Royal Mess • EP112\n|None\n|59:00\n|September 13, 2021\n|-\n|14\n|The Crockpot • EP113\n|None\n|51:00\n|September 20, 2021\n|-\n|15\n|Dan the Man • EP114\n|Paul Johansson\n|1:00:00\n|September 27, 2021\n|-\n|16\n|Light, Camera, Cry on Cue! • EP115\n|None\n|1:04:00\n|October 4, 2021\n|-\n|17\n|This One's Cursed • EP116\n|None\n|53:00\n|October 11, 2021\n|-\n|18\n|Sparkle Pits • EP117\n|None\n|1:05:00\n|October 18, 2021\n|-\n|19\n|Give Me Moira • EP118\n|Moira Kelly\n|1:10:00\n|October 25, 2021\n|-\n|20\n|Bedroom Talks • EP119\n|None\n|1:02:00\n|November 1, 2021\n|-\n|21\n|Oh Nicki, You're so Fine!\n(with Emmanuelle Vaugier) • EP120\n|Emmanuelle Vaugier\n|58:00\n|November 8, 2021\n|-\n|22\n|Hot Topic • EP121\n|None\n|59:00\n|November 15, 2021\n|-\n|23\n|Season One Finale • EP122\n|None\n|1:06:00\n|November 29, 2021\n|-\n|24\n|Playing with Fire • EP201\n|None\n|51:00\n|December 6, 2021\n|-\n|25\n|Tric or Treat • EP202\n|None\n|1:01:00\n|December 13, 2021\n|-\n|26\n|Blurred Lines • EP203\n|Bevin Prince\n|1:10:00\n|December 20, 2021\n|-\n|27\n|Piano Woman • EP204\n|None\n|49:00\n|December 27, 2021\n|-\n|28\n|One Tree Thrill\n|None\n|31:00\n|December 31, 2021\n|-\n|29\n|Truth or Dare • EP205\n|None\n|52:00\n|January 3, 2022\n|-\n|30\n|The Crown Jules with Maria Menounos • EP206\n|Maria Menounos\n|58:00\n|January 10, 2022\n|-\n|31\n|Croissants are meant to be Eaten • EP207\n|None\n|49:00\n|January 17, 2022\n|-\n|32\n|Hot for Teacher with Kieren Hutchison\n(aka Andy) • EP208\n|Kieren Hutchison\n|57:00\n|January 24, 2022\n|-\n|33\n|One Tree Thrill (Part 2)\n|None\n|22:00\n|January 28, 2022\n|-\n|34\n|A Formal Affair • EP209\n|None\n|1:02:00\n|January 31, 2022\n|-\n|35\n|Coming into Our Power • EP210\n|None\n|43:00\n|February 7, 2022\n|-\n|36\n|Checking into the Hilton, with Tyler Hilton • EP210 (part 2)\n|Tyler Hilton\n|47:00\n|February 14, 2022\n|-\n|37\n|Smoke and Mirrors • EP211\n|None\n|55:00\n|February 21, 2022\n|-\n|38\n|One Tree Thrill (Part 3)\n|None\n|13:00\n|February 25, 2022\n|-\n|39\n|The Perfect Myth • EP212\n|None\n|1:00:00\n|February 28, 2022\n|-\n|40\n|Aim for the stars!! • EP213\n|None\n|1:00:00\n|March 7, 2022\n|-\n|41\n|Mouth to Moth with Katherine Bailess\n(aka Erica Marsh) • EP214\n|Katherine Bailess\n|1:01:00\n|March 12, 2022\n|-\n|42\n|Time After Time • EP215\n|None\n|1:00:00\n|March 21, 2022\n|-\n|43\n|One Tree Thrill (Part 4)\n|None\n|19:00\n|March 25, 2022\n|-\n|44\n|This Wedding CRASHED, with Craig Sheffer • EP216\n|Craig Sheffer\n|50:00\n|March 28, 2022\n|-\n|45\n|This Wedding CRASHED, with Craig Sheffer\n• EP216 (Part 2)\n|Craig Sheffer\n|37:00\n|April 4, 2022\n|-\n|46\n|\n|Bryan Greenberg; Skye P.
