Olive-green on the back with golden-olive wings and tail and a dark crown and eye-stripe. Whitish on the belly and throat with a pale yellow eyebrow and yellow under the base of the tail. Note the dark pinkish legs and the bicolored bill, dark above and orange below. Similar to Lemon-throated Leaf Warbler, but has a whitish throat. Differs from Arctic-type warblers in lacking any wingbars. Song consists of a lazy up-and-down sequence of high-pitched whistled notes. \"\nThis species is monotypic.\nEcology and behavior\nFeeds on small insects. Forages alone or joins mixed-species foraging flocks finding insects from the foliage.\nBreeds from April to August but otherwise no information is known about its breeding habits and nest.\nHabitat and conservation status\nIt is found in tropical moist lowland forest and forest edge up to 1,500.\nIUCN has assessed this bird as least-concern species with the population believed to be stable.\nOccurs in a few protected areas like Pasonanca Natural Park, Mount Apo and Mount Kitanglad on Mindanao,  Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape in Bohol and Samar Island Natural Park but actual protection and enforcement from illegal logging and hunting are lax.\nReferences"
