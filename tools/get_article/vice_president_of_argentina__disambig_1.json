The longest vice presidential tenure as caretaker in Argentine history took place between 1865 and 1868, while President Bartolomé Mitre was preoccupied with the Paraguayan War. Seven Argentine vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency: Juan Esteban Pedernera (1861); Carlos Pellegrini (1890); José Evaristo Uriburu (1895); José Figueroa Alcorta (1906); Victorino de la Plaza (1914); Ramón Castillo (1942); and Isabel Perón (1974).\nThe Argentine Constitution does not provide for the replacement of a vice president should their tenure be ended for any reason, and their office was thus made vacant on seventeen occasions since 1861 (see list).\nThe 1994 amendments modified the vice president's term—as well as the president's—from one unrenewable six-year term to two four-year terms renewable upon reelection of the joint ticket. The vice president acts also as the president of the Senate.\nThe current incumbent, Victoria Villarruel, took office on December 10, 2023.\nCurrent vice president\nThe current vice president of Argentina is Victoria Villarruel, of the Democratic Party (affiliated with La Libertad Avanza), who took office on December 10, 2023, after in the 2023 presidential elections the formula headed by Javier Milei won the contest in the second round with 55.65% of the votes.\nList of vice presidents\nSee also\n* Politics of Argentina\n* President of Argentina\n** List of heads of state of Argentina\n* List of current vice presidents\nReferences"
