The original courthouse structure was constructed in 1725; it is the oldest courthouse building in continuous use in the United States.  The courthouse is constructed of brick laid in Flemish bond. In 1840 the courthouse was enlarged and a brick wall was erected to enclose the court green and to keep livestock and poultry away from the buildings.  A new courthouse complex has been constructed to augment the old; however, hearings are still held in the old building to preserve its historic designation.\nThis courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.\nGallery\nFile:DSC 0101 01.JPG|King William County Courthouse\nFile:King William Courthouse and Vicinity - 11.jpg|The new county office building located behind the historic courthouse\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/va0667/ King William County Courthouse & Stable, State Route 619, King William, King William County, VA]: 6 photos, 7 measured drawings, and 2 data pages at Historic American Buildings Survey"
