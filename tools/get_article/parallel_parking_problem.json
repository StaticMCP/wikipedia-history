      "text": "# Parallel parking problem\n\nThe parallel parking problem is a motion planning problem in control theory and mechanics to determine the path a car must take to parallel park into a parking space.  The front wheels of a car are permitted to turn, but the rear wheels must stay aligned.  When a car is initially adjacent to a parking space, to move into the space it would need to move in a direction perpendicular to the allowed path of motion of the rear wheels.  The admissible motions of the car in its configuration space are an example of a nonholonomic system.\nSee also\n* Automatic parking\n* Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics\n* Falling cat problem\n* Moving sofa problem\nReferences\n* .\n* ."
