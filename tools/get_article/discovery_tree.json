Dowd found a grove in the Sierra Nevada; the trees in the grove were believed to be the first giant sequoia trees to be discovered by white settlers, though some earlier reports of giant sequoias were reported. The trees he discovered included the Discovery Tree, with a height of  high and a base measuring over  in diameter. The Discovery Tree was cut down and shipped to San Francisco and New York City as an exhibition tree. The tree played a large role in the introduction of the Yosemite Grant to Congress, an act that helped preserve the giant sequoias. The stump of the Discovery Tree is a popular attraction in Calaveras Grove, which has about 200,000 visitors each year.\nDiscovery\nIn the 1850s, during the California gold rush, stories were told of a grove of trees in the Sierra Nevada that were larger than the tallest buildings on earth. This attracted Augustus T. Dowd who in 1852, while working as a hunter for a construction crew building canals to transport water to a mining camp, shot a California grizzly bear and followed it into a forest where he discovered the giant sequoias in the Sierra Nevada. Though Dowd's discovery was initially believed as the first white settler discovery of the big trees, historical evidence refutes his claim.\nFelling and exhibition\nin 1853.]]\nIn the 1850s, when travel to California's big trees was difficult and only possible by horse-and-wagon on primitive mountain trails, the idea of exploiting them for profit began to gain traction. One man, Mr. Lewis, a member of the discovery party that found the big trees, had the idea of removing the bark from one of the trees and transporting it to the East Coast for exhibition. In 1853, an article in the Daily Alta California noted that a section of bark had been taken off and packed for display at the Crystal Palace in New York.  However, Captain Hanford, a local resident, had his own scheme to fell the \"Discovery Tree\" for public exhibition. He bought the tree from his friend Lapham and proceeded to cut it down by drilling away at the trunk with two-inch pump augers and sawing at the spaces between the boreholes which took five men 22 days. The tree was over  in diameter,  tall, and 1,244 years old when felled.\nThe tree was eventually felled, and the bark was crated up and taken to San Francisco where it was put on display on Bush Street, adjacent to a local fair. The bark was reassembled in its natural state, forming a spacious room, with a carpet, piano forte, and seats for forty persons. This attracted many visitors and was widely publicized in the San Francisco newspapers of the day.\nIn 1854, Hanford, with financial support from miners Kimball and Cutting, set out to bring the giant sequoia tree from California to the eastern United States. He arrived in New York City amid controversy surrounding the Crystal Palace, a popular exhibition space that had recently closed following the World's Fair. Hanford intended to showcase the tree at the Palace, but when he and the Palace's new president, P. T. Barnum, could not agree on terms, Hanford instead rented a space at 596 Broadway. However, just days before Hanford's exhibit was set to open, Barnum announced that he too would be displaying a giant California sequoia tree at the Crystal Palace. Hanford's exhibit opened one week later and was ultimately not as successful as Barnum's, due in part to the confusion caused by the competing exhibits.\nAfter its display in San Francisco and New York, the tree was destroyed by fire before it could reach Paris for exhibition.\nLegacy\nThe felling of the tree was met with criticism. Naturalist John Muir exclaimed, \"Then the vandals danced upon the stump!\" In 1864, the Discovery Tree was used as a symbol of the need for preservation and played a key role in the introduction of the Yosemite Grant to Congress. The Calaveras land was owned by logging interests, with public protests stopping the cutting of the trees.\nIn 1931, the land was purchased by the State of California. The stump and remaining log of the Discovery Tree became a popular tourist attraction. Since its discovery in 1852, Calaveras Big Trees has remained one of the state's longest-running tourist destinations. The stump was used as a dance floor, a bar, and a two-lane bowling alley. Visitors view the size of the tree and the other towering sequoias that make up the Calaveras Big Trees.\nThe Discovery Tree was the first giant sequoia to be felled by a basal cut, allowing botanists to accurately estimate the tree's age by counting its rings. The initial reading revealed 1,120 rings, indicating that the tree was younger than originally thought, but that it grew at a steady pace throughout its life.\nDimensions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
