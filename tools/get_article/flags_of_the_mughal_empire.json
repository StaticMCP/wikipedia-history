It was primarily moss green. It displayed a lion and sun ( ) facing the hoist of the flag. The Mughals traced their use of the alam back to Timur.\nThe imperial standard was displayed to the right of the throne and also at the entrance of the Emperor's encampment and in front of the emperor during military marches.\nAccording to the Ain-i-Akbari, during Akbar's reign, whenever the emperor rode out, not less than five alams were carried along with the qur (a collection of flags and other insignia) wrapped up in scarlet cloth bags. They were unfurled on the days of festivity, and in battle. Edward Terry, chaplain to Sir Thomas Roe, who came during the reign of Jahangir, described in his Voyage to East-India (1655) that the royal standard, made of silk, with a crouching lion shadowing part of the body of the sun inscribed on it, was carried on an elephant whenever the emperor travelled.\nA painting by Payag in a manuscript of the Padshahnama'', a chronicle on Shah Jahan's reign, preserved in the Royal Library, Windsor Castle depicted the Mughal standards as the scarlet pennons with green borders with a passant lion and rising sun behind it. Another painting in the same manuscript depicted the Mughal standards having green fields with a couchant lion and rising sun behind it.\nSeals\nFile:Imperial Seal of the Mughal Empire.svg|Imperial seal of Mughals\nFile:\"Rosette Bearing the Names and Titles of Shah Jahan\", Folio from the Shah Jahan Album MET DT458.jpg|Seal of Shah Jahan\nFile:Seal of Shah Jahan.png|Seal of Shah Jahan\nFile:Persian 47 Wellcome L0050349.jpg|Seal of Jahangir\nFile:Firman of Aurangzeb, India, 1689, The David Collection, Copenhagen (1) (36012492090).jpg|Seal of Aurangzeb\nFile:Painted seal of Mughal Emperor Awrangzib Wellcome L0034099.jpg|Seal of Aurangzeb\nFile:Ghulam Ali Khan 018.jpg|Seal of Bahadur Shah Zafar in the first year of his reign\nFlags of the subjects and vassals of the Mughal Empire\nFile:Asafia flag of Hyderabad State.svg|Nizam of Hyderabad\nFile:Flag of the principality of Carnatic.gif|Nawab of Carnatic\nFile:Bengal subah flag (Nautical).svg|Bengal Subah (under mughals 1576–1717)\nFile:Bengal Subah flag (Nautical).png|Nawab of Bengal (independently 1717–1757)\nFile:Cambayflag.png|Nawab of Cambay\nFile:Drapeau Bhopal.svg|Nawab of Bhopal\nHistorical depictions\nFile:The siege of Qandahar (May 1631).jpg|Illustrations from the 1636 Padshahnama of Shah Jahan showing Moghul Soldier & Civilian Costume.
