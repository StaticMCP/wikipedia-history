He is a younger brother of Pakistan's leading Test run scorer Javed Miandad and had two other brothers (Sohail Miandad and Bashir Miandad) play Quaid-i-Azam Trophy matches. An all-rounder, he also took the field for Karachi and the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan during his career.\nMiandad played as a right-handed middle order batsman and bowled useful slow left-arm orthodox spin. He was a member of two Patron's Trophy final winning sides with Habib Bank Limited, the first under Javed's captaincy in 1987/88. The other was in 1991/92 when they drew with National Bank of Pakistan but were awarded the trophy because of a superior first innings, in which Miandad contributed 67 runs. He captained Habib Bank Limited twice during the 1995/96 Patron's Trophy.\nDespite appearing in 141 first-class matches, Miandad only scored four centuries and never more than one in a single season. He was also run out for 99 in an innings, against Pakistan National Shipping Corporation in 1990/91.\nIn a Wills Cup limited-overs match for Habib Bank Limited against Lahore City at Peshawar in the 1988/89 season, Miandad had record bowling figures with 7 for 20. His bowling record at the time was the best ever in Pakistani domestic limited-overs cricket.\nA reliable fielder, Miandad won the 'Fielder of the Tournament' award in the 1982/83 Wills Cup.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
