The club was founded in 1922, and permission was obtained from Prince Edward to use his name.\nThe waterside site on Lady Martin's Beach in Felix Bay was purchased in the same year in which a purpose-built clubhouse and bowling green were constructed.\nIts first race was held on Saturday, 18 November 1922. In 1935, it was granted permission to use the prefix \"Royal\" although newspaper reports from its inception used this title.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
