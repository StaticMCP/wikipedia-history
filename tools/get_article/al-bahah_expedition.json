The operation ended in another Ottoman defeat.\nExpedition\nHaving been defeated by the Zahran tribes, the Ottoman commander, Abidin Bey, launched another expedition to subjugate the Zahran tribes living in the Al-Bahah region. After reinforcements had arrived, Abidin Bey launched his attack and subjugated some of the Zahran provinces, south of Taif, to prevent the Saudi attacks. He laid waste to the country for 40 miles and destroyed any passage available for troops. Abidin Bey then encamped on one side of the wasted desert.\nWith the assistance of Tami bin Shu'aib, the Zahran commander, Bakhrosh ibn A'llas, encamped south of the Ottoman camp. In addition to failing to build entrenchments, the Ottomans also failed to establish advanced posts in front of the enemy. Early in the morning, the Saudis attacked the Ottoman camp, fell upon sleeping Albanian soldiers, and abandoned their positions. Despite the resistance of a few hundred Ottomans under Mahuo Beg, Saudi forces overwhelmed them, and they fled. Hussain Bey provided cover for the retreat, and Bakhrosh pursued them for two days. As a result, the Ottomans lost their tents, baggage, and guns, as well as 800 infantry and 80 cavalry.\nThe Ottomans arrived in Lye, 4 hours from Taif. Here, Abidin Bey received reinforcements from Taif, and the Saudis returned home. Muhammad Ali Pasha ordered him to advance, but panic struck the Ottomans, and they half-deserted for Taif. The Saudis lost only 60 men.\nAftermath\nAs a result of this defeat, Ottoman morale plummeted. Abidin Bey had a high reputation for skill and courage among his troops. However, this defeat convinced him that his men were not inclined to fight and that fighting the Saudis would be in vain.\nReferences"
