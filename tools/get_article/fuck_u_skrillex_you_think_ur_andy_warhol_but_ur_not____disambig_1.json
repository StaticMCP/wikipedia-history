Production was primarily handled by Skrillex himself, alongside Fred Again, Varg2TM, Whitearmor, and Eurohead, among others. Fuck U Skrillex follows his pair of 2023 albums, Quest for Fire and ''Don't Get Too Close.\nRelease\nFuck U Skrillex'' received no previous promotion, and was instead released as a surprise album. On March 31, 2025, one night before release, the full mixtape was shared by Skrillex via a Dropbox link sent to his email subscriber list. The album was released to streaming services on April 1, 2025. The cover photograph was taken near the NestHQ media company building in Los Angeles, California and features a first generation Mazda Miata.\nSeveral months prior up to the album's release, Skrillex made public comments on his Twitter/X account about his frustration with Atlantic Records. Since his contract required four albums, this album is to be Skrillex's final project with Atlantic, which has been affiliated with every Skrillex release since his debut single \"Weekends!!!\" (2010).\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = NME\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Pitchfork\n| rev3score = 8.0/10\n| rev4 = Rolling Stone\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Tom Hull\n| rev5score = B−\n}}\nFuck U Skrillex received positive reviews from music critics. According to review aggregator Metacritic, the album received \"generally favorable reviews\" based on a weighted average score of 74 out of 100 from 5 critic scores. In a review for Billboard, Katie Bain called the album \"occasionally laugh-out-loud funny\" and \"ultimately quite moving\", noting its \"tongue-in-cheek\" tone and praising \"Voltage\" as \"one of the most, if not the most, emotionally resonant, truly moving songs of the entire Skrillex catalog\". A positive review by Michaelangelo Matos for Rolling Stone noted the album's \"playful edge\" and attention to detail. Receiving the album positively, Vulture's Craig Jenkins praised the album's eclecticism, likening the album's mixtape format to Resident Advisor mixes and DJ Drama's Gangsta Grillz series.\nTrack
