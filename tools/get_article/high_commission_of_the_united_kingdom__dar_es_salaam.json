It is located on Hamburg Avenue in the Ilala District. The current British high commissioner to Tanzania is Marianne  Young since August 2024.\nHistory\nAs fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Kingdom and Tanzania conduct their diplomatic relations at governmental level, rather than between heads of state.  Therefore, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.  The UK has had a high commissioner to Tanzania since it was formed in 1964 from the union of the Republic of Tanganyika and the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba.\nThe high commissioner to Tanzania is also UK Representative to the East African Community and also represents the British Overseas Territories in Tanzania.\nUmoja House, the seven-story office building that hosts the High Commission is also home to the embassies of The Netherlands and Germany. It was designed by British architect Michael Manser and completed in 2002.\nSee also\n* Diplomatic missions of the United Kingdom\n* List of high commissioners of the United Kingdom to Tanzania\nReferences"
