He grew up in Kilkenny and published many papers about his hometown.\nHe worked with Professor George Eogan at the archaeological excavations at Knowth.\nHe left a large corpus of works that he had either written or edited and was very committed to publishing. He has been described, in the newsletter of the Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland, as \"the first and foremost Irish medieval archaeologist, urban historian, raconteur, font of knowledge on literature, film, chess, opera and so many other subjects. A Kilkenny man par excellence, and a great loss to archaeology and life\". The Kilkenny Archaeological Society, of which he was a member, holds an annual conference in his memory.\nHe was also an avid chess player and was a member of the Kilkenny Chess Club from 1972.\nWorks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nPapers\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 1989}}\n*\n*\n* Bradley, John The precinct of St John's Priory, Kilkenny, at the close of the Middle Ages, in Pertitia, 317–345 (2012)\n* Bradley, J.
