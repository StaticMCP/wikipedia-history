It was released as the album's second single on 23 June 2017. The cover art was designed by Anton Corbijn. A physical CD and vinyl release was released on 15 September 2017. A live video was released on 22 June 2017.\nBackground\nMartin Gore said in an interview with Amazon Music Germany \"an album starts taking shape, for me, really, when you have about four songs together, and we had gone down a cynical path. And I thought, 'Okay well, maybe I just gotta go with this.'\"\nThe theme of the song is the idea is about the regression of society as well as technology's role in the regression, but Gore also believed that \"new technologies would bring the world together—the world would be united by them. We were all enthusiastic about the Arab Spring, when people started organizing themselves with social media and fought for their freedom. But then everything went wrong: the Middle East seems to be falling apart.\"\nTrack listing\n|title1 = Going Backwards\n|note1 = album version\n|length1 = 5:43\n|title2 = Going Backwards\n|note2 = Highline sessions version\n|length2 = 5:27\n}}\n|title1 = Going Backwards\n|note1 = radio edit\n|length1 = 3:51\n|title2 = Going Backwards\n|note2 = Chris Liebing mix\n|length2 = 9:07\n|title3 = Going Backwards\n|note3 = Solomun extended radio remix\n|length3 = 8:25\n|title4 = Going Backwards\n|note4 = The Belleville Three full vocal mix\n|length4 = 6:44\n|title5 = Going Backwards\n|note5 = Point Point remix\n|length5 = 4:32\n|title6 = Going Backwards\n|note6 = Chris Liebing Burn Slow mix\n|length6 = 7:08\n|title7 = Going Backwards\n|note7 = Maya Jane Coles remix\n|length7 = 5:57\n|title8 = Poison Heart\n|note8 = Soulsavers re-work\n|length8 = 3:45\n}}\nPersonnel\nDepeche Mode\n* Dave Gahan – lead vocals\n* Martin Gore – guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals\n* Andy Fletcher – keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\n* James Ford – drums\n* Kurt Uenala, Matrixxman – programming\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for \"Going Backwards\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017–2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Dutch Single Tip (MegaCharts)\n| 29\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://archives.depechemode.com/discography/singles/57_goingbackwards.html Single information from the official Depeche Mode website]\n* [http://www.itunescharts.net/fra/artists/music/depeche-mode/songs/going-backwards/ Chart performance in France]\n* [http://www.itunescharts.net/ger/artists/music/depeche-mode/songs/going-backwards/ Chart performance in Germany]"
