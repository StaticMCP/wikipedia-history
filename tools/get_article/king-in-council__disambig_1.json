In a general sense, it refers to the monarch exercising executive authority, usually in the form of approving orders, on the advice of the country's privy council or executive council.\nIn countries where the reigning monarch is represented by a viceroy, derivative terms are used instead, such as Governor in Council or Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nNorway\nIn Norway, the King in Council () refers to the meetings of the king and the Council of State (the Cabinet), wherein matters of importance and major decisions are made. The council meets at the Royal Palace, normally every Friday. These meetings are chaired by the monarch or, if he is ill or abroad, crown prince (the monarch's heir). In Norway's constitution, King in Council refers to the formal Government of Norway, whereas merely King means the appointed ministry that the law refers to may alone act with complete authority on the matter assigned in the particular law.\nA decision that is taken in the State Council under the sovereign's leadership is considered to be a royal decree. If the crown prince chairs, they are crown prince resolutions. When neither the monarch nor the crown prince chairs, resolutions adopted are called government resolutions.\nSweden\nin Sweden]]\nIn Sweden, the King in Council (), more commonly known as The Royal Majesty ( or the short forms ' or ') was a concept of constitutional importance until 1974.\nThe Royal Majesty was the commonly used term to refer to the supreme executive authority under the 1809 Instrument of Government, under which the monarch made all decisions of state in the presence of his Cabinet ministers. The 1974 Instrument of Government removed the monarch from all exercise of formal political powers, which were passed to the newly created government (), chaired and led in all aspects by the prime minister. The monarch continues to head the Cabinet councils (the sovereign plus the members of the government) and the Council on Foreign Affairs, recognizing new cabinets (in the Council of State).\nCommonwealth realms\nThe King-in-Council is the technical term of constitutional law for the exercise of executive authority in a Commonwealth realm, denoting the monarch acting by and with the advice and consent of his or her privy council (in the United Kingdom and Canada's federal jurisdiction) or executive council (in most other Commonwealth realms and the Australian states and Canadian provinces). In those realms and dependencies where the sovereign's powers and functions are delegated to a governor-general, lieutenant governor, or governor, the term Governor-General-in-Council, Lieutenant Governor-in-Council, or Governor-in-Council may be used instead of King-in-Council, all of these terms describing the same technical process within constitutional law. The government of jurisdiction is commonly used as a synonym for any of the aforementioned terms, though the phrase may mean more than one thing in certain areas.\nThe Queen of Ceylon with Kotelawala cabinet.jpeg|Elizabeth II, Queen of Ceylon, with her cabinet in Ceylon, 1954\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and her Canadian Ministers at Rideau Hall 1 July 1967.jpg|Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, with her Cabinet, a subcommittee of the Queen's Privy Council, in Rideau Hall, 1 July 1967\nNew Zealand Cabinet, 1981.jpg|Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, with her Cabinet, a subcommittee of the Executive Council, 1981\nSecond Keating Cabinet 1994.jpg| Governor-General Bill Hayden, representing Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, with his Cabinet, a subcommittee of the Federal Executive Council, outside Government House, 25 March 1994\nThe Queen attending Cabinet to mark her Diamond Jubilee.jpg|Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, with her Cabinet, a subcommittee of the Privy Council, at 10 Downing Street, 18 December 2012\nSwearing-In Day Trudeau Cabinet.jpg|Governor General David Johnston, representing Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, with his Cabinet at Rideau Hall, 4 November 2015\nAn order made by the King-in-Council is known as an order-in-council and such actions are subject to judicial review.|group=lower-alpha|name=opinion}} Orders-in-council may be used to implement secondary legislation, such as British statutory instruments. In practice, decisions made by the King-in-Council are almost always the formal approval to decisions made by the cabinet, a subcommittee of the privy or executive council that includes the senior ministers of the Crown and often meets without the monarch or his local representative present.\nFormer Commonwealth realms and dependencies often retain a similar constitutional concept; for example, President-in-Council in India or Chief Executive-in-Council in Hong Kong. Similar concepts can also be found in some non-Commonwealth countries.\nSee also\nSweden\n* Privy Council of Sweden\n* Council of State (Sweden)\nThe Commonwealth\n* King-in-Parliament\n* King's Counsel\n* Law officers of the Crown\nIreland\n* Council of State (Ireland)\nNotes\nReferences"
