On 18–19 January, 1944.\nPrelude\nDuring January 10–15, 27th Volhynian Infantry Division of the Home Army wasn't fully formed yet, but was already involved in operations. \"Osnowa\" unit engaged in skirmishes with UPA in the north of Włodzimierz Wołyński. Large number of UPA forces was located in Gnojno. UPA forces stationed there posed a threat to AK forces from the Eastern direction. Concerning activities were reported regarding Germans and UPA partisans near Włodzimierz Wołyński. AK intended to capture Włodzimierz Wołyński and eliminate UPA base in Gnojno. \"Piotrusia\", \"Jarosława\" and \"Lecha\" units took part in the assault.\nBattle\nOn January 18, AK received the news of German troops abandoning Włodzimierz Wołyński. AK troops headed to Włodzimierz Wołyński with intention of capturing it. However, Lt. \"Bogoria\" decided not to strike the city for unknown reason. On January 19, AK learnt from captured UPA partisans about planned UPA attack on Bielin, which was going to be launched from their base in Gnojno. Lt. \"Bogoria\" decided to disrupt planned UPA assault by attacking their base there. AK clashed with one of UPA units in Ludmipol settlement and made them retreat.\nAK forces were 1.5 km away from the settlement, but with all the fighting they alerted the main UPA force in Gnojno and lost the element of surprise. UPA was given time to react and repel AK assaults. First AK attack on Gnojno was met with organised UPA fire from well-fortified positions, which paralyzed the AK attack. This occurred in outskirts of the settlement, AK troops hidden from UPA fire for 3 hours before being forced to retreat. Other AK attacks were also repelled and UPA defense held firmly. Polish forces retreated to Bielin and Siedlisko after these failed attacks.\nAftermath\nAK operation in Gnojno was unsuccessful. AK losses were 1 killed and 3 wounded. Other sources estimate AK losses at 5 killed. UPA losses couldn't be estimated.\nOn January 25, UPA attacked Bielin in response to previous AK attacks. UPA attack was repelled, but the UPA-men still managed to cause destruction in several Polish settlements. On 29 January, AK units attacked Babie and Szczu settlements, which only achieved limited success with devastation of these settlements.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
