It was named after John E. Brookings, president of the Brookings Lumber & Box Company, who founded the city in 1908. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,744.\nHistory\nFounding\nIn 1906, the Brookings Timber Company hired William James Ward, a graduate in civil engineering and forestry, to come to the southern Oregon Coast and survey its lumbering potential. After timber cruising the Chetco and Pistol River areas for several years, he recommended that the Brookings people begin extensive lumbering operations here and secure a townsite for a mill and shipping center.\nWhile John E. Brookings was responsible for the founding of Brookings as a company town, it was his cousin, Robert S. Brookings, who was responsible for its actual design. The latter Brookings hired Bernard Maybeck, an architect based in San Francisco who was later involved in the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, to lay out the plat of the townsite.\nWorld War II\nOn September&nbsp;9, 1942, Mount Emily near Brookings became the only site in the mainland United States and the second in the continental territory after the bombing of Dutch Harbor to suffer aerial bombardment during World War II. A Japanese floatplane piloted by Nobuo Fujita was launched from submarine I-25. The plane was armed with two incendiary bombs on a mission intended to start massive fires in the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest.\nFujita was invited to Brookings in 1962 and, as a token of friendship, gifted the city his 400-year-old family katana. Fujita later sponsored a trip to Japan for Brookings high school students and returned to the city three more times in the early 1990s. In 1997, Fujita was made an honorary citizen of Brookings by the city council.\n21st century\nThe current marketing \"brand\" for the community, through the Brookings-Harbor Chamber of Commerce, is \"The Pulse of America's Wild Rivers Coast\". America's Wild Rivers Coast is a regional marketing brand for Curry County, Oregon, and Del Norte County, California.\n2011 tsunami\nThe Port of Brookings Harbor was damaged by tidal surges from a tsunami on March&nbsp;11, 2011. The largest surge was estimated to be nearly . Boats were damaged, sunk, set adrift, and swept out to sea after many docks were torn away and pilings broken. The tsunami was caused by the 9.0 MW Tōhoku earthquake offshore of the east coast of Honshu Island, Japan. The damage was estimated at $25 million&nbsp;to $30 million.\nGeography\n]]\nBrookings is located along the southern Oregon coast at the mouth of the Chetco River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  is water.\nClimate\ns can grow there.]]\nBrookings has a mild Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb). According to the Trewartha climate classification, Brookings has a subtropical climate (Cs) since eight months are above .\nA weather phenomenon known as the \"Chetco Effect\" or the \"Brookings Effect\" can cause the temperature in Brookings near the Chetco River mouth to be much higher than the surrounding area. Adiabatic heating increases the temperature and reduces relative humidity as katabatic wind, driven by high pressure on the Great Basin, descend across the west slopes of the Cascade Range and Oregon Coast Range. The heart of Brookings, with its orientation, is protected from sea breezes coming from the northwest and the warm, dry, down-sloping winds that are funneled down the Coastal Range into the deep Chetco River gorge can reach the coast uninfluenced by the effects of the Pacific.  This can result in large temperature gradients; when Brookings recorded its all-time record high on July 8, 2008 of , Crescent City, around  south of Brookings, recorded a high temperature of just .\n) since May 2002, and at the Brookings 2 SE COOP () before then.}}\n|single line = Y\n|width = 50%\n|collapsed = Y\n|Jan record high F = 80\n|Feb record high F = 85\n|Mar record high F = 88\n|Apr record high F = 92\n|May record high F = 99\n|Jun record high F = 100\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 101\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 100\n|Nov record high F = 88\n|Dec record high F = 79\n|Jan high F = 53.7\n|Feb high F = 54.7\n|Mar high F = 55.4\n|Apr high F = 57.9\n|May high F = 61.7\n|Jun high F = 64.6\n|Jul high F = 66.6\n|Aug high F = 66.4\n|Sep high F = 66.9\n|Oct high F = 62.7\n|Nov high F = 57.3\n|Dec high F = 53.0\n|year high F = 60.1\n|Jan mean F = 48.6\n|Feb mean F = 48.9\n|Mar mean F = 49.4\n|Apr mean F = 51.4\n|May mean F = 54.9\n|Jun mean F = 58.1\n|Jul mean F = 60.0\n|Aug mean F = 60.1\n|Sep mean F = 59.6\n|Oct mean F = 56.0\n|Nov mean F = 51.6\n|Dec mean F = 47.9\n|Jan low F = 43.6\n|Feb low F = 43.2\n|Mar low F = 43.4\n|Apr low F = 45.0\n|May low F = 48.0\n|Jun low F = 51.4\n|Jul low F = 53.4\n|Aug low F = 53.8\n|Sep low F = 52.3\n|Oct low F = 49.2\n|Nov low F = 45.8\n|Dec low F = 42.7\n|year low F= 47.7\n|Jan record low F = 21\n|Feb record low F = 24\n|Mar record low F = 29\n|Apr record low F = 28\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 34\n|Jul record low F = 39\n|Aug record low F = 37\n|Sep record low F = 34\n|Oct record low F = 30\n|Nov record low F = 28\n|Dec record low F = 17\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 12.57\n|Feb precipitation inch = 9.91\n|Mar precipitation inch = 9.89\n|Apr precipitation inch = 7.09\n|May precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.06\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.39\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.67\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.46\n|Oct precipitation inch = 4.98\n|Nov precipitation inch = 11.12\n|Dec precipitation inch = 14.10\n|year precipitation inch= 77.61\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0\n|Nov snow inch = 0\n|Dec snow inch = 0.1\n|Jan snow inch = 0.2\n|Feb snow inch = 0.3\n|Mar snow inch = 0.1\n|Apr snow inch = 0\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|year snow inch= 0.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.05 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 17.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.1\n|Mar precipitation days = 17.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 14.4\n|May precipitation days =  9.8\n|Jun precipitation days =  6.0\n|Jul precipitation days =  3.4\n|Aug precipitation days =  3.9\n|Sep precipitation days =  4.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 10.3\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.9\n|Dec precipitation days = 18.5\n|unit snow days = 0.1 in\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0\n|Nov snow days = 0\n|Dec snow days = 0.1\n|Jan snow days = 0\n|Feb snow days = 0.1\n|Mar snow days = 0\n|Apr snow days = 0\n|May snow days = 0\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|source 1 = NOAA\n}}\n;Notes:\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 6,336 people, 2,717 households, and 1,689 families residing in the city.
