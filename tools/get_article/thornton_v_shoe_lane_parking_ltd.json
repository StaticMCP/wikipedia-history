It provides a good example of the rule that a clause cannot be incorporated after a contract has been concluded, without reasonable notice before. Also, it was held that an automatic ticket machine was an offer, rather than an invitation to treat, that the insertion of money was an acceptance, therefore, specifically, any (additional) conditions on the ticket were post-acceptance and invalid.\nAlthough the case is important for these two propositions, today any exclusion of negligence liability for personal injury by businesses is prohibited by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 s 2(1) and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 Sch 2, para(a).\nFacts\nFrancis Thornton, \"a free lance trumpeter of the highest quality\", drove to the entrance of the multi-storey car park on Shoe Lane, before attending a performance at Farringdon Hall with the BBC. He took a ticket from the ticket machine and parked his car. It said\nOn the car park pillars near the paying office there was a list, one excluding liability for\nThree hours later he had an accident before getting into his car. The car park operator argued that the judge should have held the matter regulated by this contract, not tort.\nJudgment\nLord Denning MR held that the more onerous the clause, the better notice of it needed to be given. Moreover, the contract was already concluded when the ticket came out of the machine, and so any condition on it could not be incorporated in the contract.\nMegaw LJ and Sir Gordon Willmer agreed with the onerous point, but reserved their opinions on where the contract was concluded. Furthermore, Sir Gordon – similarly to Denning – distinguished this case from the other ticket cases based upon the fact that a human clerk proffered the ticket and the buyer therefore would have had the opportunity to disagree with the conditions, hand the ticket back and have their money refunded.\nSee also\n*Parker v South Eastern Railway Company (1877) 2 CPD 416\n*Chapelton v Barry UDC [1940] 1 KB 532\n*Olley v Marlborough Court Hotel [1949] 1 KB 532\n*J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw [1956] 1 WLR 461\n*Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd [1989] QB 433\n*George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd [1983] QB 284\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1970/2.html Full text of the decision at BAILII]\n* [https://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2005/5.html General discussion on unread contract, section on 'failure to read']"
