The nominations were announced on January 14, 1994. Actor and director Robert Townsend hosted the ceremony, which was previously a position held on to for eight consecutive years by Buck Henry.\nControversy\nThe announcement of this year's nominations—made by a committee of a governing body called the Independent Features Project West—was postponed due to a confusion over the eligibility of Gramercy Pictures' drama A Dangerous Woman. The IFPW board determined that the film, which initially had received two nominations, had been partially funded by Universal Pictures and thus was not eligible, according to then-IFPW President Cathy Main; Gramercy Pictures is jointly owned by Universal Pictures and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. In response, Gramercy Pictures President Russell Schwartz said the IFPW's rules \"make no sense\" and the IFPW is \"as archaic as the (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences') foreign language rules\". Schwartz also added that Universal's only involvement was to guarantee a bank loan to the filmmaker and its money was not used.\nWinners and nominees\n, Best Director winner and Best Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Best Male Lead winner]]\n, Best Female Lead winner]]\n, Best Supporting Male winner]]\n, Best Supporting Female winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Best Feature\n!Best Director\n|-\n| Short Cuts\n* Equinox\n* Much Ado About Nothing\n* Ruby in Paradise\n* The Wedding Banquet\n| 'Robert Altman &ndash; Short Cuts'\n* Ang Lee &ndash; The Wedding Banquet\n* Victor Nuñez &ndash; Ruby in Paradise\n* Robert Rodriguez &ndash; El Mariachi\n* John Turturro &ndash; Mac\n|-\n!Best Male Lead\n!Best Female Lead\n|-\n| 'Jeff Bridges &ndash; American Heart'\n* Vincent D'Onofrio &ndash; Household Saints\n* Mitchell Lichtenstein &ndash; The Wedding Banquet\n* Matthew Modine &ndash; Equinox\n* Tyrin Turner &ndash; Menace II Society\n| 'Ashley Judd &ndash; Ruby in Paradise'\n* Suzy Amis &ndash; The Ballad of Little Jo\n* May Chin &ndash; The Wedding Banquet\n* Ariyan A.
