The alliance consisted of five political parties which shared a syncretic political ideology centered around direct democracy and anti-establishment rhetoric. The alliance won 15 seats from two different countries (14 from Italy and 1 from Croatia), falling short of the 25 MEPs from seven member states required to form a political group in the European Parliament.\nHistory\nMembership\nThe following parties participated in the alliance:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country\n! colspan=\"2\" |Party\n!Abbr.\n!Representative\n!Ideology\n!Seats won\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor= |\n|Human Shield\n|ŽZ\n|Ivan Vilibor Sinčić\n|Populism\n|}}\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor= |\n|Movement Now\n|Liik\n|Karoliina Kähönen\n|Liberalism\n|}}\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor= |\n|Agricultural Livestock Party of Greece\n|AKKEL\n|Evangelos Tsiobanidis\n|Agrarianism\n|}}\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor= |\n|Five Star Movement\n|M5S\n|Luigi Di Maio\n|Populism\n|}}\n|-\n|\n|bgcolor= |\n|Kukiz'15\n|K'15\n|Paweł Kukiz\n|Right-wing populism\n|}}\n|}\nSee also\n* Democracy in Europe Movement 2025, pan-European alliance aiming to democratise the EU\n* Yellow vests protests, motivated by similar principles to 5SDD\n* Law and Justice, successor to Human Shield\n* European Alliance for Freedom and Democracy, of which ŽZ, AKKEL, and K'15 were membres\nReferences"
