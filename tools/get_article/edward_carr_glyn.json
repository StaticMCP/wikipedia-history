He was the Bishop of Peterborough from 1897 to 1916.\nLife\nBorn in St George Hanover Square, London, Glyn was a younger son of George Glyn, 1st Baron Wolverton and Marianne, daughter of Pascoe Grenfell.

He was educated at Harrow School and University College, Oxford and ordained in 1868.\nAfter a curacy in Doncaster, Carr&nbsp;Glyn was the domestic chaplain to William Thomson, the Archbishop of York, and then held incumbencies at St&nbsp;Mary's Church, Beverley, St&nbsp;George's Church, Doncaster and St&nbsp;Mary Abbots Church, Kensington He became an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen and was the Bishop of Peterborough from 1897 until 1916.

In a sermon in the Cathedral for Christians of all denominations, he said ‘This war has been unsought and undesired by us. We are not fighting for increase of dominion or for enlargement of territory, but in spite of every endeavour to maintain the peace of Europe we now find ourselves necessarily and inevitably involved in a war which in severity and endurance is likely to surpass the recorded wars of English history’. He praised parents, sisters, lovers and friends for letting family members go off to the War. He sanctioned a prayer for animals suffering in the War, instituted parochial Rolls of Honour of those serving in the forces and had church bells ring at noon each day as a call to private prayer.
