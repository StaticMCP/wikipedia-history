Unusual for gobies, this species is almost a fully pelagic fish.  H. bergi grows to a length of  SL.  This species is also the only known member of its genus. The specific name honours the Soviet zoologist Lev Berg (1876-1950) who described many new species of goby from the Caspian Sea.\nReferences\ncategory:Fish of the Caspian Sea"
