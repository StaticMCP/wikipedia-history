It was an indecisive engagement, part of the Great Northern War.\nShips involved\nSweden\nRussia\nPrelude\nA small Swedish squadron led by Commander Carl Raab consisting of three ships of the line encountered on 10 July 1713 a much larger Russian squadron near Gogland who gave chase to the Swedes withdrawing towards west.\nBattle\nEarly on the 11 July, faster Russian ships had gained the Swedish squadron and reached firing distance. Intense fighting took place near Kalbådagrund and Yttre Hällkallan shallows. During the fight, Raab's flagship Ösel run aground but could swiftly detach itself and rejoin the fight. Three Russian ships following also run aground, one of them so badly that it could not be pulled free and had to be torched. Swedish ships had suffered only superficial damage and withdrew to Helsinki while the Russian squadron lost a 50-gun ship of the line Viborg.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
