It elects four councillors and covers northern and eastern parts of Airdrie (Clarkston, Drumgelloch, Holehills and Thrashbush neighbourhoods) plus the outlying villages of Caldercruix, Wattston, Plains and Glenmavis. Established in 2007, a boundary review in 2017 resulted in a very minor change (the loss of a few streets in Burnfoot). In 2019, the ward's population was 20,137.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Sophia Coyle(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Campbell Cameron(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Tommy Morgan(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Jim McGuigan(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3|Alan Beveridge(SNP/Ind.)\n|rowspan=1|Andrew Spowart(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|David Cullen(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Henry Emerson Dunbar(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Richard Alan Sullivan(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n|numcounts= 8\n}}\n2012 election\n|numcounts= 6\n}}\n*SNP councillor Alan Beveridge resigned from the party and became Independent on 10 February 2015 in opposition to the party's 2015 Westminster Election selection procedures.\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
