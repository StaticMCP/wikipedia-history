It premiered via a teaser in early July and was officially released on 18 July 2025 alongside a music video.\nBackground and release\nPresident announced plans for their debut EP, King of Terrors, scheduled for release on 26 September 2025. \"Rage\" was unveiled as its lead single, with a teaser shared on 4 July and the full track and video dropping on 18 July.\nComposition and lyrics\n\"Rage\" explores a more synth-heavy, electronic-driven sound compared to President's earlier guitar-based singles. Its lyrical content is inspired by Dylan Thomas’s poem \"Do not go gentle into that good night.\"\nMusic video\nThe official music video was released alongside the single on 18 July. The video is set in a cathedral and features a stylized \"dance-fight\" between two dancers while the masked vocalist observes from a balcony above.\nLive performances\n\"Rage\" was among the songs performed during President's live debut at Download Festival 2025.\nCritical reception\nMetal Hammer described it as \"a genuinely tender and beautiful moment,\" noting its synth-driven, electronic style.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Rage\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles Downloads (OCC)\n| 93\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles Sales (OCC)\n| 98\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Rock & Metal (OCC)\n| 32\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
