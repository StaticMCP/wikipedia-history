It is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution.\nHistory\nDuring the 1980s, a plan to consolidate the city-owned Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center and the Children's Museum of Wichita was proposed. In 1992, a capital funds campaign was launched, and with an endowment from Velma Lunt Wallace, funds from the City of Wichita and Sedgwick County, and other donations, the museum opened in the spring of 2000.\nThe museum is supported by admissions, membership dues, Sedgwick County government, and other public support and voluntary contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations.  In 2019 Exploration Place had attendance of 345,838, made up of 279,640 people visiting the facility and 66,198 people engaged through outreach programs.\nFrom April 2000 to around mid 2007, KSN-TV had a live exhibit called \"The KSN WeatherLab\". Meteorologists did live broadcasts daily, while spectators could sit in bleachers and watch. During off-air hours, visitors could interact with the green screen as well as ask meteorologists questions (via a walk-up style window).\nBuilding\nA view of the floor to ceiling windows on the island building.Construction began May 1997 and took 2 ½ years. Internationally acclaimed architect Moshe Safdie of Boston designed the building. There are  and  on the property. The tallest point of the building is the peak of the roof of the traveling exhibits space and is  above the floor (nearly 7 stories high). The combined distance around the interior perimeter of both buildings is approximately one mile.\nThe \"Island Building\" is named because it is surrounded by water, with the Arkansas River on one side and the reflecting pond on the other. The reflecting pond is between the buildings to create the illusion that looks like the river runs between the buildings. The reflecting pond is one to three feet deep. Even though the building is so close to the river it is not prone to flooding because it is above the 100-year flood level. During the flood in October 1998, the worst in recent history, the water level was still more than  below the finished floor level.\nDome Theater\nThis venue is the largest dome theater in Kansas with a 60-foot high, 360-degree screen.  It shows digital films.  General museum admission is not required to see a show at the dome.\nKemper Creative Learning Studio\nThis venue is a 140-seat theater equipped with audio/visual equipment, sound system, podium and stage lighting.
