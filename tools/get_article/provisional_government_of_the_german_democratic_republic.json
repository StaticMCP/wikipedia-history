According to the law, members of the government were: the prime minister, his 3 deputies and his 14 ministers. The number of ministers would increase to 15 after the State Security Department was elevated to a ministry by the Law on the Formation of a Ministry for State Security of February 8, 1950). It existed until November 7, 1950, after which the Council of Ministers became the government of the GDR as the Second cabinet of Otto Grotewohl.\nMinistries\nThe government consisted of:\npp. 53-85\n| minister1_termstart    = 8 February 1950\n| minister1_termend      = 7 November 1950\n| minister1_party        = Socialist Unity Party of Germany\n}}\n| minister1_termstart    = 7 October 1949\n| minister1_termend      = 7 November 1950\n| minister1_party        = Independent\n}}\n| minister1_termstart    = 7 October 1949\n| minister1_termend      = 7 November 1950\n| minister1_party        = Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)\n}}\n|}\nMinistry-level Committees\n|}\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*[http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=2127 Wer war wer in der DDR?]\n*[https://www.stiftung-hsh.de/history/stasi-prison/biographies/the-fifties/georg-dertinger-en-gb/ Georg Dertinger]\n*[https://portal.dnb.de/opac/showFullRecord?currentResultId=%22124953018%22%26any&currentPosition=2 Carl Steinhoff: erster DDR-Innenminister : Wandlungen eines bürgerlichen Sozialisten / Lutz Maeke]\n*\n*Gesetz über die Regierung der DDR:  Online-Veröffentlichung, retrieved 10 January 2018\n*Gesetz über die Bildung eines Ministeriums für Staatssicherheit:'' http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/mfsbildung50.htm Online-Veröffentlichung, retrieved 10 January 2018."
