The software was initially developed as part of a 2009 workshop at Johns Hopkins University.\nKaldi is named after the legendary Ethiopian goat herder Kaldi who was said to have discovered the coffee plant.\nSee also\n*fMLLR\n*List of speech recognition software\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/ Kaldi] – The official GitHub project\n*Kaldi paper - [http://publications.idiap.ch/downloads/papers/2012/Povey_ASRU2011_2011.pdf The Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit]\n*[https://alphacephei.com/vosk/ VOSK] – open source and commercial models from Alpha Cephei on Kaldi foundations"
