It flows from the northwestern slopes of the Alpine National Park in the Australian Alps, through the King Valley, and joining with the Ovens River at the rural city of Wangaratta.\nLocation and features\nThe King River rises below Mount Buggery, within Mansfield Shire, at an elevation exceeding  above sea level. The river flows generally north by northwest, most of its course through remote parts of the Alpine and Mount Buffalo national parks, and then descending into the King Valley, joined by eight minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Ovens River at Wangaratta. The river descends  over its  course.\nThe river is impounded by the William Hovell Dam to form Lake William Hovell, that provides water for approximately  for irrigated crops, vineyards and grazing properties along the King River from Cheshunt to Wangaratta. A small  hydro-electric generator is driven by the river's outflow from the dam, with an average annual output of .\nEtymology\nThe river was given its English name by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell, explorers of the region, in honour of Captain Philip Gidley King, the third Governor of New South Wales, in office from 1800 to 1806.\nIn the Aboriginal Waywurru language, the river is named Poodumbeyer, with no defined meaning.\nRecreation\nKayaking enthusiasts access the river for the many level 2 and level 3 rapids. In 2008 the site for the Victorian and Australian Downriver Championships.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links"
