Nobility and clergy enjoyed privileges and all political rights, while completely disenfranchised peasantry carried all the hard burdens of state, especially forced labour such as Corvée. At the same time, peasantry was more than anyone affected by the Ottoman akinji raids while also participating in the wars against Ottoman Empire.\nThe uprising erupted on 29 January 1573 in Croatian Zagorje, including lands south of the Sava river, near settlements: Mokrice, Samobor, Okić and Jastrebarsko. In neighbouring Styria, rebellion erupted in area between Bizeljsko and Podčetrtek and continued spreading towards Brežice. One of rebelled serfs commander - Ilija Gregorić - managed to capture  castle with the help of serfs from neighbouring Bizeljsko.\nOpposing forces\nNobility\nUskoks captain Josip Thurn commanded contingent of some 500 men consisting of uskoks (haramijas) equipped with firearms. There was also German infantry and cavalry, as well as Bihać cavalry contingent led by lieutenant Danilo Laser. Additionally, he also had at his disposal some musketeers, arquebusiers and hussars.\nRebelled peasantry\nRebels captain Nikola Kupinić led a contingent of some two thousand Croatian and Slovene serfs. Most of the serfs had some combat experience; either by serving in Landsturm wars against the Ottomans, where they served as either: infantry, cavalry or riflemen. In addition, serfs from Susedgrad-Stubica Segniory already fought in feudal struggles between Hennings and Tahys over control of Susedgrad Castle. For example, in January 1565, Hennings armed their 800 serfs for taking over Stubica castle. Few years later, 3000 strong serf army armed and equipped by Croatian vice-ban  managed to defeat royal Croatian army near castle of Susedgrad. Nonetheless, when peasant revolt erupted, most of the weaponry and ammunition remained stored in fortified castles controlled by nobility. The only castles which peasants did manage to take were Cesargrad (captured on 29 January) and Krško, which surrendered without a fight between 4 and 5 February. From these victories, serfs managed to capture some rifles, sabres, spears and some 8-10 light Lombard cannons. As most of these weapons ended distributed between various peasant armies, most of the serfs were merely infantry armed with axes, flails, scythes or with some rifles with little ammunition. Some 10% of rebelled serfs could also fight as a cavalry. Many serfs used bows and arrows.\nThe battle\nAfter ravaging Brežice on 3 February, rebelled serfs entered Krško on 5 February following negotiations, and without a fight. On the same day, rebelled forces led by Ilija Gregorić split into two groups near Videm. Larger 2000 strong contingent led by Nikola Kupinić crossed the Sava river, and hoped to advance through Krka river valley to Novo Mesto, with objective to persuade local peasants to join their cause. They also planned to persuade Žumberak uskoks to join them. Meanwhile, Josip Thurn learnt about the atmosphere of mutiny among the uskoks, due to unpaid salaries. He first had these salaries paid from his own pocket, after which he had 3 loudest uskok rebels hanged. After regaining discipline among his uskoks, Thurn with his 500 strong army reached Krško on 5 February. Rebelled peasants soon spotted a well organized contingent of professional soldiers, so they pulled back to Krško.\nThurn's troops quickly seized the initiative and attacked Krško. In his letter to Carniolan estates, Thurn wrote that he ordered one contingent of his infantry to enter town \"from the upper side\", while simultaneously ordering his cavalry to charge the town from the opposite side. He wrote that his men killed many peasants \"with God's aid\", while many more peasants drowned in Sava river. In conclusion of his letter, he wrote that his uskoks raged so fiercely over defeated peasants that even he himself felt pitty. The peasant defeat at Krško had a decisive effect in scaring away the peasant movement in Carniola and Styria.\nConsequences\nUpon learning of peasant defeat at Krško, Gregorić headed to village of Planina, where another group of rebelled peasants, led by Pavao Šterc, awaited. Due to disinformation about ongoing Ottoman raid in the area, this group of rebels quickly dispersed. Meanwhile, Šterc got captured by some local segniory commander. As Gregorić could not do anything to save Šterc from captivity, he decided to withdraw across Pilštanj, back to Zagorje.\nReferences\nLiterature\n*\n*\n*\n*"
