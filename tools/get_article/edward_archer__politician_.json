He was the son of David Archer and Susan (née Stubbs). His father, born in Scotland, was one of the Archer brothers – including Charles, Archibald, Thomas, Alexander, and Colin – who engaged in commercial activities in Scotland, Norway and Australia.\nArcher was educated in London at Whitgift School and King's College School. He worked with the British India Steam Navigation Company in London from 1891 to 1894, then spent several years on the Canadian Prairies engaged in farming. He relocated to Australia in 1897, joining his brothers Robert and John as a partner in their business activities in Gracemere, Queensland. Archer was manager of the company's station at Targinnie, as well as a small gold mine within the boundaries of their lease. He was chairman of the Port Curtis Dairy Company Ltd from 1904 to 1907 and served terms on the Shire Councils for the Shire of Calliope and the Shire of Fitzroy.\nPolitics\nArcher was elected to the Australian House of Representatives electoral Division of Capricornia as an Anti-Socialist on 12 December 1906, serving until 13 April 1910. When he was sworn as an MP in February 1907, he chose to make an affirmation rather than swear an oath, making him the first member of the House of Representatives to do so.\nLater, Archer changed to state politics, serving as member for the electorate of Normanby in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland between 5 March 1914 until the state election on 22 May 1915.\nReferences"
