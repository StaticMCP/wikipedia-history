On November 17, 2012 she was nominated for the MTV Europe Music Awards as the Best Czech & Slovak Act. However, on November 11, 2012 lost in favor of her fellow Majk Spirit, singer was then only female nominee out of five presented artists for the regional category, having placed the second. On January 16, 2013 the Slávik Awards nominations were announced in her home country. For this occasion, she overall earned four nominations, including the category New Artist of the Year that she won on February 3, 2013. Simultaneously with that, Buckingham also became the runner-up for the major female category at the ceremony, for which she earned a silver trophy at least.\nOne day preceding the annual event, on February 2, the later victor of the gold prize, Tina, would compliment her youngest rival via a social networking website. Her Facebook statement cited the Czech BRAVO magazine, too. \"I don't want it to sound silly or thankless, but I think that for the year 2012 the award should be deserved by Celeste Buckingham. I watch her from distance already since the SuperStar, where I'd met her, and [I] have to say [that] no other female vocalist in Slovakia has done in the past period of time such a deal of work than she has. Undoubtedly she had the most played songs, most concerts, a good sale, fans found their way to her and they did well. She is a phenomenon and [she] deserves to get the credit [...].\" Buckingham eventually missed the main prize by 83 votes.\nSome of her additional nominations for poll-oriented awards included one for the SK TV-based OTOs, her winning, two nominations at the Žebřík Music Awards by CZ magazine REPORT, winning one category, two winning nominations for the recently established Evropa 2 Awards named after the CZ radio station, and a nomination for the CZ Óčko Awards held by a local music TV. In terms of the year-end charts, her signature song \"Run Run Run\" was ranked as the most played SK composition of 2012, while second in the CZ territory, and she was also voted the Most Desired Female Singer within an online poll organized by Feminity.sk. Based on the Google's annual report Zeitgeist, Buckingham was listed among the most sought-after celebrities on the internet for the year of 2012, being rated as the fourth within the SK entertainment industry and ninth in the CZ show business, respectively.\nMusic awards\nE2 Music Awards\nThe Evropa 2 in Czech Republic, or rather Europa 2 Music Awards in Slovakia were originally established by CZ contemporary hit radio Evropa 2 in March 2013.
