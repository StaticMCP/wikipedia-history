It depicts a panoramic view of the Battle of Mount Tabor fought on 16 April 1799 during the French invasion of Egypt and Syria. The battle, fought several miles west of Mount Tabor was a decisive victory for French forces led by General Napoleon Bonaparte over their Ottoman and Mameluke opponents.\nLejeune exhibited a sketch at the Salon of 1804 and then the full version at the Salon of 1808 at the Louvre, in Paris. Today it is part of the collection at the Palace of Versailles, having been acquired in 1861.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Hornstein, Katie. Picturing War in France, 1792–1856.
