      "text": "# Cape Ward Hunt\n\nCape Ward Hunt is a cape on the north coast of Oro Province, Papua New Guinea. The cape was named after George Ward Hunt, First Lord of the Admiralty (1874–1877), by Captain John Moresby.\nThe cape is a bold, well-wooded point about  high that rises to an elevation of , with a disused , metal-framework light tower on the point and a conspicuous rock named Craigs Pillar at its eastern extremity. The waters lying between Cape Ward Hunt and Cape Nelson about  distant are described as being:\nof the most dangerous character, due to the unsurveyed areas and the numerous coral patches and shoals. The coral patches are steep-to and the sea seldom breaks on\nthem. The weather is often thick with passing squalls of rain, and anchorages are rare close to land. Between coral patches only a few miles apart [half-dozen km], a sounding of several hundred meters [] may be obtained.\nA radar of the Royal Australian Air Force manned by No. 315 Radar Station RAAF was located upon Cape Ward Hunt from 12 April 1943 until 4 October 1944 during World War II.\nReferences\nReferences cited\n*\n*\n*"
