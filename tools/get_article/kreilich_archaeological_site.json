Genevieve, Missouri. It is located near the mouth of Saline Creek, it encompasses a complex of structures and landforms related to the processing of salt by early French colonists.  The remains of stone salt furnaces survive, and archaeological investigation of the area in the 1980s has yielded pottery from the early 18th century.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Ste.
