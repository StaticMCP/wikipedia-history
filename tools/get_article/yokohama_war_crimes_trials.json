The defendants included civilians as well as military personnel ranging from enlisted ranks to generals, they belonged to class B and C, as defined by the charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Of those tried, 854 defendants were convicted, with 124 of them receiving death sentences, of which 51 were carried out. All of the convicts served their sentences or were executed at Sugamo Prison. In 1958, those still serving prison sentences from the trials were all paroled. These trials accounted for the majority of the 474 American war crimes trials conducted in the Asia-Pacific region.\nBackground\nThe majority of the 996 defendants were charged with committing war crimes against Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and civilian internees. During the conflict, Imperial Japan captured a large number of Allied military personnel and civilians across Asia and the Pacific. While some were detained at the sites of their surrender, others were transported to detention facilities within Japan and other occupied territories. Many detainees were subjected to forced labor under harsh conditions intended to support Japan's wartime economy.\nReports and judicial records from the period document widespread mistreatment, including inadequate provision of food, medical care, and shelter. The trials revealed a range of abuses such as physical assaults, torture, mutilation, medical experimentation, and execution by various means including shooting, bayoneting, and beheading. Numerous prison camp commandants and guards were tried. Approximately 90 percent of American POWs who died in Japanese custody perished in prison camps or aboard \"hell ships\".\nDefendants came from a wide range of backgrounds, including professional military personnel across all ranks, ranging from generals to enlisted men, as well as interpreters, agricultural workers, mine foremen, medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, civil servants, Shinto priests, and academics. Several women were also prosecuted, Shigeko Tsutsui for example, was a former army nurse charged for her involvement in \"merciless medical experiments\" upon captured American airmen.\nNotable defendants\nLieutenant General Tasuku Okada: Ordered the summary executions of 38 captured American aircrew.
