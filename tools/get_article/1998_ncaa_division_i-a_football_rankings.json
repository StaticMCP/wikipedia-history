Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), did not bestow a National Championship title for Division I-A football. That title was primarily bestowed by different polling agencies. There were several polls that currently existed. The main weekly polls were the AP Poll and Coaches Poll. The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings made their debut in 1998, and began being released about halfway through the season.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n|
