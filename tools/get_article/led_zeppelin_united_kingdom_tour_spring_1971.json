The tour commenced on 5 March and concluded on 1 April 1971.\nOverview\nFor this tour, the band decided to mainly perform at the smaller clubs that they had originally played earlier in their career, rather than large arenas and auditoriums. This decision was made to reward those fans who had been loyal to them from the start of their career. The small, more intimate size of the venues, and the correspondingly smaller ticket sales and gate receipts, was offered as proof that Led Zeppelin wasn't preoccupied with making money and instead endeavoured to create a close connection with their audiences when performing on-stage. However, as the tour progressed, it became evident that this intention was compromised due to thousands of fans being shut out of shows because of the scarce availability of concert tickets.\nThe Belfast concert on 5 March featured the first public performance of their now-legendary song \"Stairway to Heaven\", which was played at nearly every subsequent Led Zeppelin show. One scheduled concert from the tour, at Liverpool University, was cancelled and rescheduled to take place during the band's subsequent tour of Europe.\nDuring this period the band members began to experiment with their stage attire, introducing strange caftans and garments and growing longer hair and beards, which gave them a very fashionable appearance.\nTour set list\nA fairly typical set list for the tour was:\n#\"Immigrant Song\" (Page, Plant)\n#\"Heartbreaker\" (Bonham, Jones, Page, Plant)\n#\"Since I've Been Loving You\" (Page, Plant, Jones)\n#\"Out on the Tiles\" (intro) (Page, Plant, Bonham) / \"Black Dog\" (Page, Plant, Jones)\n#\"Dazed and Confused\" (Page)\n#\"Stairway to Heaven\" (Page, Plant)\n#\"Going to California\" (Page, Plant)\n#\"That's the Way\" (Page, Plant) (on 1 April only)\n#\"What Is and What Should Never Be\" (Page, Plant)\n#\"Moby Dick\" (Page, Jones, Bonham)\n#\"Whole Lotta Love\" (Bonham, Dixon, Jones, Page, Plant)\nEncores (variations of the following list):\n*\"Organ Solo\"/\"Thank You\" (Page, Plant) (on 21 March and 1 April only)\n*\"Communication Breakdown\" (Bonham, Jones, Page)\n*\"Rock and Roll\" (Page, Plant, Jones, Bonham) (On 5 March and 6 March)\n*\"Bring It On Home\" (Page, Plant, Dixon) (on 5 March only)\nThere were some set list substitutions, variations, and order switches during the tour.\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| City\n! style=\"width:140px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:220px;\"| Venue\n|-\n|5 March 1971 || Belfast || Northern Ireland || Ulster Hall\n|-\n|6 March 1971 || Dublin || Ireland || National Stadium\n|-\n|9 March 1971 || Leeds || rowspan=\"12\"|England || Leeds University\n|-\n|10 March 1971 || Canterbury || University of Kent\n|-\n|11 March 1971 || Southampton || Southampton University\n|-\n|13 March 1971 || Bath || Bath Pavilion\n|-\n|14 March 1971 ||Stoke-on-Trent|| Trentham Gardens Ballroom\n|-\n|16 March 1971 || Liverpool || Liverpool University\n|-\n|18 March 1971 || Newcastle upon Tyne || Mayfair Ballroom\n|-\n|19 March 1971 || Manchester || Manchester University\n|-\n|20 March 1971 || Birmingham || Stepmothers Club\n|-\n|21 March 1971 || Nottingham || Boat Club\n|-\n|23 March 1971 || rowspan=\"2\"|London || The Marquee\n|-\n|1 April 1971 || Paris Theatre (BBC concert)\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ledzeppelin.com/timelinebrowse Comprehensive archive of known concert appearances by Led Zeppelin (official website)]\n*[http://www.bootledz.com/setlists.htm Led Zeppelin concert setlists]\nSources\n* Keith Shadwick, Led Zeppelin : the story of a band and their music, 1968-80. .\n*Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. ."
