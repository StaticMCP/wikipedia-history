The awards are given by the President of the Philippines to overseas Filipinos and foreign individuals or groups in recognition of their contributions to Philippine development and to the welfare of Filipinos abroad. The program has been covered by Philippine and diaspora media, which have highlighted the achievements of awardees in areas such as education, health, and cultural promotion.\nHistory\nThe awards were established in 1991 through Executive Order No. 498 issued by President Corazon Aquino. The order directed the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) and the Department of Foreign Affairs to manage the awards system.\nSince its creation the program has been held every two years, with the ceremony traditionally taking place at Malacañan Palace. News reports in 2022 described the awards as a way for the Philippine government to recognize the impact of overseas Filipinos and their organizations across different sectors worldwide.\nAs of 2024, more than 500 awards have been given to individuals and organizations in over 50 countries.\nAdministration\nThe CFO acts as the secretariat of the awards. Nominations are usually submitted through Philippine embassies and consulates.
