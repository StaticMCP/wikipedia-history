In 1993, she received a master's degree in Business and Entrepreneurship from Columbia College Chicago.\nCareer\nWarshaw started Bloodshot Records in 1993 with co-founders Rob Miller and Eric Babcock as a hobby that they ran out of her apartment in the Wrigleyville neighborhood of Chicago. They were trying to shine a light on some of the unheralded music they were listening to and seeing in the local Chicago clubs at the time.  As of early 2019, Warshaw resigned from Bloodshot, and, as of late 2020, she and remaining co-owner Miller remained in active litigation.\nIn addition to her work at the label, Warshaw is involved in healthcare reform activism. In 2006, she helped to organize benefits to support Fitzgerald's sound engineer Gary Schepers cover healthcare related expenses.\nShe was the small business owner representative for Illinois on the White House website for health care reform under President Barack Obama. She was an active supporter of the Affordable Care Act.\nPersonal life\nIn 2000, Warshaw married Christian \"Tex\" Schmidt, who was in the German band the Roughnecks. They have a son. The marriage ended in divorce. Warshaw long-term partner is Mark Panick, a musician from the bands The Bonemen of Barumba and Razorhouse.\nAwards\n* 2014: Chicago Tribune, Chicagoans of the Year\n* 2015: Columbia College Chicago, Honorary PhD\n* 2015: Chicago Reader, Best Local Record Label\nWorks and publications\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n* Bloodshot Records\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Warshaw, Nan R.
