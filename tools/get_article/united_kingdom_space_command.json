The UKSC has three functions: space operations, space workforce generation, and space capability.\nUK Space Command was established on 1 April 2021, and from May 2024 is under the command of Major General Paul Tedman. The new command has \"responsibility for not just operations, but also generating, training and growing the force, and also owning the money and putting all the programmatic rigour into delivering new ... capabilities.\" UKSC headquarters is at RAF High Wycombe co-located with Air Command.\nWhen fully operationally capable, UK Space Command will \"provide command and control of all of Defence’s space capabilities, including [the] UK Space Operations Centre, Skynet (satellite) communications, RAF Fylingdales, and other enabling capabilities.\"\nThe command was initially planned to grow to about 650 personnel.\nDefence Command Paper and Space Strategy\nIn a March 2021 Defence Command Paper it was announced that part of the additional £1.4 billion allocated to support UK Space Command over the next decade would be used to develop a new Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) satellite capability, following on from the Carbonite-2 technology demonstrator launched in 2018.\nHistory\nOn 22 April 2021 it was announced that Air Commodore Mark Flewin was to become Head Operations, Plans & Training, United Kingdom Space Command, Royal Air Force High Wycombe in May 2021.\nAs of 2021 Commodore David C. Moody (Engineering Branch, RN) was posted in as Head of Space Capability for UK Space Command.\nIn February 2022, the first part of the Defence Space Strategy was published, which included the already announced extra investment of £1.4 billion over 10 years mostly for the development of the multi-satellite surveillance and intelligence ISTARI system. The strategy announced that the UK would adopt an \"international by design\" approach, and is the first state to publicly join the U.S. led Operation Olympic Defender, enabling international sharing of space resources and the synchronisation of space efforts. The UK will strengthen relations with the Five Eyes intelligence partnership.\nOperational concept demonstrator satellites for the ISTARI system, with electro-optical sensors and onboard processing, are planned for launch in 2024, under project MINERVA, and operated in conjunction with the Defence Intelligence Fusion Centre. The first satellite, named Tyche, launched on 16 August 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon 9.\nIn February 2025, a £127 million contract was awarded to Airbus to design and build two synthetic-aperture radar (SAR)  satellites named the Oberon system, building on the capabilities of Tyche development satellite. These will form part of the MOD space-based ISTARI system which will deliver a constellation of satellites and ground systems by 2031.\nStructure\nThe structure of UK Space Command comprises:\n* Headquarters, UK Space Command (RAF High Wycombe)\n** UK Space Operations Centre\n*** 1 Space Operations Squadron\n*** 2 Space Warning Squadron (RAF Fylingdales)\n** UK Space Academy (Defence Academy, Shrivenham)\nList of commanders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2|Commander\n!colspan=3|Term\n!rowspan=2|\n|-\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Term length\n| ref               =\n}}\n| ref               =\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n*\n* British space programme\n* Defence Intelligence Fusion Centre\n* Structure of the Royal Air Force\n* RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire (1001 Signals Unit RAF), satellite communications site where Skynet was directed from until commercialisation in 2003\nReferences\n* [https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/uk-stands-up-space-command UK stands-up Space Command] - initial Jane's story"
