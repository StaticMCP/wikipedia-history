One day as he was approaching the gates of the city of Amiens, he met a scantily clad beggar and impulsively cut his military cloak in half to share with the man. That night, Martin dreamed of Jesus wearing the half-cloak he had given away and he heard Jesus say to the angels: “Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed me with this robe.” ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060909225230/http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#tp Sulpicius, ch 2]). In another version, when Martin woke, he found his cloak restored to wholeness. The dream confirmed Martin in his piety, and he was baptized at the age of 18.\nThe part of the cloak he kept became a famous relic preserved in the oratory of the Merovingian kings of the Franks at the Marmoutier Abbey near Tours. During the Middle Ages, the supposed relic of St. Martin's miraculous cloak (cappa Sancti Martini) was carried by the king even into battle, and used as a holy relic upon which oaths were sworn. The cloak is first attested to in the royal treasury in 679, when it was conserved at the palatium of Luzarches, a royal villa that was later ceded to the monks of Saint-Denis by Charlemagne, in 798/99. During the Middle Ages, the relic of St. Martin's miraculous cloak, (cappa Sancti Martini) was carried by kings into battle and utilized in the swearing of oaths.\nThe priest who cared for the cloak in its reliquary was called a cappellanu, and ultimately all priests who served the military were called cappellani. The French translation is chapelains, from which the English word chaplain is derived. A similar linguistic development took place for the term, referring to the small temporary churches built for the relic. People called them a \"capella\", the word for a little cloak. Eventually, such small churches lost their association with the cloak, and all small churches began to be referred to as \"chapels\".\nEligibility\nThe Order of Martin of Tours has two levels:\n:#The Honorable Order of Martin of Tours is awarded to those chaplains and Religious Affairs Specialists who have demonstrated the highest standards of integrity and moral character, displayed an outstanding degree of professional competence, selflessly served Soldiers and Families, and contributed to the promotion of the Army Chaplaincy. The Honorable Order of Martin of Tours may be conferred upon any currently serving or retired Chaplain or Religious Affairs Specialist from all components who meet these standards in the active support of Army Chaplaincy programs or missions during the previous calendar year. This award is only bestowed on an individual once.\n:#The Ancient Order of Martin of Tours is reserved for Chaplains and Religious Affairs Specialists who achieve long-term, exceptional service to the Army Chaplaincy, surpassing even Honorable Order of Martin of Tours recipients. Such exceptional service must include extraordinary achievements and recognized service of Chaplains and Religious Affairs Specialists who promote the objectives and purposes of the Chaplain Corps. The Ancient Order of Martin of Tours may be conferred upon any currently serving or retired Chaplain or Religious Affairs Specialist from all components who meet these standards in the past 10 years who have demonstrated exceptional religious support leadership.\nThe Four Chaplains Medal\nThe Four Chaplains Medal, not to be confused with the Four Chaplains' Medal, a Commemorative decoration awarded posthumously to the medal's namesake, is a regimental award for excellence in service for an achievement or a shorter duration than both levels of the Order of Martin of Tours.\nHistory\nThe award is named for The Four Chaplains, also referred to as the \"Immortal Chaplains\" or the \"Dorchester Chaplains\", who died rescuing civilian and military personnel as the troopship  sank on February 3, 1943. The Four Chaplains each helped other Soldiers board lifeboats and gave up their own life jackets when the supply ran out. The chaplains gathered on deck, joined arms, said prayers, and sang hymns as the ship went down.\nThe Four Chaplains Medal recognizes exceptional impact made by Army chaplains of all components (active, guard, and reserve) who best exemplify exceptional courage, personal sacrifice, teamwork, religious calling, and the Army Values in dealing with Soldiers, Commanders, Families, and the Army.\nEligibility\nThe character and meaning of The Four Chaplains award is exemplified in the professional and religious commitment of Chaplains’ Alexander Goode, George Fox, Clark Poling, and John Washington. Placing the welfare of soldiers above their own, with common sacrificed, they gave their life jackets to soldiers and continue to minister until the ship sank beneath the waves. Accordingly, only ministry actions taken and selfless support rendered on behalf of Soldiers and Families that greatly impact the local or extended Army community are taken into consideration.\nThe award is given for collegial selfless behavior while rendering religious support to the military community regardless of faith or race in keeping with the spirit of the sacrifice of the Four Chaplains.\nSSG Christopher Stout Medal\n|image2=\n|caption2=SSG Christopher Stout (KIA July 13, 2010)\n|higher= The Order of Martin of Tours\n}}\nStaff Sergeant Christopher Stout was the first Religious Affairs Specialist Killed in Action since the Vietnam War. A military professional of the highest caliber, SSG Stout was known by others as a brother and a shield of armor.

In addition, nominees must demonstrate initiatives that greatly enhance religious support capabilities.\nOrder of Martha Washington Award\nHistory\nThe character and meaning of the Order of Martha Washington Award'' is exemplified in her actions as general George Washington's spouse during the Revolutionary War. When general Washington took command of the Continental Army, Martha Washington was suddenly responsible for child-rearing, guest hospitality, and supervision of the family estate. In addition to her estate responsibilities, she became a critical support for her husband when he was in camp by volunteering to manage the food and social events of his headquarters and serving as his sounding board and closest confidant. Martha Washington also became her husband's secretary and representative at official functions. Finally, Martha nursed sick Soldiers in camp and acted as a liaison between General Washington and other officials.
