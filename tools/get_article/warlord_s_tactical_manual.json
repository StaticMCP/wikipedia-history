Baylis comments that \"In all, this offers nothing to interest players who are not familiar with the Planescape setting, and for owners of Blood Wars'' its only redeeming factors are the hints on deck building, the tournament rules and the clarification of some of the original obscurities. And even these are probably not enough to justify the steep asking price.\"\nReferences"
