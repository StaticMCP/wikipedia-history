More than 100 veterinary nurses work alongside students, residents, interns, and specialty surgeons.\nIn 2008 the Royal Veterinary College completed the third phase of development of the QMHA.  This development supports the continued expansion of both secondary and tertiary medical and surgical services for small animals, built around support services such as Emergency and Critical Care, Anaesthesia and Diagnostic Imaging.  It first opened in 1986.\nThere is also a strategic focus on the development of first opinion small animal services at the Beaumont Animals’ Hospital, serving the Kings Cross, London area.\nReferences"
