As a result of this, on May 12 a tremendous disorder was carried out that attested to the disagreement that still existed among the population, since while some shouted through the streets the return of Iturbide others supported the republic . Such a movement caused the political chief to send some troops to the mutineers, causing bloodshed. Following these events, the Provincial Council decreed:\nRebellion\nTo all the pronouncements, the Executive Power and the Congress called for the formation of a new Congress that with wider powers constituted the nation under the system of indirect election, assigning a deputy to every 50 000 inhabitants or to the fractions that passed 40 000. With this measure most of the provinces returned to calm, however, Guadalajara was preparing to resist, being necessary the use of military force to reduce the uprising. An expedition commanded by General Nicolás Bravo was arranged and as second to Pedro Celestino Negrete .\nConsequences\nThe expedition was a success, taking General Negrete Colima and getting the entire district back to order, becoming from that moment as the territory of the nation . Bravo, meanwhile, arranged things satisfactorily and returned to Guanajuato in case the circumstances required him to take another point in the country.\nReferences\n* RIVA PALACIO, Vicente (1940).
