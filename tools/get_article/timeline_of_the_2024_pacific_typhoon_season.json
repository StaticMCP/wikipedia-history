Most of the tropical cyclones form between May and November. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator between 100°E and the International Date Line. Tropical storms that form in the entire Western Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency . Tropical depressions that form in this basin are given a number with a \"W\" suffix by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center . In addition, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration  assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that enter or form in the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). These names, however, are not in common use outside of the Philippines.\nDuring the season, as of December 27, 39 systems so far were designated as tropical depressions by either the JMA, PAGASA, JTWC, or other National Meteorological and Hydrological Services such as the China Meteorological Administration  and the Hong Kong Observatory . As they run the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre  for the Western Pacific, the JMA assigns names to tropical depressions should they intensify into a tropical storm. As of December 27, 26 of these tropical depressions became named storms and 13 of these named storms intensified to typhoons. PAGASA also assigns local names to tropical depressions should they form within or enter their area of responsibility; however, these names are not commonly used outside of PAGASA's area of responsibility.\nTimeline\nImageSize  = width:1050 height:295\nPlotArea   = top:10 bottom:80 right:25 left:20\nLegend     = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars  = early\nDateFormat =
