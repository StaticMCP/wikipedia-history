Hence, there is no award for 2011).\nThe awards were apparently discontinued after 2019, though no formal announcement appears to have been made.\n2019\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|Claire Breay (head of Ancient, Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts at the British Library)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|Our Boys: The Story of a Paratrooper by Helen Parr (Allen Lane)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Undergraduate Dissertation Prize\n| Ella Sbaraini (Clare College, Cambridge) for ''Rethinking Middle-Aged Women's Sexuality in England, 1700-1815\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n2018\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|In Our Time (radio documentary series)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|Edmund Burke & the Invention of Modern Convervatism, 1830-1914 by Emily Jones (Oxford University Press)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Undergraduate Dissertation Prize\n| Abigail Greenall (University of Manchester) for Magical Materials and Emotion in the Early Modern East Anglian Household\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n2017\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|David Olusoga (historian and broadcaster)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|Æthelred the Unready'' by Levi Roach (Yale University Press)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Historical Picture Researcher of the Year\n|Pauline Hubner (for Huw Lewis-Jones and Kari Kerbert's Sketchbooks: The Art of Discovery and Adventure)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Undergraduate Dissertation Prize\n|Emma Marshall (University of Durham) for ''Women's Domestic Medical Practice: Recipe Writing and Knowledge Networks in 17th Century England\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n2016\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|David Cesarani (historian of the Holocaust; posthumous award)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|If This Is a Woman—Inside Ravensbruck: Hitler's Concentration Camp for Women'' by Sarah Helm (Little Brown)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Historical Picture Researcher of the Year\n|Maria Ranuro (for Alexandra Harris's Weatherland: Writers and Artists Under English Skies)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n2015\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|London Calling: the BBC World Service and the Cold War by Alban Webb (Bloomsbury)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Historical Picture Researcher of the Year\n|Laura Canter (for the Folio Society's edition of Paul Fussell's The Great War and Modern Memory)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Digital History Award\n|Eleanor Parker (for her website \"A Clerk of Oxford\")\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Undergraduate Dissertation Prize\n|Rebecca Pyne-Edwards Banks (University of Derby) for Cutting Through the Gordian Knot: The British Military Service Tribunals During the Great War\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n2014\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|Norman Davies (Professor Emeritus, University College London)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|Empire of Secrets: British Intelligence, the Cold War and the Twilight of Empire by Calder Walton (Harper Press)\n|\n|\n|-\n|Historical Picture Researcher of the Year\n|Cathie Arrington (for the Folio Society's edition of Galileo Galilei's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems)\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Digital History Award\n|Historypin\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Undergraduate Dissertation Prize\n|Anna Field (Cardiff University) for Masculinity and Myth: the Highway-woman in Early Modern England\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n2013\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Prize\n!Winner\n!Runner-up\n!Highly commended\n|-\n|The Trustees Award\n|Pevsner Architectural Guides, published by Yale University Press.\n|\n|\n|-\n|Book of the Year Award\n|Memories of Empire.
