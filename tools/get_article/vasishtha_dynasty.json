Their territory included parts of the present-day northern Andhra Pradesh. They were one of the three minor dynasties that emerged after the decline of the Gupta power in the area, the other two being the Matharas and the Pitrbhaktas.\nGenealogy\nThe Vasishtha king Anantavarman is known from his Siripuram and Srungavarapukota copper-plate inscriptions. These epigraphs describe him as a son of Maharaja Prabhanjanavarman, and a grandson of Maharaja Gunavarman.\nThus, three rulers of the dynasty are known:\n* Maharaja Gunavarman\n* Maharaja Prabhanjanavarman\n* Parameshvara Anantavarman\nTerritory\nThe Siripuram and Srungavarapukota inscriptions of Anantavarman were issued from Devapura and Pishtapura respectively. In Siripuram inscription, his grandfather Gunavarman is described as the lord of Devapura. The city was presumably the capital of a region called Devarashtra (within Kalinga), which Anantavarman inherited from his ancestors. Devarashtra is identified as the present-day Yelamanchili taluka.\nAccording to the Allahabad Pillar inscription, the Gupta emperor Samudragupta defeated the kings of Devarashtra and Pishtapura during his southern invasion. It appears that Gunavarman became a sovereign of Devarashtra after the decline of the Gupta rule in the region.\nReligion\nUnlike the Vaishnavite Matharas, Anantavarman was a Shaivite. His inscriptions describe him as parama-maheshvara (devotee of Shiva).\nInscriptions\nThe following copper-plate inscriptions of the Vasishtha kings are known:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Find spot !!
