The exhibits came from Portugal itself (Braga, Chaves, Leixões, Matosinhos and Porto),  Angola, Cape Verde,  Guinea (Guinea-Bissau), India, Macao  (including a reproduction of the Guia lighthouse), Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Timor (Portuguese Timor).\nThere were reproductions of villages from different colonies and of the Padrões of Dighton and Yellala, along with a zoo, restaurants a theatre, a cinema which showed 'The Dawn Patrol and an amusement park. The Macao pavilion included a teahouse and Chinese musicians while India was represented by a Hindu temple.\nIndigenous presence\nAs similar to other colonial exhibitions in Europe, native people from the colonies were present at the exhibition as features of the exhibits and as sources of anthropological study. Reports say that 324 native people were at the colonial exhibition but only 185 were officially given assistance. The indigenous people present were also the subjects of portraits such as those by the artist Eduardo Malta which were put to use as picture postcards. Photography taken by Fotografia Alvão also involved the natives present at the exhibition. While the indigenous people of the colonies were referred to as Portuguese citizens, they were also treated as being of the classification \"indigenous\" and were viewed as curiosities from the colonies.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/EFEMERIDES/ExposicaoColonial/Portugalnaoeumpaispequeno.jpg 'Portugal is Not a Small Country' map used to show how big Portuguese colonies were]"
