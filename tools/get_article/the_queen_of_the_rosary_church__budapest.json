It was located next to the Dominican chapel, previously built in 1905, and it was dedicated on October 3, 1915 by Archbishop János Csernoch of Esztergom. Until 1951, Dominican monastic priests, and between 1951 and 1989, diocesan (non-religious) priests served in the church. Between 1989 and 2007, the church was once again served by the Dominican Order, and from 2007, for the second time, it was served by diocesan priests.\nIn a 1997 fire, the building and its equipment were severely damaged. The interior renovation started in 2008, and in 2012 the repair of stained glass windows began.\nGallery\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom3.jpg|\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom Budapest Thököly út13.jpg|\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom Budapest Thököly út19.jpg|\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom Budapest Thököly út6.jpg|\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom Budapest Thököly út8.jpg|\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom Budapest Thököly út7.jpg|\nFile:Rózsafüzér Királynéja-templom Budapest Thököly út4.jpg|\nFile:Budapešť 1266.jpg|\nSources\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20190126164356/http://www.rozsafuzerkiralyneja.hu/index.php/templomunk-toertenete"
