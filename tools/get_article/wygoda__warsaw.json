In the 16th century, Kawęczyn had an area of around 117 hectares (1.17&nbsp;km or 0.45 square miles).\nBetween 28 and 30 July 1656, the area was partially the location of the Battle of Warsaw, fought by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Crimean Khanate against the Swedish Empire and Brandenburg-Prussia, during the Second Northern War.\nIn 1796, Kawęczyn and the surrounding area, became the government property, and were integrated into the economic sphere of influence of the nearby city of Warsaw.\nIn 1811, Kawęczyn was inhabited by 8 cotters (peasant farmers), and had 16 houses. In the village was also located a tavern named Wygoda, located near the Brześć Road. Eventually, around the tavern had developed a settlement named Wygoda, which was community based around farming and serving the travelers. In 1827, Wygoda had a population of 42. In the village were located 5 houses.\nDuring the November Uprising, the area was partial location of the major battles of the conflict: First Battle of Wawer fought between 19 and 20 February 1831, and Battle of Olszynka Grochowska on 25 February 1831.\nIn 1877, Wygoda had 77 inhabitants, and 5 houses.\nOn 15 May 1951, Wygoda was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nReferences"
