Written and directed by J. Gordon Edwards, it starred Betty Blythe as the Queen and Fritz Leiber Sr. as King Solomon. The film is well known amongst silent film buffs for the risqué costumes worn by Blythe, as evidenced by several surviving stills taken during the production. Only a short fragment of the film survives.\nPlot\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was originally intended for Theda Bara. However Bara chose not to renew her contract and, after making the ill-fated Kathleen Mavourneen (1919), she all but retired from filmmaking. While making Mavourneen, construction began on sets for The Queen of Sheba. Not wanting it to go to waste, William Fox chose to put Betty Blythe in the role. The film became a hit but Blythe never matched its success with her later films.\nThe highlight of the film were the chariot races. The hippodrome set for the chariot race was constructed on the north end of the Fox Hollywood studio lot. It was a 1,250 by 3,100 ft ellipse. Western star Tom Mix staged and directed the all-female chariot race between the Queen of Sheba and Princess Vashti using 10 chariots, 40 horses, and a cast of 3,500. Mix convinced actresses Blythe and Nell Craig to take the reins and drive their chariots, and in the first of the races Mix drove one himself while wearing Roman robes.\nThe risqué costumes of Blythe made by Margaret Whistler (1888 - 1939), a former character actress who shifted to working in the wardrobe department, included see-through gossamer robes and one costume essentially consisting of strands of pearls. The topless scenes filmed for this movie were seen only in the European release versions.\nand Betty Blythe in The Queen of Sheba]]\nReception\nAlthough the film received good reviews, its premiere run disappointed Fox, and its road show was cancelled. In December 1921, Fox announced that the film could be booked by regular exhibitors in the next season. Regardless, on a budget of $479,000 The Queen of Sheba still grossed $1,121,000 in worldwide rentals.\nPreservation\nThe film is presumed lost. A 1937 New Jersey vault fire destroyed most of the Fox silent film negatives and prints, and it is unlikely a copy of The Queen of Sheba still exists. However, in May 2011, a 17-second fragment was found, and initially mistakenly identified as from Cleopatra (1917), though comparison with stills from the movie have since led to it being identified correctly.\nSee also\n*List of incomplete or partially lost films\n*List of lost films\n*Nudity in film\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://archive.org/details/Cleopatra1917 17 second fragment] from the film at the Internet Archive\n* of Fox Film fire facility in Little Ferry, New Jersey, in which the camera negative and last prints of The Queen of Sheba most likely perished\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/greenman2008/4802216882/ Foreign release lobby poster]"
