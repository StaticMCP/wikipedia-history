The Ryn castle was besieged and captured by the peasants, who killed most of its defenders. In response, the knights sent to Ryn a detachment from Olsztyn (Allenstein) and Barczewo (Wartenburg in Ostpreussen). Teutonic forces took their revenge on the peasants, destroying them in a battle on January 30, 1456. App. 500 peasants were killed, and 19 were captured.\nReferences"
