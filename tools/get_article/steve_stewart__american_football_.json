Stewart was May 1, 1956, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he attended Richfield High School. After high school, he attended the University of Minnesota where he played for their football team. During the 1977 season with Minnesota, he was named the team's most valuable defensive player.\nHe was selected by the Atlanta Falcons in the second round of the 1978 NFL draft and played 12 games that season as a linebacker with the team. Stewart noted his challenges with going from Minnesota's colder climate to the hotter climate in Atlanta. He was cut just prior to the 1979 NFL season and was subsequently signed by the Green Bay Packers. He played three games that season with the Packers. He was released early in the season to make room for Earl Edwards, who was signed.\nReferences"
