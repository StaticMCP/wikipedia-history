His reputation as a military leader was so formidable that he was nicknamed \"the devil Warwick\" by the French.\nIn 1348 he became one of the founders and the third Knight of the Order of the Garter.\nThomas was undoubtedly a brave warrior in battle and proved to be a strong military leader. For example, the 14th-century Anonimalle Chronicle states that when news arrived of his landing at Calais, the Duke of Burgundy, whose forces were camped nearby, made a hasty retreat under cover of darkness to avoid an encounter with \"the devil Warwick\".\nHe fought in Scotland as captain of the army against the Scots in 1337 at the age of 24. He also fought in the Hundred Years' Wars with France, commanding the English victory at the Battle of Crécy in 1346.\nEarly life\n, Norfolk. He displays the arms of Beauchamp on his tunic.]]\nThomas de Beauchamp was born at Warwick Castle, Warwickshire, England to Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick and Alice de Toeni. He served in Scotland frequently during the 1330s, being captain of the army against the Scots in 1337. He was hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire from 1333 until his death (in 1369). In 1344, he was also made High Sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire for life.\nVictor at Crécy and Poitiers\nWarwick was Marshal of England from 1343/4 until 1369, and was one of the commanders at the great English victories at Crécy and Poitiers, as well as the Siege of Calais in 1346.\nThomas de Beauchamp fought in all the French wars of King Edward III; he commanded the centre at the Battle of Crécy (where many of his relatives were killed, including his younger half-brother Alan la Zouche de Mortimer). He was trusted to be guardian of the sixteen-year-old Black Prince.\nHe began the rebuilding of the Collegiate Church of Saint Mary in Warwick, supposedly using money received from the ransom of the archbishop of Sens, whom he captured at Poitiers, but that is an oversimplification.\nMarriage and children\nHe married Katherine Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. They had six sons and ten daughters:\n* Guy de Beauchamp (died 28 April 1360); married Philippa de Ferrers, daughter of Henry de Ferrers, 2nd Lord Ferrers of Groby, and Isabel de Verdun, by whom he had two daughters: Elizabeth (died c. 1369), and Katherine, who became a nun.

Beauchamp died three months later at Calais aged 56, on 13 November 1369, of the Black Death and was buried alongside his wife in the chancel of St. Mary's Church, Warwick, Warwickshire.\nAncestry\nImages\nReferences\nSources\n*"
