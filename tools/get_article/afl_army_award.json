Examples of such bravery that are not usually rewarded include, a chase-and-tackle, executing a solid bump, shepherd or spoil despite facing potential heavy contact, a difficult assist on a goal, taking a mark whilst running back with the flight of the ball, and so forth.\nSelection process\nThree nominees were selected by a panel and put up for a public vote after each of the 22 regular season rounds. Each of the weekly winners were then considered by the panel (AFL All-Australian Selection Committee) to produce a selection shortlist for the general public to vote on. The winner of the vote needed the endorsement of the selection panel. The process was similar to the system of deciding the Goal of the Year and Mark of the Year awards.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!
