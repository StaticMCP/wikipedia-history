After President Gerald Ford signed this legislation into law, citizens living abroad were permitted to cast an absentee ballot in their state of residence. Shortly after ratification, former Republican National Committee Chairman, Bill Brock, and former chairman of UK Republicans, Richard Beeman, established Republicans Abroad in 1978 to organize the estimated 3 million American overseas constituents, the majority of which were Republican.\nRepublicans Abroad hosted a weekly radio-show via [http://wsradio.com/ wsRadio] titled Republicans Abroad Radio. The show aired live weekly for several years. Guests to the show included President Ronald Reagan's Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Grover Norquist, and members of Congress.\nIn January 2013, Republicans Abroad International closed, leaving its chapters to continue forward as independent organizations. When the international entity was dissolved, most chapters migrated to Republicans Overseas, while a few of its former chapters endured as independently operated organizations throughout the world, continuing a role in coordinating American voters living overseas; advocating the Republican platform and principles; engaging with media; and hosting local events.\nSee also\n*Republicans Overseas\n*Democrats Abroad\nReferences"
