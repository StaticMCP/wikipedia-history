The event took place on November 1 and November 2, 2008 in Burbank, California.\nThe tournament concluded with a final match in which Low Ki defeated the PWG World Champion Chris Hero. Aside from the tournament matches, the tournament featured a three-way nine-man tag team match, in which the losers of the first round of the tournament competed. The event marked the PWG debut of Kenny Omega.\nBackground\nThe 2008 Battle of Los Angeles tournament was set to follow the 24-man format of the previous two editions of the tournament and take place on the weekend of August 30 and 31, but PWG management was unable to book the talent they wished to for the event and decided to move the event and drop the entrants down to 16. However, the field was included to add one more participant, making it a total of seventeen participants as the two PWG commissioners Excalibur and Dino Winwood couldn't come to a conclusion on who would be the final entrant. The participants were announced as: 2006 winner Davey Richards, Chuck Taylor, Masato Yoshino, El Generico, Kenny Omega, Brandon Bonham, Austin Aries, the World Champion Chris Hero, Necro Butcher, Scott Lost, the World Tag Team Champion Nick Jackson, Roderick Strong, Nigel McGuinness, Joey Ryan, T.J.

After getting out of a Hangman's Clutch by Hero, Ki countered a running elbow smash by Hero by dropkicking him and then applied a Dragon Clutch on Hero to make him submit to the hold to win the 2008 Battle of Los Angeles tournament.\nReception\nBob Colling of 411Mania rated the first night 7.3, considering it a \"solid night one of the tournament\" with five of the matches having \"some kind of entertainment attached to them\". He considered the second night \"a better night than night one\" and praised the semi-final match between Chris Hero and Bryan Danielson as \"a nicely done match\". The tournament final between Chris Hero and Low Ki on the night two received praise from critics, with the Southern California-based wrestling website SoCal Uncensored awarding it the 2008 Southern California Match of the Year Award.\nAftermath\nAfter winning the Battle of Los Angeles, Low Ki signed a developmental contract with WWE and his contract prevented him from competing for PWG, therefore he could not appear at PWG and was unable to challenge for the PWG World Championship, a title shot guaranteed for the Battle of Los Angeles winner. Ki returned to PWG two years later at Kurt RussellReunion II: The Reunioning in 2011 and finally received a title shot against Claudio Castagnoli at All Star Weekend 8'', where he failed to win.\nResults\nTournament brackets\n* = This match was a three-way dance\n† = This was a No Disqualification match\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com Pro Wrestling Guerrilla official website]"
