      "text": "# King Huanhui of Han\n\nKing Huanhui of Han (; died 239 BC), personal name unknown, was a monarch of the Han state. He was the son of King Xi, whom he succeeded in 272 BC. During King Huanhui's reign, Han Fei submitted numerous proposals to enact Legalism. In 246 BC, King Huanhui sent Zheng Guo west to the Qin state to construct a canal with the intention of wasting Qin's resources. The canal came to be known as the Zheng Guo Canal.\nIn 262 BC, Qin sent Bai Qi to invade Han and took Yewang. To broker peace, King Huanhui ceded Shangdang Commandery to Qin. The people of Shangdang refused to be ruled by Qin but also lacked the military strength for defense. Shangdang's governor-general Feng Ting (馮亭) surrendered instead to the Zhao state. Zhao accepted the surrender and sent Lian Po to defend Changping; the Battle of Changping ensued.\nKing Huanhui died in 239 BC and was succeeded by his son, Han An.\nAncestors\nReferences\n*Shiji Chapter 45\n*Zizhi Tongjian Volume 4, 5, 6"
