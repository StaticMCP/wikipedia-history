      "text": "# Emperor Francis cherry\n\nThe Emperor Francis cherry is a sweet cherry cultivar (Prunus avium) that produces a bright red fruit which is resistant to cracking. In 1996, it was the source of the first cherry genetic map, which was created from a haploid-microspore derived population from the 'Emperor Francis' cultivar. It is also one of the sources of the 'Newfane' sweet cherry, which was created by crossing the 'Emperor Francis' with the 'Stella' cherry.\nIt can be cross-pollinated with 'Montmorency' cherry.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070427213235/http://www.uga.edu/fruit/cherry.html All about cherries]"
