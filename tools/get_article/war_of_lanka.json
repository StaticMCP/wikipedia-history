This installment continues the epic retelling of the Ramayana, focusing on the climactic battle between Ram and Raavan. The book was released on 3 October 2022 and published by HarperCollins India.\nPlot\nThe narrative begins with the abduction of Sita by Raavan, which triggers a monumental conflict. Sita, embodying defiance and courage, challenges Raavan to kill her rather than allow Ram to surrender. Ram, consumed by grief and rage, channels these emotions into a calm and focused preparation for war. His meticulous strategy is driven by a profound sense of duty (dharma) and the determination to rescue his beloved wife. The book intricately details the preparations for the war, highlighting the formation of battalions, the innovative use of the Elephant Corps, and the strategic challenges of crossing the seas to Lanka. Raavan, initially confident in his invincibility, underestimates Ram's resolve. The author presents Raavan as a multifaceted character motivated by ego, grief, and love, offering a sympathetic view of his tragic backstory and adherence to certain codes of honor. The book stands out for its vivid portrayal of characters as ordinary humans with exemplary skills and flaws, rather than the larger-than-life figures of traditional lore. Ram is depicted as a noble man, deeply affected by Sita's abduction, and striving to uphold his ideals in the battle for dharma. The narrative balances action with philosophical content, exploring the theme of dharma through dialogues and dream sequences featuring sages like Vishwamitra and Vashishta.\nCritical response\nReeta Ramamurthy Gupta's gave 3.5/5 in her review in Forbesindia.com, saying “the book has a bit of everything. It's a re-imagination of an epic with several management lessons”.\nSee also\n* Asura: Tale of the Vanquished\n* The Palace of Illusions\n* The Liberation of Sita\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61846327-war-of-lanka War of Lanks] at Goodreads"
