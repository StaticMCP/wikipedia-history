The juniper was planted within the Liang imperial palace compound. The palace was later destroyed by war but the tree has survived to the present day. The first Imperial Academy of the Ming was later built on the palace's former grounds during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, who used Yingtian (now Nanjing) as his main capital. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Sanjiang Normal College was given the site, eventually developing into Southeast University and Nanjing University in Nanjing and the National Central University in Taoyuan City on Taiwan.\nFile:Dongnan Daxue Liuchao Song (Nanjing, 1923).jpg | Tree in 1923\nFile:Liuchao Song (Nanjing).jpg | Tree in the 1930s\nFile:LiuChaoSong stone.jpg | 1981 stone marker\nImage:LiuChaoSong carving.jpg | Detail of the engraving\nSee also\n* Southeast University\nReferences"
