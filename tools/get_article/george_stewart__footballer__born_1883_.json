He made over 100 league appearances for City, experiencing a relegation in 1909 followed by promotion as winners of the 1909–10 Football League Second Division, before ending his career with short spells at Partick Thistle, Stalybridge Celtic and Merthyr Town, settling in the Manchester area.\nInternational career\nWhile playing for Hibs at club level Stewart made his Scotland debut in a 2–0 defeat by Wales at Tynecastle in the 1906 British Home Championship, and then also played in the 2–1 victory against England in the same tournament. He won two further international caps during his time with Manchester City.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120220082506/http://www.hibshistoricaltrust.org.uk/HHT/Gallery/gallery2.html Stewart's first international cap], Hibernian Historical Trust"
