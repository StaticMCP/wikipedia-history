First aired on 29 June 2020 on RTÉ One, it reached an audience of over 755,000 after Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the programme was a \"stark reminder\" of COVID-19 as the country began to reopen after the lockdown. The second and final episode aired on 30 June 2020.\nThe RTÉ Investigates team spent 30 days filming inside the hospital in May and June 2020 with the co-operation of staff and patients. Before filming began, the team had to undergo hazard training provided by health and safety experts in the United Kingdom. RTÉ delivered Personal Protective Equipment to the hospital to cover the equipment used by the team during the filming.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| RTS Ireland Television Awards\n| 31 March 2021\n| News and Current Affairs Award\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.rte.ie/player/series/rt%C3%A9-investigates-inside-ireland-s-covid-battle/SI0000007047?epguid=IH000391686 ''RTÉ Investigates: Inside Ireland's Covid Battle''] on RTÉ Player"
