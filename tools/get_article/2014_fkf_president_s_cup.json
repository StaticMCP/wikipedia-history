Explaining why they could not face Bandari in their third round clash, head coach Sammy Okoth said that the team had lost eight players during the mid-season (June–July) transfer window, and as such the squad was depleted and not yet ready to take on such an intense match.\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n| goals2 = Makori\n| penaltyscore = 0 – 3\n| penalties1 = Mathenge Kulecho Katekera\n| penalties2 =  Mukaisi Juma Sande\n| stadium = Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\nSaruni Amuoka\n| stadium = Ruaraka Stadium, Nairobi\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n| goals2 = Odhiambo\n| stadium = Moi Stadium, Kisumu\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\nLiambo\n| stadium = Afraha Stadium, Nakuru\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\nOliech\n| goals2 = Ikatwa Ndege Omollo\n| stadium = Ruaraka Stadium, Nairobi\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n| goals2 = Shiveka\n| penaltyscore = 2 – 4\n| penalties1 = Shakava E.

Two teams from both the Premier League and the National Super League competed at this stage of the competition.\nA.F.C. Leopards vs Sofapaka abandonment\nThe match between A.F.C. Leopards and Sofapaka was abandoned in the 87th minute, moments after the latter's second goal through Ekaliana Ndolo, after fans stormed the pitch in protest of the officiating. Security personnel present at the Nairobi City Stadium where the match was taking place were forced to launch tear gas canisters onto the angry mob, while one linesman left with his head badly injured. An ambulance and a SuperSport van were also damaged after being stoned by the fans.\nBefore the match's abandonment, other incidents of crowd trouble arose from the Ingwe fans. Spectators began throwing bottles and stones deep into the first half, after Austin Ikenna was flagged offside just four minutes before Enock Agwanda's opening goal in the 26th minute, forcing a stoppage of about three minutes to restore calm in the stadium.\nThe following day, the Football Kenya Federation fined A.F.C. Leopards a sum of Ksh.500,000/= (approx. US$5,590 or £3,500&nbsp;stg.), ordered the club to pay the medical expenses for the injured fans and match officials, as well as play its remaining matches for the season behind closed doors. West Kenya Sugar, the loser of the other semi-final of the day, were also handed an automatic third-place playoff win as part of the sanctions.\nMatch results\n| goals2 = Nyaga\n| penaltyscore = 10 – 9\n| penalties1 = P.
