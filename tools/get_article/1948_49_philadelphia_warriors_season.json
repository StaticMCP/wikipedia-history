The team finished at fourth place out of six teams in the BAA East Division and was eliminated in the East Division Semifinals by the Washington Capitols in two games. The team was led by power forward Joe Fulks, who averaged a team-high 26.0 points per game and set the then-NBA record for points in a game, with 63 points versus the Indianapolis Jets on February 10, 1949.\nDraft\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"10%\"| Pick\n!
