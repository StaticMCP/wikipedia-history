In 2013, Season 2 was released on DVD in the UK.\nReception\nBill Brioux notes that King is one of many new shows premiering in April 2011 which is making April to be the \"new September\", the traditional time for premiering new series in North America. \"Spring really is the new fall on specialty channels.\" In reviewing the first episode Brioux found it \"seemed pretty seen-it-before\" but that Amy Price-Francis \"has sass and sparkle which should enliven a drama with a bit of a dark comedy tone.\" Cassandra Szklarski points out that with the \"recent explosion in Hogtown-based series\" such as Flashpoint, Rookie Blue, and The Listener the unique spin of setting a cop drama in Toronto is no longer so unique. Szklarski admits that King is another \"urban whodunit\" but that it goes about it from a distinctively female point of view. Eric Volmers of the Calgary Herald found the fallibility of the character Derek Spears to be \"what promises to give King its continued dramatic tension.\" Bill Harris of Quebecor Media found King is \"not a cookie-cutter police procedural\" in that DS King's personal life is a significant part of the show.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110424061040/http://www.showcase.ca/shows/showspage.aspx?Root_Title_Id=261044 Official website]\n*\n*[http://www.facebook.com/kingseries King on Facebook - official facebook page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120129214524/http://www.tv1.com.au/shows/king/ King on TV1 Australia]"
