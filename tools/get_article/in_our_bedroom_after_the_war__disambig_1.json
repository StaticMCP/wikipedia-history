The first single from the album is \"Take Me to the Riot\", and the second single is \"The Night Starts Here.\"\nThe album was initially released with a bonus DVD documentary of the Set Yourself on Fire tour, titled \"Are We Here Now?\"\nThe album was a nominee for the 2008 Polaris Music Prize.\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708213332/http://www.culturopoing.com/Musique/Stars+In+our+bedrooms+after+the+war+-226 French review of \"In our bedroom after the war\" by the webzine Culturopoing]\n* [https://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/207679 \"Stars performer\"], Toronto Star, April 28, 2007"
