In 2016, Wares released a 7-inch single, entitled \"Missed the Point\" on Sweety Pie Records. \"Beach Date,\" the b-side to the single, was nominated for an Edmonton Music Award in 2017 under the category Indie Rock Recording of the Year. In 2017, Wares released their first full-length album, which was self-titled. Wares' debut album brought more attention to the project and BeatRoute praised Hardy's musicianship, noting that her \"punk attitude meets skillful composition\" on the album.
