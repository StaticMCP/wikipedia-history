It is given to an actress who portrayed a drama series or variety show character that is deemed the most popular among the television audience.\nThe Favourite Female Show Stealer award has been presented nine times, to four actresses. The first winner was Jeanette Aw for her role in Together (2009). The most recent winner is Jesseca Liu for Soul Detective (2022). The record for most wins is four, held by Aw, followed by Rui En winning three. The record for most nominations is eight, held by Rui En.\nHistory\nThe Star Awards for Favourite Female Character was first introduced in 2010, at the 16th Star Awards ceremony where the award was first given out to Jeanette Aw for her role in Together.\nPrior to 2012, the nominees were determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp. The rule was removed in 2012 to allow the public to determine the nominees entirely via online voting. Winners are also selected by a majority vote from the public via online voting as well.\nThe award was discontinued from 2017, along with the Favourite Male Character and Favourite Onscreen Couple (Drama) awards. In 2022, the award was revived but was renamed as Favourite Female Show Stealer. The award was discontinued in 2024\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Actress\n!
