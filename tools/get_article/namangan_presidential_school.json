It is one of the first schools founded by the country's president under the Agency for Presidential Educational Institutions. Presidential School is a co-ed, public, residential school enrolling 168 students in grades 5 through 11. Established in December 2019, it graduated its first senior class in the summer of 2021. The school is currently a member of the Council of International Schools (CIS). Additionally, the school received a Cambridge accreditation and this allows Presidential School in Namangan to conduct official Cambridge examinations. Admission is based on merit only, and the school covers each student's full cost of attendance. Only residents of the Namangan region are eligible to apply.\nAdmissions\nAnnually, the institution accepts students for grade 5 only. However, when the school\nwas newly established, it admitted students in grades 5–10 to fill the student body. To\nbe eligible to apply, an applicant must have an excellent record in math and natural\nscience subjects at school. Admission consists of three stages. The first stage is an\nonline submission of documents. Once the online application is approved, candidates\nreceive an admission ticket for the second stage, in which students solve the 30-item\ntest on mathematics. The top 480 students in the second stage are qualified for the\nfinal stage. The final stage consists of three sections, and the sum of all these sections\nadds up to 100%: Critical Thinking (32%), Problem Solving (48%) and English (20%).\nOnly 24 students are admitted from the final stage. In the 2022–2023 academic year,\n3282 students applied, making the acceptance rate as low as 0.7%. Cambridge\nAssessment International Education provides exam materials and fully supervises the\nexamination process.\nEnrollment\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!36 teachers\n!168 students\n!59 staff\n|-\n|12 class size\n|0.7% acceptance rate\n|5:1 student-teacher ratio\n|}\nCurriculum\nThe academic program combines the Uzbek national curriculum and the CAIE curriculum. Grade 8 and 9 students take five compulsory IGCSE subjects\n(Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Computer Science). Upon completing\nIGCSE exams, prospective grade 10 students chose two AS & A Level subjects out of\nfour available (Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Computer Science) to cover them in the\nupcoming two academic years. Additionally, AS & A Level Mathematics is compulsory\nfor all students. For the 2022–2023 academic year, the school started offering AS\nBusiness classes for grade 9 and 10 students. Also, students can start taking AS Level\nsubjects in grade 9 instead of 10. Except for grade 5 students, which have six, all\ngrades have seven periods (45-minute each) a day from Monday to Friday. Classes\nare held from 8:30 AM to 3:20 PM.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!NO.\n!SUBJECT\n!HOURS\n|-\n|1\n|Mathematics\n|192\n|-\n|2\n|Computer Science*\n|224\n|-\n|3\n|Chemistry CAIE*\n|224\n|-\n|4\n|Biology CAIE*\n|224\n|-\n|5\n|Physics CAIE*\n|224\n|-\n|6\n|Uzbek Literature\n|48\n|-\n|7\n|Native Language\n|48\n|-\n|8\n|World of History\n|32\n|-\n|9\n|History of Uzbekistan\n|64\n|-\n|10\n|Global Perspectives\n|32\n|-\n|11\n|Physical Education\n|32\n|-\n|12\n|Pre-military training\n|32\n|-\n|13\n|Russian L2\n|64\n|-\n|14\n|English EFL\n|96\n|-\n|15\n|Education\n|32\n|}\n-  Students choose 2 subjects out of 4\nExtra-curricular activities\nThe Presidential School in Namangan supports the holistic development of students.\nExtracurricular activities play an important role in student self-initiative, broadening of\nexperience and development of new talents and interests. Students choose activities\nbased on need and interest, and are expected to engage in both academic and nonacademic opportunities. The school offers extra-curricular activities such as robotics,\nprogramming, languages, sports, arts and music.\nGrading\nOur school does not calculate GPA, nor does it report class rank. The school year\nconsists of four terms. Students’ progress is monitored using formative and summative\nassessments, which comprise 60% of the term mark. End-of-term exams account for\nthe rest 40% of the term mark. Students also take end-of-year exams, which are 40%\nof their yearly grade. These examinations are held over the last two weeks of the\nacademic year. Grading is done on a 1-5 scale.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Code\n!Percentage\n!Description\n|-\n|5\n|85-100%\n|Excellent\n|-\n|4\n|75-84%\n|Good\n|-\n|3\n|60-74%\n|Satisfactory\n|-\n|2\n|45-59%\n|Unsatisfactory\n|-\n|1\n|1-44%\n|Fail\n|}\nGraduation requirements\nAt the end of the academic year, grade 10 students take the official AS Level\nexaminations, and grade 11 students take A Level examinations. CAIE officials\nsupervise GCE AS & A Level exams. Upon graduation, students receive the National\nCertificate of Secondary Education and GCE AS & A Level Diploma in 3 subjects. To\nreceive the former diploma, students must complete state examinations in Native\nLanguage and History of Uzbekistan.\nReferences"
