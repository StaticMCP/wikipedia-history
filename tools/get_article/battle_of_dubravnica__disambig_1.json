Vitomir and Crep were the regional lords, and one of their fortresses, Petrus, was in the vicinity of the battle.\nThe Battle of Dubravnica was the first historical mention of any Turkish movements into Prince Lazar's territory. The Serbian army emerged victorious, although details of the battle itself are scarce. After this battle the Turks didn't venture into Serbia until 1386, when their armies were routed near Pločnik.\n|}}\nSee also\n*Battle of Pločnik\n*Battle of Bileća\n*Battle of Kosovo\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* Marko Šuica, „Nemirno doba srpskog srednjeg veka“, Beograd, 2000.\n* „Istorija srpskog naroda II“, Beograd, 1982.\n* Ljubomir Stojanovic, \"Start srpski rodoslovi i letopisi: Zbornik za istoriju, jezik, i knjilemost srpskog naroda\", XVI (1927): 214.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/emmert.htm Battle of Kosovo] , about the battle and surrounding facts"
