According to the Dominican intellectual Pedro Henríquez Ureña, this war was a critical phase in the creation of Dominican national consciousness because, having already differentiated themselves from the Haitians in the first war of independence and the Spaniards in the second, the Dominicans asserted their incompatibility with the United States.\nThe war was fought mainly by irregulars (revolutionaries, intellectuals, conservative elements in the military) against the regular Dominican Army loyal to Báez. According to Hector Avalos, the civil war had a religious dimension, since the predominantly Catholic Dominicans, having already rejected Haitian Vodou, now decisively rejected American Protestantism.\nThe first fight was in Boca de Cachón. The rebels were defeated, because it was a small group of patriots. Unintimidated,  Generals Timoteo and Andrés Ogando Encarnación, counting on the support of Generals Gregorio Luperón and José María Cabral, launched a new offensive. They seized Las Matas de Farfán, Neiba and other southern towns. By the end of 1871 they had overthrown the Báez government. Cabral took the presidency. In his autobiography, Luperón explains that \"the revolution in the south, under the leadership of General Timoteo Ogando, was gaining ground. Cabral found in San Juan a respectable force, organized and with all the inhabitants unified in a single thought: overthrow Báez and save the homeland.\"\nDominican annexation was successful in the 1870 referendum, but was defeated in the United States Senate.\nSee also\n* Annexation of Santo Domingo\n* United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–1924)\n* Dominican Civil War\nReferences"
