The conference is part of the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division 2 and is made up of teams from colleges and universities based in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nHistory\nThe conference was formed on April 14, 2014, by programs previously associated with the Great Northeast Collegiate Hockey Conference (GNCHC). The original seven members consisted of Millersville University, New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Princeton University, Seton Hall University, The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), the University of Pennsylvania, and West Chester University. The founder and first president of the conference was Tom Hench (2014–2016). Andrew Ducko took over as president from 2016 to 2022. Sal Capone took over as president from 2016 to 2024. Currently Alec Artosky is president (2024–present).\nAfter the inaugural season, the CSCHC put together and all star team to compete in the 2015 ACHA all star challenge. Team CSCHC won their opening game 4–1 over the ACCHL. The 2015 CSCHC All-stars finished with a 2-2-0-1 record.\nPrior to the 2015–16 season Monmouth University joined the conference from the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Hockey Association (MACH), raising the total number of teams to eight. In November 2015, the ACHA granted the CSCHC an automatic bid into the ACHA D2 Regional Tournament.\nIn March 2016, Rutgers University and the University of Scranton were accepted into the conference from the GNCHC following the 2015–16 season.\nAt the end of the 2017 ACHA season, the CSCHC participated in the ACHA All-Star Challenge, finishing 6th with a 3–3 record.\nFor the 2018–19 season the conference adopted a new shootout rule for regular season games that were tied at the conclusion of overtime, eliminating the \"tie\" entirely from CSCHC play. Following the season the CSCHC took part in the 2019 Men's Division 2 All Star Challenge, along with 12 other DII leagues and one group representing independent programs, which was hosted at West Chester's Ice Line Quad Rinks. The team finished 12th with a record of 1–3–1. In August 2019, TCNJ was announced as a 2020 ACHA Men's Division 2 Regional host, with Loucks Ice Center in Lawrenceville, New Jersey acting as the site for the Southeast tournament between February 28 and March 1. This was the first time that a team from The Colonial acted as an official host for an official ACHA event. The two teams that advanced to the 2020 National Tournament from this were #3 University of Cincinnati and #7 Miami University. The 2020 ACHA National tournament was later canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn April 2020, Stockton University was announced at the conference's 11th member ahead of the 2020–21 season (which was eventually canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The Ospreys became the first member to jump into Division 2 with its move, most recently playing in the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference's (DVCHC) National Division at the Division 3 level. The team also rejoined the ACHA as the DVCHC, at the time of the 2019–20 season, was playing under the Collegiate Hockey Federation, a separate non-varsity governing body. The next year the league accepted Bryn Athyn College as its 12th member, which had transitioned from playing as an Independent NCAA DIII program to ACHA DII.\nThe Colonial entered the 2022–23 season with the admission Penn State Berks, its first team to join from ACHA Division 1 (Eastern Collegiate Hockey Association). However the conference also lost members for the first time with the departures of The College of New Jersey, Princeton University, and Monmouth University. With ten teams participating the conference reverted to a single division format.\nRutgers University left the conference after the 2022–23 season. NJIT and Penn State Berks also withdrew from the conference in 2023. Drexel University joined the conference for the 2023–24 season after the Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Hockey Association (MACH) folded.\nBeginning in the 2024–2025 season the conference was moved to the Northeast Region of the ACHA M2 after spending ten years in the Southeast ACHA M2 region (2014–2024) since the conference inception.\nFor the 2025 ACHA All-star Challenge, the CSCHC All-Stars did an incredible job going 3–2 against the field and finishing in 3rd Place.\nAhead of the 2025–2026 season the CSCHC welcomed two new teams; Neumann University from the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference and The College of New Jersey from the Atlantic Coast Collegiate Hockey League (TCNJ launched a Men's Division 2 team following its jump to ACHA Division 1 in 2022). In March 2025, Bryn Athyn announced it was eliminating all of its NCAA sports teams and its club hockey team due to the school's financial instability.\nNotable achievements\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!Date\n!Description\n!Player or Team\n!Notes\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league game\n|Millersville University &Princeton University\n|at Lancaster Ice Rink\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league team Win\n|Millersville University\n|Millersville won, 8–1, over Princeton\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league goal\n|Alex Vukasin(Princeton Tigers)\n|2 minutes and 57 seconds into the 1st period\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league assist\n|James McNally(Millersville University)\n|Assisted on Millersville's first goal 4 minutes and 53 seconds into the first period\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league goalie win\n|Eric Hench(Millersville University)\n|60 minutes played with 12 saves on 13 shots\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league Power Play Goal\n|Nicholas Mullarkey(Millersville University)\n| scored on Millersville's seventh goal of the game, 19 minutes and 48 seconds into the second period\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league Shorthanded Goal\n|Brian Monteith(Millersville University)\n|Millersville's first goal of the game, 4 minutes and 53 seconds into the first period\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league penalty\n|Nicholas MullarkeyMillersville University\n|Called for hooking minor 4 minutes and 42 seconds into the first period\n|-\n|September 26, 2014\n|First league Game Winning Goal\n|Cyle Knopf(Millersville University)\n|Millersville's second goal of the game 17 minutes and 26 seconds into the first period.\n|-\n|November 14, 2014\n|First league shutout\n|Marc Daouphars(Millersville University)\n|27 saves in 7–0 win over NJIT\n|-\n|December 5, 2014\n|First league team to win over a ranked opponent\n|West Chester Golden Rams\n|WEST CHESTER-5 over #8 Delaware-4, in overtime\n|-\n|February 17, 2015\n|First Team in Rankings\n|Millersville University\n|received ranking votes in final ranking period in ACHA South East Region\n|-\n|February 21, 2015\n|First league MVP\n|James McNally(Millersville University)\n|50 points (19 goals, 31 assists) in 2014–15 season\n|-\n|February 22, 2015\n|First league champion\n|West Chester Golden Rams\n|Defeated Seton Hall University in the final, 3–2\n|-\n|February 26, 2016\n|First conference team to compete in the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament via autobid\n|Princeton Tigers\n|The 2016 conference winners fell, 5–3, to the University of Louisville in Dale City, VA.\n|-\n|March 1, 2019\n|First conference team to win a game at ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament\n|TCNJ Lions\n|Defeated Rowan University, 4–3, in Lynchburg, VA.\n|-\n|February 20, 2022\n|First league team to make regionals via at-large bid\n|University of Pennsylvania\n|Ranked #13 in final ranking period, earning spot in regionals without a conference autobid\n|-\n|November 10, 2024\n|First Team Ranked in Northeast Regional rankings\n|West Chester Golden Rams\n|Ranked #25 in first ranking period\n|-\n|February 9, 2025\n|First conference team to compete in the ACHA Northeast Regional Tournament via autobid\n|Millersville University\n|Won 2025 Colonial Cup\n|-\n|}\nPlayoff format\nOriginal (2014 to 2021), current (2022 to present)\nTeams within the conference play one-another twice a season, once at home and once on the road. The results of these games count towards league standings and determine the playoff seeds. The top six teams at the conclusion of the regular season will qualify for the conference playoffs, which are held at a single venue over the course of one weekend.\nThe top two seeds receive a bye in the first round. The third seed faces the sixth seed, while the fourth seed faces the fifth. The second round sees the top seed take on the lowest remaining seed, and the second seed take on the second highest seed remaining. The two teams that advance will face each-other in the championship game, with the winner receiving both the conference trophy and a birth in the ACHA Regional Tournament.\nDual division iteration (2021 to 2022)\nFor the 2021–22 season, the Colonial split its twelve member teams into two divisions. These divisions, named the Liberty and Independence divisions, have individual standings and their own qualification methods into the 2022 Colonial Cup playoffs. Teams in the Liberty Division, the larger of the two groups, play one-another twice, home and away, and play Independence teams once amounting to a 18-game regular season. The four teams within the Independence Division play one-another three times with one additional game against each of the teams in the Liberty Division. This amounts to a 17-game regular season.\nFollowing the conclusion of the regular season a seven-team playoff is hosted. The top six teams in the Liberty Division qualify for the tournament with the school finishing first overall receiving a bye into the semifinals. The seventh seed in the tournament goes to the highest finishing team in the Independence Division. The second seed faces the seventh seed (Independence), while the third faces the sixth and fourth faces the fifth. In the semifinals the first seed plays the lowest seed remaining in the tournament while the other two remaining teams face off. The two teams that advance will face each-other in the championship game.\nMember teams\n}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!School\n!Location\n!Nickname\n!Primary conference\n!Team colors\n!Joined\n!Website\n|-\n|Drexel University\n|Philadelphia, PA\n|Dragons\n|CAA (DI)\n| align=center |\n| 2023\n|[http://drexeluniversity.pointstreaksites.com/view/drexeluniversity/home-page-815]\n|-\n|Millersville University of Pennsylvania\n|Millersville, PA\n|Marauders\n|PSAC (DII)\n| align=center |\n| 2014\n|\n|-\n|Neumann University\n|Aston Township, PA\n|Knights\n|MAC (DIII)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n| 2025\n| [https://www.neumannathletics.com/sports/clubice]\n|-\n|University of Pennsylvania\n|Philadelphia, PA\n|Quakers\n|Ivy (DI)\n| align=center |\n| 2014\n|[http://pennquakershockey.pointstreaksites.com/view/quaker/]\n|-\n|University of Scranton\n|Scranton, PA\n|Royals\n|Landmark (DIII)\n| align=center |\n| 2016\n|None\n|-\n|Seton Hall University\n|South Orange, NJ\n|Pirates\n|Big East (DI)\n| align=center |\n| 2014\n|[http://shuhockey.pointstreaksites.com/view/shuhockey]\n|-\n|Stockton University\n|Galloway, NJ\n|Ospreys\n|NJAC (DIII)\n| align=center |\n|2020\n|[https://stocktonathletics.com/sports/2012/7/9/GEN_0709125418.aspx]\n|-\n|The College of New Jersey\n|Ewing, NJ\n|Lions\n|NJAC (DIII)\n| align=center |\n| 2025\n|[https://tcnj.acha.hockeytech.com/]\n|-\n|West Chester University\n|West Chester, PA\n|Golden Rams\n|PSAC (DII)\n| align=center |\n| 2014\n|[http://wcuhockey.pointstreaksites.com/view/wcuhockey/]\n|-\n|}\nConference arenas\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!School\n!Home arena\n!Location\n|-\n|Drexel\n|Class of 1923 Arena\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|-\n|Millersville\n|Lancaster Ice Rink\n|Lancaster, Pennsylvania\n|-\n|Neumann\n|IceWorks Skating Complex\n|Aston, Pennsylvania\n|-\n|Penn\n|Class of 1923 Arena\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|-\n|Scranton\n|Revolution Ice Centre\n|Pittston, Pennsylvania\n|-\n|Seton Hall\n|Richard J.
