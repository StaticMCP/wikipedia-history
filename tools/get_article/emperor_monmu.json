He was the second son of Prince Kusakabe. Monmu's mother was Princess Abe, a daughter of Emperor Tenji. Monmu's mother would later accede to the throne herself, and she would be known as Empress Genmei.\nEvents of Monmu's life\nKaru-shinnō was only six years old when his father, Crown Prince Kusakabe, died.\n* 697:  In the 10th year of Jitō-tennōs reign (持統天皇十年), the empress abdicated; and the succession (senso) was received by a grandson of Emperor Tenmu.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Monmu is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\nEmperor Monmu ruled until his death in 707, at which point he was succeeded by his mother, Empress Genmei, who was also his first cousin once removed and his first cousin twice removed. He left a young son by Fujiwara no Miyako, a daughter of Fujiwara no Fuhito: Obito no miko (Prince Obito), who eventually became Emperor Shōmu.\nEmperor Monmu's reign lasted 10 years.  He died at the age of 25.\nThe actual site of Monmu's grave is known.  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (misasagi) at Nara.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Monmu's mausoleum.  It is formally named Hinokuma no Ako no oka no e no misasagi.\nKugyō\nis a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Monmu's reign, this apex of the  Daijō-kan included:\n* Daijō-daijin, Osakabe-shinnō.\n* Sadaijin\n* Udaijin\n* Naidaijin, Nakatomi Kamako no Muraji.\n* Dainagon, Fujiwara Fuhito.\nEras of Monmu's reign\nConventional modern scholarship seems to have determined that the years of Monmu's reign are encompassed within more than one era name or nengō.\n* Taihō (era)  (701–704)\n* Keiun       (704–708)\nNon-nengō period\nThe initial years of Monmu's reign are not linked by scholars to any era or nengō.  The Taika era innovation of naming time periods – nengō – languished until Monmu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taihō in 701.\n* See Japanese era name – \"Non-nengo periods\"\n* See Monmu period (697–701).\nIn this context, Brown and Ishida's translation of Gukanshō offers an explanation about the years of Empress Jitō's reign which muddies a sense of easy clarity in the pre-Taiho time-frame:\n::\"The eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuchō [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695–698]. (The first year of this era was kinoto-hitsuji [695].)  ... In the third year of the Taka era [697], Empress Jitō yielded the throne to the Crown Prince.\"\nConsorts and children\nBunin: Fujiwara no Miyako (藤原宮子, d. 754), Fujiwara no Fuhito’s daughter\n*First Son: Prince Obito (首皇子) later Emperor Shōmu\nHin: Ki no Kamado-no-iratsume (紀竃門娘)\nHin: Ishikawa no Tone-no-iratsume (石川刀子娘)\n*Takamado Hironari (Hiroyo)\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\n* Taihō Code\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Brown, Delmer M. and Ichirō Ishida, eds.
