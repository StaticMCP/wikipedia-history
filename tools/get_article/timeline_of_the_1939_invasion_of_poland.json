The invasion began on 1 September 1939, when German, Slovak, and Danzig forces entered Poland. The Soviets invaded Poland on 17 September. The campaign ended on 6 October with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty. The aim of the invasions was to disestablish Poland as a sovereign country, with its citizens destined for extermination.\nThe following is a timeline of the invasion, which includes events preluding to the offensives, battles and attacks during the invasion, before ending with the last Polish armed forces surrendering on 6 October, which then begins the Polish resistance movement against the German Military Administration in Poland and the Soviet Union occupational administration.\nPrelude\n*15 June: The German Military High Command finalized the plans for an invasion of Poland, codenamed Operation Fall Weiss, also known as Operation White Castle.\n, in the presence of Joseph Stalin, the dictator of the Soviet Union|alt=Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov signs the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

The treaty established a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, with a secret protocol establishing Soviet and German spheres of influence across Eastern Europe, including the division of Poland between the two countries. The treaty's existence was rumored to exist among the Allies throughout World War II, and was only proven to exist during the Nuremberg trials.\n*25 August:\n**Adolf Hitler, dispatches orders to the Wehrmacht to invade Poland on 26 August following the plans of Case White.\n**The United Kingdom signs an agreement with Poland, reaffirming mutual military assistance between the nations if either was attacked by some \"European country\", as agreed upon in the Anglo-Polish alliance.\n*26 August:\n**Hitlers postpones the invasion of Poland after being \"considerably shaken\" (according to General Franz Halder) by the reaffirmation of the Anglo-Polish alliance.\n**Approximately 70 German Abwehr agents, commanded by Lieutenant , attacked and failed to capture a key rail station and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass in Poland.

Oskar Schindler, who is known for saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust, assisted the SS in the attack.\n**Germany sends a last-minute ultimatum to Poland, which included 16 demands. Hitler later gave a speech announcing Poland rejected these demands before the invasion started, despite the ultimatum not being presented to Poland prior to the invasion.\nSeptember\n1 September\nfiring her guns during the battle of Westerplatte; taken by a Nazi collaborator photographer with the Associated Press]]\ndemolish a Polish border crossing]]\nafter German bombing]]\nduring the battle of Tuchola Forest]]\n*Around 04:30 German Stukas III./KG1 dive bombers attack Polish sapper positions around the Tczew Road Bridge in the unsuccessful attempt to preempt the demolition of the bridge.
