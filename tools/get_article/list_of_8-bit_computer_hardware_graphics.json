      "text": "# List of 8-bit computer hardware graphics\n\n}}\nThis is a list of notable 8-bit computer color palettes, and graphics, which were primarily manufactured from 1975 to 1985. Although some of them use RGB palettes, more commonly they have 4, 16 or more color palettes that are not bit nor level combinations of RGB primaries, but fixed ROM/circuitry colors selected by the manufacturer. Due to mixed-bit architectures, the n-bit distinction is not always a strict categorization. Another error is assuming that a computer's color palette represents what it can show all at once. Resolution is also a crucial aspect when criticizing an 8-bit computer, as many offer different modes with different amounts of colors on screen, and different resolutions, with the intent of trading off resolution for color, and vice versa.\n:{|\n| Sample image\n| Color test chart\n| 3-bit, 8-color palette\n| 6-bit, 64-color palette\n|-\n| Image:RGB 24bits palette sample image.jpg\n| Image:RGB 24bits palette color test chart.png\n|\n|\n|}\n3-bit RGB palettes\nSystems with a 3-bit RGB palette use 1 bit for each of the red, green and blue color components. That is, each component is either \"on\" or \"off\" with no intermediate states. This results in an 8-color palette ((21)3  23  8) that have black, white, the three RGB primary colors red, green and blue and their correspondent complementary colors cyan, magenta and yellow as follows:\n:{|\n|Sample image\n|Palette coverage\n|Color indexes\n|-\n| Image:RGB 3bits palette sample image.png\n| Image:BbcMicro palette color test chart.png\n| Image:RGB 3bits palette.png\n|}\nThe color indices vary between implementations; therefore, index numbers are not given. A common selection has 3 bits (from LSB to MSB) directly representing the 'Red', 'Green' and 'Blue' (RGB) components in a number from 0 to 7. An alternate arrangement uses the bit order 'Blue', 'Red', 'Green' (BRG), such that the resultant palette - in numerical order - represents an increasing level of intensity on a monochrome display.\nThe 3-bit RGB palette is used by:\n*The ECMA-48 standard for text terminals (sometimes known as the \"ANSI standard\", although ANSI X3.64 does not define colors)\n*Teletext Level 1/1.5 Teletext.\n*Videotex\n*Oric computers\n*BBC Micro\n*The original NEC PC-8801 up to the MkII\n*The original NEC PC-9801 with original 8086 CPU before the VM/VX models\n*All Sharp X1 models before the X1 Turbo Z\n*The Sharp MZ 700\n*Fujitsu FM-7, FM New 7, FM 77 before the FM77AV\n*Sinclair QL\n*The Macintosh SE with a color printer or external monitor\n*The SECAM version of the Atari 2600\n*The Color Maximite, a PIC32 based microcomputer\n*The Thomson TO7 (with spatial constraints - only 2 colours for each group of 8x1 pixels)\n*The  Matra Alice 32 and 90\n*The Philips VG5000\nSpecific details about implementation and actual graphical capabilities of specific systems, are listed on the next sub-sections.\nWorld System Teletext Level 1\nWorld System Teletext Level 1 (1976) uses a 3-bit RGB, 8-color palette. Teletext has 40×25 characters per page of which the first row is reserved for a page header. Every character cell has a background color and a text color. These attributes along with others are set through control codes which each occupy one character position. Graphics characters consisting of 2×3 cells can used following a graphics color attribute. Up to a maximum of 72×69 blocky pixels can be used on a page.\nSimulated image\n:Image:Level 1 teletext test.png\nBBC Micro\nBBC Micro has 8 display modes, with resolutions like 640×256 (max. 2 colors), 320×256 (max. 4 colors) and 160×256 (max. 16 logical colors). No display modes have cell attribute clashes. The palette available has only 8 physical colors, plus a further 8 flashing colors (each being one of the eight non-flashing colors alternating with its physical complement every second), and the display modes can have 16, 4 or 2 simultaneous colors.\nSimulated image\n:Image:BbcMicro palette sample image.png\nBBC Micro display modes\n:{|\n| Mode 0 (640 × 256, 2 colors)\n| Mode 1 (320 × 256, 4 colors)\n| Mode 2 (160 × 256, 8 colors)\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n:{|\n| Mode 4 (320 × 256, 2 colors)\n| Mode 5 (160 × 256, 4 colors)\n| Mode 8 (80 × 256, 8 colors)\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nSinclair QL (Sinclair Quantum Leap)\nOn the Sinclair QL two video modes were available, 256×256 pixels with 8 RGB colors and per-pixel flashing, or 512×256 pixels with four colors: black, red, green and white. The supported colors could be stippled in 2×2 blocks to simulate up to 256 colors, an effect which did not copy reliably on a TV, especially over an RF connection.\nPixel aspect ratio was not square, with resulting image proportions close to 4.4:3, making the image extend into the horizontal overscan area of a CRT TV.\n:{|\n| 256x256 mode\n| 512x256 mode\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| Simulated images (aspect ratio corrected)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| Simulated images (original pixel size)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 20pc\"\n! style=\"color:black; background:white;\"| 256×256\n! style=\"color:black; background:white;\"| 512×256\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#000000;\"| black\n| style=\"color:white; background:#000000;\" rowspan=\"2\"| black\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#0000ff;\"| blue\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ff0000;\"| red\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ff0000;\" rowspan=\"2\" | red\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ff00ff;\"| magenta\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#00ff00;\"| green\n| style=\"color:black; background:#00ff00;\" rowspan=\"2\"| green\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#00ffff;\"| cyan\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffff00;\"| yellow\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffffff;\" rowspan=\"2\"| white\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffffff;\"| white\n|}\nPC-8000 series\nThe NEC PC-8000 was capable of displaying graphics with a resolution of 160x100 pixels and 8 colors.\n4-bit RGBI palettes\n:{|\n| Image:RGBI 4bits palette sample image.png\n| Image:RGBI 4bits palette color test chart.png\n|}\nThe 4-bit RGBI palette is similar to the 3-bit RGB palette but adds one bit for intensity. It contains variants of colors (dark or bright on most machines, but saturated or unsaturated was also possible) potentially giving a total of 23×2  16 colors. Some implementations had only 15 effective colors due to the \"dark\" and \"bright\" variations of black being displayed identically. Others generated a grey tone or a different color.\nThis 4-bit RGBI schema is used in several platforms with variations, so the table given below is a simple reference for the palette richness, and not an actual implemented palette. For this reason, no numbers are assigned to each color, and color order is arbitrary.\n:Image:RGBI 4bits palette.png\nSystems that used this palette scheme:\n* IBM's original Color Graphics Adapter\n* IBM's Enhanced Graphics Adapter, in CGA modes\n* Tandy graphics on IBM's PCjr and Tandy 1000-series computers\n* Plantronics Colorplus on a limited number of PC-compatible computers\n* MCGA and VGA graphics standards for backward compatibility\n* Commodore 128 series for its 80-column mode\n* ZX Spectrum (and compatible) (with spatial constraints - only 2 colours for each group of 8x8 pixels)\n* CPC 464/664/6128\n* Sharp MZ-800 series computers\n* Thomson MO5 and TO7 (with spatial constraints - only 2 colours for each group of 8x1 pixels)\nSpecific details about implementation and actual graphical capabilities of specific systems, are listed on the next sub-sections.\nZX Spectrum===\nThe ZX Spectrum (and compatible) computers use a variation of the 4-bit RGBI palette philosophy. This results in each of the colors of the 3-bit palette to have a basic and bright variant, with the exception of black. This was accomplished by having a maximum voltage level for the bright variant, and a lower voltage level for the basic variant. Due to this, black is the same in both variants.\nThe attribute byte associated with every 8×8 pixel cell comprises (from LSB to MSB): three bits for the background color; three bits for the foreground color; one bit for the bright variant for both, and one bit for the flashing effect (alternate foreground and background colors every 0.32 seconds). Thus the colors are not independently selectable as indices of a true palette (there are not color numbers 8 to 15, and the bright bit affects both colors within a cell). However, within a single set of 8 colors the BRG order of bits means that the colors appear in increasing order of brightness on a monochrome display.\nThe color number (0 to 7) can be employed with the following BASIC statements to choose:\n* BORDER n, the color for the surrounding area outside the pixel graphical area. This cannot use the bright variants.\n* PAPER n, the background (pixel bit value of 0) color for an 8×8 pixel cell.\n* INK n, the foreground (pixel bit value of 1) color for an 8×8 pixel cell.\nAnd a value of 0 or 1 with the following statements to choose:\n* BRIGHT n, sets the bright bit for both foreground and background colors in an 8×8 pixel cell.\n* FLASH n, sets the bit that controls the flashing effect in an 8×8 pixel cell.\n:{|\n| Simulated image\n| colspan=\"3\"|Sample image and palette\n|\n|\n|-\n| Image:ZX Spectrum 256x192 example image Ara macao, Ara ararauna and Ara militaris.png\n| Image:ZXSpectrum palette sample image.png\n| Image:ZXSpectrum palette color test chart.png\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | Image:ZXSpectrum palette.png\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"11\" |'ZX Spectrum Hardware Palette'\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Colour\nnumber\n! colspan=\"4\" |Binary value\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Colour\nname\n! colspan=\"4\" |Binary value\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Colour\nname\n|-\n!G\n!R\n!B\n!I\n!G\n!R\n!B\n!I\n|-\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" |Black\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#000; color:#FFF;\" |Black\n|-\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#00E; color:#FFF;\" |Blue\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#00F; color:#FFF;\" |Bright Blue\n|-\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#E00; color:black;\" |Red\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#F00; color:black;\" |Bright Red\n|-\n|3\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#E0E; color:black;\" |Magenta\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#F0F; color:black;\" |Bright Magenta\n|-\n|4\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#0E0;\" |Green\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#0F0;\" |Bright Green\n|-\n|5\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#0EE;\" |Cyan\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#0FF;\" |Bright Cyan\n|-\n|6\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#EE0;\" |Yellow\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#FF0;\" |Bright Yellow\n|-\n|7\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n| style=\"background-color:#EEE;\" |White\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n| style=\"background-color:#FFF;\" |Bright White\n|}\n* Some ZX Spectrum clones or NTSC machines might display \"bright black\" as dark gray.\n* Colours simulated as sRGB assume non-bright as 85% voltage (0.55&nbsp;V) and bright as 100% (0.65&nbsp;V). Each ZX Spectrum model used different voltages, so the colors shown are only approximate.\n:\nIBM PC/XT and compatible systems\nThe original IBM PC launched in 1981 features an Intel 8088 CPU which has 8-bit data bus technology, though internally the CPU has a fully 16-bit architecture.  It was offered with a Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) or a Color Graphics Adapter (CGA).  The MDA is a text mode-only display adapter, without any graphic ability beyond using the built-in code page 437 character set (which includes half-block and line-drawing characters), and employed an original IBM green monochrome monitor; only black, green and intensified green could be seen on its screen.  Then, only the CGA had true graphic modes.\nThe IBM PC XT model, which succeeded the original PC in 1983, has an identical architecture and CPU to its predecessor, only with more expansion slots and a hard disk equipped as standard.  The same two video cards, the MDA and the CGA, remained available for the PC XT, and no upgraded video hardware was offered by IBM until the EGA, which followed the introduction of the IBM Personal Computer/AT, with its full 16-bit bus design, in 1984.\nCGA\nThe Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) outputs what IBM called \"digital RGB\" (that is, the R, G, B (and I) signals from the graphics card to the monitor can each only have two states: on or off).\nCGA supports a maximum of 16 colors. However, its 320×200 graphics mode is restricted to fixed palettes containing only four colors, and the 640×200 graphic mode is only two colors. 16 simultaneous colors are only available in text mode or the \"tweaked text\" 160×100 mode.\nA different set of 16 simultaneous colors is available using an NTSC TV or composite monitor  by using artifact color techniques, with independent groups having demonstrated much larger color sets of over 256 colors  See Color Graphics Adapter#High color depth.\nThe CGA RGBI palette is a variant of the 4-bit RGBI schema, arranged internally like this:.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |CGA palette internal bit arrangement (4-bit RGBI)\n|-\n!Color\n!I\n!R\n!G\n!B\n!Color\n!I\n!R\n!G\n!B\n|-\n|Black\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|Gray 2\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Blue\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|Light Blue\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Green\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|Light Green\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|Cyan\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|Light Cyan\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Red\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|Light Red\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Magenta\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|Light Magenta\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Yellow / Brown\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|Light Yellow\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|Gray 1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|White\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|}\nAlthough the RGBI signals each have only two states, the CGA color monitor (usually mentioned as RGB monitor) decodes them as four level RGB signals. Darker colors are the basic RGB 2nd level signals except for brown, which is dark yellow with the level for the green component halved (1st level). Brighter colors are made by adding a uniform intensity one-level signal to every RGB signal of the dark ones, reaching the 3rd level (except dark gray which reaches only the 1st level), and in this case yellow is produced as if the brown were ordinary dark yellow.\nThe resulting displayed colors on RGB monitors are shown below:\n:{|\n| Image:CGA palette sample image.png\n| Image:Cga palette color test chart.png\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"| Image:CGA palette.png\n|}\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#000;\"| 0 — black\n| style=\"background:#555;\"| 8 — high gray\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#00a;\"| 1 — low blue\n| style=\"background:#55f;\"| 9 — high blue\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#0a0;\"| 2 — low green\n| style=\"color:black; background:#5f5;\"| 10 — high green\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#0aa;\"| 3 — low cyan\n| style=\"color:black; background:#5ff;\"| 11 — high cyan\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#a00;\"| 4 — low red\n| style=\"color:black; background:#f55;\"| 12 — high red\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#a0a;\"| 5 — low magenta\n| style=\"color:black; background:#f5f;\"| 13 — high magenta\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#a50;\"| 6 — low yellow (brown)\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ff5;\"| 14 — high yellow\n|- style=\"color:black;\"\n| style=\"background:#aaa;\"| 7 — low gray\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| 15 — white\n|}\nA few earlier non-IBM compatible CGA monitors lack the circuitry to decode color numbers as of four levels internally, and they cannot show brown and dark gray. The above palette is displayed in such monitors as follows:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"color:white; background:#000;\"\n|| 0 — black\n|| 8 — black*\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:navy;\"| 1 — low blue\n| style=\"background:#00f;\"| 9 — high blue\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:green;\"| 2 — low green\n| style=\"color:black; background:#0f0;\"| 10 — high green\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:teal;\"| 3 — low cyan\n| style=\"color:black; background:#0ff;\"| 11 — high cyan\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:maroon;\"| 4 — low red\n| style=\"color:white; background:#f00;\"| 12 — high red\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:purple;\"| 5 — low magenta\n| style=\"color:white; background:#f0f;\"| 13 — high magenta\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:olive;\"| 6 — low yellow* (brown)\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ff0;\"| 14 — high yellow\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:gray;\"| 7 — light gray* (gray)\n| style=\"color:black; background:#fff;\"| 15 — white\n|}\n16-color palette modes\nThe only full 16-color BIOS modes of the CGA are the text mode 0 (40×25) and mode 2 (80×25). Disabling the flashing attribute effect and using the IBM 437 codepage block characters 220 (DCh) ▄ (bottom half) or 223 (DFh) ▀ (upper half), the mode 2 screen buffer provides an 80×50 quasi-graphic mode.\nAlso, a tweak mode can be set in the CGA to give an extra, non-standard 160×100 pixels 16-color graphic mode.\n:{|\n| 16-color, 80×50 mode\n| 16-color, 160×100 mode\n| 16-color comparison image\n|-\n|Image:Screen color test CGA 16colors 80x50.png\n|Image:Screen color test CGA 16colors 160x100.png\n|thumb\n|}\n4-color palette modes\nIn the 320×200 graphics mode, every pixel has two bits. A value of 0 is always a selectable background-plus-border color (with the same register and/or BIOS call used for the foreground color in the 640×200 graphic mode; black by default), and the three remaining values 1 to 3 are indices to one of the predefined color palette entries.\nThe selection of a palette is a bit complex. There are two BIOS 320×200 CGA graphics modes: modes 4 and 5. Mode 4 has the composite color burst output enabled (in the Mode Control Register at I/O address 3D8H, bit 2 is cleared), and mode 5 has it disabled (the same bit 2 is set). Mode 5 is intended mainly for a monochrome composite video monitor, but because of a specific intentional feature of the CGA hardware, it also has a different palette for an RGBI color monitor. For mode 4, two palettes can be chosen: green/red/brown and cyan/magenta/white; the difference is the absence or presence of the blue signal in all three colors. (The palette is selected with bit 5 of the Color-Select Register at I/O address 3D9h, where the bit value 1 selects the cyan/magenta/white palette [a/k/a \"palette #1\" because it is the BIOS default] and 0 selects the green/red/brown palette [a/k/a \"palette #2\"]. This bit can be set using BIOS INT 10h function 0Bh, subfunction 1.) The palette for BIOS video mode 5 is always cyan/red/white: blue is always on, and red and green each are controlled directly by one of the two bits of the pixel color value.  For each of these three palette options, a low or high intensity palette can be chosen with bit 4 of the aforementioned Color-Select Register: a value of 0 means low intensity and 1 means high intensity. (No BIOS call exists to switch between the two intensity modes.) The selected intensity setting simply controls the \"I\" output signal to the RGBI monitor for all colors in the palette. As a result, the green-red-brown palette appears as bright-green/bright-red/yellow when high intensity is selected. The combination of color-burst enable/disable selection, palette selection, and intensity selection yields a total of 6 different possible palettes for CGA 320×200 graphics.\nright\nMode 4, palette #1, low intensity\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|| 0 — [user-defined]\n|-\n| style=\"color:white;

The near-compatible Tandy 1000 series features almost 100% PCjr-compatible video hardware implemented in a Tandy proprietary chip. This graphics adapter is better known by the name Tandy Graphics Adapter, because the PCjr was short-lived but the Tandy 1000 line was quite popular for many years.  The video mode capabilities of early-model Tandy 1000 computers are exactly the same as the PCjr's.  (Later Tandy 1000 models featured \"Tandy Video II\" hardware which added a 640x200 16-color mode but surrendered PCjr hardware register-compatibility for CGA register-compatibility.)\nThe PCjr adds three video modes to the CGA mode set: 160×200 16-color \"low-resolution\" graphics, 320×200 16-color \"medium-resolution\" graphics, and 640×200 4-color \"high-resolution\" graphics.  All PCjr/Tandy 1000 graphics modes can reassign any color index to any palette entry making all 16 colors freely selectable in modes with fewer than 16 colors (including the plain CGA modes) and making color cycling effects possible in all modes.  The PCjr also offers a graphics blink function which causes 8 colors to alternate between the low and high halves of the 16-color palette at the text blink rate.  (A PCjr must be upgraded with a PCjr-specific internal 64 KB memory expansion card in order to use the latter two of these modes or any 80-column text mode.  Tandy 1000 base models can use all video modes.)\n:Image:Screen color test PCjr 16colors 160x200.png\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"color: white; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #000; width: 2pc;\"| 0\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #00a; width: 2pc;\"| 1\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #0a0; width: 2pc;\"| 2\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #0aa; width: 2pc;\"| 3\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #a00; width: 2pc;\"| 4\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #a0a; width: 2pc;\"| 5\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #a50; width: 2pc;\"| 6\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #aaa; width: 2pc;\"| 7\n|-\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #555; width: 2pc;\"| 8\n| style=\"color: white; background-color: #55f; width: 2pc;\"| 9\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #5f5; width: 2pc;\"| 10\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #5ff; width: 2pc;\"| 11\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #f55; width: 2pc;\"| 12\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #f5f; width: 2pc;\"| 13\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #ff5; width: 2pc;\"| 14\n| style=\"color: black; background-color: #fff; width: 2pc;\"| 15\n|}\nThomson\nFor Thomson computers, a popular brand in France, the most common display modes are 320×200, with 8×1 attribute cells with 2 colors. Here the intensity byte affects saturation and not only brightness variations.\nThomson MO5\nThe Thomson MO5 generated graphics based on a EFGJ03L (or MA4Q-1200) gate array capable of 40×25 text display and a resolution of 320 x 200 pixels with 16 colours (subject to proximity constraints - only two colors for a 8x1 pixel area).\nThe colour palette has 8 basic RGB colours with an intensity bit (called P for \"Pastel\") that controlled saturation (\"saturated\" or \"pastel\"). In memory, the bit order was PBGR. The desaturated colours were obtained by mixing of the original RGB components within the video hardware. This is done by a PROM circuit, where a two bit mask controls colour mixing ratios of 0%, 33%, 66% and 100% of the saturated hue. This approach makes it easy break from the usual logical progression and substitute any color in any place. This was done to replace \"desaturated white\" with Orange and \"desaturated black\" with Gray.\nAccording to the values specified on the computer's technical manual (“Manuel Technique du MO5”, pg. 11 & 19), the hardware palette was:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Thomson MO5 Hardware Palette\n|-\n!

A cheaper green monochrome display was also available from the manufacturer; in this case, the colors are viewed as a 16-tone green scale, as shown in the last simulated image, as it interprets the overall brightness of the full color signal, instead of only considering the green intensity as might, e.g., the Philips CM8833 line.\n:{|\n| 2 colors\n| 4 colors\n| 16 colors\n| 16-tone green scale\n|-\n| Image:Screen color test AmstradCPC 2colors.png\n| Image:Screen color test AmstradCPC 4colors.png\n| Image:Screen color test AmstradCPC 16colors.png\n| Image:Screen color test AmstradCPC 16colors mono.png\n|}\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-style: none; width: 100%; height: 100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:black\"| 0 – Black (5)\n| style=\"background:navy\"| 1 – Dark blue (0,14)\n| style=\"background:blue\"| 2 – Blue (6)\n| style=\"background:maroon\"| 3 – Dark red\n| style=\"background:purple\"| 4 – Dark magenta\n| style=\"background:#8000ff\"| 5 – Violet\n| style=\"background:red\"| 6 – Red (3)\n| style=\"background:#ff0080\"| 7 – Magenta-red\n| style=\"background:magenta\"| 8 – Magenta (7)\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:green\"| 9 – Dark green\n| style=\"background:teal\"| 10 – Dark cyan (8)\n| style=\"background:#0080ff\"| 11 – Cyan-blue (15)\n| style=\"background:olive\"| 12 – Dark yellow (brown) (9)\n| style=\"background:grey\"| 13 – Grey\n| style=\"background:#8080ff\"| 14 – Light blue (10)\n| style=\"color:black;background:#ff8000\"| 15 – Orange\n| style=\"color:black;background:#ff8080\"| 16 – Pink (11, 15)\n| style=\"color:black;background:#ff80ff\"| 17 – Light magenta\n|- style=\"color:black\"\n| style=\"background:lime\"| 18 – Green (12)\n| style=\"background:#00ff80\"| 19 – Cyan-green\n| style=\"background:cyan\"| 20 – Cyan (2)\n| style=\"background:#80ff00\"| 21 – Yellow-green\n| style=\"background:#80ff80\"| 22 – Light green (13)\n| style=\"background:#80ffff\"| 23 – Light cyan\n| style=\"background:yellow\"| 24 – Yellow (1, 14)\n| style=\"background:#ffff80\"| 25 – Light yellow\n| style=\"background:white\"| 26 – White (4)\n|}\nThe number in parentheses means the primary ink number for the Locomotive BASIC PEN, PAPER and INK statements (that is, \"(1)\" means ink #1 defaults to this color). Inks can also have a secondary color number, meaning they flash between two colors. By default, ink #14 alternates between colors 1 and 24 (blue and bright yellow) and ink #15 alternates between colors 11 and 16 (cyan-blue and pink). In addition, the paper defaults to ink #0 and the pen to ink #1, meaning yellow text on a dark blue background.\n6-bit RGB palettes\nThe 6-bit RGB palette uses 2 bits for each RGB component. This results in an 4×4×4 = 64-color palette as follows:\n{|\n| Image:Coco3 RGB palette sample image.png\n| Image:Coco3 RGB.png\n|}\nTandy Color Computer 3\nThe Tandy Color Computer 3 could display all of the modes of the Tandy Color Computer 1 and 2 / TRS-80 Color Computer, except the Semigraphics modes. Taking the place of the graphics and memory hardware of the previous machines is an application-specific integrated circuit called (officially) the Advanced Color Video Chip (ACVC) or (unofficially) the Graphics Interrupt Memory Enhancer (GIME).\nWith colors from a palette of 64 possible colors, this chip is capable of displaying the following combinations of colors and resolutions: 320x192x4, 320x192x16, 640x192x2, and 640x192x4.

Bit-mapped graphics modes can display 2, 4, 16, or 256 colors (from a 3-3-2 bit RGB palette), but horizontal resolution decreases as color depth increases.\nInterlaced and non-interlaced modes are available. The maximum resolution is 640×512 pixels interlaced, or 640×256 pixels non-interlaced. Only 2 colors are available at these resolutions.\nA 256-color display has a maximum resolution of 80×256. The attribute graphics mode provides a 320×256 pixel resolution with 16 colors selected from a palette of 256.\nMultiple pages can be displayed simultaneously on the screen--even if their graphics modes are different. Each page has its own palette which makes it possible to display more colors on screen simultaneously. The page height can be larger than the screen or the window it is displayed on. Each page is connected to a channel of the EXOS operating system, so it is possible to write on a hidden page.\nMSX2\nOn the MSX2 screen mode 8 is a high-resolution 256×212-pixel mode with an 8-bit color depth, giving a palette of 256 colors (Fixed RGB mode of the Yamaha V9938 video chip). From the MSB to LSB, there are three green bits, three red bits, and two blue bits. This mode uses half of the available colors overall, and can be considered a palette in its own right.\n:left\n9-bit RGB palettes\nThe 9-bit RGB palette uses 3 bits for each of the red, green, and blue color components. This results in a (23)3 = 83 = 512-color palette as follows:\n:{|\n|\n|\n|}\nMSX2\nThe MSX2 series features a Yamaha V9938 video chip, which manages a 9-bit RGB palette (512 colors in Paletted RGB mode) and has some extended graphic modes. Although its graphical capabilities are similar, or even better than of those of 16-bit personal computers, MSX2 and MSX2+ (see below) are pure 8-bit machines.\nScreen mode 6 is a 512×212-pixel mode with a 4-color palette chosen from the available 512 colors.\nScreen modes 5 and 7 are high-resolution 256×212-pixel and 512×212-pixel modes, respectively, with a 16-color palette chosen from the available 512 colors. Each pixel can be any of the 16 selected colors.\n:{|\n| 4-color screen mode 6\n| 16-color screen mode 5\n|-\n| Image:Screen color test MSX2 Screen6.png\n| Image:Screen color test MSX2 Screen5.png\n|}\n15-bit RGB palettes\nThe 15-bit RGB palette uses 5 bits for each of the red, green, and blue color components. This results in a (25)3 = 323 = 32,768-color palette (commonly known as Highcolor).\nMSX2+\nThe MSX2+ series (released in 1988) features a Yamaha V9958 video chip which manages a 15-bit RGB palette internally encoded in YJK (up to 19,268 different colors from the 32,768 theoretically possible) and has additional screen modes. Although its graphical capabilities are similar, or even better than of those of 16-bit personal computers, MSX2 (see above) and MSX2+ are pure 8-bit machines. YJK color encoding can be viewed as a lossy compression technique; in the RGB to YJK conversion, the average red and green levels are preserved, but blue is subsampled. As a result of every four pixels sharing a chroma value, in mode 12 it is not possible to have vertical lines of a single color. This is only possible in modes 10 and 11 due to the additional 16-color direct palette. This can be used to mix 16 indexed colors with a rich colorful background, in what can be considered a primitive video overlay technique.\n:{|\n| Image:MSX2plus YJK&YAE palette sample image.png\n| Image:MSX2plus YJK&YAE palette color test chart.png\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | Image:MSX2plus YJK&YAE palette.png\n|}\nScreen modes 10 & 11 – 12,499 YJK colors plus a 16-color palette. In this mode, the YJK technique encodes 16 levels of luminance into the four LSBs of each pixel and 64 levels of chroma, from −32 to +31, shared across every four consecutive pixels and stored in the three higher bits of the four pixels. If the fifth bit of the pixel is set, then the lower four bits of the pixel points to an index in the 16-color palette; otherwise, they specify the YJK luminance level of the pixel.\nScreen mode 12 is similar to modes 10 and 11, but uses five bits to encode 32 levels of luminance for every pixel, thus it does not use an additional palette and, with YJK encoding, 19,268 different colors can be displayed simultaneously with 8-bit color depth.\n:{|\n| Screen mode 10 & 11\n| Screen mode 12\n|-\n| Image:Screen color test MSX2plus Screen10&11.png\n| Image:Screen color test MSX2plus Screen12.png\n|}\n18-bit RGB palettes\n}}\nA 18-bit RGB palette uses 6 bits for each of the red, green, and blue color components. This results in a (26)3 = 643 = 262,144-color palette as follows:\n:{| style=\"border-style: none\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n|| Image:RGB 18bits palette sample image.png\n|| Image:RGB 18bits palette color test chart.png\n|}\nFM-77 AV 40\nFujitsu's FM-77 AV 40, released in 1986, uses an 18-bit RGB palette. Any 64,000 out of 262,144 colors can be displayed simultaneously at the 320×200 resolution, or 8 out of 262,144 colors at the 640×400 resolution.\nComposite video palettes\nThis section covers systems that generate color directly as composite video, closely related with display on analog CRT TVs. Many of the colors are non-standard and outside of RGB gamut, and would only display properly on NTSC hardware.\nDue to the varying ways of converting a composite signal to sRGB (the standard for internet images), images in this section will be inconsistent with each other in color until further notice.\nAtari 8-bit computers\nEarly models of the Atari 400 and 800 use a palette of 128 colors, using 4 bits for chrominance and 3 for luminance. Screen modes may vary from 320×192 (384x240 with overscan) to 40×24, using 2 or 4 simultaneous colors, or 80×192 (96x240 with overscan) using 16 colors. After 2 years (late 1981) the CTIA graphics chip was replaced with the GTIA chip increasing the palette to 256 colors (CTIA and GTIA).\nThe ANTIC chip has an instruction set to run programs (called display lists) which permits many more colors on the screen at once. There are a number of possible software-driven graphics modes.\nCTIA palette\n:{|\n| Image:Atari_8-bit_Parrot_mode_15_w_MCS_%26_color_interrupts.png\n| Image:Atari800CTIA palette color test chart.png\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

Consumers in Europe (which uses PAL) considered the Commodore colors to be more \"washed out\" and less vivid than those provided by computers such as the ZX Spectrum.\nVIC-20\nThe VIC-20 uses a MOS Technology VIC chip which produces a 16-color YPbPr composite video palette. The palette lacks any intermediate shade of gray, and it has 5 or 9 levels of luminance.\nThe VIC-20 lacks any true graphic mode, but a 22×11 text mode with 200 definable characters of 8×16 bits each arranged as a matrix of 20×10 characters is usually used instead, giving a 3:2(NTSC)/5:3(PAL) pixel aspect ratio, 160×160 pixels, 8-color \"high-res mode\" or a 3:1(NTSC)/10:3(PAL) pixel aspect ratio, 80×160 pixels, 10-color \"multicolor mode\".\n:{|\n| VIC-20 palette\n|\n|\n|-\n| Image:CommodoreVIC20 palette sample image.png\n| Image:CommodoreVIC20 palette color test chart.png\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |Image:CommodoreVIC20 palette.png\n|}\nIn the 8-color high-res mode, every 8×8 pixels can have the background color (shared for the entire screen) or a free foreground color, both selectable among the first eight colors of the palette. In the 10-color multicolor mode, a single pixel of every 4×8 block (a character cell) may have any of four colors: the background color, the auxiliary color (both shared for the entire screen and selectable among the entire palette), the same color as the overscan border (also a shared color) or a free foreground color, both selectable among the first eight colors of the palette.\nSimulated images\n:{|\n| Multicolor mode\n| High-res mode\n|-\n| Image:Screen color test CommodoreVIC20 Multicolor.png\n| Image:Screen color test CommodoreVIC20 HighRes.png\n|}\nOn some models of the system, there are nine levels of luminance:\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!| Number — name || Y || Pb (rel.) || Pr (rel.) || Number — name || Y || Pb (rel.) || Pr (rel.)\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#000000;\" | 0 — black || 0 || 0 || 0\n| style=\"color:white; background:#8b5429;\" | 8 — orange || 0.375 || −0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffffff;\" | 1 — white || 1 || 0 || 0\n| style=\"color:white; background:#d59f74;\" | 9 — light orange || 0.625 || −0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#8d3e37;\" | 2 — red || 0.3125 || −0.3826834 || 0.9238795\n| style=\"color:white; background:#b86962;\" | 10 — light red || 0.5 || −0.3826834 || 0.9238795\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#72c1c8;\" | 3 — cyan || 0.6875 || 0.3826834 || −0.9238795\n| style=\"color:black; background:#87d6dd;\" | 11 — light cyan || 0.75 || 0.3826834 || −0.9238795\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#80348b;\" | 4 — purple || 0.3125 || 0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n| style=\"color:white; background:#aa5fb6;\" | 12 — light purple || 0.5 || 0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#55a049;\" | 5 — green || 0.5 || −0.7071068 || −0.7071068\n| style=\"color:black; background:#94e089;\" | 13 — light green || 0.75 || −0.7071068 || −0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#40318d;\" | 6 — blue || 0.25 || 1 || 0\n| style=\"color:white; background:#8071cc;\" | 14 — light blue || 0.5 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#aab95d;\" | 7 — yellow || 0.6875 || −1 || 0\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffffb2;\" | 15 — light yellow || 1 || −1 || 0\n|}\nBut on other models, there are only five levels of luminance:\n:{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!| Number — name || Y || Pb (rel.) || Pr (rel.) || Number — name || Y || Pb (rel.) || Pr (rel.)\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#000000;\" | 0 — black || 0 || 0 || 0\n| style=\"color:white; background:#aa7449;\" | 8 — orange || 0.5 || −0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffffff;\" | 1 — white || 1 || 0 || 0\n| style=\"color:black; background:#eab489;\" | 9 — light orange || 0.75 || −0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#782922;\" | 2 — red || 0.25 || −0.3826834 || 0.9238795\n| style=\"color:white; background:#b86962;\" | 10 — light red || 0.5 || −0.3826834 || 0.9238795\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#87d6dd;\" | 3 — cyan || 0.75 || 0.3826834 || −0.9238795\n| style=\"color:black; background:#c7ffff;\" | 11 — light cyan || 1 || 0.3826834 || −0.9238795\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#aa5fb6;\" | 4 — purple || 0.5 || 0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ea9ff6;\" | 12 — light purple || 0.75 || 0.7071068 || 0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#55a049;\" | 5 — green || 0.5 || −0.7071068 || −0.7071068\n| style=\"color:black; background:#94e089;\" | 13 — light green || 0.75 || −0.7071068 || −0.7071068\n|-\n| style=\"color:white; background:#40318d;\" | 6 — blue || 0.25 || 1 || 0\n| style=\"color:white; background:#8071cc;\" | 14 — light blue || 0.5 || 1 || 0\n|-\n| style=\"color:black; background:#bfce72;\" | 7 — yellow || 0.75 || −1 || 0\n| style=\"color:black; background:#ffffb2;\" | 15 — light yellow || 1 || −1 || 0\n|}\nCommodore 64\nThe MOS Technology VIC-II is used in the Commodore 64 (and Commodore 128 in 40-column mode), and features a 16-color YPbPr composite video palette.

The closest equivalent in more popular and well-known machines would be the Commodore Amiga's 64-color \"Extra Half-Brite\" mode (with 32 explicitly set colors using 5 bitplanes, which are displayed with full or half brightness depending on the bit setting of a 6th plane).\nTwo bits are used for each of Red, Green and Blue and give a similar result to a normal 6-bit RGB palette (as seen with the IBM EGA or Sega Master System); the seventh bit encodes \"brightness\" which has an effect similar to--but more subtle than--the Spectrum, increasing the output of all three channels by half the intensity of the lower bits of the main six (in this way, it does make a genuine 128 colors — rather than 127 colors with \"two blacks\" and only a 7-level grayscale).\nThe layout of the byte that encodes each color is complicated and appears like a Spectrum color nybble transferred to a full byte's width, and an extra RGB bit-triplet then prefixed to it, with the MSB left unused.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+SAM Coupé color palette value bits\n!Bit 7\n!Bit 6\n!Bit 5\n!Bit 4\n!Bit 3\n!Bit 2\n!Bit 1\n!Bit 0\n|-\n| -\n|Green 1\n|Red 1\n|Blue 1\n|Half-Bright\n|Green 0\n|Red 0\n|Blue 0\n|}\nResulting color palette:\n{|\n|+SAM Coupé color palette example images\n| Image:Sample image with SAM Coupé palette.png\n| Image:Colour chart of SAM Coupé hardware palette.png\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | Image:Hardware palette of SAM Coupé.png\n|}\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+SAM Coupé color palette and bitmask\n|-\n| style=\"color: white;
