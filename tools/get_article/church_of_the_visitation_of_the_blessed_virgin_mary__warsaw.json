The church's foundation stone was laid by Janusz I the Old, Duke of Masovia and his wife, Danutė of Lithuania, in 1409. The church was consecrated in 1411. It has been modified, demolished and rebuilt several times. Originally it had one nave, was made of bricks, had a ceiling and an arch presbytery, before the end of the 15th century it was transformed into a three nave basilica.\nThe church's most striking characteristic is the tower, built in 1518. It is recognizable from a great distance and is depicted in the oldest images of Warsaw.\nSt. Mary's Church during Warsaw Uprising, 1944.\nSt. Mary's Church as seen from the bank of Vistula river.\nDuring World War II, the church was severely damaged by German forces - the roof of the nave collapsed and the upper portion of the tower was blown up. It was reconstructed in 1947–1966 to the design by Beata Trylińska.\nBehind the church is small park with a set of steps that lead down to the Vistula and the so named Kościuszko banks of the river. In the square there are outdoor theatre performances and concerts which are organized locally.\nSee also\n* St. Kazimierz Church\n* St. Hyacinth's Church\n* St. John's Cathedral\n* St. Martin's Church\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070228165800/http://vr360.pl/nmp/ Virtual Tour]\n* [http://www.warszawa1939.pl/index.php?r1=przyrynek_kosciol&r3=0 www.warszawa1939.pl]"
