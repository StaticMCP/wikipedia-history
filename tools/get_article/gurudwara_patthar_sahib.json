The shrine is built around a large boulder (pathar) associated with traditions connecting the site to Guru Nanak Dev Ji, and it is a frequently visited religious and tourist site on the Srinagar–Leh/Leh–Kargil route.\nLocation and access\nGurudwara Pathar Sahib lies on the Srinagar–Leh highway (Leh–Kargil road), roughly 20–25&nbsp;km from Leh city, at high altitude on the cold desert plateau of Ladakh. It is accessible by road from Leh and is commonly visited by travellers en route to or from Leh.\nHistory and legend\nThe history of Gurdwara Pathar Sahib dates back to 1517 CE, when Guru Nanak is believed to have visited Ladakh during his journey from Sikkim, Nepal, and Tibet to Punjab via Srinagar. According to local folklore, a demon living in the area attempted to kill Guru Nanak by rolling a large boulder (pathar) down a hill while he was meditating. The rock is said to have softened upon touching Guru Nanak, leaving the impression of his body while he remained unharmed. When the demon struck the stone with his foot, his footprint also became embedded in it. Realizing Guru Nanak’s spiritual power, the demon repented and was forgiven.\nFor centuries, the sacred rock was preserved and venerated by Buddhist Lamas, who referred to Guru Nanak as \"Lama Nanak\" or \"Guru Gompka Maharaj.\" In the 1970s, during the construction of the Leh–Nimmu road, the boulder resurfaced when efforts to remove it were unsuccessful. Following reports of dreams and local testimonies linking the stone with Guru Nanak, the Indian Army preserved the site and constructed the present-day Gurdwara around it.\nManagement and maintenance\nThe shrine is maintained by Indian Army as per the Sikh Rehat Maryada or the code of conduct and conventions for Sikhism. The shrine also hosts Langar daily.\nRecent events\nVisits by public officials and coverage in regional news outlets have highlighted the gurudwara's cultural significance and its role in Ladakh's religious landscape. For example, the Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh paid obeisance at the gurudwara during an official visit in September 2025.\nSee also\n* Sikhism in India\n* Tourism in Ladakh\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.incredibleindia.gov.in/en/ladakh/leh/gurudwara-pathar-sahib Incredible India — Gurudwara Pathar Sahib] (Government of India tourism page)\n* [https://www.jktdc.co.in/Gurudwara-Pathar-Sahib.aspx Jammu & Kashmir Tourism Development Corporation — Gurudwara Pathar Sahib]\n* [https://hillpost.in/2023/08/gurudwara-pathar-sahib-leh-a-symbol-of-unity-in-diversity/120933/ Hill Post — Gurudwara Pathar Sahib, Leh: A Symbol of 'Unity in Diversity']\n* [https://voiceofladakh.in/2025/09/ladakh-lieutenant-governor-visits-gurudwara-pathar-sahib/ Voice of Ladakh — LG visits Gurudwara Pathar Sahib]\n* [https://statetimes.in/lg-kavinder-first-lady-pay-obeisance-at-gurudwara-pathar-sahib/ State Times — LG pays obeisance]"
