In 2012 it was decided to split the neighbouring Waiapu Ward for the 2013 election, with the northern part being combined with Matakaoa Ward to form Matakaoa-Waiapu Ward.\nMatakaoa Ward contained the towns of Tikitiki, Te Araroa, and Hicks Bay. It also contained the East Cape Lighthouse, the most easterly place in mainland New Zealand.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Matakaoa ward\n\n#REDIRECT Matakaoa Ward"
