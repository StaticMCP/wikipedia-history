Although its second single \"Bobbie Ann Mason\" was a Top Ten hit on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in 1995, neither of the album's other singles — \"Save This One for Me\" or the title track — reached Top 40.\nThe album was also released in Spanish under the title Un Rayo de Luz (\"A Ray of Light\"), with Spanish-language versions of most of the songs on Looking for the Light. This version charted at #22 on the Top Latin Albums charts.\nCritical reception\nEntertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Trevino \"mixes cliche-ridden heartbreak songs with muscular two-step\" and citing \"Poor, Broke, Mixed-Up Mess of a Heart\" and \"Save This One for Me\" as standouts. Chris Dickinson gave a three-star review in New Country magazine, comparing Trevino's voice to George Strait's and citing the title track as a \"truly vulnerable\" performance, although he thought that Trevino sounded too young and forced on \"Save This One for Me\" and \"Bobbie Ann Mason\".\nTrack listing\nTrack listing (Un Rayo de Luz)\n#\"Perdí la Partida\"\n#\"Un Rayo de Luz\"\n#*bilingual version\n#\"Tú Para Mi\"\n#\"Eso Me Dijo\"\n#\"Corazón Soñador\"\n#\"Me la Guardan Para Mi\"\n#\"Alivia el Dolor\"\n#\"Tu Eres Mi Verdad\"\n#\"Ella No Podrá Decir Que No Me Vió Llorar\"\n#\"Un Rayo de Luz\"\nPersonnel\nSource:\nTracks 1, 3, 4, 6 - 9, 11\n*Eddie Bayers - drums\n*Mark Casstevens - acoustic guitar\n*Sonny Garrish - steel guitar\n*Rob Hajacos - fiddle\n*Joey Miskulin - accordion on \"I Want a Girl in a Pick-Up Truck\"\n*Michael Rhodes - bass guitar\n*Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins - piano (Tracks 4 & 11)\n*Matt Rollings - piano\n*Brent Rowan - electric guitar\n*John Wesley Ryles - background vocals\n*Rick Trevino - lead vocals\n*Dennis Wilson - background vocals\nTracks 2, 5, 10\n*Paul Franklin - steel guitar\n*John Jorgenson - electric guitar\n*Larry Marrs - bass guitar\n*Tim Mensy - background vocals on \"Looking for the Light\"\n*Steve Nathan - piano\n*John Wesley Ryles - background vocals\n*Blaine Sprouse - fiddle\n*Rick Trevino - lead vocals\n*Steve Turner - drums\n*John Willis - acoustic guitar\n*Dennis Wilson - background vocals\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard)\n| 57\n|}\nReferences"
