If two teams are tied for the most points, then the Trophy goes to the team with the most regulation wins (RW). The Presidents' Trophy has been awarded 37 times to 18 different teams since its inception during the 1985–86 NHL season.\nAs the team with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is normally guaranteed home-ice advantage throughout the entire Stanley Cup playoffs. Winning the award does not assure playoff success, as there have been only eight instances where the Presidents' Trophy winner has gone on to win the Stanley Cup in the same season, while three Presidents' Trophy winners have been defeated in the Stanley Cup Final. However, the team with the Presidents' Trophy has won more than any other playoff seeds of 2-16. The most recent team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season is the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this feat more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.\nHistory\nThe Trophy was introduced at the start of the  by the League's Board of Governors to recognize the best team in the regular season, informally known as the regular season championship. Prior to this, the team that finished in first place when the regular season concluded was allowed to hang a banner reading \"NHL League Champions.\"\nA total of 18 teams have won the Presidents' Trophy. The Detroit Red Wings have won six Presidents' Trophies, the most of any team. The Boston Bruins and New York Rangers are tied for second with four. The Colorado Avalanche and Washington Capitals are tied for third with three. Five teams (Calgary Flames, Chicago Blackhawks, Dallas Stars, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks) are tied for fourth most with two Presidents' Trophy wins apiece. Among these multiple winners, Calgary, Dallas, Detroit, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Washington have won it in consecutive seasons; only Detroit did it consecutively twice. Out of these teams, Edmonton, Calgary, and Dallas have captured a Stanley Cup, along with their second straight Presidents' Trophy.\nIf there are two or more teams tied for first in points in the League, then the NHL's standard tiebreaking procedure is applied, with the first tiebreaker being the team with the most regulation wins (that is, all games won except those won in overtime or in a shootout). During the shortened , both the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights finished tied for first with 82 points in 56 games, with Colorado winning the trophy since they had 35 regulation wins while Vegas had 30. From the  through  seasons, the first tiebreaker was most regulation and overtime wins. Before 2010, the first tiebreaker was the most wins, including both overtime and shootout wins. The most notable of the pre-2010–11 protocol is from the , where both the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red Wings finished tied first with 113 points, with the Sabres winning the Trophy since they had 53 wins, three more than Detroit, who had 50.\nPast trophies\nFrom 1937 to 1967, the same criterion now observed for winning the Presidents' Trophy was used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy. With the modern era expansion in the  and the creation of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. However, no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the entire League during this period, and no trophy at all was awarded based on the results of the regular season from the  through  seasons. A cash bonus of $350,000 was awarded to the winning team with the NHL's best regular season record during these years, to which the Presidents' Trophy was added in . The cash bonus is split amongst the players on the active roster of the winning team.\nFactoring all NHL seasons prior to the introduction of the Presidents' Trophy, the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall 21 times, the most times in League history (although this was most recently accomplished in , before the Trophy was introduced; since its inception, the Canadiens have been Presidents' runners-up three times, in , , and ). Detroit is second with 18 first-overall finishes.\nPlayoff implications\nThe Presidents' Trophy winner is normally guaranteed home-ice advantage throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs. This does not necessarily correlate to success in the playoffs, however. The Trophy has been awarded 37 times, but only eight of the winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup in their respective years, leading to a popular superstition that the Trophy may be cursed. In addition, eight Presidents' Trophy winners have been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, with first-round upsets being common in the NHL compared to other major professional sports. Since the salary cap era of the NHL from 2005–06 onwards the first-placed NHL team has had the lowest probability of winning the playoff championship, compared to the other three North American major professional sports leagues (NBA, MLB, and NFL).\nNHL broadcaster Darren Eliot attributes the apparent lack of playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, the goal is to advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who might have a hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.\nIan Cooper, writing for the Toronto Star, noted that \"of 11 Presidents' Trophy winners to lose in the first two rounds, seven came from divisions that were among the league's weaker half ... If a team dominates a weak division, its shortcomings should become apparent once it faces stiffer competition from the rest of the conference\". Jonathan Weiss, writing for the Bleacher Report in 2010, also noted that of the teams between 1982 and 2009 that led the League in points during the regular season, 12 of them (45 per cent) reached the Cup Finals, while of the other 405 teams during that same time period, only 42 (10 per cent) advanced to the final round, concluding that \"the team that leads the NHL in regular season points is four to five times more likely than any other team in the playoffs to make it into the Stanley Cup finals, and seven to eight times more likely to win the Cup\".\nThe 1995–96 Red Wings were considered a \"cursed\" team, as their record-setting season was cut short by the newly relocated Colorado Avalanche in the Conference Finals, sparking a particularly vicious rivalry between the two teams in subsequent seasons. In the 1996–97 season, the Avalanche were the defending Cup champions and won the Presidents' Trophy but lost the Conference Finals which was a rematch against the Red Wings, the Red Wings went on to win the Cup. The Red Wings would go onto the defeat the Presidents' Trophy-winning Dallas Stars in 1998, en route to the Red Wings' second straight Cup win. Thereafter, in three of four seasons, the Presidents' Trophy winning team went on to win the Stanley Cup (Stars in 1999, Avalanche in 2001, and Red Wings in 2002).\nSince the Blackhawks won the Presidents' Trophy and Stanley Cup in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, the \"curse\" has been more pronounced. The 2018–19 Tampa Bay Lightning were swept in the first round by the Wild Card Columbus Blue Jackets after a dominant season in which they tied the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings' record for regular season wins, becoming the first Presidents' Trophy winner to suffer this fate. Adding to the ignominy was the Blue Jackets' previous lack of postseason success, as their sweep of the Lightning was their first playoff series victory in franchise history, with only four previous playoff qualifications. By contrast, the Lightning had made several deep playoff runs in the previous seasons (including a Cup Finals appearance in 2015). Over the next three years, the Lightning did not win the Presidents' Trophy but nevertheless won two consecutive Stanley Cups while reaching a third consecutive Stanley Cup Final. For the 2022–23 Boston Bruins; after setting new records for single-season wins and points, they proceeded to lose in the first round in seven games to the Florida Panthers after having led the series three games to one. The Panthers were incidentally the previous season's Presidents' Trophy winners, where their 2021–22 season ended when they were swept in the second round by the Lightning (en route to the Lightning's third consecutive Finals appearance).\nOnly four times in the history of the Presidents' Trophy has a team missed the playoffs the season after winning the award: the New York Rangers did it twice, who won the Trophy in the  season and missed the playoffs in  (and then rebounded to win both the Presidents' Trophy and Stanley Cup in ), however, they did it again when they won the Trophy in the  season and missed the playoffs in ; the Buffalo Sabres, who won the Trophy in the  season and missed the playoffs in , the Boston Bruins, who won the Trophy in the  season and missed the playoffs in  despite having a winning record.\nWinners\nPresidents' Trophy Banner from the 2002–03 season|thumb]]\nBold Team with the most points ever accumulated in a season during the trophy's existence.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Points\n!Margin\n!\n!Playoff result\n|-\n|\n|Edmonton Oilers\n|119\n|9\n|1\n|Lost division finals (CGY)\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|Edmonton Oilers\n|106\n|6\n|2\n|Won Stanley Cup (PHI)*\n|-\n|\n|Calgary Flames\n|105\n|2\n|1\n|Lost division finals (EDM)\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|Calgary Flames\n|117\n|2\n|2\n|Won Stanley Cup (MTL)*\n|- style=\"background:#ffcc66;\"\n|\n|Boston Bruins\n|101\n|2\n|1\n|Lost Stanley Cup Final (EDM)^\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|Chicago Blackhawks\n|106\n|1\n|1\n|Lost division semifinals (MNS)#\n|-\n|\n|New York Rangers\n|105\n|7\n|1\n|Lost division finals (PIT)\n|-\n|\n|Pittsburgh Penguins\n|119\n|10\n|1\n|Lost division finals (NYI)\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|New York Rangers\n|112\n|6\n|2\n|Won Stanley Cup (VAN)*\n|- style=\"background:#ffcc66;\"\n|\n|Detroit Red Wings\n|070\n|5\n|1\n|Lost Stanley Cup Final (NJD)^\n|-\n|\n|Detroit Red Wings\n|131\n|27\n|2\n|Lost conference finals (COL)\n|-\n|\n|Colorado Avalanche\n|107\n|3\n|1\n|Lost conference finals (DET)\n|-\n|\n|Dallas Stars\n|109\n|2\n|1\n|Lost conference finals (DET)\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|Dallas Stars\n|114\n|9\n|2\n|Won Stanley Cup (BUF)*\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|St. Louis Blues\n|114\n|6\n|1\n|Lost conference quarterfinals (SJS)#\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|Colorado Avalanche\n|118\n|7\n|2\n|Won Stanley Cup (NJD)*\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|Detroit Red Wings\n|116\n|15\n|3\n|Won Stanley Cup (CAR)*\n|-\n|\n|Ottawa Senators\n|113\n|2\n|1\n|Lost conference finals (NJD)\n|-\n|\n|Detroit Red Wings\n|109\n|3\n|4\n|Lost conference semifinals (CGY)\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |Season cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|Detroit Red Wings\n|124\n|11\n|5\n|Lost conference quarterfinals (EDM)#\n|-\n|\n|Buffalo Sabres\n|113\n|0 (3 wins)\n|1\n|Lost conference finals (OTT)\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n|115\n|7\n|6\n|Won Stanley Cup (PIT)*\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|San Jose Sharks\n|117\n|1\n|1\n|Lost conference quarterfinals (ANA)#\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|Washington Capitals\n|121\n|8\n|1\n|Lost conference quarterfinals (MTL)#\n|- style=\"background:#ffcc66;\"\n|\n|Vancouver Canucks\n|117\n|10\n|1\n|Lost Stanley Cup Final (BOS)^\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|Vancouver Canucks\n|111\n|2\n|2\n|Lost conference quarterfinals (LAK)#\n|- style=\"background:#ccfebb;\"\n|\n|Chicago Blackhawks\n|77\n|5\n|2\n|Won Stanley Cup (BOS)*\n|-\n|\n|Boston Bruins\n|117\n|1\n|2\n|Lost second round (MTL)\n|-\n|\n|New York Rangers\n|113\n|3\n|3\n|Lost conference finals (TBL)\n|-\n|\n|Washington Capitals\n|120\n|11\n|2\n|Lost second round (PIT)\n|-\n|\n|Washington Capitals\n|118\n|7\n|3\n|Lost second round (PIT)\n|-\n|\n|Nashville Predators\n|117\n|3\n|1\n|Lost second round (WPG)\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|Tampa Bay Lightning\n|128\n|21\n|1\n|Lost first round (CBJ)#\n|-\n|\n|Boston Bruins\n|100\n|6\n|3\n|Lost second round (TBL)\n|-\n|\n|Colorado Avalanche\n|82\n|0 (5 regulation wins)\n|3\n|Lost second round (VGK)\n|-\n|\n|Florida Panthers\n|122\n|3\n|1\n|Lost second round (TBL)\n|- style=\"background:#ffbbbb;\"\n|\n|Boston Bruins\n|135\n|22\n|4\n|Lost first round (FLA)#\n|-\n|\n|New York Rangers\n|114\n|1\n|4\n|Lost conference finals (FLA)\n|-\n|\n|Winnipeg Jets\n|116\n|5\n|1\n|Lost second round (DAL)\n|}\nEarlier best records\nFor reference, the following are teams that finished with the best records in the NHL for each season between  and .\nNHL vs. PCHA/WCHL/WHL Stanley Cup era (1917–1926)\nPrior to 1926–27, the Stanley Cup was then awarded as a \"World Series\" trophy between the champions of the NHL and a rival league (first the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, then the Western Canada Hockey League).
