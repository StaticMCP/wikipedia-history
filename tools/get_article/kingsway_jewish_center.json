The synagogue features a series of 18 windows designed by abstract expressionist artist Adolph Gottlieb.  It is a four-story steel frame building with a brick faced facade that steps back from the property line as it rises.  The school building is a simple three story building with long rectangular windows and several entrances.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
