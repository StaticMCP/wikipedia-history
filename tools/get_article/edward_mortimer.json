He was Distinguished Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, from 2013.

Mortimer was a scholar at Eton College and studied history at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1962 to 1965, graduating with a congratulatory first, and was a Prize Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, from 1965 to 1972. In 1963, during his time at Balliol, he was part of the team that reached the final of the first series of University Challenge, losing to Leicester University.\nCareer\nBefore university Mortimer went to Senegal to do Voluntary Service Overseas, and taught English for a short period in a lycée in St Louis. After leaving Oxford he went to Paris to do research for a PhD, but set it aside in 1967 when he was hired as a reporter in The Times Paris office. He returned to Oxford in 1970 to write a book on the French Communist Party. During his time in Paris he documented the student riots and the last days of Charles de Gaulle's presidency. Left-leaning in his politics, he later reflected that \"For me, May 1968 was certainly the high point of the Sixties.\" He went on to become a columnist and leader writer for The Times and foreign affairs editor for the Financial Times. Between 2007 and 2012 he was Senior Vice President of the Salzburg Global Seminar and was a member of the Advisory Council of Independent Diplomat.\nPersonal life\nMortimer married painter and sculptor Elizabeth Zanetti in Exeter in 1968; together they had four children.
