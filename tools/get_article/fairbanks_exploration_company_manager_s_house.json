It is a three-story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a post-and-beam foundation.  An ell extends from the center of the rear.  The house was built in 1935-36 by the Fairbanks Exploration Company to house its local vice president and general manager.  It is the first Colonial Revival house built in Fairbanks, and is one of the state's finest examples of the style.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska\nReferences"
