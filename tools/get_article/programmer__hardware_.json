If the device is not a standard DIP packaging, a plug-in adapter board, which converts the footprint with another socket, is used.\nCable & port\nIn some cases, a programmer connects to a device via a cable to a connection port on the device. This is sometimes called on-board programming, in-circuit programming, or in-system programming.\nTransfer\nData is transferred from the programmer to the device as signals via connecting pins.\nSome devices have a serial interface\nfor receiving data (including JTAG interface).\nOther devices communicate on parallel pins, followed by a programming pulse with a higher voltage for programming the data into the device.\nUsually, a programmer is controlled via a connected personal computer through a parallel port,\nUSB port,\nor LAN interface.\nA program on the controlling computer interacts with the programmer to perform operations such as configure install parameters and program the device,\nTypes\nThere are four general types of programmers:\n# Automated programmers often have multiple programming sites/sockets for mass production. Sometimes used with robotic pick and place handlers with on-board sites to support high volume and complex output such as laser marking, 3D inspection, tape input/output, etc.\n# Development programmers usually have a single programming site; used for first article development and small-series production.\n# Pocket programmers for development and field service.\n# Specialized programmers for certain circuit types only, such as FPGA, microcontroller, and EEPROM programmers.\nHistory\nfor MCU\" &Flash memory Programmer]]\nRegarding old PROM programmers, as the many programmable devices have different voltage requirements, every pin driver must be able to apply different voltages in a range of 025 Volts.\nBut according to the progress of memory device technology, recent flash memory programmers do not need high voltages.\nIn the early days of computing, booting mechanism was a mechanical devices usually consisted of switches and LEDs. It means the programmer'' was not an equipment but a human, who entered machine codes one by one, by setting the switches in a series of \"on\" and \"off\" positions. These positions of switches corresponded to the machine codes, similar to today's assembly language.262}}\nNowadays, EEPROMs are used for bootstrapping mechanism as BIOS, without the need to operate mechanical switches for programming.\nManufacturers\nFor each vendor's web site, refer to \"External links\" section.\n* Batronix GmbH &amp; Co.
