Fox televised the ceremony within the United States. Jane Lynch hosted the Emmys for the first time. The Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held on September 10.\nThe nominations were announced live on Thursday, July 14, 2011, at 5:40&nbsp;a.m. PDT (12:40 UTC) at the Leonard H. Goldenson Theatre in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. The nominations were announced by Melissa McCarthy of Mike & Molly and Joshua Jackson of Fringe.\nThe biggest winner of the night was ABC's Modern Family. The series ended the event with five wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series for the second consecutive year. For the fourth time, the Outstanding Drama Series category was won by AMC's Mad Men. It is also the third series to win four times consecutively in that category. Downton Abbey walked away with the award for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie, with four wins overall.\nThis year's ceremony was watched by 12.4 million people, down 8% from last year's show. The ceremony received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performance of Lynch as the host but criticizing the overall quality of the production, particularly the presenters and the orchestra.\nBeginning this year, the Outstanding Miniseries and Outstanding Television Movie categories were merged. This was due to the continuing decline in the number of miniseries being produced; the previous two ceremonies only had two miniseries nominated. The merge was short-lived however when the separate categories returned, beginning in 2014.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Modern Family (ABC)'\n** 30 Rock (NBC)\n** The Big Bang Theory (CBS)\n** Glee (Fox)\n** The Office (NBC)\n** Parks and Recreation (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Mad Men (AMC)'\n** Boardwalk Empire (HBO)\n** Dexter (Showtime)\n** Friday Night Lights (DirecTV)\n** Game of Thrones (HBO)\n** The Good Wife (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** The Colbert Report (Comedy Central)\n** Conan (TBS)\n** Late Night with Jimmy Fallon (NBC)\n** Real Time with Bill Maher (HBO)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Downton Abbey (PBS)'\n** Cinema Verite (HBO)\n** The Kennedys (ReelzChannel)\n** Mildred Pierce (HBO)\n** The Pillars of the Earth (Starz)\n** Too Big to Fail (HBO)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" colspan=\"2\" |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** Dancing with the Stars (ABC)\n** Project Runway (Lifetime)\n** So You Think You Can Dance (Fox)\n** Top Chef (Bravo)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Jim Parsons – The Big Bang Theory as Dr. Sheldon Cooper (CBS)'\n** Alec Baldwin – 30 Rock as Jack Donaghy (NBC)\n** Steve Carell – The Office as Michael Scott (NBC)\n** Louis C.K. – Louie as Louie (FX)\n** Johnny Galecki – The Big Bang Theory as Dr. Leonard Hofstadter (CBS)\n** Matt LeBlanc – Episodes as himself (Showtime)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Melissa McCarthy – Mike & Molly as Molly Flynn (CBS)'\n** Edie Falco – Nurse Jackie as Jackie Peyton, RN (Showtime)\n** Tina Fey – 30 Rock as Liz Lemon (NBC)\n** Laura Linney – The Big C as Cathy Jamison (Showtime)\n** Martha Plimpton – Raising Hope as Virginia Chance (Fox)\n** Amy Poehler – Parks and Recreation as Leslie Knope (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Kyle Chandler – Friday Night Lights as Eric Taylor (DirecTV)'\n** Steve Buscemi – Boardwalk Empire as Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson (HBO)\n** Michael C.

The segment was extended for this ceremony, as executive producer Mark Burnett stated that \"it [didn't] need to be a bummer... It can be a celebration\".\n* Cliff Robertson\n* Elizabeth Taylor\n* Anne Francis\n* James MacArthur\n* Peter Falk\n* Harold Gould\n* Stanley Frazen\n* James Arness\n* Janet MacLachlan\n* Madelyn Pugh Davis\n* Steve Landesberg\n* Blake Edwards\n* Betty Garrett\n* John Cossette\n* Bill Erwin\n* Barbara Billingsley\n* Leslie Nielsen\n* Tom Bosley\n* Reza Badiyi\n* Leonard Stern\n* Ryan Dunn\n* Denise Cramsey\n* Frank Potenza\n* Bob Banner\n* Andy Whitfield\n* Fred Steiner\n* Jill Clayburgh\n* John Dye\n* Jack LaLanne\n* Al Masini\n* Sada Thompson\n* Laura Ziskin\n* Don Meredith\n* Sherwood Schwartz\n* Bubba Smith\n* Stephen J. Cannell\nMemorable moments\nOpening number\nThe show opened with Jane Lynch performing a pre-taped opening number which showed the TV world as being contained inside of a large building, parodying Rear Window. Lynch walked through the building and entered the universe of shows including The Big Bang Theory, Mad Men, Parks and Recreation, MythBusters and Glee (the show of which Lynch is a cast member) among others. Lynch's lyrics satirized elements of each show and television in general. The ceremony culminated with Lynch entering the theatre and performing a short dance number, which ended with a fireworks show. The opening number received a standing ovation.\nEmmytones\nThroughout the night, the \"Emmytones\" introduced each genre in the form of a short jingle. They consisted of Zachary Levi (\"Chuck\"), Cobie Smulders (\"How I Met Your Mother\"), Kate Flannery (\"The Office\"), Wilmer Valderrama (\"Royal Pains\"), Joel McHale (\"Community\") and nominee Taraji P. Henson (\"Person of Interest\"). The Emmytones received mixed to negative reviews, with many critics citing them as unimportant and others calling them \"time fillers.\"\nAward for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\nFor the presentation of the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, each of the nominees went up to the stage in the style of a beauty pageant. The orchestra played music similar to that of a pageant as the nominees went to the stage. The winner ended up being Melissa McCarthy, who mentioned that this was \"her first and best pageant ever.\" Both the producers and the nominees in the category gave nominee Amy Poehler credit for conceiving the idea. Nominee Martha Plimpton was also credited.\nThe presentation was well received critically with many critics regarding it to be the best part of the night. Once all the nominees reached the stage, they received a standing ovation. The pairing of Rob Lowe and Sofía Vergara, who presented the category, was also praised critically.\nCriticism about the orchestra\nFor the 2011 ceremony, the producers enlisted Hype Music to provide the orchestrations. These orchestrations were universally hated by reviewers. The band played music from the Hype Music roster of artists as the winners walked to the stage, breaking the tradition of their respective program's theme song being played as they accepted their awards. The decision to do this received an overwhelmingly negative response from critics and enraged Emmy Award enthusiasts, many of whom felt as though a tradition observed since the 1st Primetime Emmy Awards had been broken. One reviewer even called this decision \"one of the biggest mistakes in the ceremony's history.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2011 Emmys.com list of 2011 Nominees & Winners]\n* [http://www.emmys.com Academy of Television Arts and Sciences website]\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110621012308/http://www.emmys.tv/news/2011/ballot-listings-63rd-primetime-emmy-awards-now-available 2011 Emmy Nomination Ballots]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130820200542/http://www.emmys.tv/sites/emmys.tv/files/writing2011_0.pdf 2011 Emmy Nominating Ballot for Writing]"
