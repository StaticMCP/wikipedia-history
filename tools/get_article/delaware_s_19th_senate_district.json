It has been represented by Republican Brian Pettyjohn since 2012.\nGeography\nDistrict 19 covers central Sussex County, including the communities of Georgetown, Bridgeville, and Long Neck. It borders the state of Maryland.\nLike all districts in the state, the 19th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 20th, 35th, 36th, 37th, 39th, 40th, and 41st districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 19th district holds elections in presidential years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2020\n}}\n2016\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Trump 58.1 – 40.6%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Trump 61.4 – 35.0%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Wade 58.2 – 40.2%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Romney 55.5 – 43.1%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 51.9 – 41.1%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 56.0 – 41.7%\n|}\nReferences"
