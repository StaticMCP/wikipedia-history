Pole agreed to allow Collett to explore such a design, subject to getting tractive effort above .\nCollett designed the \"King\" Class to the maximum dimensions of the original GWR  broad-gauge engineering used to develop its mainline, resulting in the largest loading gauge of all the pre-nationalisation railways in the UK, with a maximum height allowance of . Consequently, this restricted them as to where they could operate under both GWR and British Railways ownership. To accommodate the largest possible boiler, and to conform with Pole's requested tractive effort requirement, the \"King\" class were equipped with smaller  main driving wheels than the \"Castle\" class. This resulted in both the GWR's highest-powered locomotive design, but most importantly a higher tractive effort than the \"Castle\". This combination allowed the \"King\" class to pull the now required higher-weight 13+ coach express trains from London to Bristol and onwards to the West Country, at a higher-speed timetable average than the \"Castle\".\nWith the class to be originally named after notable cathedrals, in light of the invitation to feature in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's centenary celebrations, the GWR decided to make them more notable by naming the class after British Kings.\nOperational career\nAs the first of the class, No. 6000 was specifically named after the then monarch of the United Kingdom King George V. Built at Swindon Works and completed in June 1927, following a period of running in, the locomotive was shipped to the United States in August 1927, to feature in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's centenary celebrations. During the celebrations it was presented with a bell and a plaque, and these are carried to this day. This led to it being affectionately known as \"The Bell\". The bell carries the inscription:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: auto\"\n|Presented to\nLocomotive King George V\nby the\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company\nin commemoration of its\ncentenary celebration\n24 September – 15 October 1927\n|}\nAfter returning from the US it was allocated to Old Oak Common. Moved by British Railways to Bristol in 1950, it was returned to Old Oak Common in 1959, and withdrawn by the Western Region of British Railways in December 1962 after covering .\nPreservation\nThe locomotive was officially preserved as part of the national collection. It was restored to main line running order at the Bulmer's Railway Centre in Hereford. Operationally based at Hereford, in 1971 it became the very first steam locomotive to break the British Railways mainline steam ban that had been in place since the completion of the Fifteen Guinea Special in 1968. Its restoration to main line service and subsequent operation is often credited with opening the door for the return of steam to the mainlines of the UK.\nThe engine took part in the GWR150 celebrations in 1985 hauling railtours, one trip which took place on 7 Apr was \"The Great Western Limited\" which was running from London Paddington to Plymouth via Bristol was booked to be worked by No. 6000 while double heading with No. 7819 Hinton Manor. Both engines were to double head the train from Bristol to Plymouth on the outward journey but No. 6000 was failed in Taunton with a hot box and had to be taken off the train. No. 7819 Hinton Manor continued alone with the train but that would too later be failed in Exeter with a hot box.\nAfter years of running, a costly overhaul of the locomotive was declined by the National Railway Museum. In part, this was due to the fact that, since its second renovation, a second class-member King Edward I had been restored for mainline operation. In addition, the higher ballast beds in place on the Western Region since the early 1980s, to allow for the high speed running of the InterCity 125 train sets, have greatly reduced the running-level loading gauge of the former GWR mainline – especially under bridges – to , so enabling mainline running of a \"King\" class now requires a reduction in the height of the original GWR-built chimney, cab and safety valve bonnets by , as had been done on the restoration of King Edward I. No. 6000 is the only one of the three preserved \"King\" class locomotives to retain its original-built full-height fittings.\nAfter closure of the Bulmer's Steam Centre in 1990, No. 6000 moved to the Swindon \"Steam\" Railway Museum. In 2008, it swapped places with No. 92220 Evening Star, and became resident at the National Railway Museum. In late 2015, No. 6000, along with City of Truro, returned to STEAM – Museum of the Great Western Railway (located at the site of the old railway works in Swindon), and both were put on display in preparation for Swindon 175 (in 2016), celebrating 175 years since the inception of Swindon as a railway town. Both locomotives are expected to remain at Swindon for 5 years.\nGallery\nImage:GWR King George V 04 db.jpg|As was displayed as a static exhibit at the Swindon 'Steam' Railway Museum\nImage:GWR King George V 16 db.jpg|Close-up of the bell\nImage:GWR King George V 06 db.jpg|Nameplate\nImage:GWR King George V 08 db.jpg|Part of the backhead\nimage:King George V at National Railway Museum.jpg|King George V at National Railway Museum, York.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=45396 Pathe Newsreel of King George V in 1968 ]"
