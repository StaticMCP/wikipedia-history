The party emerged from a split within the Socialist Party (SP).\nHistory\nThe creation of the RSP is the result of an internal ideological conflict within the SP. This conflict took place between the party leadership and the left wing of the party, formed by, among others, ROOD (the former youth organization of the SP), Communist Platform (CP) and the Marxist Forum. This conflict started over the incompatibility of the victory of the CP with the victory of the SP. From October 2020, members of CP were expelled. Subsequently, in November 2020, ties with the youth organization ROOD were suspended, because the chairman and the board member had met with CP. In October 2021, ROOD and the Marxist Forum were labelled as 'political parties' by the party board, which prohibited dual membership. This amounted to the expulsion of several dozen members.\nThe subsequent suspensions of the local boards of the Utrecht and Rotterdam branches prompted a number of members to issue a statement. It is stated, among other things, that the party \"(…) suffers from a serious democratic deficit and a toxic leadership culture,\" and that \"the party leadership (…) has launched an attack against socialism in these cities.\"\nOn 25 September 2022, 'The Socialists' - as the RSP was then called - organized a first national conference with 140 attendees. It was decided to work on a countrywide socialist party. When it was founded 'The Socialists' was supported by councillors in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Zaanstad, Assen and a member of the provincial council from Utrecht. In addition, ROOD called on its members to join the new party.\nAt a party congress held in March 2025, it was subsequently decided to continue under the name Revolutionary Socialist Party.\nIdeology\nThe party is largely based on the works of Karl Marx and his ideological descendants without giving a strong preference to specific currents within it. The party is explicitly non-Stalinist, and due to its history as a minority group, places a strong emphasis on internal democracy.\nThe RSP's programme is divided into two parts: a maximum programme outlining its long-term goals, and a minimum programme detailing the short-term steps aimed at achieving those long-term objectives.\nThe RSP advocates for a radical democratization of society, including the economy. The party identifies as anti-racist, feminist, environmentally conscious, internationalist, and supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.\nMaximum programme\nAs a long-term goal, the party names \"(...) a communist society in the Netherlands, Europe and the world. In such a society, economic production will no longer be driven by the chaos of market forces and profit-seeking, but everyone will contribute according to their ability and everyone will take based on need. It is a stateless society, in which class rule has ceased to exist and in which the role of democracy and the other functions of the state have been absorbed by society as a whole\". They also name socialism as a compass towards communism, explicitly stating that they have no blueprint for this.\nActivities\nIn 2024, ROOD, in collaboration with the RSP, started a campaign against NATO in the run-up to the NATO summit in The Hague in 2025. As part of the campaign, ROOD and the RSP will give lectures, take action at defence locations and spread the anti-imperialist message. As part of this campaign, ROOD, together with the RSP and other organizations, is organizing a counter-summit on June 21 and 22.\nOn 1 May 2025, RSP members participated in a Labour Day demonstration in Amsterdam, alongside ROOD. They advocated for promoting class struggle, emphasizing the need for revolutionary action beyond parliamentary means.\nIn May 2025, RSP activists squatted a building in the Mariastraat during a housing demonstration in Utrecht in protest against vacancy.\nLocal\nAt the time of writing, the RSP has a party organization with branches in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Eindhoven, Overijssel, South Limburg, the Northern Netherlands, Arnhem, Nijmegen, West Brabant and Wageningen.\nElection results\nAfter the split, which took place just before the 2022 municipal elections, three of the then local initiatives participated in elections under various names. This is the only time so far that the RSP or groups around it participated in elections, no seats were won.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2022 Dutch municipal elections\n!Municipality\n!#\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n|Amsterdam\n|1.427\n|0,5%\n|0\n|-\n|Rotterdam\n|2.034\n|1,0%\n|0\n|-\n|Utrecht\n|694\n|0,4%\n|0\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://rsp.nu/ Website Revolutionary Socialist Party] (rsp.nu)"
