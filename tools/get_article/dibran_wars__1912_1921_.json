The city of Debar (Albanian: Dibra), an Albanian populated city in north-western Macedonia, and its inhabitants, the Dibrans, posed difficulties for the Serbian Kingdom, rising up in several uprisings.\nEvents\nDuring the years of 1912-21, around 5 uprisings of the Dibran forces happened against the Serbian and eventually Yugoslav forces. Chronologically the uprisings were:\nUprising in Lumë\nThe Uprising of Luma was the first war involving the armed Dibran forces. The armed uprising lasted between 30 October to 6 December 1912 and took place in the Luma region of Northern Albania. The Albanian troops were stationed in the Gjakova highland highlands (Morinë Pass - Prush Pass); Has (Planejë - Gorozhup); Zhur Pass; Vërrin (Billushë - Jeshkovë - Lybeqevë - Lez); Sharr mountains (Gur i Zi) and Opojë (Llapushnik gorge). To prevent the Serbian troops from crossing to the White Drin, the Albanians organized sveral ambushes in the villages of Shalqin, Domaj, and Gjinaj. The Lumë forces were made up of around 4,000 people, while the Dibra forces totaled to about 600. The Lumë forces then captured the Lumë tower, winning the battle. Albanian forces in the evening of 17 November, attacked the carriages of Serbian convoys that were attempting to withdraw to Prizren. During these attacks, the Serbians lost many soldiers and materials. The fighting in the mountains was described in the memoirs of Kosta Novaković, a Serbian soldier who participated in the battle. According to Ottoman reports, 6 Serbian battalions were killed, while according to a British report 9 battalions were killed.\nWar in Dibra (1913)\nThe Conference of London gave most Albanian land to Serbia, leaving the Albanian population unhappy. The Serbian army would pass through Dibra regularly and repressed the local population. Due to this and the recent placing of thousands of Serbian soldiers on the border with Albania, the Albanian Dibrans would revolt against the Kingdom of Serbia. Dibran forces liberated the largest parts of Upper and Lower Dibra and lands in the western parts of the Black Drin river on 20 September 1913 and then liberated Peshkopi, completely destroying an entire Serbian battalion. Fighting continued from the Castle of Doda all the way to Trebisht. On 21 September a group of 6000 Albanian Dibrans surrounded a group of 5000 Serbian soldiers and liberated Greater Dibra. Fighting continued on 22 September in Mavrovl, Gostivar, and Kërçovë, with the latter being liberated and then\nthe entire city of Dibra was captured by Albanian forces. On the 26th of September Dibran forces captured Mavrovl, Gostivar, and Lapushnik and began to march to Struga. By October 1913, Serbian forces had informed the Great Powers that they had removed their forces from the Albanian border.\nWar in Dibra (1915)\nDuring the Great Retreat of the first World War, Serbian soldiers retreating through Macedonia began to march to Peshkopia, despite them allegedly guaranteeing to not attack Albanian populated land. They were attacked by Albanian Dibrans and were swiftly defeated in the Battle of Kaush.\nLura Massacre\nThe Lura Massacre was a massacre perpetrated by Austrian soldiers between July 10 and 28, 1916. During the massacre, Austrian forces killed 44 Albanian men and women in the areas of Reç, Dardhë, and Lurë. The massacre had vengeful intentions according to the Austrian soldiers as Albanian Dibrans attacked a group of 10 Austrian soldiers near Gjurrë-Reç on July 10th of the same year.\nWar in Dibra (1920)\nDuring the time of the Koplik War high ranking Albanians formed the Assembly of Arras, where it would be decided that a military force would be created led by Elez Isufi, Jashar Erebara, Ramiz Daci, and many other Albanian warriors. This army sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav army in Llasen, telling them to withdraw from the region of Dibra in 24 hours or they were going to declare war. The Yugoslav army amassed to 10 battalions and outnumbered the Albanian fighters. After the ultimatum not being accepted, the Albanian fighters began their attack on Yugoslav forces on 13 August 1920 attacking strategic points. Dibran forces defeated the Yugoslav army in Luzni and again while being led by Jusuf Xhelili (Elez Isufi's grandson) in the Hills of Shumbat leading to 100 Yugoslav soldiers being killed and more than 600 captured as prisoners of war. Albanian Dibrans also started attacking Yugoslav forces and checkpoints near Peshkopi forcing the Yugoslav forces to withdraw from their \"strategic line\". On 17 August, Dibran forces liberated the city of Dibra and the Radika Gorge. Afterwards they were also able to liberate Peshkopi. The war ended in September of the same year, with Yugoslav forces momentarily retreating from Ohrid and the Dibra region to Gostivar. 1000 were killed and another 2000 were captured, while Albanian casualties were around 200-300.\nBattle of Gëlqere Pass (1921)\nDuring the Albanian-Yugoslav border war (1921), the Yugoslav army was attempting to capture the strategic mountain passes of Buall and Murrë together with Lanë-Lura, as this would give them an \"easier\" passageway to Durrës. They would position 5400 soldiers in this region and began their march before they were met by a group of 400 Albanian soldiers commanded by Ali Riza together with 700 Dibran volunteers commanded by Elez Isufi. The armies met in Gëlqere Pass on 26 October and the Battle lasted until 29 October. In the end the Albanian forces would emerge victorious pushing the Yugoslav forces outside of the region. By the end of the battle there would be many Yugoslav casualties, while 34 Albanian soldiers would be killed. The battle is also known as the Battle of Lanë-Lura.\nSee also\n*Koplik War\n*Vlora War\n*Albanian-Yugoslav border war (1921)\n*Kachak Movement\n*June Revolution (Albania)\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\n*"
