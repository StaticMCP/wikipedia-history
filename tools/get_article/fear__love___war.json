It was released on September 11, 2001, through Loud Records. Recording sessions took place at 36 Chambers Studio in New York City. Production was handled primary by member 4th Disciple, as well as Falling Down, Mike \"Trauma\" D and Rebel Dainja, with the RZA and Divine surviving as executive producers. It features guest appearances from Frukwan, Lord Superb, Polite, Prodigal Sunn, U-God and Madam Scheez. The album features the singles \"Feel It\" b/w \"Militant\" and \"Street Monopoly\" b/w \"Monster\".\nWhile the album did not sell as well as the group's first two efforts, it received some critical acclaim, partly due to more mature and personal lyrical content, providing balance to the group's dark production, Five-Percenter militancy, and violent combat imagery. The album is now out of print.\nTrack listing\n| extra2 = 4th Disciple\n| length2 = 3:53\n| title3 = Militant\n| note3 = featuring U-God\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = 4th Disciple\n| length3 = 3:20\n| title4 = Originators\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = Falling Down\n| length4 = 3:09\n| title5 = Skit\n| length5 = 0:46\n| title6 = Sweatshop\n| note6 = featuring Frukwan and Madam Scheez\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 = 4th Disciple\n| length6 = 4:06\n| title7 = Street Monopoly\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = Falling Down\n| length7 = 3:55\n| title8 = Afterhours Part 1\n| writer8 = Bogard\n| extra8 = 4th Disciple\n| length8 = 1:01\n| title9 = Trilogy\n| note9 = featuring Prodigal Sunn\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = 4th Disciple\n| length9 = 3:13\n| title10 = Feel It\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 = 4th Disciple\n| length10 = 4:14\n| title11 = Skit\n| length11 = 1:17\n| title12 = Whatever We Want\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = 4th Disciple\n| length12 = 4:00\n| title13 = Skit\n| length13 = 0:34\n| title14 = Monster\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = Falling Down\n| length14 = 3:38\n| title15 = The Hit\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = 4th Disciple\n| length15 = 3:53\n| title16 = One To Grow On\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = 4th Disciple\n| length16 = 2:46\n| title17 = Skit\n| length17 = 0:36\n| title18 = Day One\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 = Rebel Dainja\n| length18 = 4:17\n| title19 = Spoken Word\n| length19 = 1:21\n| title20 = Nonchalantly\n| writer20 =\n| extra20 = Mike \"Trauma\" D\n| length20 = 4:35\n| title21 = The Rule\n| note21 = featuring Polite\n| writer21 =\n| extra21 = 4th Disciple\n| length21 = 3:28\n| title22 = Lady Sings The Blues\n| writer22 =\n| extra22 = Mike \"Trauma\" D\n| length22 = 4:31\n| total_length = 1:01:18\n}}\n;Sample credits\n* \"Day One\" contains a sample of \"Dicitencello Vuje\", written by Rodolfo Falvo and Enzo Fusco and performed by Mario Lanza.\nPersonnel\n*Terrance \"9th Prince\" Hamlin – performer (tracks: 2-4, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22)\n*Samuel \"Beretta 9\" Murray – performer (tracks: 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 16, 20, 21)\n*Domingo \"Dom Pachino\" Del Valle – performer (tracks: 3, 7, 10, 12, 14, 18, 20-22)\n*Rodney \"Islord\" Stevenson – performer (tracks: 2, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, 22)\n*Jeryl \"Killa Sin\" Grant – performer (tracks: 7, 12, 14, 21)\n*Jamal \"ShoGun Assasson\" Alexander – performer (tracks: 3, 15, 16)\n*Selwyn \"4th Disciple\" Bougard – performer (tracks: 15, 16), producer (tracks: 2, 3, 6, 8-10, 12, 15, 16, 21)\n*Jamel \"Superb\" Cummings – performer (track 2)\n*Lamont \"U-God\" Hawkins – performer (track 3)\n*Arnold \"Frukwan\" Hamilton – performer (track 6)\n*Samantha \"Madam Scheez\" Brown – performer (track 6)\n*Vergil \"Prodigal Sunn\" Ruff – performer (track 9)\n*Jason \"Polite\" Bratcher – performer (track 21)\n*Marc \"Falling Down\" McWilliams – producer (tracks: 4, 7, 14)\n*Nigel \"Rebel Dainja\" Julien – producer (track 18)\n*Mike \"Trauma\" Dewar – producer (tracks: 20, 22)\n*Jose \"Choco\" Reynoso – mixing\n*Joe Yannece – mastering\n*Mitchell \"Divine Justice\" Diggs – executive producer\n*Robert \"RZA\" Diggs – executive producer\n*Jamie Story – art direction, design, layout\n*Bilal Allah – A&R\n*Saadiq Busby – A&R\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for Fear, Love & War\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2001)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
