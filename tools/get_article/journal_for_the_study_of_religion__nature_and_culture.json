The journal is the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture. The idea for the journal emerged during the preparation of the interdisciplinary Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature.\nJSRNC was described in its founding editor's inaugural editorial as a \"reframed\" version of a predecessor journal named Ecotheology (ISSN 1363-7320). From 1996 to 2006, Ecotheology had published eleven volumes that are now archived and available at the website of JSRNC.\nThe journal JSRNC is indexed or abstracted by the following services:\n*Scopus Abstract and Citation Database\n*ATLA Religion Database\n*Religious and Theological Abstracts\n*European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH Plus)\n*EBSCO's Academic Search Premier & Religion and Philosophy Collection\n*Bibliography of Humanities and Social Sciences Literature, K.G. Saur Verlag\n*Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)\n*Index to the Study of Religions Online\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
