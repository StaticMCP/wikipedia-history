The temple is dedicated to Shiva. Shiva is worshiped as Amirthakadeswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Amirthavalli Amman. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.\nAs per Hindu legend, the essence of creation arrived at this place in a pot (locally called kalayam), the place came to be known as Kalayanallur. The temple is closely associated with Sakya Nayanmar, one of 63 saints associated with Saivism. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 10 p.m., and three major yearly festivals on its calendar. Maha Shivrathri and Masi Magam during the Tamil month of Masi (February - March) and Margazhi Tiruvadhirai during Margazhi (December - January) are the major festivals celebrated in the temple.\nThe temple complex houses a three-tier  known as gopuram (gateway tower) and has moats inside and outside the surrounding walls. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Amirthakadeswarar and Amirthavalli Amman being the most prominent. The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The image of Lingothbhava is made of emerald, while the image of Ardhanarishvara is depicted with his right leg in relaxing posture. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend\nAs per Hindu legend, the essence of creation arrived at this place in a pot during deluge. Since the pot (locally called kalayam) arrived here, it was called Kalayanallur. Sambandar in his works in Tevaram mentions that this place was originally occupied by Buddhists (Calukkiyar) and hence it came to be known as Cakkiyarkkottai, which with time became Cakkottai.\nAnother legend states that Nayanmar saint Sakya was a staunch devotee of Shiva. He used to wear in Sakya style, which was not typical of Saivism. He used to worship Shiva at this place and even did puja for a stone he crossed. In his devotion, he used to forget that he was adorning the image of Shiva with stones instead of flowers. One day he forgot to do his austerities and started consuming food. He suddenly realised his mistake and ran to the place where he usually worships Shiva to find stones from Kailash started falling at his feet, with Shiva and Parvathy appearing before him. It is believed that as Sakya worshipped Shiva here, the place used to be called Sakkottai.\nArchitecture\nThe present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Thanjavur Nayaks. The temple has a three-tiered rajagopuram (temple tower gateway) and has a moat both inside and outside its surrounding walls. There is a Saptamatrikas sculpted in a single panel and image of Tapsiviyaman. The Dakshinamurthy sculpture on the temple is unique as it is depicted with four hands - the upper right holding a bead made of Rudraksha, the upper left holding Agni (fire), the lower right holding cinmudra and lower left holding palm leaves. The temple tank associated with it is called Caturveda Tirtha, while the tree associated with the temple is Vanni. The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Amirthakalasanathar or Amirthakadeswarar. The consort is Amirthavalli. Most of the shrines were constructed by the Medieval Cholas. There are shrines to Murugan and Ganesa. There is also a brick halls from the Thanjavur Nayak period.  The image of Lingothbhava is made of emerald, while the image of Ardhanarishvara is depicted with his right leg in relaxing posture. There are smaller shrines for Dhandapani Muruga in a small size and Nardana Vinayaka on the southern side.  The front hall houses the Nandi Bali Peeta.\nReligious Significance\nSakkottai is associated with the life of the Nayanmar, Sakya Nayanar who resided here. It is also the place where Brahma worshipped Shiva. Hymns in praise of the temple have been written by Sundarar. Sundarar venerated Amirtakateswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon.\nSpecialty\n12 Shiva temples are connected with Mahamaham festival which happens once in 12 years in Kumbakonam.
