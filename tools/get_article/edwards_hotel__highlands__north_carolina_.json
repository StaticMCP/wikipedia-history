The main block of the hotel, a three-story brick structure, was built in 1935.  It was attached to a c. 1880 -story wood-frame structure, which was operated for many years as a boarding house or hostelry, and is now the historic main inn for Old Edwards Inn and Spa. The brick block was designed by Linton H. Young, and was built after the construction of the Highlands Country Club brought an influx of summer visitors to the area.  The property was operated as a hotel by the Edwards family from 1914 to 1970 and is now owned by Art and Angela Williams (A.L. Williams) of Palm Beach, FL. .\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Macon County, North Carolina\nReferences"
