      "text": "# Glossary of United Kingdom railway terms\n\nThis article contains a list of jargon used to varying degrees by railway enthusiasts, trainspotters, and railway employees in the United Kingdom, including nicknames for various locomotives and multiple units. Although not exhaustive, many of the entries in this list appear from time to time in specialist, rail-related publications. There may be significant regional variation in usage.\nA\n; Absolute block signalling\n: A British signalling scheme designed to ensure the safe operation of a railway by allowing only one train to occupy a defined section of track (block) at a time, used on lines which lack automatic block signalling\n; Aspect\n: The indication displayed by a colour-light signal (e.g. a yellow aspect)\n; Autocoach\n: A passenger coach fitted with a driving cab and controls for use in an autotrain\n; Automatic warning system (AWS)\n: The specific form of limited cab signalling introduced in 1948 in the United Kingdom to help train drivers observe and obey warning signals\nB\n; Baby Deltic\n: D5900 class Bo-Bo diesel-electric locomotives, constructed by the English Electric company. They used a single Napier Deltic engine/generator combination, as opposed to the two-engines layout and Co-Co wheel arrangement of the much longer Deltic locomotives from the same manufacturer, to which they bore a very strong family resemblance.\n; Baby Warship\n: North British D6300 class locomotives, which used one diesel engine coupled to a hydraulic transmission, making them effectively half a D600 Warship or D800 Warship, each of which had two engines\n; Bagpipes\n: British Rail Class 33/1 locomotives, specifically those fitted for push-pull working with 4TC stock\n; Basils\n: A nickname for the British Rail Class 755 bi-mode / diesel multiple units. Named for the TV character Basil Fawlty due to many teething problems on introduction.\n; Bed pan\n: A name used for the service that used to operate between Bedford and London St. Pancras; this service has subsequently been replaced by cross-London service on the Thameslink route. It is sometimes used when referring to the line from Bedford to St Pancras, and not any service in particular.\n; Black Five\n: A LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0. Class of steam locomotive built in the UK, named from their black 'mixed-traffic' livery and 'Class 5' power rating.\n; Blood and Custard\n: The Crimson and Cream livery used on BR's coaches during the 1950s and 60s\n; Bobby\n: A signaller. From Robert Peel; originally, the railway police were responsible for signalling.\n; Bodysnatcher\n: British Rail Class 57 diesel-electric locomotives—made by transplanting a General Motors reconditioned power unit and alternator into a Class 47 bodyshell\n-type freight car bogie]]\n; Bogie\n: The undercarriage assembly of rolling stock incorporating the train wheels, suspension, brakes and, in powered units, the traction motors\n; Booking clerk\n: A member of staff at railway stations, employed to sell tickets to passengers, able to provide advice on ticketing and route options, and responsible for the daily accounts and auditing of the station\n; Bone\n: British Rail Class 58 diesel-electric locomotive—from the shape: the body is narrow with wide cabs. (Also called egg timer.) Ironically, one of the final workings of this class was a railfan special called the Bone Breaker which ended in a bufferstop collision and a passenger breaking his leg.\n; Bone Shaker\n: London Underground A60 and A62 Stock, due to the shakey ride of the old trains. The nickname was coined by an ITV News reporter during a report on the A Stock's last day of service on the Metropolitan Line.\n; Brake van\n: A heavy vehicle with powerful brakes which was attached to the rear of goods trains in the days when most wagons were not fitted with a continuous braking system. Its function was to supplement the locomotive's braking power in slowing and stopping the train and to keep the couplings uniformly tight by selective light braking to avoid snatching and breakages. It also conveyed the train guard, hence its alternative name of \"guards van\". Partly analogous to caboose and its synonyms.\n; Brush\n: British Rail Class 47 diesel-electric locomotive, also known as the \"Brush Type 4\". Followers of this type are often known as \"Brush bashers\".\n; Bubble car\n: A British Rail Class 121 or 122 single railcar. This name was later made official by Chiltern Railways, the final company to have operated the 121 in mainline service.\n; Bullhead rail\n: A steel rail section commonly used in 60&nbsp;ft lengths on almost all railway lines throughout Britain until c1950, which due to its shape must be supported in cast iron chairs that are screwed to the sleepers. It is still found on some London Underground lines, on secondary and preserved lines, and in yards. The rail has two heads (shaped somewhat like a vertical dumbbell) which led some people to assume that when one side became worn, the rail could be inverted and reinstalled for further service rather than being replaced (it can't, because the two heads are different sizes, and by the time the top became worn down sufficiently to fit in the chairs when the rail is inverted, both the top and the bottom of the rail would be too small for further use).\nC\n; Cant\n: The superelevation angle of a track (the relative level of one rail to the other), typically around a curve\n; Cape\n: A British Railways telegraphic codeword to note the cancellation of a passenger train service\n; Car transporter wagon or car transporter van\n: A specialized freight car for transporting automobiles\n;Cat\n: A British Rail Class 68 diesel-electric locomotive\n;\n: The area either side of the railway immediately off the ballast shoulder which provides a safe area for workers to stand when trains approach\n; Chair\n: A cast iron bracket screwed to the sleeper and used to support bull head rail that is held in place by a wooden key (wedge) or spring steel clip—still found on preserved railways and in yards\n; Check rail\n: A double rail section of track, sometimes found in train yards and on bridges to prevent derailments or limit damage caused by derailments, by having rail on both sides of the wheel flange. Also found on curves with a tight radius and switches and crossings\n; Chimney, funnel, or stack\n: A smokestack\n; Chopper\n: British Rail Class 20 diesel-electric locomotive\n; Chord\n: A curve connecting two otherwise-unconnected rail lines that lie at tangents to that curve (Usually both lines are straight, one being at a higher level than the other.)\n; Clag\n: Originally used to describe the exhaust of steam locomotives, \"clag\" is a term describing the often spectacular  (particularly blackened, as in Class 37, or whitesmoked, as in Class 55) exhaust emissions of many older British diesel locomotives, especially, Classes 52 and 55.\n; Coach\n: Railway vehicle for use in passenger trains\n; Coffee pot\n: Applied to the shape of SR Q1 class steam locomotives\n; Composite\n: A passenger car with more than one class of accommodation provided (e.g. first and third).

Once commonplace, this practice has led to several lawsuits against railway companies and is now strictly prohibited due to the high risk to life and property.\n; Flying Banana\n: The first design of GWR diesel railcars, introduced in 1932. This has since been adopted for the Network Rail New Measurement Train, due to its all-over yellow livery. Also occasionally used to describe the High Speed Train.\n; Formation\n: The group of rail vehicles making up a train, or more commonly a group of locomotives connected together for multiple-unit (MU) operation\n; Four foot\n: The area between the running rails of a standard-gauge track; the actual distance is .
