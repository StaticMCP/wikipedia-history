On 9 February, they signed the Treaty of Lunéville, ending the war on the continent. The war against the United Kingdom continued (with Neapolitan harbours closed to her by the Treaty of Florence, signed on 28 March).  A British expedition landed in Egypt in March, fighting the Battle of Abukir, the Battle of Alexandria and laying siege to Alexandria.  The French surrender there on 2 September ended their campaign in Egypt and Syria which had begun in 1798.\nThe naval war also continued, with the United Kingdom maintaining a blockade of France by sea. Russia, Prussia, Denmark, and Sweden formed the Second League of Armed Neutrality to prevent their shipping from being searched by the Royal Navy. British Admiral Horatio Nelson attacked the Danish fleet in harbor at the Battle of Copenhagen, destroying much of the fleet of one of France's more steady allies during the period. Nelson continued into the Baltic Sea to attack the Russian fleet at Reval (Tallinn) but had to withdraw to allow negotiations.\nOff Gibraltar, the outnumbered French squadron under Linois rebuffed a first British attack under Saumarez in the first battle of Algeciras, capturing a ship of the line. In the second battle of Algeciras, four days later, the British captured a French ship and sank two Spanish, killing around 2000 mostly Spanish seamen for the loss of 12 British.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Treaty of Amiens\n* French Revolutionary Wars"
