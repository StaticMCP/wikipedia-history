It was released on September 16, 2002, by Earache Records and, like their debut, produced by the band's frontman Erik Rutan.\nStyle\nKing of All Kings is stylistically similar to its predecessor, Conquering the Throne. It has been classified as \"extreme grind/metal.\" The album's style is characterized as a \"messy, rhythmic cacophony of growls, blast beats, and noisy guitars.\" The album's lyrics are said to \"[salute] all that which is evil.\" Derek Roddy's blast beats have been described as sounding \"relentless.\"\nReception and legacy\nRevolver included King of All Kings in a list of essential albums from the Florida death metal scene. In his review of the album, Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic praised its musicianship and production, but criticized the lack of variety between its tracks. He said, \"Despite its weaknesses, it is evident that Rutan and company are slowly striding forth with their own signature sound, and now that Hate Eternal is Erik Rutan's main focus, one should expect even more grandiose grindcore on future releases.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs by Erik Rutan except when noted.\n#  \"Our Beckoning\"   – 0:49\n#  \"King of All Kings\"  – 2:49 (Rutan, Anderson)\n#  \"The Obscure Terror\"  – 3:53\n#  \"Servants of the Gods\"  – 2:56\n#  \"Beyond Redemption\"  – 3:08 (Rutan, Anderson)\n#  \"Born by Fire\"  – 3:43 (Rutan, Anderson)\n#  \"Chants in Declaration\"  – 4:05\n#  \"Rising Legions of Black\"  – 3:24 (Rutan, Anderson)\n#  \"In Spirit (The Power of Mana)\"  – 4:31\n#  \"Powers That Be\"  – 4:30\nPersonnel\n* Erik Rutan - guitars, lead vocals\n* Jared Anderson - bass, backing vocals\n* Derek Roddy - drums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hateeternal.com/ Hate Eternal official site]"
