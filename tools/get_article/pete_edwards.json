He previously held a number of senior leadership positions at the university, most recently as Vice-Principal for Regional Engagement. His research interests focus on intelligent information infrastructures that promote transparency and accountability in computational systems.\nEarly life and education\nEdwards studied chemistry for his undergraduate degree and was awarded a PhD in computational chemistry by the University of Leeds in 1988.\nCareer\nAfter the University of Leeds, Edwards joined the Department of Computing Science at the University of Aberdeen as a postdoctoral researcher in 1988. He has spent over 35 years at the University, being promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2002 and Professor in 2009. He has held a range of senior academic and leadership roles at the University of Aberdeen, including Head of Computing Science, Head of the College of Physical Sciences Graduate School, Director of the Northern Research Partnership Graduate School (a collaboration among the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, and Robert Gordon), Head of the School of Natural and Computing Sciences, Vice-Principal for Regional Engagement and Acting Senior Vice-Principal.\nEdwards was announced as the internal appointment for Principal of University of Aberdeen on 13 October 2025 following a twice-failed external search.\nPublications (selected)\n* “Using Knowledge Graphs to Unlock Practical Collection, Integration, and Audit of AI Accountability Information”.
