His efforts enabled the park to survive its formative years and grow into one of Africa's finest parks.\nTurner was born in England but spent most of his childhood in Kenya. He served in Africa during World War II and joined the Kenya Game Department in 1946 as a Game Control Officer. Three years later, he became a hunting tour leader with an East African company. It was during this time that Turner learned much about the animals that he would later fight so hard to protect. In 1956, he married and accepted a job at the newly formed Serengeti National Park.\nIn his sixteen years as a warden, Turner worked to prevent poaching, developed the use of aircraft in park management, and directed the training of numerous Tanzanian wardens.\nHe later worked as an advisor to the Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya, which borders the Serengeti National Park.\nTurner died of a sudden heart attack in 1984. He is buried in the Masai Mara Reserve, just a few steps away from the Tanzanian border.\nHis autobiography, My Serengeti Years, was published posthumously, and is a collection of stories and mental images of life in Africa in earlier times.\nTurner married Kathleen Tubb and they had two children.\nThe Turner Spring area is named after him.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.serengeti.org/ Serengeti National Park]\n* [http://www.serengeti.org/p_turner.html#top/ Myles Turner's biography at Serengeti National Park homepage]"
