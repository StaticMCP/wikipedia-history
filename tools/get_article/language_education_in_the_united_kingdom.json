There were government plans for language teaching in primary schools, but the plans were dropped, due to the obvious situation of insufficiently trained teachers.\nSecondary modern schools had limited modern language teaching, being occasionally found in the top stream of such schools, but often there was none at all.\nOn 22 February 1962 Conservative MP John Cordeaux asked the education secretary about foreign language teaching in primary schools. The government was to implement an experimental scheme to attempt French teaching in some primary schools, in nine areas across England and Wales, from September 1964, in conjunction with the Nuffield Foundation. By 1968, 850 Scottish primary schools taught French, with 200 out of Glasgow's 212 primary schools.\n1970s\nFollowing the introduction of comprehensive education in the 1960s the provision of language education at secondary level, mostly French, expanded and many primary schools introduced foreign languages as part of the 'Primary School Language Project' in the early 1970s. However, by the 1970s the status of French in primary schools was in question with the influential report  'Primary French in the Balance' ensuring that 11 was the age that most began studying French.\nFrom 1970-75 French A-level entries dropped from 25,925 to 17,025 and German entries from 7,520 to 5,516. The move to comprehensive schools had not been seen to help language teaching to flourish, so a national survey of language teaching was conducted by five HM Inspectors of Schools in 83 comprehensive schools took place from 1975 to 1976, which resulted in the ungenerous DES report Modern Languages in Comprehensive Schools published on Thursday 17 March 1977. The report said that language teaching was often too 'mechanical' and inflexible, not nuanced.\nThe DES report said that mixed ability language classes were not a resounding success, that 'there was grave cause for concern' about bright children trying to learn languages at comprehensive schools, and that not enough was being done to help them. Teaching in sixth forms was 'no less disquieting'. Comprehensive schools had introduced language teaching, nominally for all, at some comprehensive schools, although most comprehensive schools only offered such language teaching to the top 60-80%, at most. Only a minority at such schools continued languages after 14.\nDue to more language teachers being required, it became more difficult for comprehensive schools to offer two languages for those taking languages after 14. Under the former grammar school system, taking two languages up to 16 was never any profound difficulty; the grammar schools had enough teachers, and enough people capable of learning two languages. Comprehensive schools often had neither. The 1977 report also questioned why only people who took French A-level were able to continue French to 18, when there were many other people at 16 who had some capability in languages. Other European countries did not do this. Many former grammar school teachers found language teaching across wide abilities in comprehensive schools difficult. It found, over the 83 secondary schools, that there was one pass in a language O-level, or CSE grade 1, at 16, for every ten children at 16.\nIn the 1977 report, it found that many heads of language departments 'showed little awareness of the responsibilities they bore, beyond the walls of their own classrooms', leading some less-experienced teachers to flounder on their own, when such teachers needed to be assisted.\nThe British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) held a conference on 19 May 1978 at the Royal Society of Arts entitled 'Does Britain need linguists?', attended by Labour MP Les Huckfield.\nIn a BOTB report, 'Foreign Languages for Overseas Trade', published on Wednesday 23 May 1979, with a foreword by the Duke of Kent, it found that secondary school language abilities were not appropriate for the world of work. In his foreword, the Duke made several accusations, claiming that British companies had not tried with other languages, due to relying on Commonwealth connections, and that it was expensive to give language training to managers. The Duke claimed that secondary schools were obsessed far too much with syntax and grammar, and that secondary schools should have acquired the spoken diction beforehand. The BOTB report was later discussed at a conference for headteachers, hosted by the University of Surrey's Department of Linguistic and International Studies, on 8 December 1979.\nIn December 1979 the University Grants Committee published its 'Report on Russian and Russian Studies in British Universities', which proposed to end the teaching of Russian in 19 to 20 universities; this was to centralise teaching in 20 main university departments. This move was opposed by the British Association for Slavonic & East European Studies\n1980s\nIn 1983, the most French A-levels were taken: 27,103. The number fell but increased again by the early 1990s.\nUniversities were beginning to offer European business courses, to allow a year out in Europe, often at polytechnics, such as Middlesex Polytechnic. The University of Kent was a leading university with such courses, and cooperation with European universities. It largely coordinated all of the UK's part in the Erasmus Programme.\nMany more secondary schools were offering languages up to 14, but not many comprehensive schools had obligatory language teaching after that. Most grammar schools would require a language to be followed up to 16. Prior to the 1970s, languages were largely only taught in grammar schools after the age of 14, and to take two languages up to 16. Most people believed that comprehensive schools could not achieve this, given the large range of abilities; only a few people, at most, believed it could be taught up to 16 in comprehensive schools. Some chief education officers believed that language teaching should be compulsory up to 16, for the able children only.\nAs part of the National Curriculum, a Modern Languages working group was established in 1989.\nThe National Curriculum MFL Working Group (MFLWG) was chaired by Sir Martin Harris. The committee, possibly hardheadedly, believed that most children could study modern languages up to the age of 16, despite many other linguists, previously, not coming to that same radical, or optimistic, conclusion.\nThe Council of Europe, from 1982-87, had been looking at language teaching across Europe, which influenced the findings of the committee of Sir Martin Harris. A national educational conference, to discuss any findings, was held in 1989.\nAs a result all children at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4 were required to study a modern foreign language. However, concerns were expressed as to whether the time devoted to learning modern languages was sufficient for acquisition to take place and the extent to which French had become the dominant language.\n1990s\nOn 16 May 1990, the BBC launched a £3m series of educational programmes to prepare for the Single Market in 1992, such as a series of ten programmes entitled You and 92.\nThe LINGUA programme was set up by the EC from 1990 to 1994, which changed to become the Socrates programme in 1994.\nThe 1990 House of Lords report 'European Schools and Language Learning in UK Schools' found that around 18,000 took French A-level, which had dropped by 10% in eight years.\nThe 'Nuffield Languages Inquiry' was set up in 1998 by Sir John Boyd (diplomat), with Alwena Lamping.\n2000s\nCurriculum 2000 was introduced by the Labour government in 2000 to allow an A-level course to be broken into two, in modules. It allowed A-levels to be less strenuous to attempt, and that more people could possibly pass each course. But, each exam required half the effort of the previous A-level system. An A-level became two AS-level courses. AS levels had been introduced, only, to give an alternative to the harder A-level course, which was not for everyone. But the AS-level had not been introduced to be a kind of replacement for the tough A-level exam. If teenagers took less-difficult exams at 18, the exam grades would inflate as well. The system was dropped from 2015 to 2018. The difficulty was that everyone was getting glowing exam grades, and so prestigious universities could not sufficiently separate out enough candidates; it was mere grade inflation.\nThe authoritative report Language Trends has been published annually since 2002 by the British Council.\nIn September 2000, modular AS levels were introduced, under Curriculum 2000. These were to be taken in year 12, which counted 50% towards the final A-level result: it spread the risk of the exam result over two years, but any number of resit exams were possible.\nThe European Year of Languages began in January 2001, and the Labour government had meetings with main European ambassadors about low participation in language education across the UK: Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, Santiago de Mora-Figueroa y Williams and Daniel Bernard.\nLid King, the former director of the CILT from 1992, after John Trim and Alan Moy, became the new National Director for Languages in 2003, until 2012. He implemented the 2002 National Language Strategy.\nIn 2004 the Labour government dropped the requirement of the 1988 National Curriculum to take a language GCSE at 16. The Labour Party had recognised, after the age of 14, the adversity of many comprehensive schools trying to teach foreign languages; the subject could be too difficult for those who would not enter the sixth form. Language GCSEs were difficult to pass; dropping the requirement would also enable less-difficult GCSEs to be taken instead, giving an artificial boost to GCSE league tables. The NUT did not support the policy of dropping the requirement.\nFrom 1996 French A-level entries had halved, to 14,650 in 2006, and there were 6,204 German A-level entries. By 2007, 51% at 16 took a language GCSE: in 2000 it was 80%.\n2010s\nForeign language teaching in primary schools was to be compulsory by September 2011. In 2001, 21% of primary offered foreign languages: by 2010 this was 92%.\nSince 2014 the National Curriculum has required that pupils in Key Stage 2 must study an ancient or modern foreign language. Pupils in Key Stage 3 must study a modern foreign language.\nFrom September 2016, in England, AS levels no longer counted towards the A-level; many took AS level language courses up to year 12 only; the new A-levels are called linear A-levels.\nBy 2017, there were 9,672 entries for French A-level, and 3,842 for German. But the regulator Ofqual found that one in five entrants for German A-level were native speakers, acquiring half of all A* grades, and a quarter of all A grades; possibly abusing or gaming the system.\nIn 2017, a survey by the CBI found that employers most need people with skills and fluency in French, German and Spanish.\nIn 2018, new modern language GCSEs were introduced in England and Wales. In January 2019, the  National Centre for Excellence for Language  was established at the University of York, to coordinate modern language education in England, with nine school hubs across England; of the nine schools, two are grammar schools and two are faith schools.\nFrom 2010 to 2018, French GCSE entries dropped by 29% and German GCSE entries dropped by 37%. But Spanish GCSE entries from 2010 to 2018 rose considerably.\nFrom 2011 to 2018, French A-level entries have dropped from around 12,000 to just under 8,000. According to Joint Council for Qualifications, language GCSE entries have halved since 2005. There was a slight increase in French GCSE entries in 2018 and 2019; entries for Spanish are on course to overtake entries for French by 2030.\n2020s\nAncient languages are being reintroduced into more English secondary schools, such as Latin. A £4m Department for Education scheme will initially be rolled out across 40 schools as part of a four-year pilot programme for 11- to 16-year-olds starting in September 2022. As well as language teaching, the Latin Excellence Programme will also include visits to Roman heritage sites to provide pupils with a greater understanding of classics and the ancient world. The initiative aims to boost GCSE Latin entries and will be modelled on the success of the Mandarin Excellence Programme, launched in 2016 in response to the growing importance of Mandarin as a global language. The programme now involves 75 schools across the country with more than 6,000 pupils learning Mandarin towards fluency.\nWith the passage of the British Sign Language (Scotland) Act 2015, the Scottish Qualifications Authority published a Group Award specification for BSL qualifications in 2021. With the passage of the British Sign Language Act 2022, the UK government published subject subject content for a BSL GCSE in 2024.\nIn 2022, Education Wales announced that BSL had become part of the Curriculum for Wales. In 2024, Qualifications Wales announced that the BSL qualification had been delayed from 2026 to 2027.\nNational resources\n* National Consortium for Languages Education; in March 2023, UCL was given a £15m contract to found the National Centre for Languages Education, with around 20 language hub schools\n* Northern Ireland Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (NICILT) is at QUB\n* Scotland has the SCILT at The Ramshorn, part of the University of Strathclyde\n* Wales had the CILT Cymru, until funding was cut by 70% in 2014 from £600,000 to £200,000\nNations\nEngland\nLanguage education in England up to the age of 19 is provided in the National Curriculum by the Department for Education, which was established in 2010.\nLanguage teaching should provide the foundation for learning further languages, equipping pupils to study and work in other countries.\nIn the 2023 Language Trends, it was found that two in three state secondary schools in England teach only one foreign language at GCSE. Most grammar schools would teach at least two languages. For years 7 to 9, around half of those at independent schools learn two languages; for state secondary schools it was one in five. 38% of state secondary schools offer German at GCSE; for independent schools, it is 80%.\nWales\nTake up of foreign languages at GCSE in Wales dropped from 55% of the cohort in 1995 to 22% in 2012. And it was worse in less-wealthy parts of Wales - only 11% of the cohort in Blaenau Gwent took a foreign language GCSE. German is taught in a quarter of secondary schools.\nWales has the lowest participation rate in foreign languages in the UK. Two other parts of the UK have grammar schools, which have helped the provision of foreign language learning, at least up to 16. Academic-orientated sixth form colleges, as much as grammar schools, also provide adequate foreign language teaching. But Wales, with no grammar schools, does not have the same adequate provision for such teaching. Northern Ireland is entirely selective, and has not suffered the fate of Wales, in its foreign language teaching.\nJean Coussins, Baroness Coussins, a Cambridge graduate in Modern Languages who has worked with the Chartered Institute of Linguists, and who chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Modern Languages, chaired a discussion in the House of Lords on Wednesday 12 March 2014 about substandard language teaching in Wales.\nThe language component of the Welsh Baccalaureate was removed around 2014.\nIn December 2019, the British Council described secondary school language teaching in Wales as plummeting. From 2002 to 2019, GCSE foreign language candidates in Wales had dropped by 60%; 39% of secondary schools had no-one taking foreign languages after 16. Difficult foreign languages were viewed by schools as unsuitable for the less-able.\nBritish Council Wales produced its annual report 'Language Trends Wales'.\n230 French A-levels were taken in 2023, 55 German A-levels, and 140 Spanish A-levels in Wales.\nScotland\nAt the same time as England, foreign languages became compulsory at primary schools in September 2014.\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland has an exclusively-selective education system; modern languages are broadly well-taught at selective schools. Northern Ireland has 794 primary schools, 66 grammar schools and 126 non-grammar secondary schools.\nLanguage Trends Northern Ireland is produced for British Council Northern Ireland by Ian Collen, head of the NCILT at QUB, a former French and German teacher, who runs the PGCE courses at QUB.\nIn 2000, 190 Northern Irish candidates sat German A-level; in 2022 it was 72.\nPrimary level\nAround 50% of primary teachers either have a degree or A-level in a language. About 70% of primary schools deliver languages in-house, often with a HLTA, a type of teaching assistant who is not QTS standard. Some primary schools work with local secondary schools or sixth form colleges for language training for primary teachers. Around 10% of primary schools have overseas visits, and about 10% participate in eTwinning or the Comenius programme (itself part of the Socrates programme) whereby the scheme involves teacher exchanges abroad. Another project is MEITS (Multilingualism: Empowering Individuals, Transforming Societies).\nEngland\nAt Key Stage 2 it is compulsory to for primary schools to study ancient and modern languages. French is offered at around 75% of primary schools, with Spanish at about 25% and German at about 5%, with about 45 minutes per week of language learning per school.\nSecondary level\nEngland\nAt Key Stage 3 it is compulsory for secondary schools to study modern languages.\nGCSE modern foreign languages and GCSE ancient languages are studied at Key Stage 4. Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Bengali, Mandarin, Greek, Gujarati, Modern Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Punjabi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, and Urdu are studied.\nThe English Baccalaureate was introduced in 2011, which has modern and ancient language requirements. Languages at GCSE are much more popular at single sex secondary schools than for co-educational state secondary schools; many grammar schools are also single sex schools. Many language teachers are female; in some secondary schools all language teachers are female, supplying limited role models for some teenage males.\nSixth-form level\nModern and classical languages are taught at A-level, with French being most popular (around 8,000) followed by German (around 3,000). It is perceived that top grades are difficult to get in language A-levels.\nEngland\nModular AS levels had been introduced to form 50% of the total A-level result from 2000, but this was stopped from 2016.\nUniversity level\nTeaching of modern languages at university is well-represented by universities such as those in the Russell Group, but in other universities, such teaching is not represented.\nBroadcasting\nThe School Broadcasting Council for the United Kingdom, set up in 1947, advised the BBC for much of the 1960s.\nEducational broadcasting at the BBC was largely started, on the radio, by Mary Somerville (broadcasting executive), after J. C. Stobart. Only after September 1957 did the BBC have the money for school television programmes, or sufficient technical equipment. The Educational Foundation for Visual Aids, founded in 1948, had a catalogue of over 6,000 educational films for schools, mostly for filmstrip projectors, a staple of 1960s and 1970s language education.\nIn the 1980s some of the more well-known BBC programmes were carried by PBS channels in the US, such as WNET\nEducational series have included:\nTelevision\n* Chez les Dupré, from 1960–62, 50 episodes on Associated-Rediffusion\n* La Jeunesse Francaise, BBC TV 7 May 1962 on Mondays at 11.30am, a 4-part series for sixth forms, presented by Henry Appia, produced by Colin Nears.
