Alabama was allocated sixty-five delegates, fifty-six of which were pledged. Thirty-seven delegates were elected from the seven congressional districts and the remaining nineteen were chosen by the State Democratic Executive Committee to reflect candidates' statewide vote totals. Nine delegates were unpledged delegates, or \"superdelegates,\" made up of five party officers and four congressmen.\nJesse Jackson of South Carolina won more statewide votes than Al Gore of Tennessee, but both took the same number of delegates, twenty-eight, to the Convention, due to Gore's strength in the state's congressional districts. Later in the campaign, Gore withdrew his bid for the nomination and released his delegates while urging them to support Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. Dukakis won the support of every superdelegate and Gore delegate, and at the Convention, Alabama cast thirty-seven votes for Dukakis to Jackson's twenty-eight.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Alabama Democratic presidential primary, 1988\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2 | Candidate\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | Popular vote\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=3 | Delegates\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | #\n!scope=\"col\" | %\n!scope=\"col\" | Pledged\n!scope=\"col\" | Unpledged\n!scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jesse Jackson\n| 176,764 || 43.56% || 28 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Al Gore\n| 151,739 || 37.39% || 28 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Michael Dukakis\n| 31,206 || 7.69% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dick Gephardt\n| 30,214 || 7.44% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Gary Hart\n| 7,518 || 1.85% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Paul Simon\n| 3,063 || 0.75% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Bruce Babbitt\n| 2,410 || 0.59% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Lyndon LaRouche\n| 845 || 0.21% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Uncommitted\n| 2,072 || 0.51% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!
