Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite and Collision.\nAt Worlds End on December 28, Jon Moxley retained his AEW World Championship in a four-way match in the main event only for FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) and Adam Copeland, who was returning from a seven month hiatus, to confront him afterwards. At Fight for the Fallen on January 1, Copeland, now known as simply \"Cope\", and FTR defeated Death Riders. Over the course of the following weeks Jay White, whom was one of the three other competitors in the four-way match at Worlds End, would become involved in Cope's feud with Moxley. On the January 22 episode of Dynamite, Cope defeated Pac only to be shown on the TitanTron that Death Riders had kidnapped Harwood, Wheeler and Rock 'n' Roll Express (Robert Gibson and Ricky Morton). Claudio Castagnoli then con-chair-toed Morton before attacking Cope and White in the ring. This would lead to a Brisbane Brawl at Grand Slam Australia on February 15 which Death Riders won. Following the loss, Cope vowed to dismantle Death Riders one-by-one. Starting with Pac on the February 22 episode of Collision, hitting Pac with a con-chair-to. On the February 26 episode of Dynamite with the help of White and Willow Nightingale, Cope took out Castagnoli and Marina Shafir, leaving Moxley and Wheeler Yuta left. On the March 5 episode of Dynamite, Cope defeated Yuta. After the match, an argument erupted in the ring between Yuta and Moxley, leading to Yuta walking away. Moxley then said that he would look forward to beating Cope at Revolution.\nAt Maximum Carnage on January 18 (taped January 16) \"Hangman\" Adam Page defeated Christopher Daniels in a Texas Death match. After the match, Daniels announced his retirement, making his loss to Page his final match. On the January 22 episode of Dynamite Daniels confronted Page telling him that he won and that he was retired, in turn making Page question his attitude towards Daniels. On the February 12 episode of Dynamite MJF defeated Dustin Rhodes but continued to attack him after the match until Page fended MJF off. The following week on Dynamite both men engaged in a promo exchange which lead to a brawl. On the February 26, 2025 episode of Dynamite MJF attacked Daniels backstage in order to get back at Page, as by now, Page had become remorseful of his treatment towards Daniels. A match for Reveloution between Page and MJF was set up shortly afterwards.\nOn the September 11 episode of Dynamite, Will Ospreay teamed with Kyle Fletcher to win a tag team Casino Gauntlet match to earn a shot at The Young Bucks' AEW World Tag Team Championship at Grand Slam on September 25, but failed to win the titles at the event. At WrestleDream on October 12, after Ospreay had lost his AEW International Championship to Konosuke Takeshita, Fletcher would attack Ospreay, ending their alliance On 23 November at Full Gear, Ospreay was defeated by Fletcher. The next day, Ospreay was announced as a participant in the 2024 Continental Classic, where he was placed in the Gold league. Ospreay finished the tournament with 9 points and advanced to the playoff stage on 28 December at Worlds End.

At Grand Slam Australia on 15 February, Ospreay and Omega defeated Fletcher and Takeshita in a tag-team match. A match was later set up between Fletcher and Ospreay in a Steel Cage match.\nAt the start of 2024, Mariah May became Toni Storm's \"understudy\" and protégé. At Revolution Mariah May adopted Storm's previous \"Rockstar\" persona, including wearing Storm's old ring attire and entrance music, and would begin wrestling matches on Dynamite and Collison in this persona as a tribute to her mentor Storm. At Forbidden Door, Storm retained the title against Mina Shirakawa, May's tag team partner in World Wonder Ring Stardom, and following the match Storm, May and Shirakawa put aside their differences with a three-way kiss. Throughout the Storm/Shirakawa rivalry, it had been teased that May was conflicted about who to side with, her mentor Storm or former Stardom tag partner Shirakawa, and that she was romantically tied to both women. On the July 10 episode of Dynamite, Storm was attacked by May after May defeated Willow Nightingale in the finals of the Owen Hart Foundation Women's Tournament to earn a shot at her AEW Women's World Championship on August 25 at All In, turning face after being a tweener alongside May for months while May fully turned heel. On August 25 at All In, Storm lost the AEW Women's World Championship to May, ending her third reign at 281 days. After nearly four months on hiatus, Storm made her return on December 11 at Winter is Coming, now under her \"Rockstar\" persona, where she confronted May after her successful title defense against Shirakawa. After returning, Storm began acting as if she just made her debut in AEW. After winning a Casino Gauntlet match at Maximum Carnage to earn title shot against May, she returned to her \"Timeless\" persona, revealing her \"Rockstar\" act was all a ruse. On February 15, 2025 at Grand Slam Australia, Storm defeated May to win the AEW Women's World Champion for a record-setting fourth time. It was then announced Storm would face May in a \"Hollywood Ending\" Falls Count Anywhere match which would serve an end to their feud. This was also May's last match and appearance in AEW before signing with WWE three months later.\nIn late 2024, Swerve Strickland began a feud with Ricochet. On the February 5, 2025 episode of Dynamite, Strickland was defeated by Ricochet, who proceeded to steal the \"Embassy\" robe that Strickland wore in honor of Jimmy Rave. It was then announced Ricochet would take on Strickland with the winner getting an AEW World Championship match.\nGoing into Revolution The Murder Machines (Brian Cage and Lance Archer) were demanding an AEW World Tag Team Championship opportunity against The Hurt Syndicate. At the same time, The Outrunners (Truth Magnum and Turbo Floyd) were also wanting a title opportunity. On the February 26 episode of Dynamite The Outrunners defeated The Murder Machines in order to get a AEW World Tag Team Championship opportunity. The match was later made official for Revolution.\nAt Grand Slam Australia, Kazuchika Okada defeated Buddy Matthews to retain his AEW Continental Championship.
