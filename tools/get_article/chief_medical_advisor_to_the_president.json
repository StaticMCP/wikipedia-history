Established in 2019, the position has been vacant since December 31, 2022, when Anthony Fauci stepped down.\nHistory\nThe position was established in 2019 by the first Trump administration. On February 2, 2019, former physician to the president Ronny Jackson was selected to serve as chief medical advisor and assistant to President Donald Trump. Jackson's job included advising Trump on public health policy. Jackson left at the end of 2019, and the Trump administration did not name a successor.\nOn December 4, 2020, the transition team of the incoming Biden administration announced that Anthony Fauci, then the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would serve in the role. Fauci stepped into the job on January 21, 2021, the day after Biden took office. Fauci advised on public health policy related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2022, Fauci stepped down from his position as announced 4 months earlier.\nChief medical advisors\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n!No.\n!Officeholder\n!Portrait\n!Term start\n!Term end\n! colspan=\"2\" |President\n|-\n|1\n|align=\"center\"|Ronny Jackson\n|\n|February 2, 2019\n|December 1, 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: ;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Donald Trump\n|-|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=5|VacantDecember 1, 2019 – January 20, 2021 ()\n|-\n|2\n|align=\"center\"|Anthony Fauci\n|\n|January 20, 2021\n|December 31, 2022\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background: ;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Joe Biden\n|-|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=5|VacantDecember 31, 2022 – present ()\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
