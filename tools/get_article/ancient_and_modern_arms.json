      "text": "# Ancient and modern arms\n\nAncient and modern are terms used in heraldry to differentiate two different coats of arms used at different periods by a family or other bearer. Reasons for changing arms have been numerous, the most famous being the 1376 change in the French royal arms by Charles V of France to show three fleurs-de-lis instead of semee de lis, possibly to symbolize the Holy Trinity. The reasons for other changes were more prosaic, for example where a court of chivalry ordered a change or differencing where two families claimed the same arms, as in the famous case of Scrope v Grosvenor. The resulting two versions of arms are referred to as \"France ancient\" and \"France modern\",  \"Grosvenor ancient\" and \"Grosvenor modern\".\nList of examples\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
