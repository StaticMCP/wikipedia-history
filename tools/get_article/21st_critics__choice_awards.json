But after what an email to members called \"an unprecedented cry out\" from its membership, the BFCA's board of directors called a \"special referendum\" on adding the movie to the ten candidates for Best Picture, which it won. (A similar situation happened for the 6th Critics' Choice Awards in 2001, in which the film Cast Away was voted by referendum to be included among the nominees for Best Picture.) The BFCA faced immediate criticism, including from its own members, over what many saw as an attempt to increase ratings for the awards ceremony's broadcast on A&E (which, is 50% owned by Disney, the company behind Star Wars) on January 17, 2016. Two members—Eric Melin (editor-in-chief of Scene-Stealers.com, a film critic of Lawrence Journal-World, and the president of the Kansas City Film Critics Circle) and Scott Renshaw (editor of Salt Lake City Weekly)—resigned in protest.\nMelin, in an open letter, wrote: }}\nSimilarly, in another open letter, Renshaw wrote: }}\nFilms with multiple nominations and wins\nThe following twenty-six films received multiple nominations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Nominations\n|-\n| Mad Max: Fury Road\n| 13\n|-\n| Carol\n| rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|-\n| The Martian\n|-\n| The Revenant\n|-\n| Spotlight\n| 8\n|-\n| The Big Short\n| 7\n|-\n| The Hateful Eight\n| 6\n|-\n| Bridge of Spies\n| rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|-\n| Brooklyn\n|-\n| The Danish Girl\n|-\n| Jurassic World\n|-\n| Sicario\n|-\n| Room\n| 4\n|-\n| Ex Machina\n| rowspan=8 style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|-\n| Inside Out\n|-\n| Joy\n|-\n| Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation\n|-\n| Spy\n|-\n| Steve Jobs\n|-\n| Trainwreck\n|-\n| Trumbo\n|-\n| Black Mass\n| rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\"| 2\n|-\n| Furious 7\n|-\n| Love & Mercy\n|-\n| Sisters\n|-\n| Spectre\n|}\nThe following five films received multiple awards:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Awards\n|-\n| Mad Max: Fury Road\n| style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|-\n| The Big Short\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|-\n| Spotlight\n|-\n| The Revenant\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:center\"| 2\n|-\n| Room\n|}\nTelevision programs with multiple nominations and wins\nThe following programs received multiple nominations:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Program\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Network\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Nominations\n|-\n| Fargo\n| FX\n| Limited\n| style=\"text-align:center\"| 8\n|-\n| The Leftovers\n| HBO\n| Drama\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 6\n|-\n| Transparent\n| Amazon\n| Comedy\n|-\n| The Wiz Live!\n| NBC\n| Movie\n| style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|-\n| Black-ish\n| ABC\n| Comedy\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 4\n|-\n| Empire\n| Fox\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Drama\n|-\n| Mr. Robot\n| USA\n|-\n| Penny Dreadful\n| Showtime\n|-\n| American Horror Story: Hotel\n| FX\n| Limited\n| rowspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|-\n| Jane the Virgin\n| The CW\n| Comedy\n|-\n| The Knick\n| Cinemax\n| Drama\n|-\n| Luther\n| BBC America\n| Limited\n|-\n| Rectify\n| Sundance\n| Drama\n|-\n| Saints & Strangers\n| Nat Geo\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Limited\n|-\n| Show Me a Hero\n| HBO\n|-\n| UnREAL\n| Lifetime\n| Drama\n|-\n| ''You're the Worst\n| FXX\n| Comedy\n|-\n| The Amazing Race\n| CBS\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Reality – Competition\n| rowspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 2\n|-\n| Chopped\n| Food Network\n|-\n| Fresh Off the Boat\n| ABC\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Comedy\n|-\n| Getting On\n| HBO\n|-\n| The Grinder\n| Fox\n|-\n| Hannibal\n| NBC\n| Drama\n|-\n| Inside the Actors Studio\n| Bravo\n| Reality – Structured\n|-\n| The Last Man on Earth\n| Fox\n| rowspan=\"4\"| Comedy\n|-\n| Master of None\n| Netflix\n|-\n| The Middle\n| ABC\n|-\n| Mom\n| CBS\n|-\n| Nashville\n| ABC\n| Drama\n|-\n| Survivor\n| CBS\n| Reality – Competition\n|}\nThe following programs received multiple awards:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Program\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Network\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Awards\n|-\n| Fargo\n| FX\n| Limited\n| style=\"text-align:center\"| 4\n|-\n| Mr. Robot''\n| USA\n| Drama\n| style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://members.criticschoice.com/movie-awards/21st-annual-critics-choice-awards-winners/ 21st Annual Critics' Choice Awards – Winners]"
