Its purpose is to make sure that doing business in Nigeria is easy through reforms and policies.\nHistory\nPEBEC was inaugurated in 2016 by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, with the mandate to remove the critical bottleneck and bureaucratic constraints of doing business in Nigeria.\nPEBEC collaborates with Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and other partners to reduce the costs, time and number of procedures to make the process of setting up and doing business in Nigeria simpler and effective – from starting a business to getting a location to getting finance to dealing with day-to-day operations and ultimately to operating in a secure business environment.\nThe PEBEC’s regulatory reform program commenced in 2017 as an outcome from the 5th Presidential Quarterly Business Forum hosted by His Excellency, the Vice President at which private sector feedback firmly highlighted some of the regulatory hurdles and the costs associated with regulatory compliance for businesses.

This includes significant improvements in flagship World Bank Doing Business ranking and being twice recognized as a top 20 improvers in doing business.\nThe Ease of Doing Business Index (DBI) was an annual ranking done by the World Bank group that objectively assesses prevailing business climate conditions across 190 countries based on 10 indicators (starting a business, getting electricity, enforcing contracts etc.). The index captures ease of doing business reforms that have been validated by the organized private sector and offers comparative insights based on this validation. The rank ranges from 1 - 190. A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and running of a business.\nIn 2019, Nigeria ranked 131st place in the 2019/20 DBI report and named one of top 10 most improved economies in the world for the 2nd time in 3 years.\nLeadership\nOn the board of PEBEC, the Vice-President of Nigeria sits as the Chairman of the board with the Minister for Industry, Trade and Investment as the Vice-Chair.
