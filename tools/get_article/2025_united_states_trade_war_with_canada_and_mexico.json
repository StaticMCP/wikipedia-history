The order called for 25percent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and all imports from Canada except for oil and energy, which would be taxed at 10percent.\nIn response, then Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would retaliate with 25percent tariffs on billion (billion) of American goods, which would expand to billion (billion) after three weeks. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico would enact tariffs and non-tariff retaliation against the United States. On February3, one day before they were set to take effect, both leaders negotiated a one-month delay for the tariffs.\nThe U.S. tariffs took effect on March4; Canada's retaliatory tariffs began simultaneously, while Mexico stated it would wait to retaliate. On March6, Trump exempted goods compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) from tariffs. Later, the U.S. imposed universal tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automotive imports, including those from Mexico and Canada. Due to the USMCA exemption, as of August 2025, over 85% of Canada—U.S. trade and 84% of Mexico—U.S. trade remains tariff-free.\nTrump has said the tariffs are intended to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Canada and Mexico, force both countries to secure their borders with the U.S. against illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, and promote domestic manufacturing in the United States. Sheinbaum, Trudeau, and Trudeau's successor, Mark Carney, have called the U.S. tariffs unjustified and stated that they violate the USMCA. Trudeau said that Trump intends to use tariffs to force Canadian annexation into the United States, which Trump has suggested. Economists have said tariffs would likely disrupt trade between the three countries, upending supply chains and increasing consumer prices.\nEconomic background\nU.S.–Canada trade\nThe bilateral trade relationship between the United States and Canada is one of the world's largest. Canada–U.S. trade comprises about one third of Canada's economy, and about 3 percent of the United States's economy. In the first nine months of 2024, Canadian government data estimated that  () of goods crossed the Canada–U.S. border. More than 70 percent of Canadian exports go to the United States. The countries' energy and automotive markets are both highly integrated, and Canada is the U.S.'s largest supplier of both steel and aluminum. As of November 2024, the U.S. government estimated the United States's trade deficit with Canada to be . This deficit is primarily driven by American demand for Canadian oil; when oil exports are excluded, the U.S. has a trade surplus with Canada. Roughly 60 percent of oil imported by the U.S. is sourced from Canada, and Canada is the largest supplier of U.S. energy imports and second-largest recipient of U.S. energy exports. The increased value of U.S. imports from Canada is partially a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which created global market instability and raised energy prices. Cars, trucks, other vehicles, and auto parts constitute 27 percent of Canadian exports to the United States. Canada is the second-largest source of automobile parts imported to the United States.\nU.S.–Mexico trade\nThe economies of the United States and Mexico are highly intertwined. In 2024, roughly  of goods were transported across the Mexico–U.S. border, and over  in commerce between the two countries occurs daily. In 2023, U.S. exports to Mexico totaled , while the U.S. imported over  of Mexican products, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. More than 75 percent of Mexico's exports go to the United States, and the U.S. is Mexico's primary trading partner. Roughly 70 percent of Mexico's natural gas consumption comes from the U.S., and the U.S. imports about 700,000 barrels of crude oil from Mexico each day. Food production between the two countries is also closely integrated: the U.S. sources roughly half of its fresh fruits and vegetables from Mexico, and Mexico is the top market for U.S. agricultural exports. Mexico is the third-largest exporter of steel to the U.S., behind only Canada and Brazil; both Mexico and the U.S. have been accused of violating an agreement signed alongside the USMCA to limit steel exports between each other. Some Americans, including Trump, have said that Mexico has exceeded the level of exports allowed under the agreement. At the same time, the Mexican steel organization Canacero reported that the level of U.S. steel exports also breached the deal. Mexico is the top source of both automobiles and automobile parts imported to the United States.\nTrade agreements\n, Donald Trump, and Justin Trudeau signing the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement in 2018.]]In 1994, the United States, Canada, and Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a free trade agreement that eliminated almost all tariffs on trade between the three countries.|group=lower-alpha}} NAFTA has been described as a source of political division. In the U.S., it caused offshoring as U.S. companies relocated their businesses to Mexico for cheaper labor, harming American factory towns and workers. The backlash against free trade allowed candidates like Donald Trump, who supported protectionist policies, to rise to prominence in U.S. politics. However, many parts of the U.S. benefited from NAFTA's increased trade and economic activity. In 2020, during Trump's first term as U.S. president, NAFTA was replaced by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), primarily because Trump disagreed with NAFTA. Changes between NAFTA and the USMCA were largely cosmetic; the new agreement maintained zero tariffs on most products traded across the three countries, but allowed some tariffs to be imposed for national security matters. The region covered by USMCA is one of the world's largest free trade zones.\nPolitical background\nFirst Trump administration\nDuring his first term, Trump threatened tariffs on Mexico if it did not end illegal immigration to the United States across the U.S.–Mexico border and repeatedly threatened to withdraw from NAFTA. However, he ultimately did not impose tariffs on Mexico after it agreed to create the Mexican National Guard, send 6,000 troops to fight illegal immigration, and allowed the U.S. to expand its \"remain in Mexico\" policy, which forced certain asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until the U.S. processed their asylum claim. Trump pressured Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA by threatening aggressive import tariffs, and in May 2018, he extended the U.S.'s global tariffs on steel and aluminum to the two countries, inviting them both to retaliate. The three countries agreed to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs in May 2019, one year after they had begun, prior to the USMCA taking effect on July1, 2020. One month after the USMCA entered force, Trump said that aluminum imports constituted a national security threat that endangered U.S. producers and imposed 10 percent tariffs on Canadian aluminum. Trump ended the tariffs the next month ahead of Canada's planned retaliation.\nIn 2018 and 2019, Trump also placed major tariffs on China, totaling about  of tariffs on about  of products, which were largely kept in place by the subsequent administration of Joe Biden. The U.S. government has been concerned over China–Mexico trade, particularly in the automotive sector, because it fears that Chinese companies can use Mexico to export to the United States, circumventing tariffs on China and taking advantage of the USMCA. From October 2023 to October 2024, U.S. authorities apprehended 23,000 people illegally crossing across its northern border from Canada and 1.5&nbsp;million people illegally crossing its southern border from Mexico.\nCanadian politics\nTrump's 2024 presidential campaign outlined an economic strategy that emphasized the use of tariffs to fund proposed tax cuts and encourage domestic manufacturing in the United States. In November 2024, after winning the U.S. presidential election, Trump threatened 25 percent tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico, which he said would \"remain in effect until such time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country.\" Shortly after, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau—who has a contentious relationship with Trump—traveled to Trump's estate in Florida to speak with him and discuss the tariffs, as well as illegal immigration and drug smuggling across the Canada–U.S. border. On December16, Canada announced a plan to spend  () on border security to allay Trump's concerns. The plan included the creation of a joint U.S.–Canada \"strike force\" intended to combat transnational crime.\nOn January&nbsp;6, 2025, Trudeau declared his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and prime minister after the election of a new leader on March&nbsp;9. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario and head of the Council of the Federation, called a snap provincial election to be held on February&nbsp;27, saying that he wanted his Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario to have a stronger mandate to oppose Trump's impending tariffs on Canada. On January&nbsp;31, Trudeau stated on social media that Canada was \"ready with a forceful and immediate response\" if the U.S. proceeded with its decision to impose tariffs on Canadian exports.\nMexican politics\nSince Felipe Calderón's tenure as president of Mexico in 2012, U.S. law enforcement agents based in Mexico were able to collaborate with their Mexican counterparts to gather intelligence, design operations, conduct anti-corruption investigations, and carry out institutional reforms. However, in 2019, Andrés Manuel López Obrador began to scale back international cooperation in the Mexican drug war as part of his \"Hugs, not bullets\" plan. Opioids, predominantly fentanyl, have killed over 500,000 Americans since 2012. The opioid epidemic in the United States is largely fueled by drugs smuggled from Mexico; approximately 98 percent of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes from Mexico, while less than 1 percent comes from Canada. In 2021 and 2022, during the worst years of the opioid epidemic, over 100,000 people in the U.S. died annually from drug overdoses. In October 2024, Claudia Sheinbaum was inaugurated as president of Mexico. She was described as taking \"bold moves\" against Mexican drug cartels. Trump's presidential campaign also pledged the mass deportation of illegal immigrants in the United States—the majority of which are from Mexico. In response, Mexican officials created an initiative called \"Mexico Embraces You\" to welcome deported migrants.\nSecond Trump administration\nDuring his inaugural address on January 20, 2025, at the beginning of his second term, Trump said he would enact steep tariffs on other countries. He said that \"Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries\", the U.S. would \"tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens\". Trump said that both Canada and Mexico are allowing \"mass numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in\" to the U.S. across their borders. Approximately 0.2 percent of fentanyl entering the U.S. comes from Canada, while 98 percent comes from Mexico. Trump launched a process to designate Mexican drug cartels and other criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations. He also threatened U.S. military intervention against cartels in Mexico. Trump also said both countries were unfairly profiting from the United States's trade deficits. He has criticized the United States's trade deficit with Canada while citing inaccurate figures that claim it to be as much as .\nEven after Trump declared his intention to impose imminent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, U.S. companies did not make a concerted effort to import large quantities of goods to the United States before their enactment. On January 29, Sheinbaum said of Trump's threatened tariffs that \"We don't think its going to happen really\", and that \"if it happens, we also have our [retaliation] plan\", which she declined to detail. The Mexican foreign ministry said Mexican officials were in talks with the Trump administration.\nTrump also made repeated calls for Canada to be annexed by the United States as its \"51st state\", and said that while he would not use military coercion, he could use \"economic force\" to bring about Canadian annexation. Since the trade war began, Trudeau has said that Trump's comments should be taken as a serious threat against Canadian sovereignty and that Trump seeks to control Canada to access its mineral resources. In an interview, Trump said that his suggestions to annex Canada were serious, and argued that the U.S. trade deficit with Canada was \"essentially a subsidy\" and that Canada would be \"much better off\" in the United States. Trump has argued that Canadian statehood would make tariffs \"totally disappear\", lower Canadian taxes, and make the country more secure militarily, and called the Canada–U.S. border an \"artificial line that looks like it was done with a ruler\". Trudeau has said that Canadian annexation is \"never going to happen\".\nInitial tariff threats\n|alt=Photograph of a man]]\nOn February 1, 2025, Trump signed three executive orders imposing 25 percent tariffs on all goods from Mexico and Canada except for Canadian oil and energy exports, which received a 10 percent tariff. Mexican energy exports will be subject to the full 25 percent tariff. The orders were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and were set to take effect at 12:01&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 4. Trump also ordered 10 percent tariffs on China, which would be imposed in addition to the existing tariffs of up to 25 percent on many Chinese goods. The orders included a clause allowing the U.S. to increase its tariffs if the countries respond with their own tariffs or other retaliatory measures.\nTrump used the IEEPA—a 1977 U.S. law giving the president broad financial power during declared national emergencies—to circumvent the USMCA's tariff restriction for reasons other than national security, marking the first time the law was used to impose tariffs. Trump cited both the influx of illegal immigrants crossing the United States's borders with both Mexico and Canada, as well as the opioid epidemic in the United States fueled by fentanyl originating in China reaching the U.S. through Mexico and Canada. In the executive order, he said that Canada has played a \"central role\" in allowing fentanyl to enter the U.S. and that it has failed to \"devote sufficient attention and resources or meaningfully coordinate\" with the U.S. to \"stem the tide of illicit drugs,\" despite the vast majority of fentanyl in the U.S. coming from the southern border with Mexico. The tariffs are also aimed at forcing manufacturers to hire Americans to make their products in the U.S. instead of importing them from other countries. In later remarks, Trump repeated his hope for Canada to be annexed by the United States, and said that it could do so to avoid tariffs.\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Trump advisors Peter Navarro and Stephen Miller were the leading officials in the economic discussions regarding the imposition of tariffs. At the same time, China was included at the urging of the National Security Council. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: \"We need to protect Americans, and it is my duty as president to ensure the safety of all. I made a promise on my campaign to stop the flood of illegal aliens and drugs from pouring across our borders, and Americans overwhelmingly voted in favor of it.\" While he acknowledged that the tariffs could cause \"temporary short-term disruption,\" he said that they needed to be imposed. Trump also claimed that \"Tariffs don't cause inflation\" but rather that \"They cause success.\"\nCanadian response\n|alt=Photograph of a man]]\nHours after Trump imposed the tariffs on February 1, Trudeau said that Canada would retaliate against the United States with tariffs. He said that Canada would impose 25 percent tariffs on  () of American exports immediately after the U.S. tariffs take effect and impose 25 percent tariffs on a further  () worth of goods in the next three weeks. Trudeau said that the delay would allow Canadian businesses to prepare. He added that Canada was considering more retaliatory trade actions in addition to tariffs to force Trump to end the trade war, including export restrictions on critical minerals and energy products, or a ban on American companies bidding on government contracts.\nTrudeau stated that American liquor, vegetables, clothing, shoes, and perfume would be among the first products to face retaliatory tariffs, and that tariffs would also be imposed on consumer goods such as household appliances, furniture, and sports equipment. Canada's retaliation is aimed mainly at \"red states\" of the U.S., led by Trump's Republican Party. In his speech, Trudeau presented data showing that only about 1 percent of fentanyl imports and illegal border crossings to the United States come from its border with Canada. He called the U.S.–Canada relationship \"the most successful partnership the world has ever seen\" across all domains and accused Trump's tariffs of violating the USMCA. He also stated that the tariffs pose a threat to American consumers and industries, urging Canadians to \"choose Canadian products and services rather than American ones\" whenever possible. Trudeau stated: \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people. As I have consistently said, tariffs against Canada will put your jobs at risk, potentially shutting down American auto assembly plants and other manufacturing facilities.\"\nCanada's premiers also responded. Ontario premier Ford said that Canada has \"no choice but to hit back and hit back hard\" and ordered the Liquor Control Board of Ontario to end sales of American alcohol. The Premier of Alberta Danielle Smith, who had until then been opposed to aggressive trade action against the United States, said Canada needed to respond to Trump's \"mutually destructive policy\" and that she supported \"the strategic use\" of tariffs on U.S. goods \"that are more easily purchased from Canada and non-U.S. suppliers\". Premier François Legault of Quebec said he ordered Treasury Board president Sonia LeBel to \"review all procurement contracts involving American suppliers\" and penalize any that do business with Quebec's government. He also directed the Société des alcools du Québec to remove all American products from its shelves.\nIn Nova Scotia, Premier Tim Houston said the province will double highway tolls for U.S. vehicles and direct the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation to stop selling all U.S. liquor by February 4. Northwest Territories premier R.J. Simpson also announced that his government would review its procurement policies to eliminate purchases from U.S. companies where possible. Premier Wab Kinew of Manitoba and Premier Dennis King of Prince Edward Island both said that their provinces would stop importing American liquor, while British Columbia premier David Eby said the BC Liquor Distribution Branch would halt liquor purchases from Republican-led states. On March 10, this was then expanded to ban all U.S. alcohol. Legislation is also planned on being introduced that would tariff U.S. vehicles driving to Alaska through the province. Yukon premier Ranj Pillai said his territory's government would halt orders of U.S. alcohol, review its contracts with U.S. companies, and consider tolls on U.S. vehicles, but later said the measures would be put on hold until tariffs came into effect.\nPierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, condemned what he called \"massive, unjust and unjustified tariffs\". He urged that the government end the current prorogation of parliament to retaliate with measures including dollar-for-dollar tariffs on U.S. goods that he said would raise money to help \"affected workers and businesses\". He also repeated his demand for a \"massive\" tax cut and other efforts to bolster the economy.\nMexican response\n|alt=Photograph of a woman]]\nSheinbaum had spoken to Trump before his inauguration to de-escalate his tariff threats. Trump said that Sheinbaum had agreed to \"effectively closing\" the Mexico–U.S. border to avoid tariffs; Sheinbaum denied this, but said that \"there will not be a potential tariff war\". After Trump signed executive orders imposing 25 percent tariffs, Sheinbaum said Mexico would implement tariff and non-tariff retaliatory measures against the United States. She said the retaliation was \"in defense of Mexico's interests\". Sheinbaum did not specify which U.S. goods Mexico's retaliation would target, though media reports claimed Mexico had been preparing possible retaliatory tariffs ranging from 5 percent to 20 percent on pork, cheese, produce, steel, and aluminum; reports also claimed that Mexico intended to exempt the automotive industry from tariffs.\nMarcelo Ebrard, Mexico's secretary of economy, called Trump's tariffs a \"flagrant violation\" of the USMCA. Sheinbaum also responded to Trump's claim that she has an alliance with the Mexican drug cartels, calling it \"slander\". At an event on February 1, she said Mexico would keep a \"cool head\" in proceeding with its retaliations, and she proposed establishing a task force with the U.S. to address Trump's issues with Mexico and said that \"problems are not resolved by imposing tariffs\".\nOne-month delay\nOn February&nbsp;3, 2025, Sheinbaum and Trump mutually agreed to delay the tariffs on Mexico by one month, until March&nbsp;4. Sheinbaum accepted sending 10,000 troops from the Mexican National Guard to their border to prevent drug trafficking. Trump said the U.S. had pledged to take measures to curb weapons trafficking to Mexico. During their call, Trump complemented Sheinbaum, telling her \"You're tough\". After their call, Sheinbaum directed Mexican law enforcement agencies to target fentanyl gangs, and Mexican police raided opioid labs and arrested cartel members. On February&nbsp;27, Mexico transferred 29 cartel operatives, Sinaloa Cartel founding member Rafael Caro Quintero, to the United States to face criminal charges there. Sheinbaum's calm demeanor during calls with Trump and success in mitigating illegal immigration and fentanyl appeared to earn the respect of Trump and impressed members of his administration, including Stephen Miller, who is Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and the U.S. homeland security advisor. Trump later described Sheinbaum as \"a wonderful woman\" with whom he has a \"very good\" relationship.\nTrump also spoke to Trudeau on February&nbsp;3. During their call, he introduced concerns that Canada was not allowing U.S. banks to \"open or do business there\"; Canada allows American banks to operate commercially in the country but had restricted personal banking to protect its citizens from bank failure. The Canadian Bankers Association said that 16 U.S.-based bank subsidiaries and branches with around  () in assets are currently operating in Canada. After a second call that afternoon, Trump and Trudeau successfully negotiated a one-month delay on the tariffs.\nOfficials present for the call told The New York Times and the Toronto Star that in addition to concerns over banking, Trump also relayed grievances over Canada's protection of its dairy sector and Canadian consumption taxes that Trump said make American goods more expensive. Trump also said that the 1908 treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom that established the 49th parallel as the border between the U.S. and the dominion of Canada was invalid and that he wanted to revise it. Trudeau and his aides then scrambled to \"google\" the treaty, after which Trudeau told Trump that it had been superseded by the Canadian Constitution of 1982 and that the patriation of Canada from Britain under the premiership of Trudeau's father Pierre Elliott Trudeau had established Canada's full sovereignty over its territory.\nTrump also mentioned during the call that he wanted to revisit the numerous treaties regulating the sharing of lakes and rivers between the U.S. and Canada. In addition, he raised Canada's level of defense spending, and questioned whether Canada does \"anything\" to contribute to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), the joint U.S.–Canada air defense command that operates across North America.\nTrudeau told Trump that Canada would appoint a \"fentanyl czar\", list Mexican drug cartels as terrorists, create an intelligence directive targeting fentanyl and organized crime supported by  () in funding, and implement its  () border program and establish a Canada–U.S. joint strike force to combat organized crime, fentanyl, and money laundering. Trudeau also assured Trump that 10,000 personnel \"are and will be\" working on border security in Canada. In response, Trump issued an updated executive order changing the start date of the tariffs to March&nbsp;4 at 12:01&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Trump wrote on social media after the call that he was \"very pleased with this initial outcome\" and the tariffs had been delayed \"to see whether or not a final economic deal with Canada can be structured\". On February&nbsp;11, Canada appointed Kevin Brosseau, a former deputy national security advisor to Trudeau and former Royal Canadian Mounted Police senior, as the fentanyl czar.\nAfter the call between Trump and Trudeau on February&nbsp;3, Howard Lutnick, the incoming U.S. secretary of commerce called Dominic LeBlanc, the Canadian finance minister, who he had been communicating regularly since December 2024. Lutnick said that Trump had realized the U.S.–Canada relationship was governed by a series of agreements that could be quickly abandoned. He said Trump was interested in dissolving arrangements related to sharing and managing the Great Lakes, and reviewing military cooperation between the two countries, including NORAD. Lutnick also said Trump wanted to remove Canada from the Five Eyes, an intelligence-sharing alliance between the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand; the Financial Times reported that some officials in Trump's administration have sought to remove Canada from the alliance.\nMarco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, dismissed that the U.S. was reconsidering military cooperation with Canada. However, Canadian officials, despite initially believing Trump's suggestion of annexing Canada into the United States to be a joke, began to interpret it as a serious threat.\nSubsequent tariff threats\nOn February 10, 2025, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum entering the United States from all countries, including Canada and Mexico, which provide most of the U.S.'s metal imports. The steel and aluminum tariffs are set to enter force on March 12. Trump said those tariffs were \"the first of many\", and that over the next four weeks, he would discuss tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals, chips, and other goods with his team. In response, Trudeau called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and said he hoped talks with the Trump administration would resolve the issue, but that Canada will have a \"firm and clear\" response if needed. Shares of U.S. steelmakers rose in response to Trump's order, while prices for steel and aluminum rose.\nImposition of tariffs\nOn March&nbsp;3, Trump said that the tariffs that were delayed from February would take effect as planned on March&nbsp;4, and that there was \"no room left\" for Canada or Mexico to negotiate a last-minute deal with the United States to delay them further. Lutnick said that both Canada and Mexico had made progress on improving border security, but that neither had satisfied the U.S.'s demands to halt the flow of fentanyl into the United States. Canadian foreign minister Mélanie Joly said that Canada was prepared to respond, while Sheinbaum reaffirmed that Mexico's prior response plans would take effect when Trump's tariffs were imposed. U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico began as scheduled, at 12:01&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on March&nbsp;4.\nCanada's retaliation began simultaneously: 25 percent tariffs on  () of U.S. goods took effect on March&nbsp;4, and Trudeau affirmed that 25 percent tariffs on an additional  () of U.S. goods would take effect 21 days later, on March&nbsp;25. After the tariffs were imposed on March&nbsp;4, Trudeau said in a news conference that Trump's \"excuse\" for the tariffs of fentanyl was \"completely bogus\" and \"completely false\", and that Trump was imposing tariffs because he wished for \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy\" to \"make it easier\" for the U.S. to annex Canada. Trudeau called Trump's decision to impose tariffs \"very dumb\", and said Canada would \"not back down from a fight\".\nThe onset of the tariffs led to stock market declines in the U.S., especially for retailers and car manufacturers. On March&nbsp;5, Lutnick said Trump was \"listening to the offers from Mexico and Canada\" and \"thinking about trying to do something in the middle\", suggesting that tariffs could take effect at a less significant scale. Later that day, Trump granted a one-month exception from the tariffs for automakers compliant with USMCA regulations, which represent about 85 percent of passenger vehicles imported to the U.S. from Mexico in 2024. Trump decided after meeting with executives from the three largest U.S. automakers—Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis—who said that the tariffs would harm U.S. companies more than their foreign rivals.\nAfter the U.S. tariffs took effect on March&nbsp;4, Sheinbaum said she would announce Mexico's countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs, on March&nbsp;9. She cited plans to speak with Trump in the intervening days as the reason for her delayed response. Sheinbaum said that if the tariffs persisted, Mexico would \"reach out to Canada and other nations\" and could look for trading partners other than the U.S. or shift trade alliances \"if necessary\".\nTrump and Sheinbaum spoke by phone on March&nbsp;6. Sheinbaum began the call by listing to Trump her efforts to secure the Mexico–U.S. border and fight fentanyl trafficking, suggesting to him that the tariffs would make it more difficult for her to justify cooperation with the U.S. to a domestic audience. She sent Trump a chart showing how fentanyl seizures at the border had dropped dramatically since the 10,000 National Guard troops had arrived. During the call, Trump complimented Sheinbaum and asked her opinion of Trudeau, calling her \"lucky\" after she responded that they rarely talked. While Sheinbaum recounted that Trump initially refused to lift tariffs, by the end of their call Trump offered exclusions for many Mexican goods.\nUSMCA exemption\nAfter speaking to Sheinbaum, Trump posted on social media that he would delay tariffs on all USMCA-compliant goods until April&nbsp;2 \"out of respect\" for Sheinbaum, and thanked her for her \"hard work and cooperation\". Immediately afterward, Sheinbaum wrote on Twitter that she and Trump had an \"excellent and respectful\" call and thanked Trump, saying the two had \"agreed that our work and collaboration have yielded unprecedented results\".\nTrudeau and Trump had spoken by phone on March 5, and Trump said their conversation ended on a \"somewhat 'friendly note. After Sheinbaum's call, Trump extended the delay of tariffs on USMCA-compliant products to Canada on March&nbsp;6.  After Trump's announcement, Canadian officials said that the planned increases in their retaliatory tariffs would be suspended, though the initial tariffs on the U.S. would remain in place.\nAlthough only about 50 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico and 38 percent of U.S. imports from Canada were USMCA-compliant in 2024, many countries had not filed the requisite paperwork because previous tariff levels were so low. Both Canada and Mexico believed that nearly all of their exports would be quickly made compliant. The Royal Bank of Canada estimated that almost 90% of Canadian exports entered the U.S. duty free in April 2025, and by August said 100% of Canadian energy exports and 95% of other exports were compliant with the trade pact.\nCourse of the trade war\nOn March&nbsp;7, Trump threatened reciprocal tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy products. He said the tariffs would be as high as about 250 percent and take effect the following week. Later, Trump said that Canada \"must immediately drop their Anti-American Farmer Tariff of 250 percent to 390 percent on various U.S. dairy products, which has long been considered outrageous.\" Canada's tariff-rate quota on U.S. dairy products allows a certain amount of U.S. dairy products to enter the country without facing tariffs, with high tariffs only imposed if the imports surpass a certain amount. Since U.S. dairy exports to Canada have never exceeded the quota, the Canadian tariffs have never been activated.\nOn March&nbsp;9, the day Sheinbaum had planned to announce Mexico's retaliation, she held an event in Mexico City's central plaza to celebrate the delay on the U.S. tariffs, which tens of thousands of Mexicans attended. Sheinbaum said during the event that \"Fortunately, dialogue and respect have prevailed\" and they she was optimistic that Mexico would not be given further tariffs and that she would negotiate with Trump with a \"cool head\".\nBeginning on March&nbsp;10, Ontario imposed a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S. states of Michigan, Minnesota, and New York. The next day, Trump said that Canada would face 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum on March&nbsp;12, rather than the 25 percent tariffs imposed on every other country. Ford said that afternoon that he would suspend the surcharge on electricity exports, saying \"The temperature needs to come down.\" In response, Trump said that the U.S. would only impose 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. On March&nbsp;13, the day after those tariffs entered force, Canada imposed 25 percent tariffs on an additional  () of U.S. goods. In a joint statement, Ford and Lutnick said that U.S. and Canadian officials would meet in Washington, D.C., on March 13 to discuss a \"renewed USMCA\"., Trudeau's successor as prime minister]]On March&nbsp;9, Mark Carney won the Liberal Party leadership election to succeed Trudeau as Canadian prime minister. In his acceptance speech, he said that he supported the Trudeau government's retaliatory tariffs and that his government would keep them in place \"until the Americans show us respect.\" As prime minister–designate, he called Trump's threats to impose tariffs on dairy and metals \"an attack on Canadian workers, families, and businesses\", and that his government would ensure that its response had a \"maximum impact in the U.S. and minimal impact here in Canada.\" He added that tariffs would remain until the U.S. made \"credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade.\" Carney was sworn in on March&nbsp;14, beginning his premiership.\nTrump pledged to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs on all countries beginning in April&nbsp;2. Regarding Canada, he said that if it did not drop \"egregious, long time Tariffs\" by April&nbsp;2, he would \"substantially increase\" tariffs on Canadian cars entering the U.S. to \"essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.\" Trump later announced that 25 percent tariffs on all imported cars and car parts would enter force on April&nbsp;2. In response, Carney said that \"it clear that the United States is no longer a reliable partner\", and that while \"it is possible that, with comprehensive negotiations, we will be able to restore some trust\", \"there will be no turning back\" in the Canada–U.S. relationship.\nCarney and Trump spoke directly for the first time in a phone call on March&nbsp;28. Carney called the call \"very cordial\" and \"substantial\", and said that Trump \"respected Canada's sovereignty\". Trump described his call as \"extremely productive\" and said that he and Carney \"agree on many things\". Trump referred to Carney as the \"prime minister of Canada\", whereas he had addressed Trudeau as the \"governor\" of Canada as a U.S. state. In addition, Trump said that he believes \"things will work out very well between Canada and the United States\". Carney told Trump that Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. tariffs planned for April&nbsp;2 came into effect. Both leaders agreed to start \"comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship\" between Canada and the U.S. after the Canadian federal election on April&nbsp;28.\nOn April&nbsp;2, when Trump imposed universal 10 percent tariffs on imports from all countries, Canada and Mexico were exempted; the countries faced no new tariffs from the U.S. and the exemption given to most USMCA-compliant goods was extended indefinitely. The same day, the U.S. Senate narrowly approved a measure that would revoke some of Trump's tariffs on Canada. Four senators from the Republican Party (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell) joined all senators of the opposition Democratic Party in passing the resolution. However, the measure also needs to pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to take effect, in which Republican leaders have much more power to block it.\nSheinbaum said that Mexico had been given \"preferential treatment\" by the U.S. and that Canada and Mexico had avoided additional tariffs because of the USMCA. She added that U.S. and Mexican officials had a \"mutual respect\" relationship. Mexican economy secretary Ebrard said that the worldwide U.S. tariffs could help Mexico by making it cheaper to do business there relative to other countries. Despite Canada's exclusion, Carney denounced the tariffs and said they would \"rupture the global economy\" and harm economic growth. He also said he would seek to assemble a \"coalition of like-minded countries\" to create an alternative to the U.S., and that \"if the United States no longer wants to lead, Canada will\". He declared: \"The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect and championed the free and open exchange of goods and services, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality.\"\nTrump announced universal 25 percent tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts on March&nbsp;27, which came into effect on April&nbsp;3. When the U.S. tariffs began, Carney announced that Canada would retaliate with a 25 percent tariff on U.S. cars and trucks imported into Canada and that Canada would use the money generated from the tariffs to support people and businesses negatively impacted by U.S. tariffs. Sheinbaum said that the U.S. auto export tariffs were a concern for Mexico and that she hoped to continue speaking to U.S. officials to lower tariffs on auto exports, steel, and aluminum. Rather than retaliating with tariffs, however, Sheinbaum announced that Mexico would try to mitigate the impact of the tariffs by increasing domestic production of corn, beans, and rice, in addition to fuel and refined oil products to reduce its dependence on U.S. natural gas.\nOn April 11, Trump threatened Mexico with further tariffs and sanctions, saying that it was violating its obligation under the 1944 treaty between the two countries relating to water resources in the Tijuana, Colorado, and Rio Grande rivers. Despite the treaty requiring that Mexico deliver to the United States 1.75 million acre-feet of water every five years, it had offered less than 500,000 from October 2020 to December 2024. Trump accused Mexico of \"stealing the water from Texas farmers\". Sheinbaum acknowledged that Mexico had failed to fulfill its commitments under the treaty: She said that the 2020–2023 North American drought had prevented Mexico from providing the full amount of water, but that \"to the extent of water availability, Mexico has been complying\". Sheinbaum said that Mexico had sent \"a comprehensive proposal\" to the U.S. to resolve the issue, and said that \"I am sure that, as in other matters, an agreement will be reached\". On April&nbsp;28, Mexico and the U.S. jointly announced an agreement in which Mexico would immediately transfer some of its water reserves to the United States and give the country a larger share of the water from the Rio Grande through October 2025, and Mexico said the U.S. had agreed not to seek renegotiation of the 1944 water treaty.\nOn April 15, Canada announced several measures to provide relief from tariffs, including a 6-month pause on tariffs for goods imported from the U.S. to be used in \"Canadian manufacturing, processing and food and beverage packaging, and for those used to support public health, health care, public safety, and national security objectives.\" The country also exempted automakers that continue manufacturing in Canada from retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. and began accepting applicants to the \"Large Enterprise Tariff Loan Facility\" (LETL) program, which supports large Canadian businesses struggling to obtain access to liquidity.\nEvents after the Canadian federal election\nCarney led the Liberal Party to victory in the April&nbsp;28 Canadian federal election, with the party winning enough seats to form a minority government. Carney had campaigned on a promise to stand up to Trump's threats and protect Canada's economy; after winning, he declared: \"Trump is trying to break us so he can own us. That will never happen.\" The day after the election, Trump called Carney  to congratulate him on his victory; in a news conference on May&nbsp;2, Carney said he and Trump had agreed to travel and meet in Washington, D.C., on May&nbsp;6.\nin May 2025]]\nduring their May 2025 meeting]]\nCarney met Trump at the White House on May&nbsp;6. Carney characterized the meeting, which was two hours long and included a 75-minute one-on-one meeting between the two leaders, as \"very positive\", and Trump said it went \"very well\" with \"no tension\". Trump largely refrained from criticizing Carney or Canada, calling Canada \"a very special place\" to him and responded to a reporter's question about what \"concession\" he wanted from Canada by saying he only sought \"friendship\". When Trump claimed that Canada would be better off as a part of the U.S., Carney told Trump: \"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are not for sale,\" and that \"Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale ever.\" In response, Trump said \"never say never\" but did not press the matter further.\nSpeaking to reporters at the Canadian Embassy in Washington after the meeting, Carney said that during the meeting Canada \"began the renegotiation of our trading relationship\" with the U.S. and that Trump had committed to negotiate a new Canada–U.S. trade agreement. During their meeting, Trump and Carney also discussed foreign policy issues such as the Russia–Ukraine war, the Middle Eastern crisis, and China. Carney said he told Trump that it was not \"useful\" for him to continue referring to Canada as the \"51st state\" and threatening annexation. After the meeting, Trump echoed Carney's statement that the meeting set Canada–U.S. relations on a better trajectory and called Carney \"a big step up\" as a leader, criticizing Trudeau and former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland. Carney said he and Trump would meet next at the 51st G7 summit in June, which Canada hosted in Kananaskis, Alberta.\nBy May 14, 2025, consulting group Oxford Economics estimated that Canada had \"effectively suspended almost all of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products\" following the exemptions implemented a month prior. Minister of Finance François-Philippe Champagne called this a \"falsehood\", and stated that 70 percent of the tariffs were still in place.\nOn June 4, U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs doubled to 50 percent. Carney said Canada was in intense negotiations with the U.S. but preparing reprisals if they failed. Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, stated 23,000 steel jobs and another 9,500 aluminum jobs would be impacted within days. At the G7 summit on June 16, the two countries pledged to work on a deal with the next 30 days. In a June 20 press conference, Carney said Canada would increase its counter-tariffs on steel and aluminium products, at the time 25%, on July 21 if talks with the United States stalled.\nCarney invited Sheinbaum to the G7 summit, though Trump departed the summit early on June 15 to deal with the Israel–Iran war, missing a scheduled meeting between him and Sheinbaum. On June 27 U.S. president Donald Trump announced the suspension of the trade talks with Canada, also announcing new tariffs on goods crossing the Canada–United States border. That was reverted on June 30, when White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett announced the restart of the trade talks with Canada after the country scrapped its digital services tax on Canadian-source revenue received by large technology firms (which mainly affected American companies including Amazon, Meta, and Google).\nOn July 11, Trump announced in a letter sent to Carney that the US would raise the tariffs to 35%, starting August 1. He cited the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada against the US as the main reason, as well as the continued flow of fentanyl into the US from Canada and the trade deficit with Canada. The letter also stated that if Canada raised its tariffs against the US, the US would raise its tariffs by that percentage on top of the existing 35%, as well as saying if Canada works with the US to stop the flow of fentanyl, the US may adjust the tariffs upwards or downwards, based on the relationships with Canada.\nOn August 5, the Associated Press reported that due to the USMCA exemption, as of August 2025, over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade and 84% of Mexico-U.S. trade remains tariff-free.\nOn August 22, Carney announced Canada would drop many of their retaliatory tariffs by matching the USMCA exemption in order to jump start trade talks. \"Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States. And while it’s different from what we had before, it’s still better than that of any other country,\" said Carney.\nOn October 23, Trump announced that all trade negotiations with Canada were canceled after the Ontario government published a public service announcement with audio clips of former US president Ronald Reagan stating that tariffs on foreign goods are poor policy in the long term. Trump later said he would raise tariffs on Canada by \"more than 10%\" in response to the advertisement.\nReactions and responses\nCanadian reactions\nThe United States tariffs and threats against Canada have harmed historically strong Canada–U.S. relations, caused increases in Canadian nationalism and patriotism, and led to an uptick in anti-Americanism.\nIn February 2025, a poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that 91 percent of Canadians expressed a desire to decrease Canada's reliance on the U.S. as a trade partner; it also showed a 10 percentage-point increase in Canadians saying they are \"very proud\" of and \"have a deep emotional attachment\" to Canada compared to December 2024. An Ipsos poll in February 2025 found that, after Trump's threats, 68 percent of Canadians thought less of the United States, while 65 percent said they would avoid traveling to the U.S. and 67 percent said they would avoid buying U.S.-made products. The same month, a Léger poll found that 27 percent of Canadians considered the U.S. an \"enemy\", while only 1 percent of Americans thought the same of Canada. store in Ontario featuring a Canadian flag reading \"Canadian owned and operated\"|alt=The facade of a Canadian Tire with a banner reading \"Canadian owned and operated\" on a Canadian flag|left]]In the days after the initial tariff announcements, Canadian crowds booed the U.S. national anthem at sporting events featuring American teams. Many Canadians began a boycott of American goods and travel to the United States and a \"Buy Canadian\" movement gained traction across the country. As prime minister, Trudeau supported the Canadian boycott.\nMany Canadian politicians, including Trudeau and Poilievre, spoke of national unity, and the trade war and conflict with the U.S. created a rally 'round the flag effect in the lead-up to the 2025 Canadian federal election. Both Canadians across the political spectrum and Canadian society at large have grown concerned over threats from the United States; Canadian politicians have a motive to \"push back immediately and forcefully\" against Trump and the U.S. because of the threats to Canadian sovereignty.\nThe trade war also increased support for the removal of trade barriers between Canada's provinces, which Trudeau said that all premiers support but that \"challenges within bureaucracies\" persist. Simultaneously, Alberta premier Danielle Smith pledged to hold a referendum on Albertan separatism in 2026 if enough voters sign a petition in favor of doing so.\nWhereas in early January 2025 the Liberals had trailed the Conservatives in federal election opinion polls by over 20 points for months, the party began to close the gap in polls after the trade war began and Trudeau announced his resignation. Support for the New Democratic Party and Bloc Québécois also fell dramatically, and polling suggested a close race between the Carney-led Liberals and the Poilievre-led Conservatives.\nIn February 2025, following Trump's initial announcement, Canadian travel to the United States dropped by 40 percent compared to February 2024.  A March 2025 Abacus Data poll found that 62 percent of Canadians planned to avoid traveling to the U.S. for the next year, and American tourism groups are worried they will lose Canadian tourist traffic. The mayor of Haines, Alaska, a town connected to the outside world only through Yukon, has expressed concern that the tariffs will affect the normally friendly relations between Americans and Canadians. The shift in Canadian travel away from the U.S. could amount to an annual loss of  for the U.S. economy. In March 2025, the Trump administration said that beginning on April&nbsp;11, 2025, Canadians entering the U.S. for more than 30 days are required to register with authorities and be fingerprinted.\nOther reactions\nThe tariffs could affect negotiations on renewing the USMCA, for which a review is due in 2026. Trump has ordered U.S. officials to review and report how to correct \"unfair\" trade practices by April&nbsp;1, 2025. Canadian officials have grown concerned that Trump may threaten tariffs to force changes to the agreement.\nIn the United States, a February 2025 survey by The Harris Poll for Bloomberg News found that around 60 percent of Americans believe that high tariffs could cause consumer prices to rise. The following month, a poll by the University of Michigan found that the number of Americans expressing confidence in the economy fell by 11 percent in March 2025, and that the number expecting inflation rose. In the United States, Trump's initial decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico was criticized by the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, which said that his \"justification for this economic assault on the neighbors makes no sense\" and that Trump had begun \"the dumbest trade war in history\".\nMany Americans believe Trump's threats to annex Canada are a joke or a negotiation strategy, and Trump's tariff policy in general raised questions about whether he has a serious intent to impose tariffs or whether his orders to impose them are threats intended only to serve as a negotiation tactic. The imposition and rollback of tariffs created uncertainty for many businesses, and has led to an erosion of international confidence in the U.S. as a reliable trade partner.\nAccording to Deutsche Welle, Trump's imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico violated both the USMCA and the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), of which all three countries are members. On March&nbsp;13, 2025, the WTO said that Canada had formally requested to begin dispute resolution proceedings with the United States, saying that the tariffs violated the U.S.'s commitments under the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. On April&nbsp;7, Canada also initiated WTO dispute resolution proceedings regarding the U.S. tariffs on cars and car parts.\nIn Mexico, the government and local businesses aimed to bolster a \"Made in Mexico\" campaign to promote domestic products. Some Mexicans called for boycotts of U.S. products after Trump's initial threat of tariffs, and a poll by the Mexican firm Buendía & Márquez found that 80 percent of Mexicans held a negative opinion of Trump in mid-February 2025, an increase from 66 percent in early January. Sheinbaum's approval rating also rose, with some polls in February 2025 suggesting that it exceeds 80 percent.\nThe European Commission—the executive branch of the European Union—condemned U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and called for the U.S. to \"reconsider its approach\".\nEconomic impact\nStock market\nThe trade war led investors to fear that tariffs could create inflation by causing rises in both manufacturing costs and consumer prices, leading to volatility in the U.S. stock market. Trump has characterized the economy as being in \"period of transition\" for the start of his presidency. On March&nbsp;3, after Trump confirmed the imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as the increase of tariffs on China from 10 percent to 20 percent set to take place the same day, the U.S. stock markets dropped considerably: the S&P 500 index fell by 1.8 percent, while the Nasdaq-100 index fell by 2.6 percent. By March&nbsp;6, the S&P 500 had lost almost all of its gains since November 2024.\nOn March 9, Trump declined to say whether his policies could lead to a recession in the United States. He said in an interview with Fox News that it would take time to see the payoff from his policies, but that they would ultimately be worthwhile, saying \"If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters, and you can't go by that. You have to do what's right.\" The next day, the S&P 500 dropped an additional 2.7 percent—its largest single-day drop of 2025—and the Nasdaq by 4 percent. On March&nbsp;10, the S&P 500 fell by 1.4 percent, pushing it into a correction, which is defined as a fall in a stock market index of over 10 percent from its peak; the S&P 500 was 10.1 percent lower than its record high, which was on February&nbsp;19. The market's losses were equivalent to over  in value; the Nasdaq-100 and Russell 2000 indices had already entered corrections. On March&nbsp;11, the S&P 500 rose by 2.1 percent, exiting a correction, though ending the week down 2.3 percent. After Trump's April&nbsp;2 tariffs, the S&P 500 fell over 10 percent in two days, in its worst week since the COVID-19 recession of 2020.\nIn Canada and Mexico, stock markets were more stable. By March&nbsp;6, Mexico's most prominent stock market index, the Índice de Precios y Cotizaciones, had risen 6 percent since the beginning of 2025. Canada's benchmark index, the S&P/TSX, was almost the same level it began the year.\nProspective effects\nThe trade war is expected to significantly disrupt trade between the United States, Mexico, and Canada and upend supply chains across North America. Many economists have expressed skepticism over the effectiveness of Trump's strategy in imposing tariffs, and many have said that increased tariffs would raise the prices of consumer goods in the U.S. and worsen the country's cost-of-living crisis. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that the tariffs would lead to a loss of about  in purchasing power for the typical American household. While some companies will opt to bear the cost of the tariff, others are likely to raise prices on consumer products to offset lost revenue or attempt to negotiate lower prices for their products.\nBecause the United States does not produce enough oil to satisfy its demand, 10 percent tariffs on Canadian oil and energy will likely lead to an increased oil price across the United States. This is especially true in the Midwest, a region heavily reliant on oil imported from Alberta. The Canadian government had previously said that U.S. gas prices could increase by  per gallon overnight if tariffs were imposed. Tariffs could also increase the cost of electricity in some U.S. states, especially those that rely on Canadian provinces like Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia for energy. Outside North America, tariffs on energy imports would give European and Asian oil refineries a competitive advantage against their rivals.\nThe tariffs could also lead to price increases in various U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, including fruits, vegetables, beer, liquor, and electronics from Mexico and potatoes, grains, lumber, and steel from Canada. Price increases would compound with high inflation in the U.S., especially in grocery prices. The cost of Canadian lumber, used by many homebuilders in the U.S., would also likely increase. The tariffs would also cause risk to the U.S. farming and fishing industries.\nThe tariffs pose a risk of \"severe recession\" in Mexico if maintained. A year-long 25 percent tariff could cause Mexican exports to fall by around 12 percent, ultimately leading to a 4 percent decline in the country's gross domestic product in 2025. The American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico, the group representing U.S. companies in the country, said tariffs would harm both economies and \"fail to address the real challenges of security, migration and drug trafficking\". The Mexican automobile industry is likely to be most susceptible to upheaval from the tariffs, alongside the electric equipment sector, making it the largest beneficiary of the reprieve given to USMCA-compliant car imports.\nCanada, a highly trade-dependent economy, will also likely suffer, experiencing harmed economic growth and increased prices for businesses and consumers. The Canadian economy could enter a recession within six months if the tariffs are maintained. Quebec premier Legault said that the U.S. tariffs could cause the loss of as many as 100,000 Canadian jobs within the province. Prices could also increase in Canada for even domestically produced products, mainly if the tariffs cause economic difficulties for smaller businesses. Canadian companies being unable to sell their products to Americans at the same volume would also cause some of them to cut workers, scale back, or even shut down entirely. Canada's mineral processing industry will likely be significantly harmed by the tariffs.\nSee also\n*\n* China–United States trade war\n* Tariffs in the second Trump administration\nNotes\nReferences"
