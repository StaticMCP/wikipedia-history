Ward thrived in the American Amateur Baseball Congress-sponsored baseball leagues and graduated from Farmington High School, home of the Scorpions. He was drafted out of high school in 1982. Ward also starred in the Connie Mack World Series, a baseball tournament for 18-and-under players that has been hosted in Farmington since 1965.\nSince 1988, Ward has lived in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nEarly career\nA hard-throwing pitcher, Ward was drafted with the ninth pick in the 1st round of the 1982 amateur draft by the Atlanta Braves. He is tied with Jim Kremmel (1971) for the second-highest draft pick of players hailing from New Mexico, behind shortstop Alex Bregman, who was selected with the second pick in the first round of the 2015 MLB draft. He made his major league debut on April 12, 1986, but after limited success was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays on July 6 for pitcher Doyle Alexander.\nSetup man\nWard became one of the Jays' most dependable middle and late inning relievers in 1988, and remained in the role through the 1992 season, when the Blue Jays won their first World Series. His pitching repertoire featured a lively, mid-90s fastball and a hard slider.\nCloser\nAfter years of being in Tom Henke's shadow, Ward took over the closer's role in 1993. In the regular season, Ward set Toronto's single-season team record for saves with 45. He was tied with Jeff Montgomery of the Kansas City Royals for most saves in the American League. Ward was the closing pitcher for the American League in its 9–3 victory at the 1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.  In helping the Blue Jays repeat as World Series Champions in 1993 Ward reached the peak of his career and, unexpectedly, the last significant duty of his career.\nIn the 1993 World Series, Ward earned two saves over Philadelphia, in Game 1 (8–5 save, in Toronto) and in the wild Toronto 15–14 victory in Game 4 in Philadelphia, when Ward got the last four outs after Toronto scored the final six runs of the game. Ward was the winning pitcher for the decisive Game 6 in which Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run after Ward pitched in relief.\nThe rest of Ward's career was beset by injuries and he would never save another Major League game after 1993. After missing the entire 1994 season due to biceps tendinitis, he retired from the Toronto Blue Jays after pitching just four games during the 1995 season. He finished his career with a 3.28 ERA and 121 saves.\nBroadcasting\nSince 2014, Ward has been featured on the Blue Jays' radio broadcasts for Sportsnet 590 The Fan. He occasionally fills in for regular colour commentator Joe Siddall.\nSee also\n* List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders\nReferences\nExternal links"
