While holding this position, he conceptualized and oversaw the planning of a $5 million housing project built on Mills estate land located to the west of the Tanforan naval installation in San Bruno, California. The project was planned in order to replace the existing Homaja housing project, which was earmarked for demolition in order to clear land for a new roadway connecting San Bruno Avenue to Junipero Serra Boulevard. On 5 May 1953, after the depot he was serving in had been disestablished, Ransford announced that he  had been detached from his duties as a district public works officer and was reassigned to serve as the commander officer at Naval Construction Battalion Center Port Hueneme in Port Hueneme, California, overseeing the training of Seabees (Navy Construction Battalions); replacing Adm. John R. Perry in the position effective 7 May 1953. The duties that Ransford had carrying out in overseeing projects in San Bruno were reassigned to  Capt. George K. Brodie, who was assigned as district public works officer at Mare Island. At the time Ransford left San Bruno, the planning and approval was in an advanced stage, having been approved by the Navy Department and pending congressional review.\nLater life and career\nReferences"
