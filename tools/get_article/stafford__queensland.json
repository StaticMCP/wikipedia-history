In the , Stafford had a population of 6,978 people.\nGeography\nStafford is predominantly a residential suburb, including some original Queenslander-style homes and a significant number of post-war Queensland Housing Commission homes on quarter-acre blocks built around the 1940s and 1950s.\nStafford lies to the west of Lutwyche Road, along the banks of Kedron Brook. Being an area of that age, many of Stafford's residents are elderly, but younger families are increasingly moving there.\nSparkes Hill () is in the south-west of the suburb and is  above sea level. The water reservoir on the top of the hill holds , which 16% of Brisbane's water supply.\nHistory\nStafford was originally called Happy Valley. It is possible that the name originates from the fact that Sir Thomas Brisbane for whom the city is named was an officer in the Staffordshire Regiment – a Stafford Knot is featured in the city's coat-of-arms. A public move to rename the area after the English county of Staffordshire in 1885 and 1886 led to its current name.\nStafford State School opened on 25 May 1886. On 24 January 1955, the Stafford Infants State School opened removing the younger children from the main. The infant school closed on 9 December 1977, and the younger children became part of the main school again.  The Stafford area was originally known as Happy Valley, and the earliest school registers list the school's name at that time as either Happy Valley (Lutwyche) State School or Stafford (Happy Valley) State School.\nIn 1928, in what is now known as Stafford, 20 sites at Gourock Estate, Kedron—being resubdivisions 1 to 20 (subs A & B easements) of subdivision 1 of portion 96, Parish of Kedron—were advertised for auction by Isles, Love & Co. Auctioneers. A map produced to advertise the sale shows the land for sale being off Main Stafford (or Happy Valley) Road, near Clifford St.\nBetween 1940 and 1968 Stafford was served by electric trams operated by the Brisbane City Council. This was the last completely new tram line (as distinct from the tram line extension) built in Brisbane.\nThe Stafford Church of Christ was established through an outreach of the Kedron Church of Christ in the early 1950s commencing with Bible schools. Land at 610 Stafford Street () was purchased circa October 1952. In January 1953, an old army hut was relocated to the site to be converted to a chapel. The new chapel was dedicated early in March 1954. In 1963, the Stafford church became independent of the Kedron church. It is now known as the Fellowship Baptist Church of Christ.\nQueen of Apostles Catholic Primary School opened on 30 January 1962. In 1969, it opened its second campus for the younger students in neighbouring Stafford Heights to the north.\nConstruction commenced on the water reservoirs on top of Sparkes Hill in 1973 and was completed in 1978.\nOne of the original large employers of local workers, Gibson's Tannery (also known as Scotia Works), closed in 1982 to make way for the Stafford City Shopping Centre, which opened in March 1984. The centre was extended again in 1997, which opened in December of that year to include a new food court and the first 10-screen cinema complex in Brisbane at the time, operated by Australian Multiplex Cinemas. Previously, the Stafford Road shopping strip at the tram terminus was the local centre.\nDemographics\nIn the , Stafford had a population of 6,561 people.\nIn the , Stafford had a population of 6,978 people, 51% female and 49% male.
