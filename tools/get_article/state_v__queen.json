Felicity is captured by the Count. In order to protect Felicity from being injected with Vertigo, Oliver is forced to kill the Count. Meanwhile, Blood, revealed to had hired the Count to kill the vigilante, now known as Arrow, is informed that one of his test subjects named Cyrus Gold has survived his injection, feeling \"stronger\". Ultimately, Moira is exonerated by the jury; she later learns that Malcolm, alive and well, had rigged the trial. He also reveals that he now knows Thea is his biological daughter.

Club rated the episode B+, complimenting \"how well Arrow can juggle its labyrinthine continuity\" in response to the return of the \"Broken Dolls\", as well as Stephen Amell's \"subtle acting\" after killing the Count. The main event of the episode, the titular trial was described as a \"letdown\" by Wilkins due to the underwhelming revelation that Moira Queen had a brief affair with Malcolm Merlyn. Wilkins is optimistic about the future, noting the verdict as an \"intriguing test of Arrow's storytelling discipline to see how it develops that idea\".\nMike Cecchini of Den of Geek rated the episode one out of five stars, describing it as a \"major misstep\" and \"a tremendous step backwards\". Cecchini criticized the absurdness of the Count's storyline. However, Cecchini complimented Malcolm Merlyn's dramatic return and two well-placed moments of utter competency for Felicity Smoak which established her inclusion on the team and lightens the tone.\nJesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 7.4, noting that Count Vertigo let the episode down with \"bad acting and \"copycat Joker\" writing\". Schedeen praised the writers use of Ollie's new vow against killing to great effect in this episode.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
