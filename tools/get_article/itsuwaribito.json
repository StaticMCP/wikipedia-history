It was serialized in Shogakukan's  manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday, running from January 2009 to February 2010, and it was subsequently transferred to the Club Sunday website, where it ran from February 2010 to August 2013. Its chapters were collected in 23  volumes. In North America, it was licensed for English release by Viz Media.\nPlot\nUtsuho's childhood honesty inadvertently caused a major disaster, leading him to adopt a life of deception thereafter. Raised in an orphan village by a monk, he became a habitual troublemaker. Though the monk encouraged him to aid others, Utsuho refused to abandon his deceitful ways, instead resolving to use his talent for trickery for benevolent purposes.\nDuring his travels, he befriended three companions: Pochi, an innocent ; Yakuma, a disciplined and skilled young doctor; and Neya, a graceful teenage Itsuwaribito (professional liar) with a guileless demeanor. Together, they journeyed across Japan, where Utsuho sought to expand his makeshift family and assist others through his lies.\nCharacters\nMain characters of the series. Counter-clockwise from bottom center: Utsuho (with Pochi in front of him), Neya, Iwashi, Hikae, Uzume, Minamo, Chouza and Yakuma.\n;:\n:A skilled white-haired teenaged boy deceiver who adopts lying as a philosophy after childhood trauma. Orphaned when thieves murdered his parents—a tragedy he blames on his own truthful testimony as a child—he is taken in by a priest who implores him on his deathbed to \"believe in people\" while tasking him with saving 1,000 lives. Utsuho embarks on this mission as an Itsuwaribito (professional liar), wielding dual blades and excelling in combat strategy, bomb-making, disguise, and medical aid. Though he revels in tricking others—particularly his frequent target Yakuma—he despises being deceived himself. His Kansai dialect and book-learned knowledge often contrast with his childlike excitement when encountering new experiences.\n;\n:A young, genderless  who speaks human language and refers to itself in the first person. Rescued by Utsuho from a trapper who killed its mother, Pochi becomes the first companion on Utsuho's mission to save 1,000 people. Noted for its polite speech (adding \"-san\" to names) and optimistic naivety, Pochi serves as Utsuho's moral opposite - incapable of deception but gifted with pure-hearted simplicity that enables it to acquire the \"Seven-Colored Rainbow,\" one of the Nine Treasures others could not obtain. Though initially timid, Pochi develops courage under Utsuho's influence, eventually confronting danger to protect its savior. Its childlike personality manifests in drawn-out speech patterns marked by tilde symbols and enthusiastic hand-clapping when moved.\n;\n:An 18-year-old foreign physician serving as the serious  counterpart to Utsuho's antics. Despite initially distrusting itsuwaribito, he becomes a trusted ally valued for his medical expertise, physical strength, and sharp perception—able to detect disguises and unspoken affections. His protective nature toward the group earns him maternal nicknames. Summoned by the emperor for treatment, he pursues a cure with devotion to the empress that transcends professional duty.\n;\n:Neya is a 16-year-old female Itsuwaribito exiled to Nadeshiko Island despite committing no crimes. With crimson eyes and pink-tinted hair, she speaks in refined aristocratic language and wields kunai concealed by her bow. Though skilled in deception (having even tricked Utsuho), she exhibits occasional clumsiness that belies her composed demeanor. After overstaying her prison term to care for the island's children, the villagers manipulated her departure with Utsuho, inspiring her goal to establish a mainland settlement for them. She harbors unrequited affection for Utsuho while recruiting Yakuma as the prospective village doctor. Orphaned in youth, Neya was adopted by Princess Oni-hime as a body double due to their identical appearance. Their sisterly bond ended when the princess sacrificed herself during a castle attack, gifting Neya the Peacock Feather treasure before her death. This tragedy led Neya to seek refuge on Nadeshiko Island.\n;\n:A guardian of the , one of the Nine Treasures. With beast-like eyes and spiked green hair tied with a bandana, Hikae claims to have lived over 500 years—a plausible assertion given his rapid healing from fatal wounds and immunity to poisons. He exhibits an enigmatic, amoral personality, valuing only entertainment and showing particular disdain for Neya and Yakuma while favoring Utsuho and Pochi. His philosophy centers on seeking amusement above all else, disregarding conventional morality. After suffering a mental breakdown during a treasure trial alongside Utsuho, Hikae joins the group as an ally. His extensive knowledge of the Nine Treasures frequently guides their travels, though his inappropriate remarks often cause conflicts. As a combatant, he wields  (bladed gloves). His immortal physiology requires neither food nor sleep, making him an ever-vigilant night watchman.\n;\n:A 20-year-old ruler of the male-exclusive Yome Mura (Bride Village). She possesses the Cherry Blossom Rouge treasure and takes pride in her renowned beauty, often wearing revealing clothing to showcase her flawless skin. Initially despising anything unattractive, she rebuilt her village and banished men, animals, and the infirm. Her perspective changes after Utsuho presents her with a mirror as \"the world's most beautiful thing,\" prompting her to join his journey, readmit the exiled villagers, and address Utsuho with honorific reverence. Despite her vanity, Iriya demonstrates unexpected kindness, even befriending romantic rival Neya while assisting with fashion advice. Her practical skills and adaptability make her a valuable companion, though she occasionally employs seduction as a tactical weapon.\n;\n:A 19-year-old warrior allied with Kuroha, leader of his group. He is characterized by his simple-minded nature and cheerful demeanor. Despite his limited intellect—often mispronouncing words and serving as comic relief—he possesses exceptional combat skills with his three-section sickle staff, effective at any range. Though initially ostracized since childhood and prone to destructive impulses, he demonstrates childlike loyalty to those he cherishes. His honest nature frequently leads to accidental disclosures of sensitive information. After forming an unexpected friendship with Utsuho and developing affection for Neya, Uzume undergoes significant personal growth. He resolves to live without killing, creating tension with Kuroha. Following conflicts at Bride Village and the capital, he ultimately joins Utsuho's group with his comrades Chouza and Minamo committed to building a world free from suffering.\nPublication\nWritten and illustrated by , Itsuwaribito started in Shogakukan's  manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday on January 28, 2009. released on January 28 of that same year.}} The series ran for 51 chapters, until February 10, 2010.

He criticized the poor pacing in the second volume. Katherine Dacey described the manga as a \"tonal mess,\" contrasting the bloody fight scenes with the cute talking tanuki and the \"uncomplicated\" protagonist. Leroy Douresseaux felt the series had potential, enjoying the premise, and feeling that the series hit its stride more in the second volume. Danica Davidson felt that the lead became more sympathetic during the first volume. Holly von Winckel noted the extreme violence used by the author to distinguish the protagonist from the 'real' bad guys, feeling that the tanuki character was an \"antidote\" to this strong violence. Patti Martinson felt that the premise was gimmicky, but that the second volume \"explored\" the issue more than she had hoped. Nick Smith describes the lead character as being an \"even less likeable version of Naruto,\" summing up the first volume as being both enjoyable and frustrating. Deb Aoki noted the combination of gore and cute elements, making the first volume \"difficult to recommend .\" Davey C. Jones enjoyed the fast pace of the second volume.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110516151044/http://websunday.net/rensai/ituwaribito/ Itsuwaribito official website at Web Sunday]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111024031345/http://club.shogakukan.co.jp/magazine/SH_CSNDY/ituwaribit_002/detail Itsuwaribito official website at Club Sunday]\n* [http://ameblo.jp/iinumayuuki/ Yuuki Iinuma's official blog]\n*"
