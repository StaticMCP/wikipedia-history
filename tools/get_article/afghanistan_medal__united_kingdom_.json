In 1877 the Afghan Amir refused to accept a British Resident and in 1878 agreed a treaty with Russia granting it protective rights in Afghanistan. In response, a British-led force entered the country in November 1878 and advanced on Kabul. After defeats at Ali Musjid and Peiwar Kotal, the Afghans sued for peace and accepted a British Resident in Kabul, the war ending on 26 May 1879. After the Resident was murdered on 3 September 1879, the war recommenced. A British-led force again occupied Kabul, defeating the Afghans en route at Charasia. Sporadic fighting continued and after defeat at Maiwand, a British force was besieged in Kandahar. General Roberts led a column that marched from Kabul to relieve Kandahar, the resulting Afghan defeat leading to the conclusion of the war in September 1880. The soldiers who took part in General Roberts' march were awarded the Kabul to Kandahar Star in addition to the Afghanistan Medal.\nMedals awarded to the 66th Foot (Berkshire Regiment) and E Battery of B Brigade, Royal Artillery, rate a high premium as these units sustained the heaviest casualties at the battle of Maiwand in July 1880.\nWhen the first phase of the war ended in May 1879, it was proposed that the India General Service Medal be issued with clasps for Afghanistan, Ali Musjid and Peiwar Kotal. However, when the war recommenced in September 1879, it was decided to award a distinct medal to cover the whole campaign.\nDescription\nThe Afghanistan Medal is a circular silver medal,  in diameter, with the following design:\n*The obverse shows a veiled effigy of Queen Victoria, facing left, with \"VICTORIA REGINA ET IMPERATRIX\" around the edge.\n*The reverse shows marching and mounted soldiers with arms with an elephant carrying a cannon. In the upper-left of the medal around the edges is \"AFGHANISTAN\" and on the bottom in a straight line is \"1878-79-80\"\n*The medal hangs from a plain suspender which is attached to the medal with a double toe claw. The ribbon is  wide and is dark green with broad crimson edges.\n*The recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the rim of the medal.\n*Plain silver clasps were awarded and are found as follows:\n**\"ALI MUSJID\" (21 November 1878)\n**\"PEIWAR KOTAL\" (2 December 1878)\n**\"CHARASIA\" (6 October 1879)\n**\"KABUL\" (10–23 December 1879)\n**\"AHMED KHEL\" (19 April 1880)\n**\"KANDAHAR\" (1 September 1880)\nThe maximum number of clasps awarded to any one man was four.\nThe medal was awarded without a clasp to those who saw service in Afghanistan between 22 November 1878 – 26 May 1879, or 3 September 1879 – 20 September 1880, but did not take part in these major actions.\nA bronze version for issue to authorised native Indian followers, including bearers, grooms and grasscutters, was proposed. Although considered and specimens produced, no bronze awards were finally made.\nSee also\n*British campaign medals\n*Second Afghan War\n*Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan (Post 2001)\nNotes\nBibliography\n*Dorling, Captain H.
