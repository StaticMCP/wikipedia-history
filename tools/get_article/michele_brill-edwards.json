This was reported as: \"Michele Brill-Edwards, who took a Health Canada director to court in the 1990s for overruling scientific decisions on drug safety. She was demoted and resigned, and continues to speak out on drug issues.\" As a representative for the Alliance for Public Accountability, Brill-Edwards intervened in the media in Canada's tainted-blood scandal involving the Red Cross.\nBrill-Edwards was \"the central character\" in an episode of CBC's The Fifth Estate (TV), in which she was depicted \"as a tireless moral crusader; a champion of the people who was justifiably suspicious of the big drug companies, HPB, and doctors like Myers and Leenen who, the program alleged, seemed to be conspiring to keep the drug on the market despite the fact that a number of red flags had been raised in the United States, Canada and Britain.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://vimeo.com/73358580 Video interview with Michele Brill-Edwards]"
