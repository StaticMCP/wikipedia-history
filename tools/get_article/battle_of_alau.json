      "text": "# Battle of Alau\n\nThe Battle of Alau was fought in Alau, Parsa District on  28 July 1847. It was fought between the armies of Rajendra Bikram Shah and  Jung Bahadur Rana and in this confrontation, Jung Bahadur's army won against Rajendra's army and arrested King Rajendra.\nAfter the Bhandarkhal Parva, King Rajendra went to Kashi with the queen. In this period, Jung Bahadur dethroned King Mahendra and replaced him with prince Surendra. Rajendra, then, started plotting the removal of Jung Bahadur with his consultants. However, Jung Bahadur was aware of this conspiracy because he had sent his spies with King Rajendra to Kashi. As a result, King Rajendra's army was slaughtered in Alau and he was then put under arrest. This event is popularly known as 'Alau Parva' in Nepal.\nSee also\n* List of massacres in Nepal\nReferences"
