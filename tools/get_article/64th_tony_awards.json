were ineligible for Tony Award nominations because fewer than 50% of their scores were written for the stage productions.\nOn May 14, 2010, the Tony Award committee announced a disqualification of a nomination in the \"Best Costume Design in a Musical\" category for Ragtime, stating that \"...Santo Loquasto's designs for the revival of Ragtime are predominantly those from the original 1998 production, and therefore do not meet the Tony rule which states, work that 'substantially duplicate(s)' work from a prior production is ineligible.\"\nCompetitive awards\nSource: Tony Awards\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n{| class=wikitable width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

The musical Memphis won four awards, including Best Musical. The revival of Fences earned ten nominations, the most nominations ever received by a play revival, and won three awards.  The new play Red received seven nominations and won six awards, the most of any play or musical this season.\nFilm actors won an unusual number of awards this season, with Denzel Washington, Scarlett Johansson, Viola Davis, Eddie Redmayne and Catherine Zeta-Jones among the winners.  So many film actors appeared on Broadway last year that theatre actor Hunter Foster created a Facebook page called [http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=102274489824156&ref=search \"Give the Tonys Back to Broadway\"].  The New York Times critic Charles Isherwood wrote, \"I share to a certain extent Mr. Foster’s dismay at this year’s star-glutted Tony awards. ... It’s possible that if the Tony administrators had not kicked the journalists out of the voting pool, there might have been a few more worthy winners.\"  Isherwood called the proliferation of Hollywood stars on Broadway \"ominous\", claiming that projects from last season featuring film actors such as Jude Law's Hamlet and A Steady Rain monopolized the box office, causing \"superior\" plays to fail.  On the other hand, Isherwood felt, it is possible that \"welcoming [film] stars on Broadway – the talented ones, anyway – [could help] New York theater to reassert its importance to the culture, and maybe even to tilt the balance of the entertainment business at least a little back toward the East Coast\".\nMultiple nominations and awards\nThese productions had multiple nominations:\n*11 nominations: Fela! & La Cage aux Folles\n*10 nominations: Fences\n*8 nominations: Memphis\n*7 nominations: Red\n*6 nominations: Ragtime & A View from the Bridge\n*5 nominations: The Royal Family\n*4 nominations: Enron, A Little Night Music & Promises, Promises\n*3 nominations: American Idiot, ''Finian's Rainbow, In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play), Lend Me a Tenor & Million Dollar Quartet\n*2 nominations: The Addams Family, Come Fly Away, Everyday Rapture, Hamlet, Next Fall, Sondheim on Sondheim & Time Stands Still\nThe following productions received multiple awards.\n*6 wins: Red\n*4 wins: Memphis\n*3 wins: Fela!, Fences & La Cage aux Folles\n*2 wins: American Idiot''\nSee also\n* Drama Desk Awards\n* 2010 Laurence Olivier Awards – equivalent awards for West End theatre productions\n* Obie Award\n* New York Drama Critics' Circle\n* Theatre World Award\n* Lucille Lortel Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080703180051/http://www.tonyawards.org/ Tony Awards official site]"
