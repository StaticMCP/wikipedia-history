SDD is also a subject offered to senior high school students in Australia in university entrance exams such as the Higher School Certificate (HSC) and the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE).\nVictoria\nVCE Course\nIn Victoria, the course in the VCE is known as Information Technology: Software Development.\nNew South Wales\nHSC Course\nIn New South Wales, the course was changed to Software Engineering in 2024 following a syllabus update. SE is separated into the Preliminary (Year 11) and HSC (Year 12) courses. A prerequisite for the HSC Course is successful completion of the Preliminary Course, which is the same for any other course in the HSC. The course also often requires a major project, in which students must plan, design and develop a software application. The course in NSW is set out in the NSW Board of Studies (now known as the New South Wales Education Standards Authority) HSC Software Design and Development syllabus document.\nPreliminary Course\n:Concepts and Issues in the Design and Development of Software (30%)\n*Social and ethical issues\n*Hardware and software\n*Software development approaches\n:Introduction to Software Development (50%)\n*Defining the problem and planning software solutions\n*Building software solutions\n*Checking software solutions\n*Modifying software solutions\nDeveloping Software Solutions (20%)\nCourse Structure\nDevelopment and Impact of Software Solutions (15%)\n*Social and ethical issues\n*Application of software development approaches\nSoftware Development Cycle (40%)\n*Defining and understanding the problem\n*Planning and design of software solutions\n*Implementation of software solutions\n*Testing and evaluation of software solutions\n*Maintenance of software solutions\nDeveloping a Solution Package (25%)\nOptions (20%)\nOne of the following options:\n#Programming paradigms, or\n#The interrelationship between hardware and software\nSee also\nInformation Processes and Technology, which is a similar course offered in the HSC.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au Board of Studies Website]"
