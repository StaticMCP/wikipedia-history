On TV, he was a familiar guest star on cowboy shows. On the long-running Western Gunsmoke, he played 16 different characters in 19 episodes (including a pair of two-part stories), second only to Victor French (23) for most appearances of any actor on the show. He also had a recurring role on The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.\nEarly years\nWoodward was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the third of five sons of Dr. Valin Woodward and his wife, Frances McKinley. He grew up in Arlington, Texas, graduating from high school in 1944. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, he enrolled at North Texas Agriculture College, where he was active in the theater. He graduated in 1948 with a bachelor's of business administration in finance. He attended law school at the University of Texas at Austin. During that time, he hosted a local radio talk show and sang with a barbershop quartet and a dance band.\nMilitary service\nWoodward was a member of the United States Army Air Force during World War II. He flew his first plane at the age of 16 years. He returned to the military during the Korean War in the now-Military Air Transport Service.\nActing career\nWesterns\nOne of Woodward's longest television roles was in 42 episodes between 1958 and 1961 on the ABC television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp as the deputy/sidekick \"Shotgun\" Gibbs. Woodward made a dozen guest appearances on Wagon Train between 1958 and 1965, and many appearances in Gunsmoke, Rawhide, and Bonanza.\nIn the 1966 episode \"Hugh Glass Meets the Bear\" of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, Woodward was cast as Thomas \"Broken Hand\" Fitzpatrick. John Alderson played Hugh Glass, who after being mauled by a bear and abandoned by Fitzpatrick, crawled 200 miles to civilization. Victor French portrayed Louis Baptiste, with Tris Coffin as Major Andrew Henry.\nWoodward also played on The Waltons as Boone Walton, nephew to Waltons grandfather Zeb Walton, being Zeb's eldest brother Henry's son.\nStar Trek\nWoodward guest-starred in two episodes of the original series of Star Trek as two different characters. In the first-season episode, \"Dagger of the Mind\" (1966), Woodward plays Dr. Simon van Gelder, a deputy director of a facility for the criminally insane.  Later, he was cast in \"The Omega Glory\" in Star Treks second season, playing Captain Ron Tracey.  Woodward called the role of Dr. Simon Van Gelder the most physically and emotionally exhausting acting job of his career.\nDallas\nWoodward was a familiar face on the television drama series Dallas from 1980 to 1987. His recurring role was Marvin \"Punk\" Anderson. As the series progressed, Woodward's role became that of a trusted advisor to the Ewing sons.\nRecording\nIn 1963, Woodward recorded \"Heartache City\" backed with \"An Encouraging Word\" (CRC Charter 15).\nDeath\nWoodward died at age 93 on February 22, 2019, at his Hollywood Hills house in California.\nRecognition\nIn 2009, Woodward was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.
