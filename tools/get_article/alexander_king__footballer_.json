He scored one of the goals for Hearts as they won the 1896 Scottish Cup Final by 3–1 against Hibernian, and continued his success with Celtic, winning the Scottish Football League title in 1897–98 and the Scottish Cup in 1899.\nKing represented Scotland six times and played for the Scottish Football League XI four times.\nHis brother John King (17 years younger, leading him to be mistakenly described as a nephew) was also a footballer whose clubs included Partick Thistle and Newcastle United.
