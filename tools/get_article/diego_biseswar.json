Born in the Netherlands, he represented the Suriname national team.\nEarly life\nBiseswar was born in Amsterdam to Surinamese parents. His father was a bus driver in Amsterdam. Growing up, his only passion was football.\nClub career\nYouth career\nBiseswar's first football club was amateur club DWS. He joined Ajax after a year. After five seasons with Ajax, he was deemed \"unmanageable\" and was released. Bisewar has stated that he was happy to leave Ajax, saying that \"Ajax thought I wasn't good enough and I wanted to leave myself. I didn't feel at ease, many friends were leaving and my relationship with the coach wasn't optimal. It was unfortunate, but there were no dreams in tatters.\"\nBiseswar returned to former club DWS, before leaving again to play for Telstar. After one season, Biseswar was asked to join the Feyenoord youth academy, a move he was happy to make: \"I visited them a few times and was quickly convinced. I had no difficulty to join Feyenoord as a boy from Amsterdam. And why? Ajax was far behind me and I always had a special feeling for Feyenoord.\"\nAfter playing for Feyenoord U15 for one season, Biseswar was promoted to Feyenoord U17, in which he played for two seasons. At the end of the last season, Biseswar made his debut with Feyenoord's first team.\nFeyenoord\nEarly years\nBiseswar at a Feyenoord training.\nOn 29 October 2004, Biseswar signed his first professional three-year contract with Feyenoord, at the age of 16. However, later that year, Biseswar was suspended by the KNVB for a month after he \"played in a competition match, under a different name, in the first team of an amateur club from Amsterdam but was quickly picked out during the game as player of Feyenoord.\" On 22 May 2005, Biseswar made his senior Feyenoord debut by replacing Tim Vincken in the 67th minute in Feyenoord's last Eredivisie match of the 2004–05 season. Feyenoord defeated ADO Den Haag (6–3), which was also the last match under the management of Ruud Gullit.\nIn the 2005–06 season, Biseswar mainly played for Feyenoord U19. However, Biseswar also made six appearances in Feyenoord's first team and scored his first goal in the Eredivisie. On 20 November 2005, Biseswar replaced the injured Ali Boussaboun in the 53rd minute in the Eredivisie away match against Roda JC. In the 79th minute, Biseswar scored the winning goal. He then set up a goal for Salomon Kalou to score his second goal of the game, in a 6–1 win against Willem II on 29 December 2005. On 31 January 2006, it was announced that both Biseswar and Royston Drenthe were official members of the Feyenoord's first team. However, during a 1–1 draw against Ajax A1 on 18 February 2006, he was sent–off for his unprofessional behavior in the second half and after the match, Biseswar was banished from the first team for a month. At the end of the 2005–06 season, Biseswar went on to make six appearances and scoring once for the side.\nAhead of the 2007–08 season, Biseswar signed a contract with Feyenoord, keeping him until 2009. His first appearance of the 2007–08 season came on 26 August 2007, coming on as a late substitute, in a 5–0 win over NAC Breda. A month later on 26 September 2007, he made another appearance for the side, also coming on as a late substitute, in a 3–0 win over FC Utrecht. Just only making two appearances for the side 2007–08 season, it was expected in January that Biseswar was expecting to leave the club. It came after when he was discipline, as he was half an hour late for the Feyenoord A1 game on 27 November 2007.\nLoan spells\nBiseswar had two Eredivisie loan spells while at Feyenoord. For the 2006–07 season he joined Heracles Almelo. It came after he went on a trial for the club and were among six players to be cut following Erwin Koeman's decision ahead of the new season. Biseswar made his Heracles Almelo debut in the opening game of the season against FC Twente, where he came on as a substitute for Kai Michalke in early first half, then scored and set up two goals, in a 3–0 win, earning himself a Man of the Match award. Biseswar made 26 Eredivisie appearances for the club, in which he scored two goals. However, Heracles Almelo decided not to retain Biseswar for disciplinary reasons.\nFor the 2007–08 season, Biseswar had an unsuccessful spell at Eredivisie side De Graafschap. He made his De Graafschap debut on 2 February 2008 against Excelsior, coming on as a substitute, in a 1–1 draw. Biseswar failed to make an impression and only played 11 Eredivisie matches for the club from Doetinchem, without scoring any goals. At the end of the 2007–08 season, De Graafschap was at one point keen on signing him permanently but decided not to, due to Feyenoord's asking price.\nReturn to Feyenoord\nFor the 2008–09 season, Biseswar returned to Feyenoord; his contract was due to expire at the end of the season, and he was placed on the transfer list. As a result, Biseswar was expected to leave the club. He trialled at English club Sheffield United, but they could not afford the player. Feyenoord failed to sell the youngster, but Biseswar made a good impression during pre-season and the early league matches. Therefore, manager Gertjan Verbeek opted to give Biseswar another chance at the club. He made his first appearance for Feyenoord since returning from a loan spell from De Graafschap, starting the whole game, as they lost 2–0 loss against PSV Eindhoven in the Johan Cruyff Shield. Biseswar then scored his first goals for the side in over three years, and set up one of the goals, in a 3–0 win over FC Volendam on 13 September 2008. He then scored three goals in two matches between 2 November 2008 and 9 November 2008, including scoring a brace against \tFC Utrecht. However, Biseswar suffered an injury while warming up ahead of a match against HHC Hardenberg in the third round of the KNVB Cup and was sidelined for a month. After returning to the first team from injury, he then scored again for the side on 26 December 2008, in a 3–1 win over NAC Breda. Over the course of the season, Biseswar became an important first team member. As his contract was due to expire, he received interest from former club Ajax and Spanish club Valencia. On 10 March 2009, Biseswar announced he didn't want to leave Feyenoord for another Dutch club. On 3 April 2009, Biseswar signed a new three-year contract with the club. Biseswar finished the season with 30 Eredivisie matches, scoring a total of seven goals.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Biseswar found himself playing in the first team by coming on from the substitute bench. The decision to put Biseswar came from new manager Mario Been, who was frustrated with his mentality with the club. Despite this, he scored his first goal of the season in the second round of the KNVB Cup, in a 5–0 win over Harkemase Boys. Biseswar soon regained his first team place for the side, where he replaced Sekou Cissé, who suffered an injury and the one who dispatched Biseswar to the substitute bench. Biseswar continued to regain his first team place for the side throughout the 2009–10 season. Despite being sidelined on three occasions for the side during the 2009–10 season, Biseswar went on to make thirty–three appearances and scoring once in all competitions.\nIn the 2010–11 season, Biseswar, however, suffered an injury at the start of the season. At one point during the summer transfer window, he was subjected a loan transfer move to Excelsior but rejected a move to the club. Biseswar explained his decision that he wanted to stay at the club to fight for his place in the first team. However, upon returning to the first team from injury, Biseswar found his first team opportunities limited under the management of Been. But he returned to the starting lineup following an injury crisis and was featured in number of matches throughout the year. However, in January, Biseswar suffered a knee injury that saw him sidelined for two matches. On 30 January 2011, he returned to the starting lineup from injury, where he played 85 minutes, as Feyenoord lost 2–1 against FC Twente. Biseswar then scored his first goal of the season and set up the opening goal of the game for the side, as they beat Heracles Almelo 2–1 on 12 February 2011. Since returning to the first team from injury, he continued to regain his first team for the side towards the end of the season. On 10 April 2011, Biseswar then scored his second goal of the season, in a 4–0 win over FC Utrecht. In a 3–1 win over PSV Eindhoven on 24 April 2011, he played a role during the match when he set up two goals for Georginio Wijnaldum, who scored twice.\nAhead of the 2011–12 season, Biseswar was linked with a move away from Feyenoord in the summer transfer window, but the transfer move never materialised and he stayed at the club. However, Biseswar suffered an abdominal muscle injury that kept him out for two months. He returned from injury on 2 October 2011 as a substitute in a 3–0 loss against ADO Den Haag. However, upon returning from injury, Biseswar found his first team opportunities under the new management of Ronald Koeman and was placed on the substitute bench in the number of matches for the side. His attitude also caused issues by Manager Koeman that he apologised. It was announced on 26 November 2011 that Biseswar would be leaving Feyenoord in January after a contract negotiation broke down.\nKayserispor\nBiseswar moved to Turkish club Kayserispor in January 2012, signing a four-and-a-half-year contract. The move reported to have cost 200,000 euros.\nBiseswar made his Kayserispor debut on 8 January 2012, starting the whole game, in a 1–0 loss against Antalyaspor.

Five days later against Gaziantepspor on 16 January 2012, he set up a goal for Gökhan Ünal to score the first goal of the game, in a 1–1 draw.
