Ur I is part of the Early Dynastic III period of ancient Mesopotamia. It was preceded by the earlier First Dynasty of Kish and the First Dynasty of Uruk.\nRule\n, possible founder of the First Dynasty of Ur.]]\n.]]\n.]]\n.]]\nAccording to the Sumerian King List, the final ruler of the First Dynasty of Uruk Lugal-kitun was overthrown by Mesannepada of Ur. There were then four kings in the First Dynasty of Ur: Mesannepada, Mes-kiagnuna, Elulu, and Balulu. Two other kings earlier than Mes-Anepada are known from other sources, namely Mes-kalam-du and A-Kalam-du. It would seem that Mes-Anepada was the son of Mes-kalam-du, according to the inscription found on a bead in Mari, and Mes-kalam-du was the founder of the dynasty. A probable Queen Puabi is also known from her lavish tomb at the Royal Cemetery at Ur. The First Dynasty of Ur had extensive influence over the area of Sumer, and apparently led a union of south Mesopotamian polities.\n(items and positions in PG 789), circa 2600 BCE (reconstitution).]]\nEthnicity and language\nLike other Sumerians, the people of Ur were a non-Semitic people who may have come from the east circa 3300 BCE, and spoke a language isolate.\nInternational trade\nin this necklace from the Royal Cemetery dating to the First Dynasty of Ur were probably imported from the Indus Valley. British Museum.]]\nThe artifacts found in the royal tombs of the dynasty show that foreign trade was particularly active during this period, with many materials coming from foreign lands, such as Carnelian likely coming from the Indus or Iran, Lapis Lazuli from the Badakhshan area of Afghanistan, silver from Turkey, copper from Oman, and gold from several locations such as Egypt, Nubia, Turkey or Iran. Carnelian beads from the Indus were found in Ur tombs dating to 2600-2450, in an example of Indus-Mesopotamia relations. In particular, carnelian beads with an etched design in white were probably imported from the Indus Valley, and made according to a technique developed by the Harappans. These materials were used into the manufacture of beautiful objects in the workshops of Ur.\nwas likely imported from the Badakhshan area of Afghanistan.]]\nThe Ur I dynasty had enormous wealth as shown by the lavishness of its tombs. This was probably due to the fact that Ur acted as the main harbour for trade with India, which put her in a strategic position to import and trade vast quantities of gold, carnelian or lapis lazuli. In comparison, the burials of the kings of Kish were much less lavish. High-prowed Sumerian ships may have traveled as far as Meluhha, thought to be the Indus region, for trade.\nDemise\nAccording to the Sumerian King List, the First Dynasty of Ur was finally defeated, and power went to the Elamite Awan dynasty. The Sumerian king Eannatum (c.2500–2400 BCE) of Lagash, then came to dominate the whole region, and established one of the first verifiable empires in history.\nThe power of Ur would only revive a few centuries later with the Third Dynasty of Ur.\nList of rulers\n{|class=\"wikitable\"border=\"1\"style=\"width:100%;text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Depiction\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Ruler\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Succession\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Epithet\n!width=\"16.5%\"| dates\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Early Dynastic IIIa period ()\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\"|Predynastic Ur ()\n|-\n|\n|\n|A-Imdugud𒀀𒀭𒅎𒂂\n|\n|\n|}}\n|\n*Historicity certain\n*His name does not appear on the SKL\n*Known from an inscribed cylinder seal bearing the title of, \"Governor of Ur\" (found in tomb PG 1236 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n|-\n|\n|\n|Ur-Pabilsag𒌨𒀭𒉺𒉋𒊕\n|Son of A-Imdugud (?)\n|\n|}}\n|\n*temp. of Ursangpae\n*Known from an inscription fragment bearing the title of, \"King of Ur\" (found in tomb PG 779 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n|-\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Depiction\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Ruler\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Succession\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Epithet\n!width=\"16.5%\"| dates\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Early Dynastic IIIb period ()\n|-\n|\n|\n|Akalamdug𒀀𒌦𒄭\n|Son of Meskalamdug (?)\n|\n|\n|\n*Son of Meskalamdug (?)\n*temp. of Akurgal\n*Known from dynastic beads and tomb inscriptions bearing the title of, \"King of Ur\" (found in tomb PG 1332 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n|-\n|\n|\n|Meskalamdug𒈩𒌦𒄭\n|Son of Akalamdug (?)\n|\n|\n|\n*Son of Akalamdug (?)\n*temp. of Enakalle\n*Known from dynastic beads and tomb inscriptions bearing the title of, \"King of Kish\" (found in tomb PG 755 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n|-\n|\n|\n|Puabi𒅤𒀜\n|colspan=\"3\"|}} to Meskalamdug (?)\n|\n*Known from inscriptions bearing the title of, \"Queen\" (found in tomb PG 800 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n*She may have ruled in her own right as queen regnant\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|1st\n|\n|Mesannepada𒈩𒀭𒉌𒅆𒊒𒁕\n|Son of Meskalamdug (?)\n|\n|(80 years)\n|\n*Son of Meskalamdug (?)\n*temp. of Ur-Lumma\n*Known from the SKL, Tummal Chronicle, and an inscribed seal bearing the title of, \"King of Kish\" (found in tomb PG 1232/1237 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n|-\n|2nd\n|\n|Meskiagnun𒈩𒆠𒉘𒉣\n|Son of Mesannepada (?)\n|\n|(30 or 36 years)\n|\n*Son of Mesannepada (?)\n*temp. of Epa'e\n*Said on the SKL to have been the son of Mesannepada and to have held the title of, \"King\" of not just Ur; but, all of Sumer\n*Known from the Tummal Chronicle his tomb PG 1157 located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur\n|-\n|3rd\n|\n|Elulu𒂊𒇻𒇻\n|\n|\n|(25 years)\n|\n*Historicity certain.\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of \"king\" of not just Ur; but, all of Sumer.\n*temp. of Lugalanda\n|-\n|4th\n|\n|Balulu𒁀𒇻𒇻\n|\n|\n|Uncertain(36 years)\n|\n*Historicity uncertain.\n*Known from the SKL; very little otherwise.\n*Said on the SKL to have held the title of \"king\" of not just Ur; but, all of Sumer.\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|Enshakushanna𒂗𒊮𒊨𒀭𒈾\n|Son of Elulu (?)\n|\n|(60 years)\n|\n*Son of Elulu (?)\n*temp. of Urukagina\n*Held the title of \"lord of Sumer and king of all the land\".\n|-\n|\n|\n|Lugal-kinishe-dudu𒈗𒆠𒉌𒂠𒌌𒌌\n|\n|\n|(120 years)\n|\n*Originally from Uruk\n*Held the title of \"King of Uruk and Ur\"\n*temp. of Enannatum II\n|-\n|\n|\n|Lugal-kisal-si𒈗𒆦𒋛\n|Son of Lugal-kinishe-dudu\n|\n|\n|\n*Son of Lugal-kinishe-dudu.\n*Held the title of \"king of Uruk and Ur\".\n*temp. of Enentarzi\n|-\n|\n|\n|A'annepada𒀀𒀭𒉌𒅆𒊒𒁕\n|Son of Mesannepada\n|\n|Uncertain; this ruler may have  sometime during the EDIIIb period\n|\n*Son of Mesannepada\n*temp. of Entemena\n*Known from dedication tablets with inscriptions bearing the title \"King of Ur\" (found in tomb PG 580  located in the Royal Cemetery at Ur)\n|-\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Depiction\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Ruler\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Succession\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Epithet\n!width=\"16.5%\"| dates\n!width=\"16.5%\"|Notes\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"align=\"center\"style=\"background-color:palegoldenrod\"|Proto-Imperial period ()\n|-\n|\n|\n|Lunanna\n|\n|\n|Uncertain; this ruler may have  sometime during the Proto-Imperial period\n|\n*Historicity certain.\n*temp. of Sargon\n|}\nSumerian King List\nOnly the final kings of the First Dynasty of Ur, from Mesannepada to Balulu and possibly 4 unnamed kings, are mentioned in the Sumerian King List:\n}}\nArtifacts\nThe Royal Cemetery of Ur held the tombs of several rulers of the First Dynasty of Ur.
