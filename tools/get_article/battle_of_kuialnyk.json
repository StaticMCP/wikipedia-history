Cossacks were passing through the lands of Budjak Horde and were in the steppe beyond Kuialnyk. They encountered Crimean lord Nurredin-Sultan, who was moving from Ochakiv together with Budjak Murza Tenmambet, while being accompanied by Ottoman Janissaries with cannon.\nBattle\nNurredin-Sultan was meant to head to Crimea while Murza Tenmambet was heading to Budjak after assisting Doroshenko for four months, but he encountered the Cossacks and joined battle with them on the Kuialnyk river. Tatar-Turkish forces attempted to fire at the Cossacks from cannon, but these cannos exploded and didn't inflict any casualties on the Cossacks. The Cossacks defeated the Tatar-Turkish forces and Nurredin-Sultan fled to Crimea. Murza Tenmambet was captured by the Cossacks, along with three other Tatars.\nAftermath\nAfter this battle, the Cossacks reached the Bug where Sirko's Cossacks expected to be paid for their work, but they were promised payment only after giving further assistance to the Polish king in Ukrainian cities. However, Sirko's Cossacks weren't paid for their work, which left them dissatisfied and they blamed Sirko for switching to the side of Poland-Lithuania, threatening to return to Tsardom of Russia. Sirko himself eventually returned to the Left-Bank where he sought to be pardoned by Russian Tsardom.\nReferences"
