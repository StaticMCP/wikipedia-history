It was released by Arista on November 12, 2007, in the United States. The album comprises a combination of classic duets spanning Franklin's career, and two newly recorded duets with Fantasia and John Legend, also containing two live duets, one from 1993, the other from 1998. The album concludes with a previously released rendition of \"Nessun Dorma\", of which Franklin had performed a version at the Grammy Awards of 1998, when she filled in last minute for Luciano Pavarotti.\nThe album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200 album chart and reached number seven on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, her first to reach the top ten since 1998. The disc's first and only single, \"Put You Up on Game\", featuring Fantasia was released to radio on October 1, 2007. The single peaked at number 41 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs but missed the Pop chart.\nThe song peaked at number ten on the Adult R&B Songs and earned the pair an NAACP Image Award nomination in the Outstanding Duo or Group category.\nTrack listing\n| extra1 = Richards\n| length1 = 5:08\n| title2 = Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\n| note2 = Duet with Eurythmics, from ''Who's Zoomin' Who?, 1985\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 = Stewart\n| length2 = 5:53\n| title3 = I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\n| note3 = Duet with George Michael, from Aretha, 1986\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = Narada Michael Walden\n| length3 = 4:03\n| title4 = What Now My Love\n| note4 = Duet with Frank Sinatra, from Duets'', 1993\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = Phil Ramone\n| length4 = 3:16\n| title5 = Put You Up on Game\n| note5 = Duet with Fantasia\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 = The Underdogs\n| length5 = 4:16\n| title6 = What Y'all Came to Do\n| note6 = Duet with John Legend\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 = Devo Springsteen\n| length6 = 3:17\n| title7 = Never Gonna Break My Faith\n| note7 = Duet with Mary J.
