The company was founded in 1994 by Rachel Bernstein, Bill Spieth and Ted Spieth, acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2003, became part of the 2K label in 2005, and was closed down in 2006.\nHistory\nFrog City Software was founded by Rachel Bernstein, Bill Spieth and Ted Spieth in 1994. In 2003, following the release of Tropico 2: Pirate Cove, Frog City Software was acquired by Take-Two Interactive. On January 25, 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced the opening of publishing label 2K, which would henceforth manage its development studios, including Frog City Software.\nOn June 6, 2006, Snow, a game about drug trafficking in development at Frog City Software at the time, was canceled. It was presumed that the move occurred as an immediate consequence of the 2005 Hot Coffee controversy. Frog City Software shut down later that year. Veterans of the studio established Sidecar Studios as a successor but disbanded a year later to pursue other interests.\nGames developed\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Title\n!Platform(s)\n!Publisher\n|-\n|1997\n|Imperialism\n|Microsoft Windows\n|Strategic Simulations\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1999\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Imperialism II: The Age of Exploration\n|macOS\n|The Learning Company\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Microsoft Windows\n|Strategic Simulations\n|-\n|2001\n|Trade Empires\n|Eidos Interactive\n|-\n|2003\n|Tropico 2: Pirate Cove\n|Gathering of Developers\n|}\nCancelled\n*Pantheon\n*Snow\nReferences"
