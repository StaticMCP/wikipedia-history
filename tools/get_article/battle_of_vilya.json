On 4 September 1943, a fight took place with armed Ukrainians while harvesting grain from the surrounding fields for Polish refugees and partisans gathered in the area of Huta Stara (Ludwipol municipality). The clash took place in the area of the destroyed Ukrainian village of Vilya, which was pacified on 28 May 1943 by the German garrison from Bystrzyce.\nBattle\nOn 6 September 1943, two sotnias and a staff group of the Polesian Sich stationed in the devastated village of Vilya in Volhynia (Ludwipol commune in the Kostopol district) came into accidental contact with a detachment of the Home Army and a Felix Dzerzhinsky detachment of Polish communist partisans, who were guarding a grain haul. The Home Army part of the group was commanded by Lieutenant Zdzisław Ostromęcki \"Podkowa\". The commander of the communist part was platoon leader Franciszek Szafran. In total, the Polish forces initially numbered around 40 armed men.\nBoth sides, surprised by the encounter, engaged in a battle in which the weaker Polish side initially suffered losses of 16 men. Władysław and Ewa Siemaszek report that the tide of the battle was turned by the arrival of reinforcements from a Soviet unit and a Home Army unit under Władyslaw Kochański, pseud. \"Bomba\".\nAftermath\nSources differ on result of the battle and number of losses. According to Władysław and Ewa Siemaszek, the Ukrainian unit was smashed and pushed out of the Vilya, with Polish losses amounting to 18 killed; among others, Second Lieutenant Ostromęcki was killed. However, according to Grzegorz Motyka, Polish partisans retreated and lost a total of 23 men in the clashes that lasted all day. On the Ukrainian side, heavy losses were also reported: 8 killed, including , and 15 wounded.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
