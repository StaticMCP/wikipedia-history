Goth\n* Guides the US (and the world) through a highly dangerous crisis precipitated by a nuclear explosion inside a Chinese satellite over the Pacific.\n*This causes tensions and mutual suspicions among the world's superpowers, and there are increasing indications of possible involvement by extraterrestrial beings.\nPresident Newton Sanders\n* President in: Mark Lawson's novel: Idlewild\n* In a universe in which President John F. Kennedy survived the assassination attempt on his life, and went on to be re-elected in 1964, Newton Sanders wins the 1992 Presidential election running as a third-party candidate - defeating both President George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n* He is assassinated via a \"baby bomb\" (an infant wrapped in Semtex and detonated) by Yusaf Yusaf (alias \"Anderson Kempinski Fraser\"). As he did not have a vice-president, he is succeeded by the Speaker of the House.\nPresident Matthew Vincente \"Matt\" Santos\n* President in: The West Wing (television series)\n* A former mayor and three-term congressman from Houston, Texas.\n*Santos is married to Helen Santos and has two children.\n*He is preparing to retire from politics when he is approached by Josh Lyman about a presidential campaign.\n*He starts out the campaign in last place in a crowded field, before catapulting into third place after receiving 19% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary.\n* Surging late after winning the California primary, Santos is deadlocked with the frontrunner, Vice President Bob Russell at the 2006 Democratic National Convention. Santos wins the party nomination on the fourth ballot and names former Labor Secretary and White House Chief of Staff Leo McGarry as his running mate.\n* Santos narrowly defeats Senator Arnold Vinick of California by a count of 272 to 266 electoral votes. However, this victory is undermined by the sudden death of Leo McGarry (written due to the real-life passing of McGarry's portrayer, actor John Spencer) on Election Night.\n* Before his inauguration, Santos names his defeated rival Vinick his secretary of state, ensuring bipartisan cooperation in handling growing tensions between Russia and China, and seeks the confirmation of Pennsylvania Governor Eric Baker as his vice president.\n* Second sitting U.S. Congressman to be elected to the presidency after James A. Garfield.\n* In the West Wing canon, Santos is the first Hispanic-American president.\n* Played by: Jimmy Smits\n* Party: Democratic\nPresident Lee Sarason\n* President in: ''It Can't Happen Here''\n* Chief political operative and adviser to Berzelius 'Buzz' Windrip as a Governor and U.S. Senator.\n* U.S. Secretary of State during Windrip's presidency, during which time the United States is transformed into an authoritarian Corporatist country.\n* Following the flight of the disillusioned Vice President Perley Beecroft to Canada, Sarason leads a coup which sees Windrip overthrown and exiled to France.\n* Due to extravagance and relatively weak rule, Sarason is soon after killed in a bloody putsch at the White House organised by General Dewey Haik, who proclaims himself as the new president. Thereafter, a military dictatorship erodes Corporatist power, plunging the United States into civil war and a war with Mexico.\n* Party: Corporatist (presumably, previously Democratic)\nPresident James William Sawyer\n* President in: White House Down\n* Proposes a controversial peace treaty with allied nations to both remove military forces from and provide significant financial aid to the Middle East.

The attack is later revealed to have been masterminded by Eli Raphelson, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, who is allied with influential groups who stand to lose money should the peace deal go through.\n* Is rescued by Capitol policeman John Cale, and along with him attempts to escape from the White House.\n* Presumed dead after an explosion in the White House cabana, but narrowly escapes.

Running as the Democratic nominee for president in 2024 on a platform of curtailing the power and influence of Supes, his election immediately makes him the target of a plot by Homelander and Sister Sage to install a Supe supremacist regime by assassinating him and elevating his running mate Victoria Neuman (a Supe) to the presidency. On January 6, after Homelander outs Neuman as a Supe on live television and Singer is nearly assassinated by a shapeshifting Supe posing as Annie January, Singer is framed for Billy Butcher's assassination of Neuman (having been party to the CIA's and The Boys' attempts to preemptively assassinate her) and arrested before he can be inaugurated as president.

Macdonald has been put up to this by his wife Sarra, a shrewd schemer and manipulator - who is the President's mistress.\n* On the third day after inauguration, the president gets a visit from three officials who inform him of an \"Unknown Law\" inaugurated by George Washington and maintained secretly by all Presidents since: Once in a term, a President may order the assassination of a person who, in the President's judgement, constitutes a Clear and Present Danger to the Integrity of the Nation and against whom no evidence can be brought in a court.

She remains there for the next year until finally being found and rescued by US military forces led by Wolf Squadron, a mostly-civilian militia founded by Steve Smith organizing survivors in the Atlantic Ocean and being deputized by the remaining military command structure.\n* Due to no one else higher than her in the United States presidential line of succession having been found, she is installed as acting president, and quickly proves herself inept at the job. Driven by a delusional desperation to find her daughter (who was infected just before the Fall), she orders the military to stop killing infected and focus on searching for her daughter, while also having Smith arrested for war crimes on the basis of all the infected killed on his orders were still technically human.\n* With her actions undermining all efforts to rebuild the country – as Texas' provisional government threatens to secede and there are rumblings of a military coup - Smith's daughters Faith and Sophia stage an unauthorized rescue mission into DC to find someone who can legally supplant Sovrain as president.
