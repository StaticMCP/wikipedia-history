The museum opened in 2002 and entered voluntary liquidation in 2013.\nThe museum opened in 2002 in Bristol's historic old railway station, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, following renovation and conversion costing £8 million. It was completed in 1840 and includes the passenger shed and the adjoining former engine and carriage shed. It is over  with timber and iron roof spans of , this Grade I listed building has been nominated as part of a World Heritage Site.\nThe museum had a flourishing publications department, producing books on aspects of colonial life such as the history of the Northern Rhodesia Police, and a register of titles of the regiments of the Honourable East India Company and East Indian Armies. The museum also held the collection of artefacts of the Commonwealth Institute; extensive photograph stills, paper, film and oral history archives, and a costume collection. These are now in the care of Bristol Museums, Galleries & Archives (apart from loans which were returned to their owners).\nThe museum was also the home of the New World Tapestry.\nUnlike many national museums in Britain, the BECM was not publicly funded, but owned and operated by a charitable trust; consequently an admission charge was in place.\nBreaking the Chains\nThe museum's Breaking the Chains exhibition, funded by a £1m Heritage Lottery grant to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the British Transatlantic Slave Trade by the Slave Trade Act 1807, was shortlisted for the Art Fund Prize.\nClosure and controversy\nOn 23 November 2007 the museum announced it would be moving its core operations to London in 2008. The museum closed to the public in the autumn of 2008 and for school visits at the end of March 2009.\nOn 16 March 2011, the Museums Association announced that the Director of the museum, Gareth Griffiths, had been dismissed pending a police investigation into the unauthorised disposal of museum objects.\nBy July 2012, the museum announced that the planned move to London had been cancelled and that it would instead give its collection to the City of Bristol to display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery at a future date. The Old Station which had previously housed the museum was also given to the city, and may be used for future Network Rail services to London.\nThe unauthorised sale of hundreds of items from the museum's collection was the subject of a BBC One Inside Out programme on 10 December 2012.\nIn a letter dated 22 May 2013, the museum wrote to one of the lenders of items:\nOn 24 October 2013, The British Empire and Commonwealth Museum and The Empire Museum Ltd were placed into \"members' voluntary liquidation\"; two employees of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bristol, were appointed joint liquidators.\n\"Lost\" items\n]]\nThe following is a partial list.\n*Thomas Buttersworth's painting of the East India Company's Dunira, loaned by Lord Caldecote, was sold at auction in 2008, to the Government of Madeira, without the owner's consent.\n* Bronze statuette of John Robert Godley donated by New Zealand.\n* Maori pare (carved lintel) donated by New Zealand.\n* Model pataka (store house) donated by New Zealand.\nCollections\nAfter the closure of the museum the collections were given to Bristol City Council to care for, with the objects under the care of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and the archive collections (including papers, books, photographic, film and sound) under the care of Bristol Archives. The Directorate of Overseas Surveys photographic collection was deposited with the National Collection of Aerial Photography in Edinburgh in 2012. Since 2014 Bristol Archives have worked to catalogue some of the photographic and film collections, digitise them and make them available for public use.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000819000201/http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/ British Empire & Commonwealth Museum website]\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20101108133608/http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/exhibitions/maingalleries.htm Official website (archived)] on Wayback Machine\n* [http://www.imagesofempire.com/ Images of Empire online resource of still and moving images]\n*\n* [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Rise-and-fall-of-the-British-Empire-museum/24476 Article on the rise and fall of the museum]"
