Prehistoric settlement in the UAE took place in the Neolithic, with a number of distinctive eras of ancient settlement including the Stone Age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures from 5000 to 3100 BCE; the Hafit period with its distinctive beehive shaped tombs and Jemdet Nasr pottery, from 3200 to 2600 BCE; the Umm Al Nar period from 2600 to 2000 BCE; the Wadi Suq Culture from 2000 to 1300 BCE and the three Iron Ages of the UAE.\nIron Age I spanned 1200–1000 BCE; Iron Age II from 1000 to 600 BCE and Iron Age III from 600 to 300 BCE. This was followed by the Hellenistic Mleiha era (also known as the PIR - Pre-Islamic Recent), from 300 BCE onwards through to the Islamic era which commenced with the culmination of the 7th century Ridda Wars.\nThe remains of settlements, burials and other extensive evidence of human habitation throughout these eras is littered throughout the UAE, with many extensive finds of rich materials in the shape of pottery, jewellery, weapons and both human and animal remains providing archaeologists and researchers with an increasingly sophisticated picture of longstanding involvement in regional trade alongside nomadic cultures eking out a living from the frequently arid and inhospitable desert and mountain environment of the UAE.\nSettlements\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Settlement\n!Emirate (modern)\n!Populated\n!Notes\n|-\n|Al Ashoosh\n|Dubai\n|2500–2000 BCE\n|Umm Al Nar site with no burial discovered.\n|-\n|Al Madam\n|Sharjah\n|1100–300 BCE\n|Iron Age aflaj (water systems)\n|-\n|Al Sufouh\n|Dubai\n|2500–2000 BCE\n|Umm Al Nar site with tomb\n|-\n|Bidaa bint Saud\n|Abu Dhabi\n|3200–2600 BCE\n|Hafit and Iron Age burials\n|-\n|Bithnah\n|Fujairah\n|2000–300 BCE\n|Wadi Suq burials and Iron Age petroglyphs\n|-\n|Ed-Dur\n|Umm Al Quwain\n|5300 BCE–300 CE\n|Major ancient city/settlement spanning Ubeid period through Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq to Iron Age and Pre-Islamic\n|-\n|Hili\n|Abu Dhabi\n|3200–2600 BCE\n|Hafit and Umm Al Nar tombs\n|-\n|Jebel Buhais\n|Sharjah\n|5000–1300 BCE\n|Necropolis featuring Stone, Bronze, Iron and Hellenistic age burials\n|-\n|Jebel Faya\n|Sharjah\n|125,000 BCE\n|Neolithic, Paleolithic, Stone, Bronze Age finds (See Mleiha)\n|-\n|Jebel Hafeet\n|Abu Dhabi\n|3200-2600 BC\n|Gave its name to the Hafit period, extensive beehive tombs, with some reconstructed\n|-\n|Julfar\n|Ras Al Khaimah\n|1300-1650 CE\n|Precursor settlement to Ras Al Khaimah\n|-\n|Jumeirah\n|Dubai\n|900-1100 CE\n|Remains of early Islamic era souq, houses and caravanserai\n|-\n|Kalba\n|Sharjah\n|2500–1300 BCE\n|Umm Al Nar settlement\n|-\n|Kush\n|Ras Al Khaimah\n|600-1400 CE\n|Late pre-Islamic to Islamic settlement\n|-\n|Masafi\n|Ras Al Khaimah\n|1300–300 BCE\n|Iron Age finds\n|-\n|Mleiha\n|Sharjah\n|5300–300 BCE\n|Settlement through Ubaid, Hafit, Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq and Iron Age to Hellenistic Mleiha & pre-Islamic periods\n|-\n|Muweilah\n|Sharjah\n|1100–600 BCE\n|Iron Age II settlement\n|-\n|Qattara Oasis\n|Abu Dhabi\n|1800–1500 BCE\n|Bronze and Iron Age settlement\n|-\n|Rumailah\n|Abu Dhabi\n|2000–1000 BCE\n|Umm Al Nar through to Iron Age II settlement\n|-\n|Saruq Al Hadid\n|Dubai\n|2600 BCE–1000 CE\n|Occupation since Umm Al Nar period, major Iron Age metallurgical centre\n|-\n|Seih Al Harf\n|Ras Al Khaimah\n|2000–1300 BCE\n|Extensive Wadi Suq burial site\n|-\n|Shimal\n|Ras Al Khaimah\n|2500–1300 BCE\n|Umm Al Nar/Wadi Suq burials\n|-\n|Tell Abraq\n|Umm Al Quwain/Sharjah\n|2500–400 BCE\n|Major settlement, spanning Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq and Iron Age\n|-\n|Thuqeibah\n|Sharjah\n|1100–400 BCE\n|Iron Age II and III settlement\n|-\n|Umm Al Nar\n|Abu Dhabi\n|2600–2000 BCE\n|Burials and settlement defined the Umm Al Nar period\n|}\nSee also\n* List of cultural property of national significance in the United Arab Emirates\n* List of cities of the ancient Near East\nReferences"
