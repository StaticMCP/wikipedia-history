Bishop allegedly had an ugly temperament. In a 2005 American National Public Radio interview, Charles Martell, the maker of Stinking Bishop cheese, related a story that Bishop got angry at his kettle one day for not heating fast enough and in retaliation shot it. This story, although apocryphal, illustrates the sort of behaviour that earned Bishop his reputation for irascibility.\nCharacteristics\n'Moorcroft' is a medium-sized pear of rounded-conical shape; it has a greenish-yellow skin, turning bright yellow, and some russetting. Its juice has medium acidity and tannin with little or no citric acid present; in the 19th century, it was praised for making perry with good alcoholic strength and flavour.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035958/http://www.orchard-group.uklinux.net/glos/pears/ Pears of Gloucestershire, Gloucestershire Orchard Group]"
