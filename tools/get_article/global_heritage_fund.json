The AMAL in Heritage mobile app launched in August 2017.\nBy monitoring sites before and in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, AMAL preserves crucial information that can be used to repair or reconstruct historic structures. The user-friendly technology also supports locals around heritage sites where access to expertise is challenging.\nIn the wake of the August 2020 port explosion in Lebanon, Global Heritage Fund launched a campaign to deliver AMAL in Heritage to the people of Beirut in partnership with the Lebanese Department of Antiquities (DGA). A local team recorded and assessed over 200 buildings in two days using the AMAL toolkit. This information was passed to a copy of Oxford University’s Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and North Africa (EAMENA) Project that is specific to Lebanon and managed by the DGA.\nGlobal Heritage Network\nIn 2010, Global Heritage Fund launched Global Heritage Network (GHN), an early warning and threats monitoring system that uses satellite imaging technology and ground reporting to enable international experts and local conservation leaders to clearly identify and solve imminent threats within the legal core and protected areas of each site.\nSaving Our Vanishing Heritage\nIn October 2010, Global Heritage Fund produced a report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage: Safeguarding Endangered Cultural Heritage Sites in the Developing World. The report listed 500 major archaeological and heritage sites in developing countries, evaluating their current loss and destruction, conservation and development. It identified nearly 200 of these sites as  or  of irreparable loss and destruction. The Vanishing report stated that there were five accelerating man-made threats facing global heritage sites in developing countries: development pressures, unsustainable tourism, insufficient management, looting, and war and conflict.\nStrategic Affiliation with World Monuments Fund\nIn 2023, Global Heritage Fund and World Monuments Fund announced a Strategic Affiliation. The affiliation aims to create a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future for cultural heritage protection worldwide. GHF’s two active projects, Dali Dong Village in Guizhou, China, and La Ciudad Perdida in Colombia, joined WMF’s project portfolio.\nPartners\nGlobal Heritage Fund has worked with over one hundred partners worldwide, including local community boards, NGOs, private sector companies, and local and national governmental bodies. Global Heritage Fund partners include Google Arts & Culture, American Express, Intrepid Foundation (the not-for-profit entity of Intrepid Travel), the A.G. Leventis Foundation, Grow Annenberg, and the J.M. Kaplan Fund.\nReferences"
