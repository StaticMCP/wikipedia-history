The larger than life-size (3.45 meters [11.32 feet]) Lenin monument was built by Russian sculptor Sergey Merkurov from the same red Karelian stone as Lenin's Mausoleum. It was displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair and erected on Kyiv's main Khreshchatyk Street (at the intersection of Shevchenko Boulevard, opposite the Bessarabsky Market) on 5 December 1946.\nThe statue was toppled from its pedestal and crushed by protesters on 8 December 2013, as part of the Euromaidan events, when many other Soviet statues were toppled. The plinth remains in place, and has become at times a site of political artwork, and arguments. Since 2016 various sculptures or installations have been exhibitioned in front of the plinth.

Ukrayinska Pravda. 30 October 2019 [https://m.kyiv.znaj.ua/274130-u-centri-kiyeva-vstanovili-novu-skulpturu-ukrajinci-ne-v-zahvati-kosyaki-vladi-ob-yednani-sharoyu In the center of Kyiv installed a new sculpture, Ukrainians are not thrilled: \"Shackles of power united by a layer\"]. ZNAJ.UA. 30 October 2019\nSince 2015 all monuments connected with communism-related themes and/or persons are illegal in Ukraine.\nPost-Soviet period\nAccording to the decree of the former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, this monument of the Soviet Union and the associated Communist period should have been removed after Ukraine gained independence. Nevertheless, due to the resistance of the Communist Party of Ukraine, whose members were elected to Verhovna Rada, the last Kyiv monument to Lenin was left standing.\nAfter the fall of Soviet rule, the monument suffered numerous incidents of vandalism which led to both increased policing of the area and frequent vigilance by pro-Soviet activists.\nDemolition\nOn 1 December 2013, a group of masked men attempted to topple the statue during the surge of the Euromaidan protests. Police immediately reacted by deploying a small Berkut riot police unit which was attacked, overwhelmed and forced to flee. Euromaidan leaders immediately denounced both the monument attempt and the clash with police as an action of unaffiliated \"provocateurs\".\nLater, on 8 December 2013, several Ukrainian individuals subsequently claimed to be affiliated with the Svoboda political party toppled the statue, as Kyiv police silently looked on. The statue then broke from impact with the ground.\nAfter the fall of the Lenin statue the crowd began to sing the national anthem of Ukraine. Later, pieces of the monument were picked up by protesters as souvenirs.\nOver a hundred other Lenin statues and Soviet icons across Ukraine were destroyed from December 2013 to February 2014.\nResponse\nThe removal or destruction of Lenin monuments and statues gained particular momentum after the destruction of the Kyiv Lenin statue. Under the motto \"Ленінопад\" (Leninopad, translated into English as \"Leninfall\"), activists pulled down a dozen communist monuments in the Kyiv region, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, and elsewhere, or damaged them during the course of the EuroMaidan protests into spring of 2014. In other cities and towns, monuments were removed by organised heavy equipment and transported to scrapyards or dumps.\nPolitical response\nA member of the Ukrainian parliament from the party UDAR, Valeriy Karpuntsov, announced that Ukrainian police had started arrests of people present in the area during the fall of the last monument to Lenin in Kyiv.\nThe governor of Kharkiv Oblast, Mykhailo Dobkin, tweeted on 8 December 2013 about starting a crowdfunding campaign to restore the monument: \"Tomorrow I will open the account for restoration of the monument to Lenin in Kyiv… Everybody, who hates Hutsuls for their stupidity, join\". He stated that he would allocate the sum of ₴100,000 for the restoration of the monument.\nPublic opinion\nMost residents of Kyiv (69%) had a negative attitude to the removal of Lenin's monument during the mass protest actions, while 13% had a positive attitude and 15% remained indifferent.\nNotable figures\n*Singer Ruslana (one of the leading figures of the protests) was critical of the event, saying, \"We do not need any barbaric actions. We condemn acts of vandalism, savagery, violence and anything that can divide and split Ukraine [...] doubling monuments and calls for aggression is nothing but a movement in the opposite direction of European integration and humane society.\"\nLater use of the site\nOn 15 May 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that started a six-month period for the removal of all communist themed monuments in Ukraine.
