The Mount Ommaney Shopping Centre () is located on the outskirts of the suburb and is opposite to the Mount Ommaney Hotel.\nThe mountain is  above sea level. Homes on the top of the mountain generally have views either to the Brisbane CBD, the suburbs, the countryside on the opposite side of the river or the river itself.

Alfresco dining on the verandah is available overlooking the course and across to the hill and creek.\nHistory\nThe suburb takes its name from the mountain, which in turn takes its name from John Mansell Ommaney, the nephew of Stephen Simpson, Commissioner for Crown Lands in the Moreton Bay District. Simpson had designated his nephew, John Ommaney as his heir. On 11 March 1856 the young man, aged 20, was riding from Wolston House and was thrown from his horse. The horse returned to Wolston House and a search was undertaken. Ommaney was found on the ground insensible and, despite medical attention, died. His body was taken by steamer to be buried in the Church of England cemetery at Paddington.\nThe western part of the original land holdings that became the Centenary Suburbs were part of the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Wolston Estate is the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.\nIn 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the area of Wolston Estate. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.\nMount Ommaney was developed as part of the Hooker Centenary Project in 1959. It and the surrounding suburbs such as Jindalee are known as the Centenary Suburbs (1959 being the Centenary of Queensland).\nMount Ommaney Special School opened on 1 January 1992.\nMount Ommaney Library opened in 1997 with a major refurbishment in 2015.\nDemographics\nIn the , the population of Mount Ommaney was 2,334, 54.3% female and 45.7% male.
