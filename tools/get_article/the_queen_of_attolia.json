      "text": "# The Queen of Attolia\n\nThe Queen of Attolia is a young adult fantasy novel by Megan Whalen Turner, published by the Greenwillow Books imprint of William Morrow in 2000 (later, of HarperCollins). It is the second novel in the Queen's Thief series that Turner inaugurated with The Thief in 1996.\nSetting\nThe book is set in fictional landscapes in the small countries of Attolia, Eddis and Sounis, which are modelled in Ancient Greek and other territories around the Mediterranean, particularly Italy. The characters' names are Greek, and references are made to Greek Classical literature. Though the story's pantheon is fictional, the name of the world's primary deity, Hephestia (similar to Hephaestus), suggests influence from Greek mythology. The fantasy world also includes elements from later European cultures, such as guns, pocket watches, printed books and stained glass windows.\nPlot\nEugenides, the renowned Thief of Eddis, a master of deception and daring exploits, makes a critical misstep. While spying on the enigmatic and powerful Queen of Attolia, he is captured. Expecting the swift justice of the hangman's noose, Eugenides is instead subjected to a far more brutal and symbolic punishment: the Queen, invoking an ancient law for thievery, orders his right hand to be severed by the sword. This act, a public display of Attolia's authority, leaves Eugenides physically and emotionally scarred.\nReturning to Eddis, Eugenides is plunged into a profound depression. Stripped of his skill and identity, he struggles to find purpose. Meanwhile, the Queen of Attolia, outwardly a cold and calculating ruler, is revealed to harbor a secret remorse for her harsh decision, hinting at a borrowed and taunts beneath her steely facade.\nEddis and Attolia find themselves on the brink of war, their conflict exacerbated by the opportunistic kingdom of Sounis, which strategically plays both sides to its advantage. Further complicating matters is Nahuseresh, the shrewd and influential ambassador from the formidable Mede Empire. He pays elaborate compliments and gifts to the Queen of Attolia, all while manipulating the escalating conflict to serve the Mede Empire's own hidden agenda, adding a layer of intrigue and suspicion to the already volatile political landscape.\nQueen Attolia, a woman ruling in a world dominated by men, faces challenges from all sides. She must skillfully navigate the treacherous waters of courtly politics, managing the overbearing advances of the Mede ambassador while simultaneously quelling the rebellious sentiments of her own barons, who doubt her ability to rule effectively due to her gender. All this unfolds against the backdrop of a bloody and costly war, threatening to destabilize her kingdom.\nA glimmer of hope emerges when the powerful Magus of Sounis visits Eddis, awakening Eugenides from his despair. Realizing the dire situation his country faces, with his cousin, the Queen of Eddis, potentially losing her throne and her land, Eugenides begins to stir. Recognizing that he must rise to the occasion, Eugenides decides to cast off his depression and embrace a new role, adopting a similar guardedness of heart as Queen Attolia.\nEmploying his cunning and strategic mind, Eugenides embarks on a daring plan to steal the Magus from Sounis, a move designed to sow discord between Attolia and Sounis. Eugenides succeeds in his scheme, temporarily diverting their attention away from Eddis. This masterful manipulation buys the tiny country of Eddis precious time and breathing room as Attolia and Sounis turn their focus and their armies against each other, offering Eddis a chance to survive in the face of overwhelming odds.\nReception\nThe Queen of Attolia received starred reviews from the Horn Book, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly, as well as favorable reviews in other review publications.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
