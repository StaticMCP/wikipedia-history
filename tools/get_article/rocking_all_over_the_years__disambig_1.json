The album contains all Quo's UK top 10 singles, including the new \"Anniversary Waltz (Part One)\", a medley of classic rock and roll songs to celebrate the 25th anniversary of band members Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt first meeting each other. A second rock and roll medley, \"Anniversary Waltz (Part Two)\", was issued as a single later in 1990.\nTrack listing\n# \"Pictures of Matchstick Men\" (Rossi) from Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo – 3:08\n# \"Ice in the Sun\" (Wilde) from Picturesque Matchstickable Messages from the Status Quo – 2:01\n# \"Paper Plane\" (Rossi/Young) from Piledriver – 2:53\n# \"Caroline\" (Rossi/Young) from Hello! – 3:40\n# \"Break the Rules\" (Rossi/Young/Parfitt/Lancaster/Coghlan) from Quo – 3:37\n# \"Down Down\" (Rossi/Young) from On the Level – 3:45\n# \"Roll Over Lay Down\" (Rossi/Young/Parfitt/Lancaster/Coghlan) – 4:41\n# \"Rain\" (Parfitt) from Blue for You – 4:25\n# \"Wild Side of Life\" (Warren/Carter) Single release only – 3:13\n# \"Rockin' All Over the World\" (Fogerty) from ''Rockin' All Over the World – 3:25\n# \"Whatever You Want\" (Parfitt/Bown) from Whatever You Want'' – 3:49\n# \"What You're Proposing\" (Rossi/Frost) from Just Supposin' – 3:50\n# \"Something 'Bout You Baby I Like\" (Supa) from Never Too Late – 2:38\n# \"Rock 'n' Roll\" (Rossi/Frost) from Just Supposin' – 3:50\n# \"Dear John\" (Gustafson/MacCauley) from 1+9+8+2 – 3:12\n# \"Ol' Rag Blues\" (Lancaster/Lamb) from Back to Back – 2:48\n# \"Marguerita Time\" (Rossi/Frost) from Back to Back – 3:19\n# \"The Wanderer\" (Maresca) Single release only – 3:19\n# \"Rollin' Home\" (David) from In the Army Now – 3:58\n# \"In the Army Now\" (Bolland/Bolland) from In the Army Now – 3:39\n# \"Burning Bridges\" (Rossi/Bown) from ''Ain't Complaining'' – 3:51\n# \"Anniversary Waltz (Part One)\" (Lee/Kind/Mack/Mendlesohn/Berry/Maresca/Bartholomew/King/Collins/Penniman/Hammer/Blackwell) new track – 5:00\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
