Within the previous several years, the Shimazu clan of Satsuma province had spread across the island, seizing the Ōtomo clan capital of Funai (Funai Castle). In doing so, they had become a significant power in the region, and threatened Hideyoshi's supremacy over Japan.  Hidenaga's forces pursued the Shimazu beyond Takajō who garrisoned by Yamada Arinobu, and began to besiege the fortress. Shimazu Iehisa then turned his force of 20,000 around, clashing with a detachment of 15,000 Toyotomi warriors. Three thousand Shimazu warriors dismantled the fortifications of the besiegers, and distracted them long enough to effect a cavalry attack. However, they then found themselves flanked by 1500 Toyotomi warriors, who made every effort to give the appearance of a larger force in the Shimazus' rear, cutting off their escape.  Fighting their way through the Toyotomi forces, the Shimazu effected a retreat, leaving Takajō and the surrounding area to Hidenaga.\nReferences"
