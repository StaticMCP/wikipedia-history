The range is one of the most northern ranges in the world and the Arctic Cordillera, surpassed only by the Challenger Mountains which lies immediately to the northwest and the United States Range slightly further east. The highest mountain in the range is Barbeau Peak.\nThe range was named by Gordon Noel Humphreys during the Oxford University Ellesmere Land Expedition. Edward Shackleton, also a member of the party, claimed, in 1937, that Humphreys had done so because he was \"a great imperialist\".\nPeaks of the range include:\n{| style=\"margin-left: 3em\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"0\"\n!Peak|| metres|| feet\n|-\n||Barbeau Peak ||2,616||8,583\n|-\n||Mount Whisler ||2,500||8,202\n|-\n|Mount Oxford ||2,210||7,250\n|-\n|Arrowhead Mountain||1,860||6,102\n|-\n||Highpointer Peak||1,585||5,200\n|}\nReferences\n*Geographical Names of the Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve and Vicinity by Geoffrey Hattersley-Smith (1998)"
