A total of 22 delegates, each with a half vote, attended the convention.\n2004 caucus\nDiana Kerry addresses Democrats Abroad\nIn 2004, Democrats Abroad chose its delegates to the Democratic National Convention via a caucus system, similar to the Iowa caucuses. Caucuses are different from primaries. In the latter, people show up, vote, and go home. In a caucus, different areas or rooms are available for each candidate so that his or her supporters can gather and discuss their candidate's strengths and weaknesses. Caucusgoers who are unsure of their choice can move from room to room to hear about multiple candidates. Straw polls may be taken during the process. Eventually, all the caucusgoers meet in a plenary session and representatives from each room give a short presentation on why his or her candidate should be the Democratic nominee. Then a vote is taken. If some candidates' support is below a certain threshold, that candidate is eliminated and everyone is given the opportunity to switch support. Then a final vote is taken and the number of delegates for each candidate is determined, proportional to his or her share of the vote. The final step consists of the actual election of the delegates pledged to each candidate.\nLocal caucuses were held February 6–9, 2004 and country caucuses February 20–23, 2004. At these caucuses delegates to the regional and world caucuses were elected according to the process discussed above.\nThe regional and world Democrats Abroad caucuses were held back-to-back in Edinburgh, Scotland, March 26–28. The city of Edinburgh held a reception for the delegates at which the mayor spoke and praised the delegates for their active participation in the democratic process.\nAt the caucuses, politicians spoke, as well as Diana Kerry, the sister of the eventual nominee Sen. John Kerry.\n22 delegates and two alternates went to the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.\n2000 caucus\nAl Gore won the 2000 Democrats Abroad presidential caucus.
