It was the first single-volume world bird list to include subspecies names, and until the publication of the 5th edition of James Clements' Checklist of Birds of the World was the only one to do so.\nIt is currently in its fourth edition (2013), and is published by Aves Press in the UK.\nFirst edition\nThe first edition was published in 1980, with a foreword by Leslie Brown. A revised edition was published in 1984.\nSecond edition\nThe second edition was published in 1991, and a reprint was issued in 1994, and included an appendix with a further 282 changes.\nThe jacket paintings are by Martin Woodcock.\nThird edition\nThe third edition was published in 2003. It was edited by Edward C. Dickinson, with the assistance of four other regional compilers: David Pearson (covering Africa), James Van Remsen, Jr. (The Americas), Kees Roselaar (the Palearctic region) and Richard Schodde (Australasia); Dickinson himself acted as the regional consultant for Asia.\nThis edition starts with a foreword from Richard Howard (Alick Moore having died prior to this edition being prepared). A seven-page introduction is followed by a six-page chapter entitled \"Avian Higher-level Phylogenetics and the Howard and Moore Checklist of Birds\" by Joel Cracraft, F. Keith Barker and Alice Cibois, after which is a summary of the family structure used in this edition, in tabular form, giving numbers of genera and species. The bulk of the book, from pages 31 to 826 is the systematic list. A references list from pages 832 to 883 lists 3000 references used in the compilation of the checklist.\nFourth edition\nThe fourth edition was published in two volumes in 2013 and 2014. The first volume (covering the non-passerines) was edited by Edward C. Dickinson and James Van Remsen, Jr. while the second volume (passerines) was edited by Edward C. Dickinson and Les Christidis. The volumes are available for download.\nReferences"
