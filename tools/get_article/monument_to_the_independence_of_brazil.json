It is also known as the Ipiranga Monument () or the Altar of the Fatherland (). The monument is located on the banks of the Ipiranga Brook, on the historic site where prince regent Pedro (later emperor as Pedro I) proclaimed the independence of the country on 7 September 1822.\nThe monument was designed and built by Italian sculptor Ettore Ximenes (1855–1926) and Italian architect Manfredo Manfredi (1859–1927) to celebrate the first centennial of the Brazilian Independence in 1922.\nThe crypt\nA crypt and chapel is located inside the monument. The crypt was built in 1972 to house the remains of Emperor Pedro I (also King of Portugal as Pedro IV) and his wives, Maria Leopoldina of Austria and Amélie of Leuchtenberg. The crypt is consecrated as a Catholic chapel, as demanded by the then head of the Brazilian imperial family, Pedro Henrique of Orléans-Braganza. He agreed to allow the transfer of the remains of his ancestors to the monument on the condition that the place be consecrated as a Catholic place of burial, with a Catholic altar, where masses could be held. Pedro I and Amélie's remains were transferred from the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza in Lisbon; while Maria Leopoldina's was moved from the Imperial Mausoleum of St Anthony's Convent in Rio de Janeiro.\nFile:Olhares sobre o Museu do Ipiranga 2017 041 (cropped).jpg|Pedro I's sarcophagus\nFile:Olhares sobre o Museu do Ipiranga 2017 031.jpg|Visitors\nFile:Olhares sobre o Museu do Ipiranga 2017 042.jpg|Maria Leopoldina's sarcophagus\nFile:Túmulos Dona Amélia e Dom Pedro I.jpg|Amélie's grave\nSculptural set\nCentral panel\nThe revolutionaries\nFile:Museu Paulista 2017 022.jpg|The Minas Gerais conspirators\nFile:MONUMENTO 2 MUSEU DO IPIRANGA.jpg|The Pernambuco revolutionaries\nThe four corner figures\nFile:Joaquim Gonçalves Ledo, Monumento à Independência.JPG|Joaquim Gonçalves Ledoleader of the independence movement in\nFile:Hipólito José da Costa, Monumento à Independência.JPG|Hipólito da Costathe \"father of Brazilian press\"\nFile:José Bonifácio, Monumento à Independência.JPG|José Bonifáciothe \"patriarch of independence\"\nFile:Diogo Antônio Feijó, Monumento à Independência.JPG|Diogo Antônio Feijóregent of the Empire of Brazil\nNotes\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.museudacidade.sp.gov.br/independencia-monumento.php Monument to the Independence of Brazil at the São Paulo City Museum Website]"
