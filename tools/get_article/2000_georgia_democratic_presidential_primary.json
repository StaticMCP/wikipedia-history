The Georgia primary was an open primary, which awarded 93 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of whom 77 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary and 65 delegates with almost 84% of the vote, while senator Bill Bradley only received a little more than 16% and only 12 delegates. Lyndon LaRouche Jr. failed to gain ballot access in Georgia, making this one of the few contests he was not on the ballot for.\nProcedure\nGeorgia was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on March 7, 2000, also known as \"Super Tuesday\".\nVoting was expected to take place throughout the state from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. until 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In the open primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 77 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 4 and 6 were allocated to each of the state's 11 congressional districts and another 10 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 17 at-large delegates.\nThe state committee meeting was subsequently held and voted on the 17 at-large delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 13 unpledged PLEO delegates: 7 members of the Democratic National Committee, 4 members from Congress (1 Senator, Max Cleland, and 3 representatives, Sanford Bishop, Cynthia McKinney, and John Lewis), the governor Roy Barnes, 1 distinguished party leader, that being former president Jimmy Carter, and 2 add-ons.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Bill Bradley\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Georgia Democratic presidential primary\n!
