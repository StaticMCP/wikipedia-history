Speech therapy was open to various ages.\nHistory\nThe school was founded by Dr. Byron Wesley King, who had overcome a stammer in his own youth to become a renowned orator.  King taught speech and drama at Curry College before opening his own school. King died unexpectedly in 1924 during his return from a speaking engagement. His widow continued to operate the school until at least 1948.\nNotable alumni\n* Dutton S. Peterson\n* Ila Marshall Cronin\n* N. C. Hanks\n* Zeola Hershey Misener\n* Venzella Jones\nReferences"
