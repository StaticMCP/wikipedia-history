However, there were also Czech films submitted by Czechoslovakia before it ceased to exist in 1992.\nThe award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, three Czech films have been nominated, one of which, Jan Svěrák's Kolya, has won the award. The two other Czech directors to have films accepted as nominees are Jan Hřebejk's Divided We Fall nominated at the 73rd Academy Awards, and Ondřej Trojan's Želary nominated at the 76th Academy Awards.\nPrior to becoming a separate state in 1993, the Czech Republic was part of Czechoslovakia, which submitted twenty-three films for Oscar consideration between 1964 and 1991. All films chosen during this era had significant input from actors, directors and crew from the Czech Republic, and some of them won the Academy Award like Closely Watched Trains in 1967 and The Shop on Main Street, a Slovak-language production from 1965.\nCzech director Jan Svěrák received an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for his film Kolya.]]\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by the Czech Republic for review by the academy for the award by the year of the submission and the respective Academy Award ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n!
