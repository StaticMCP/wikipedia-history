      "text": "# 2007–08 Queensland Roar FC season\n\nThe 2007–08 Queensland Roar season was the club's third season participating in the A-League where they would finish in fourth place in the regular season.\n2007–08 season\nFailure to qualify for the 2006–2007 finals series resulted in the release from contract of defenders Chad Gibson (the club's first captain and A-league pin-up boy) and Swiss import Remo Buess. Both left on good terms with the club during January 2007 stating that the team had to be altered to make it more competitive in the future.\nIn further evidence of \"spring cleaning\" in preparation for Season 3, Chinese signing Yuning Zhang was released from an inauspicious contract with the Roar. Billed as the Chinese David Beckham, Zhang underwhelmed Roar supporters and will return to China in search of a club within the local scene there.\nDanny Tiatto has signed a two-year contract with Queensland Roar, becoming Frank Farina's first 07/08 signing . Tiatto, who has played in England for the past 11 years for Leicester City and Manchester City, agreed to terms with Queensland after Melbourne declined to sign him.\nFarina has highlighted his favoritism toward young Queensland and indeed Australian players with the signings for the 2007–08 season of highly rated Queenslanders and Youth International Strikers Robbie Kruse and Tahj Minniecon, as well as attacking Midfielder Mitch Nichols. Also, the contracts of highly rated 20-year-olds Chris Grossman and Ben Griffin have been renewed, while Farina has given two-year contracts to Queenslanders Under-17 International Striker Tahj Minniecon and Under-20 and AIS Scholarship holder Robbie. These signings have all made the Roar a team of bright, young talent, predominantly Queenslanders which is Farina's focus.\nQueensland Roar's German import Marcus Wedau has been released from the remaining year of his contract by the A-League club on compassionate grounds. Wedau, 31, will return to Germany to be with his pregnant partner who is expecting their first child in October.\nOn 25 July 2007, Craig Moore was unveiled as the new marquee player for the Roar, returning to his native home state of Queensland, Australia, to play in the 2007/2008 Hyundai A-League Season and the 2008–2009 season\nSquad\nTrialists\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=col | Position\n! scope=col | Name\n! scope=col | Current club\n|-\n|FW || Victor Fenehia || Mitchelton FC\n|-\n|DF || Blake Charity || AIS\n|-\n|DF || Joel Peach || AIS\n|-\n|FW || Gareth Musson || Mitchelton FC\n|}\nTransfers\nIn\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=col | Name\n! scope=col | Position\n! scope=col | Moving from\n|-\n| Danny Tiatto || Midfield || Leicester City\n|-\n| Tahj Minniecon || Forward || AIS\n|-\n| Robbie Kruse || Forward || AIS\n|-\n| Chris Grossman || Midfield || AIS / Rochedale Rovers\n|-\n| Mitch Nichols || Midfield || Palm Beach\n|-\n| Matthew Ham || Goalkeeper|| Brisbane Wolves\n|-\n| Griffin McMaster || Goalkeeper || Mount Gravatt Hawks\n|-\n| Michael Zullo || Midfield || Brisbane City Soccer Club\n|- style=\"background:#e0ffe0;\"\n| Marcinho  || Forward || São Paulo FC\n|- style=\"background:#e0e0ff;\"\n| Craig Moore || Defender || Newcastle United FC\n|-\n| Zoran Petrevski || Forward || Preston Lions\n|}\nOut\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=col | Name\n! scope=col | Position\n! scope=col | Moving to\n|-\n| Chad Gibson || Defender || Released: contract not renewed\n|- style=\"background:#e0ffe0;\"\n| Remo Buess || Defender || Released: contract not renewed\n|- style=\"background:#e0ffe0;\"\n| Yuning Zhang || Forward ||  Released: contract not renewed\n|-\n| Dario Vidosic || Midfield||  1.
