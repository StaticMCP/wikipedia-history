      "text": "# Queen's Gift\n\n'Queen's Gift' is a 1952 American historical novel by Inglis Fletcher, the seventh and last in her \"Carolina Series\" that began in 1940 with the publication of ''Raleigh's Eden''.\nThe story mixes fictional romantic plot-lines with actual historical events surrounding the political conflicts associated with North Carolina's entry into the Union. James Iredell, Samuel Johnston and Penelope Barker are among the actual historical figures depicted; it also dramatizes historical events like the Hillsborough and Fayetteville Conventions.\nFletcher reportedly called ''Queen's Gift \"the most difficult book she had ever written\" up to that point.\nPublication history\nAs with Fletcher's other Carolina Novels, ''Queen's Gift was published by Bobbs-Merrill in hardcover with a wraparound illustrated dust jacket. It was republished as a mass market paperback by Bantam in 1973.\nReception\nRichard Walser, a reviewer for the Raleigh News and Observer, said that \"Queen's Gift represents Inglis Fletcher at her best\" and declared that \"(n)o literate North Carolinan would ever dare admit not having read it.\" Victor P. Hass also provided a positive review, writing of its position in the series: \"I closed Queen's Gift'' with real regret; it will seem strange not to look forward to another panel in the series.\"\nReferences"
