      "text": "# Culture of Togo\n\nTogo's culture reflects the influences of its 37 tribal ethnic groups, the largest and most influential of which are the Ewe, Mina, and Kabye.  French is the official language of Togo, but many native African languages are spoken there as well. Despite the influence of Western religion, more than half of the people of Togo follow native animistic practices and beliefs.\nEwe statuary is characterized by its famous statuettes which illustrate the worship of the twins, the ibéji. Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the more ubiquitous African masks. The wood-carvers of Kloto are famous for their \"chains of marriage\": two characters are connected by rings drawn from only one piece of wood.\nThe dyed fabric batiks of the artisanal center of Kloto represent stylized and colored scenes of ancient everyday life. The loincloths used in the ceremonies of the tisserands of Assahoun are famous. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the immense arid extents, swept by the harmattan, and where the laterite keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician Paul Ahyi is internationally recognized today. He practises the \"zota\", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate Lomé.\nFestival\nTogolese are celebrate their traditional festival according their different ethnic groups.\nAgbogbo Zã is celebrate in Notsè  by Ewe ethnicity in memory of the walls and the history of Agbogbo.\nDunenyo Zā is a  traditional festival of Ewe people in south Togo.

We have dance of funerals, storytelling, praise and worship. Some ethnic group are choosing the dance of marriage.  There are various dances across the 5 regions in Togo.\nCommunity\nIn Togo, a branch of the global Protestant fraternal organization known as the Orange Order exists, which is governed by the Grand Lodge of Togo. The first lodge in the country, LOL 867, \"Defenders of Lome,\" was formed in September 1915 by John Amate Atayi, a local who had been initiated into a lodge in Lagos, Nigeria. The lodges in Togo, which also include LOL 884, focus on positive evangelism, youth development, and community philanthropy. Members view the victory of William of Orange as a symbol of civil and religious freedom rather than a political one.\nSee also\n* Mass media in Togo\n* Music of Togo\n* List of Togolese people\nReferences\n*[https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/togo/ CIA World Factbook: Togo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101116004024/http://www.mistg-un.org/fr/ U.N.
