Both sides arrived on the battlefield unimpeded and even before engaging, Rokkaku troops defeated the army of Dodo Kuranosuke. After that easy skirmish, they believed they had already won the battle. Highly motivated under Nagamasa, his troops charged unintimidated and in the chaos of the battle, the Rokkaku force collapsed and retreated under heavy losses.\nAftermath\nThe Azai clan ousted their defunct leader Azai Hisamasa, replacing him with Nagamasa. The Rokkaku clan fell into disarray with retainers questioning Yoshikata's rule; his strength weakened never to recover to its height.\nReferences"
