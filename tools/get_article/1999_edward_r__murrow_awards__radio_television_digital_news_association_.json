Murrow Awards were presented by the Radio-Television News Directors Association (RTNDA), now renamed the Radio Television Digital News Association (RTDNA) in recognition of what the association terms \"outstanding achievements in electronic journalism\".  National winners were selected from a pool of regional award winners.  Below are the 1999 national award winners, which recognizes coverage that aired during the previous 1998 calendar year.\nCategories that are not listed either had no entrants or the entries received were not deemed worthy of the award.  The category currently called Breaking News was called \"Spot News Coverage\" in 1999, so the lists below have been edited to read Breaking/Spot News to avoid any confusion.\nThe information on this page was retrieved using the Archive.org Internet Wayback Machine to access the now defunct website for RTNDA.org, a domain that was abandoned when the organization was renamed RTDNA.\n1999 National Edward R.
