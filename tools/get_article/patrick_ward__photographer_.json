      "text": "# Patrick Ward (photographer)\n\nPatrick Ward (born 1937) is a British photographer who has published collections of his own work on British and other subjects as well as working on commissions for the press.\nLife and career\nWard became interested in photography while doing National Service when a friend sent him the book of The Family of Man. He started out as an assistant to the photographer John Chillingworth (previously at Picture Post), and his own work was published in \"Manplan\" at The Architectural Review, the Observer Magazine, the Sunday Times Magazine, and the Telegraph Magazine.\nIn his own time, Ward worked on a portrayal of the English at play that resulted in the book Wish You Were Here, published in 1976 by Gordon Fraser in a uniform edition with Homer Sykes' Once a Year. This was also an observation of the class divisions of England.\nWard was one of a number of photographers who contributed to Bill Jay's short-lived Album, and Jay credits his and David Hurn's generosity with saving him from starvation during that period.\nCommenting on Wish You Were Here and Flags Flying (1977), Daniela Mrázková wrote that \"Ward is not a reporter but rather [an] essayist who can relate serious matters in a totally unserious manner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\"\nPublications\nBooks of work by Ward\n*Wish You Were Here: The English at Play.
