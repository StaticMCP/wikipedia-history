It was built on the hill of Fourvière, which is situated in the center of the Roman city. The theatre is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site that protects the historic center of Lyon.\nChronology\nThe theatre was constructed in two phases: around 15 BC, a theatre with a 90 m (98 yd) diameter was built next to the hill. At the beginning of the 2nd century, the final construction added a last section for the audience. The diameter is 108 m (118 yd), and there were seats for 10,000 people.\nToday the theatre is primarily a tourist site, but it is still used as a cultural venue. Each year, the Nuits de Fourvière festival takes place in the theatre.\nSee also\n* Odeon of Lyon\n* List of Roman theatres\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Ancient theatre of Fourvière\n\n#REDIRECT Ancient Theatre of Fourvière\n\n---\n\n## Ancient Theatre of Fourviere\n\n#REDIRECT Ancient Theatre of Fourvière"
