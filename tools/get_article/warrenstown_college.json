In 1958, the college developed a new site beside the old college building, and in 1968, specific programmes for the horticultural industry were started at the college.\nIn the 1980s, the college offered a two-year course in commercial horticulture and awarded a senior certificate to successful candidates.\nProduce from the farm and glasshouses was sold through the market at Smithfield in Dublin.\nThe principal of the horticultural college was Br James O'Hare, succeeded by Harold Lawlor.\nThe college offered a FETAC Vocational Certificate in Horticulture at three different levels (4, 5 and 6) with progression routes such as the National Diploma in Horticulture which validated by HETAC and run in conjunction with Teagasc and other horticultural colleges, was available at Warrenstown.\nThe college had developed links with the nearby Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and developed a BSc in horticulture.\nClosure\nThe agricultural college closed in 2001, and in 2008 Warrenstown Horticultural College also announced it was to close in 2009. 200 students and staff were to be transferred to the Botanic Gardens (who also have a linkage with IT Blanchardstown) and other Teagasc facilities.\nThe 450 acre farm was sold in 2008 for €13.8million.\nColaiste na bhFiann\nSince 2010, the college has been a site for Coláiste na bhFiann, an Irish Language college who purchased the college and 20 acres from the Salesians. The Salesians, whose headquarters is in Crumlin, Dublin 12, still run Pallaskenry Agricultural College in Limerick.\nReferences"
