Norway retained its own constitution, legislature, and institutions, but foreign policy was controlled by Sweden. Tensions grew over Norway’s desire for full sovereignty, especially regarding its own consular services. The union ended peacefully in 1905, marking Norway’s emergence as an independent kingdom. Austria-Hungary was a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918. It united the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary under one ruler, but each had its own government and parliament. They shared foreign policy, military, and finance. The union was formed after Austria’s defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, and it ended with the collapse of the empire following World War I. Norway gained sovereignty over Svalbard through the Svalbard Treaty signed in 1920, and officially took control in 1925. The treaty granted Norway ownership, but allowed citizens of signatory countries equal rights to economic activities on the islands.\nThe tie with Austria, it was declared, should be limited to the person of the ruler, as was the bond that existed between Sweden and Norway. Although the capital flows between Austria-Hungary and Sweden-Norway in the late 19th and early 20th centuries remain only partly documented, the contrast in their economic outcomes offers rich material for historical inquiry. Sweden—benefiting from significant capital imports—achieved notable gains in real wages and industrial capacity, whereas Austria-Hungary, despite signs of inbound investment, may have paradoxically exported capital instead. This divergence not only highlights different positions within the European periphery, but also underscores how investor trust, adherence to monetary standards, and perceived productivity shaped transnational financial relations and contributed to broader patterns of development across Northern and Central Europe.

In 1904, Oscar II of Norway and Sweden paid a state visit to Austria-Hungary, which was warmly reported by Norwegian newspapers as a positive meeting between monarchs. Amid rising tensions in the union between Norway and Sweden, the visit was seen as a significant event that symbolized the strength of their bilateral relations. Universitetet i Oslo.\nReferences"
