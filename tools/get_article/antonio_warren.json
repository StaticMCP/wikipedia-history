He had a career-high 1,136 yards rushing in his first full season as a starter. He set a club record with 160 yards on 18 carries in a losing effort in the 2004 Grey Cup game against the Toronto Argonauts. That Grey Cup total ranked second all-time, trailing only Johnny Bright's 171 yards in 1956, at the time the game was played (though Kory Sheets has since broke Bright's record in the 2013 Grey Cup with 197 yards).\nIn 2005, he led the CFL in rushing touchdowns with 13 and ranked second overall with 16. He led the Lions in rushing for the second straight season and was fourth in the CFL with 2,179 combined yards.\nIn 2006, Warren rushed for 169 yards in five games with the Lions before he was released in July. Joe Smith replaced him as the Lions' starting running back.\nProfessional regular season statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=0 style=\"background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|-\n| Year || Team || Rush Att. || Yards || Avg. ||LG||  TD\n|-\n!2001\n|Calgary Stampeders\t||59\t||372\t||6.3\t||39 \t||1\n|-\n! 2002\n|Calgary Stampeders\t||23\t||138\t||6.0\t||37 \t||0\n|-\n! 2004\n|BC Lions\t||219\t||1,136\t||5.2\t||37 \t||5\n|-\n! 2005\n|BC Lions\t||205\t||983\t||4.8\t||50 \t||13\n|-\n! 2006\n|BC Lions\t||41\t||169\t||4.1\t||16 \t||0\n|-\n|\n!
