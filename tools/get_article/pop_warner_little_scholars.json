It is the largest youth football organization in the United States.\nIts headquarters are in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Pop Warner Little Scholars is named after football coach Pop Warner, who heavily contributed to the organization in its early years.\nParticipation\nParticipation has declined as parents become more concerned about concussions in American football.\nJasmine Plummer was the first girl to participate in a Pop Warner football team as quarterback. At the age of 11 years old, she became the first female quarterback and the first black female athlete to play in the Pop Warner Super Bowl youth football tournament, specifically the 56th Annual Pop Warner Super Bowl (Junior Pee Wee division); however, her team, the Harvey Colts, lost in the semifinals.\nAge and weight divisions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

One game in particular in 2012 resulted in five concussions. In 2015, a family sued Pop Warner over the suicide of a former player who was later found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), claiming that the organization knew or should have known about the risk of head injuries. Several other lawsuits have been filed against Pop Warner for related cases.  At least one case resulted in a settlement.\nIn 2016, the Pop Warner league banned kickoffs in an attempt to reduce high-speed collisions that result in concussions.  In 2019, they banned younger players from using a three-point stance, which is associated with head injuries.\nA 2018 study found that tackle football before age 12 was correlated with earlier onset of symptoms of CTE, but not with symptom severity.  There have also been advocates for flag football only before certain ages.\nMichael Lewis, a preventive medicine specialist on the Pop Warner Youth Football Medical Advisory Board, says that even people who do not believe that football causes CTE should support reducing the number of times children and adolescents have their heads hit, because \"there’s no downside to decreasing\" the risk to the brain.  The Concussion Legacy Foundation with the slogan \"Stop Hitting Kids in the Head\",  encourages parents and coaches to prefer flag football over tackle football until age 14.\nSee also\n* Early sports specialization\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
