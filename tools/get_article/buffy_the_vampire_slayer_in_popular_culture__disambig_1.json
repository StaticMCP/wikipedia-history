      "text": "# Buffy the Vampire Slayer in popular culture__disambig_1\n\n}}\nA popular American television show from the late 1990s through early 2000s, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has had a tremendous influence on popular culture that has attracted serious scholarly attention. Even the language used on the show has affected modern colloquial expressions.A noteworthy example of this pioneering is the fact that the first use on television of the verb \"to google\" as a verb appeared on the show on October 15, 2002, in the fourth episode of the show's final season.\nReferences in other works of fiction\nBuffy and its spinoff, Angel which employed pop culture references as a frequent humorous device, have themselves also become a frequent pop culture reference in video games, comics and television shows, and has been frequently parodied and spoofed. Sarah Michelle Gellar, the actress who played Buffy, has herself participated in several parody sketches, including a Saturday Night Live sketch in which the Slayer is relocated to the Seinfeld universe, and adding her voice to an episode of Robot Chicken that parodied a would-be eighth season of Buffy. There are also several adult parodies of Buffy, web comics, and music.\nTelevision\nSketch shows\nThere have been a number of spoofs of Buffy on notable TV comedy sketch shows.  In chronological order:\n*MADtv (1997) – \"Buffy the Umpire Slayer\" sketch in which Nicole Sullivan starred as 'Buffy'.

It also includes cast members Andrew Daly as Spike, Mo Collins as Willow and Stephnie Weir as Tara.\n*V Graham Norton – When Anthony Head appeared on Norton's show, he spoofed \"Buffy\" in a \"Poofy the Vampire Slayer\" sketch. Graham Norton portrayed 'Poofy', whilst Head portrayed 'Rupert Giles'.\n*Robot Chicken – Series co-created by Seth Green (who portrayed Oz on Buffy).
