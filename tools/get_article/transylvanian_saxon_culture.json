The Transylvanian Saxon heritage in Romania is present in the local architecture of many Transylvanian villages, towns, and cities as well as in the Romanian cuisine, as dishes of German origin are shared between the cultures of the two peoples. The eclectic origins of the Transylvanian Saxons as a Germanic people (with roots also from Luxembourg) make their regional culture to be distinguished as Central European and Western European (given their origins from the Rhine river valley).\nFolk dances\nExamples of Transylvanian Saxon folk dances include Königinnentanz (i.e. the queens' dance) or der Webertanz (i.e. the tailors' dance).\nCultural festivals and celebrations\n, Bavaria, southern Germany in May.]]\nHaferland is the name of the Transylvanian Saxon cultural festival which unfolds over a period of time of one week. The festival has been attended by both Romanians and foreign tourists as well. Another noteworthy historical Transylvanian Saxon festival is the Crown Festival (). There is also the annual gathering (or Pentecost; ) of the Transylvanian Saxons held in the small Bavarian town of Dinkelsbühl in southern Germany. The respective festival is held annually in May.\nVisual arts\nIn terms of visual arts, the Transylvanian Saxons have excelled at painting through the works of the following artistic representatives: Friedrich Miess, Fritz Schullerus, Trude Schullerus, Arthur Coulin, or Edith Soterius von Sachsenheim, the latter whom also emigrated to England.\nReligion\nReligion has been a very important part of the Transylvanian Saxon culture throughout the passing of time. In the distant past, more specifically during the High Middle Ages until the Reformation, the Transylvanian Saxons were Roman Catholic. After the Reformation, the vast majority of the Transylvanian Saxons became Lutherans through a peaceful collective conversion. Nowadays, the small Transylvanian Saxon community still left in Romania is religiously represented by the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Romania ().\nContributions to Romanian culture\nThe Transylvanian Saxons also contributed significantly to the Romanian culture through their historical heritage and the century-long cohabitation with the Romanians in southern, south-eastern, and north-eastern Transylvania. Their heritage in these areas of Transylvania is best represented by the rural fortified settlements which are UNESCO-recognized World Heritage Sites. It is estimated that there have been  300 (or even more than 300 according to a particular estimate) such fortified settlements known as kirchenburgen (or fortress church) in German. Nevertheless, nowadays the number of those which haven't yet fallen into ruin is significantly lower, estimated at 150–200.\nThe contributions of the Transylvanian Saxons to the Romanian culture also include a significant number of loanwords from German to Romanian, most notably denoting professional titles or tools (see also Romanian terms derived from German on Wiktionary). In the Romanian lexis, there is also a significant influence stemming from Austrian High German ().\nContributions to humanity\nThe Transylvanian Saxons also made noteworthy contributions to humanity in the field of science and technology by pioneering spacecraft propulsion through the works of engineers Conrad Haas and Hermann Oberth.\nGallery\nFile:Die Gartenlaube (1884) b 597 3.jpg|Transylvanian Saxon medieval guardsmen, illustration from 'Die Gartenlaube' (1884)\nFile:Die Gartenlaube (1884) b 597 2.jpg|Transylvanian Saxon medieval guardsmen, illustration from 'Die Gartenlaube' (1884)\nFile:Biserica Neagra, Brasov, Romania.jpg|The Black Church () in Brașov ()\nFile:DealuFrumos2.JPG|Evangelical Lutheran fortified church at Dealu Frumos (), Merghindeal (), Sibiu County of the local Transylvanian Saxon community\nFile:Saschiz IMG 5621.jpg|Fortified pesant citadel of Saschiz ()\nFile:Rumänien.
