The succeeding president Lee changed its status to the vice-ministerial level. President Moon returned this post to a ministerial-level position which was abolished under Park's administration. Moon's successor Yoon abolished the post following his promise to reduce the size of the presidential secretariat. However, Yoon revived this post in order to strengthen policy coordination.\nList of presidential secretaries for policy\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" | President\n|-\n!
