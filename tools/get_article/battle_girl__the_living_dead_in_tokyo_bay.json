Simply put, this is one of the most boring, nonsensical, bloodsucker excursions I've seen.\"  Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said that the \"low-budget effects and goofy costumes are devastating for a science fiction apocalypse feature such as this one\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
