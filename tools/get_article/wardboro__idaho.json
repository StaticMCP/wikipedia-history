This name could not be kept when the U.S. Postal Service rejected is as there was already a Preston in Franklin County.\nThe present name is after Wardsboro, Vermont, the native home of a share of the early settlers. Other names proposed included Heepsville (after the daughter of William and Sophia Heap who had died in a blizzard), Prestonville, Greensborough, Troy and Dalrymple Dell. Oscar Dalrymple's of naming the town after his hometown of Wardboro won the day. A rumor subsequently arose that the town was named after its first postmaster, Milton Ward.\nReferences"
