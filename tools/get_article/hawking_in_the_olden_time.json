      "text": "# Hawking in the Olden Time\n\nHawking in the Olden Time, or simply Hawking, is an 1832 genre painting by the British artist Edwin Landseer. It depicts a historic scene of hawking with the hawk and a heron dominating the composition, and the human figures moved into the background. The painting was the first of Landseer's major works to feature hawking, a theme he would return to. It was displayed at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1832 at Somerset House in London, where it was praised by The Athenaeum as a \"wonderful piece of painting, and boldly conceived\". Today the painting is in the collection of Kenwood House in Highgate, having been acquired as part of the Iveagh Bequest in 1929.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Bryant, Julius.
