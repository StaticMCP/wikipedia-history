The west, centre, and south of the locality are low-lying flatter where the land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nIn 1922, local people requested a school in Middlebrook, claiming there were 25 children in the district. However, it was not until January 1935 that a site was chosen and approval was given to erect a school building capable of accommodating 40 students. It was also necessary to extend Middlebrook Road and build a bridge over a creek to make the school accessible.  Middlebrook Road State School (also known as Middlebook State School) opened on 2 September 1935 with Charles Mathew Connolly as the first head teacher. It closed circa 14 December 1945. The school building was relocated to Millaa Millaa State School and a bus service was provided to transport the students to Millaa Millaa to attend school each day. The school was located on the eastern corner of Middlebrook Road and Barter Road (approx ).\nDemographics\nIn the , Middlebrook had a population of 55 people.\nIn the , Middlebrook had a population of 62 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Middlebrook.
