Cowan\n|synonyms = Swartzia tomentosa\n}}\nSwartzia panacoco, known as panococo or Brazilian ebony, is a tree of the bean family, growing in Guyana, South America.  Its wood is hard and durable. The heartwood ranges from an olive brown to a near black color and can have lighter or darker markings that are sharply separated from the sapwood, which is lighter and yellow in appearance.\nThe wood of the panococo is used much like ebony but more limited due to smaller size logs.\nAccording to \"The Treasury of Botany\" published by Longmans, Green, and Co. of London in 1899 for John Lindley, Ph.D., F.R.S., F.L.S., an Emeritus Professor of Botany in University College, London, panococo is also a French name for Ormosia coccinea.\nIn 1997, it was listed in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants.\nReferences"
