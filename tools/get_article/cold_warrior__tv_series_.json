Moving away from the serial format of Blood Money and Skorpion, Cold Warrior was a series of eight stand-alone episodes, which saw Percival dealing with various threats to national security. He was assisted by Jo (Lucy Fleming) and Danny Quirk (Dean Harris) - the latter also reprising his role from Blood Money.\nCast\n* Michael Denison - Captain Aubrey Percival\n* Lucy Fleming - Jo\n* Dean Harris - Danny Quirk\n* David Swift - Sir William Logie\nEpisodes\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #800517; color:#FFFFFF;\"| #\n! style=\"background: #800517; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Title\n! style=\"background: #800517; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background: #800517; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background: #800517; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Original air date (UK)\n|-\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\n| LineColor       = 800517\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
