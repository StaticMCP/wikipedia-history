Produced by Raoul Nadalet and directed by Alain Tshinza, the movie showcases the growth of the culture through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s in the small country of Luxembourg. Centered around the Four elements of hip hop (Breakdance, Graffiti, Rap and DJing) the movie follows local practitioners from the different generations and gives an in-depth view of a culture that is often associated with violence and juvenile delinquency.\nThe documentary is named after the former underground passage under Place Émile-Hamilius which became a meeting point for dancers and members of the local hip-hop scene. The film offers an interesting angle on Luxembourgish culture and language through several generations of an art scene and movement which has seen its active members grow to positions as scholars, professors, entrepreneurs and journalists, coming from a space that is often swept under the rug.\nCast\n{|\n| valign=top width=450 |\n* Project X\n* Tom Mahnen\n* Nikki Etikwa Ikuku\n* Sputnix\n* JMP\n* CHI\n* LX Team\n* Cool Brebs & Systematic Crew\n* DJ Mike MC\n* Sloggy\n* Andre Haagen\n* DJ Kwistax\n* All Schools Collectif\n| valign=top width=450 |\n* Spike\n* Kaos\n* Stick\n* Sumo\n* Giamba\n* DJ Jean Maron\n* DJ Mätti\n* Fail\n* Opposition\n* Foundation\n* Z-Town Massiv\n* Valkila\n* De Läb\n|}\nSee also\n* Cinema of Luxembourg\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160205025455/http://hamilius.net/ (official website)] of Hamilius: Hip Hop Culture in Luxembourg\n*"
