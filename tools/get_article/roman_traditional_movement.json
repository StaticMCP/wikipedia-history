It was founded in 1988 as a unification of several existing groups. Among the founders were , Renato Del Ponte and Roberto Incardona.\nHistory\nThe Roman Traditional Movement was created in 1988, following an effort in the 1980s to unify different strands of Roman Neopaganism in Italy. A part of the background was a return to the religious roots of the Traditionalism of Julius Evola, represented by the Gruppo di Dioscuri and its successor Arx in Messina, but without the politics otherwise associated with Evola in the post-war period. Arx joined forces with the unrelated groups Centro Studi \"Claudio Flavio Giuliano\", the Istituto Siciliano di Studi Tradizionali and the Centro Studi \"Giorgio Gemisto Pletone\" to hold three meetings from 1985 to 1988, which resulted in the creation of a common organisation. Some of the key people involved were the religious writer and former Italian Social Movement politician , the historian Renato Del Ponte and the researcher Roberto Incardona. The original name was the Roman Traditionalist Movement (), which was shortened to the current name in 1998, following some defections and a reorganisation.\nActivity\nThe Roman Traditional Movement practices and works to support and spread what it calls the Roman Way to the Gods (), Roman-Italic religion (Italian: Religione Romano-Italica) or Gentile Roman religion. It publishes the magazine La Cittadella and organises meetings and conferences. In 2005 it became a member of the European Congress of Ethnic Religions.\nSee also\n* UR Group\n* Neopaganism in Italy\n* Reconstructionist Roman religion\n* Natale di Roma\n* Pietas Comunità Gentile\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://ecer-org.eu/organisations/the-movimento-tradizionale-romano-roman-traditionalist-movement-m-t-r/ Presentation and history] at the European Congress of Ethnic Religions"
