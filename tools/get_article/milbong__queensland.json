An Aboriginal with only one eye is supposed to have camped by a waterhole in the vicinity.\nIn the late 1870s, the choice of name for the district was contentious with three names in popular use: One Eye Waterhole (from the natural feature), Blantyre (the name of a local farm), Waterview (the name of the Congregational Church) and Milbong.  The establishment of a post office and school created a need to resolve the issue of naming, resulting in Milbong being eventually chosen.\nBlantyre One Eye Waterhole State School was established circa 25 July 1874. By 1877, it had been renamed Milbong State School. It closed in 1965. It was at 2616 Ipswich Boonah Road (corner Milbong Road, ).\nBlantyre Congregational Church at \"One Eye\" was completed about 1877, later being called the Waterview Congregational Church, before becoming known as Milbong Congregational Church. It was at 5 Milbong Road (). The church building is still extant, but is now being used as a house.\nMilbong Lutheran Church (also known as St Luke's Lutheran Church) opened on 23 September 1885. A new church (built on  the site of the original church) was opened on 10 April 1906, while the old church was removed to be use as a barn but was later burned down. The church closed in 1974 and the church building removed, but the cemetery remains. The church site and cemetery was on the Ispwich Boonah Road, but is now within the suburb of Roadvale.\nDemographics\nIn the , Milbong had a population of 161 people.
