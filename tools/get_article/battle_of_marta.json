It follows a significant Byzantine victory through which John Troglita managed to suppress the Berber rebellion led by Antalas. However, in this instance, the Berber rebels manage to re-organize and prevail, for the pacified Moors gain the victory for Byzantines in the battle of the fields of cato which procopius mention as unexpected.\nBackground\nAfter the conquest of the Vandal Kingdom in 534, the Byzantine Empire restored Roman rule over North Africa, but it quickly faced resistance from Berber tribes concerned about their autonomy. Following several more or less suppressed uprisings, a major rebellion erupted in 543, jeopardizing the Byzantine position in Africa. In 546, Emperor Justinian dispatched John Troglita to take control of the province, weakened by divisions and the incompetence of Byzantine leadership. Successfully forming an alliance with Cusina, a Berber chief, and engaging in a pitched battle against the rebel coalition led by Antalas, Troglita achieved a significant success upon his arrival.\nHowever, the rebellion is not completely suppressed. In Tripolitania, Carcasan, the leader of the Ifuraces, become leader of the Libyan tribes after the death of Ierna priest of Gurzil and leader of the Libyans and go joining Antalas who migrated in the south, launching raids into roman africa. Meanwhile, the Byzantines are weakened by the departure of a portion of their troops to Italy to participate in the war against the Goths. In reality, of the nine regiments, only six remain, and Ifisdaïas withdraws his support for Troglita. The rebels' territory is arid, and mounting a Byzantine expedition is complicated by the lack of supplies. In the midst of summer, the shortage of water and food becomes apparent, leading to a mutiny among the Byzantine troops Quickly, John Troglita must retreat toward the coast, but adverse winds prevent the support fleet from approaching. Simultaneously, the Berber rebels also face a shortage of supplies as their numbers exceed the capacity of local oases. Soon, they are spotted by Byzantine scouts, and John Troglita pursues them, still with the support of Cusina, before establishing his camp at Marta.\nBattle\nThe battlefield is crossed by a river that separates the two armies. John Troglita orders his light troops to hold the downstream of the river, thwarting any attempts at crossing through the use of projectile weapons. The Byzantines launch a disorderly charge and manage to drive the Berber rebels from the riverbanks. The rebels' retreat sparks martial enthusiasm among the Byzantines and their Berber allies. Nevertheless, Jean hesitates about advancing further. He arranges his army to be prepared for any eventuality, organizing it into three corps. On the left wing are the Berbers led by Cusina, in the center are General John Troglita and the infantry phalanxes, and on the right wing is the Byzantine cavalry with Putzintulus, Geisirith, and Sinduit. John hesitates before committing the army, following the advice of his escort officers, the domestic protectors. Finally, influenced by the counsel of two Byzantine officers, he decides to initiate the battle without knowing the arrangement of his adversary. The Berber rebels have taken refuge in wooded terrain, hindering the handling of the Byzantine phalanx's pikes and favoring surprise attacks by the rebels. Soon, the Byzantines are vulnerable to the rebels' attacks, taking advantage of their adversaries' mobility challenges.Jean hesitates before committing the army, following the advice of his escort officers, the domestic protectors.\nCarcasan mobilizes the bulk of his troops, launches a counter-attack that overwhelms the Byzantines. Cusina panics first and leaves the battlefield, triggering the Byzantines' retreat. John Troglita, intervening personally to revive the courage of his troops, sees his horse shot from under him and, surrounded, has to free himself with his sword. He reforms combat groups and retreats while fighting, pressed by the rebels. He crosses the river again, retreats along the coast, reaching the port of Iunci (Younga). Finally, he finds refuge behind the walls of Laribus for the winter.\nAftermath\nThis defeat is a setback for John Troglita, who had embarked on a campaign to eradicate the Berber rebellion. However, his defeat is mitigated by his ability to organize the retreat of his troops and avoid the annihilation of his army. According to Corippus, the author of \"La Johannide,\" an epic dedicated to John Troglita and the primary account of the battle, the defeat is explained by the nature of the terrain and the numerical superiority of the Berbers. Finally, he attributes the success of the Byzantine retreat to the Berbers' inability to organize an effective pursuit, as they are hindered by the size of their herds. After their victory, Procopius notes that the Berber rebels extended their raids to the walls of Carthage and \"exercised horrible cruelties on the inhabitants of the country.\"\nAntalas, upon learning of the victory of the rebels, immediately rises and joins the Tripolitanian tribes the following year. On the other hand, John Troglita manages to rally several Berber leaders, including Cusina, Ifisdaïas, and Iaudas, enabling him to achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of the Fields of Cato and bring an end to the Berber rebellion.\nReferences"
