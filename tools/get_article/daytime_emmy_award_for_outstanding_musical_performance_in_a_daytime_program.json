The Award honors the work of a musical artist and the Program’s production of the performance. With the current title award name that was established in 2017, on-camera musical performances from any appropriate Daytime show and several entries for performances by different musical artists appearing on a program are eligible to enter the competition, rather than just a talk show or morning program.\nThe award was removed in November 2019 after category changes were announced.\nWinners and nominees\nwas the first winner in this category, for her performance of her song \"Fight Song\" on Good Morning America.]]\n(pictured) alongside of the Broadway cast from The Color Purple won in 2016 for their performance of the titutar song on Today Show.]]\n(pictured) alongside of the Broadway cast from Dear Evan Hansen won in 2017 for their performance of \"You Will Be Found\" on Today Show.]]\nListed below are the winners of the award for each year, as well as the other nominees.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\" background: #f6e39c;\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7%;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\" | Performer(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\" | Program\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%;\" | Performed\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Network\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2016 (43rd)\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Rachel Platten\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Good Morning America\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | \"Fight Song\"\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\n|\n|-\n|Adele\n|Today Show\n| \"Million Years Ago\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |NBC\n| rowspan=\"4\" |}}\n|-\n|Annie Lennox\n|The Talk\n| \"I Put a Spell on You\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |CBS\n|-\n|ELO\n|CBS This Morning Saturday\n| \"When I Was a Boy\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |CBS\n|-\n|Bruno Mars & Mark Ronson\n|The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n| \"Uptown Funk\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |Syndicated\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2017 (44th)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Cynthia Erivo & the Cast of The Color Purple\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Today Show\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | \"The Color Purple\"\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |NBC\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n|Charles Bradley\n|CBS This Morning Saturday\n| \"Ain't a Sin\" / \"The World (Is Going Up In Flames)\" / \"Changes\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |CBS\n| rowspan=\"4\" |}}\n|-\n|Michael Bublé\n|Live! with Kelly\n| \"Nobody but Me\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |Syndicated\n|-\n|Pentatonix\n|Rachael Ray\n| \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |Syndicated\n|-\n|St. Paul and The Broken Bones\n|CBS This Morning Saturday\n| \"All I Ever Wonder\" / \"Flow With It\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |CBS\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2018 (45th)\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Ben Platt & the Cast of Dear Evan Hansen\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Today Show\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | \"You Will Be Found\"\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |NBC\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n|Andra Day and Common\n|The View\n| \"Rise Up\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |ABC\n| rowspan=\"4\" |}}\n|-\n|Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit\n|CBS This Morning Saturday\n| \"Cumberland Gap\" / \"If We Were Vampires\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |CBS\n|-\n|Robert Randolph and the Family Band\n|Rachael Ray\n| \"Love Do What It Do\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |Syndicated\n|-\n|Pharrell Williams\n|The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n| \"Runnin\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |Syndicated\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2019 (46th)\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |  Cast of ''The Band's Visit\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Today Show\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |\"Answer Me\"\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |NBC\n|rowspan=6| }}\n|-\n|Adrienne Houghton, Israel Houghton\n|The Real\n|\"Secrets\"\n|Syndicated\n|-\n|Lindsey Stirling\n|Live with Kelly and Ryan\n|\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\"\n|Syndicated\n|-\n|Ashley McBryde\n|CBS This Morning Saturday''\n|\"Girl Goin' Nowhere / American Scandal\"\n|CBS\n|-\n|Ben Rector\n|Pickler & Ben\n|\"Old Friends\"\n|CMT\n|}\nSeries with most nominations\n;5 nominations\n*CBS This Morning Saturday\n;4 nominations\n*Today Show\n;2 nominations\n*The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n*Rachael Ray\nSeries with most wins\n;3 wins\n*Today Show\n;1 win\n*Good Morning America\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130729135934/http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000206/ Daytime Emmy Awards] at the Internet Movie Database"
