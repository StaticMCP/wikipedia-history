It is considered a subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler by some taxonomists. Of this subspecies there never have been reports of a substantial population. In 1982 only four up to possibly 15 birds of the subspecies have been counted, and since 1995 none has been sighted, despite extended efforts to find specimens.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Aguiguan Reed Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Aguiguan reed warbler\n}}"
