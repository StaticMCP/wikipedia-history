The result was a victory for José María Lemus of the Revolutionary Party of Democratic Unification, who received 95.2% of the vote.\nThe Central Electoral Council had disqualified the candidacies of José Alberto Funes (Democratic Institutional Party), Roberto Edmundo Cannessa (National Action Party) and José Alvaro Díaz (Nationalist Democratic Party). It also forbade Rafael Carranza Anaya (Authentic Constitutional Party) and Enrique Magaña Menéndez (Renovating Action Party) from withdrawing their candidacies; nevertheless, the latter two boycotted the elections.\nResults\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Benítez Manaut, Raúl. \"El Salvador: un equilibrio imperfecto entre los votos y las botas.\" Secuencia 17:71-92 (mayo-agosto de 1990).\n*Kantor, Harry.
