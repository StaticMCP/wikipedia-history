Later in life he sometimes gave his birth date as 1896, seemingly to avoid forced retirement.\nLeach graduated with a MA from Johns Hopkins University in 1917: his master's thesis was on the legend of the Holy Grail. He then researched for a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania: studying under the Americanist, Cornelius Weygandt and anthropologist, Frank Speck.\nLeach completed his doctorate, which dealt with the use of Celtic tradition in literature, in 1930.\nPersonal life\nLeach was married twice, first to Alice May (Maria) Doane, with whom he had a son, Donald. His second marriage was Nancy Rafetto, with whom he also had a son, Douglas.\nMaria Leach was also a renowned folklorist: amongst her publications were The Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend (1949–50) and The Rainbow Book of American Tales and Legends (1958).\nCareer\nAfter the completion of his doctorate Leach developed and taught courses on folklore within the University of Pennsylvania's Department of English. Over time, he adapted English literature courses he inherited into folklore courses: one titled \"The Epic and Short Story', he gradually changed into a general folklore course, another on the literary ballad he transformed it into a folk ballad course.  By 1959 Leach had developed a doctoral program in folklore and folklife - the second in the United States.  A Folklore department was established at the University in 1962.\nEarly in his career, Leach carried out fieldwork in the Southern mountain regions of the United States, as well as in the John Crow Mountains in Jamaica. Later in life, mostly likely influenced by his Cape Breton born first wife, Leach carried out four collecting trips to Atlantic Canada.  The recordings Leach made in Canada have since been made available online.\nLeach was regarded as a charismatic lecturer who established the University of Pennsylvania as a well-respected site for the academic study of folklore and had an enormous impact on the folklorists he taught. One obituary credited him with being \"a key man in the revolutionizing of the teaching of folklore in the United States\".\nMacEdward Leach spent his entire career at the university, retiring in 1966. His successor as Chair of the Folklore department was Don Yoder.\nRecognition\nLeach served as both Secretary-Treasurer (1943–1960) and President (1961–1962) of the American Folklore Society (AFS). He has been credited with an enormous impact on the Society, having \"almost single-handedly nurtured that organization from near collapse to vigor\". His impact as an administrator included promoting the growth of local American folklore societies to aid the AFS and generating revenue for the AFS by creating a Bibliographical and Special Series of publications.\nSelected publications\nLeach, MacEdward (1941).
