The house was built in 1835 by Alfred Battle and his wife, Millicent Battle.  The house's grounds include the only remaining documented antebellum garden in the state. The house itself is noted for its vernacular use of monumental boxed columns.  The Battle family lived in the house until 1875, when the home was purchased by Bernard Friedman.  The Friedman family continued to reside in the house until Victor Hugo Friedman died in 1965, leaving the house to the city of Tuscaloosa.  The Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society currently maintains the house as a historic house museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\"Tuscaloosa Scrapbook\", Matt Clinton\n*Past Horizons The Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society\n*A Belle of the Fifties: Memoirs of Mrs. Clay of Alabama, Virginia Clay-Clopton\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120617154814/http://www.historictuscaloosa.org/index.php?page=the-battle-friedman-house-and-gardens-2 The Battle-Friedman House at Tuscaloosa County Preservation Society website]"
