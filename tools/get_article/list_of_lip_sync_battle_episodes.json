      "text": "# List of Lip Sync Battle episodes\n\nLip Sync Battle is an American musical reality competition television series that premiered on April 2, 2015, on the American cable network Spike, later known as Paramount Network. The show is based on an idea by Stephen Merchant and John Krasinski, in which celebrities battle each other with lip sync performances. The idea was introduced as a recurring segment on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and later The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, before being developed into a separate show. The premiere episode was the highest-rated premiere in Spike's history. Lip Sync Battle has been a hit show for the network.  The series' success has led to the creation of various international adaptations. In August 2018, the show was renewed for a fifth season which premiered on January 17, 2019. In September 2020, it was announced that the series would move to another ViacomCBS network as part of the Paramount Network's now-scrapped planned shift to films. However, no new home for the program has been announced since then.\nDuring the course of the series, 91 episodes of Lip Sync Battle aired over five seasons, including five specials.\nSeries overview\n| end1         =\n| color1S      = #B3001B\n| link1S       = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Christmas special (2015)\n| linkT1S      = Christmas\n| start1S      =\n| color2       = #3AA2C9\n| link2        = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Season 2 (2016)\n| episodes2    = 21\n| start2       =\n| end2         =\n| color2S      = #00BA85\n| link2S       = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Live special (2016)\n| linkT2S      = Live\n| start2S      =\n| color3       = #FF9933\n| link3        = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Season 3 (2016–17)\n| episodes3    = 24\n| start3       =\n| end3         =\n| color3SA     = #DAF910\n| link3SA      = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Hip Hop special (2017)\n| linkT3SA     = Hip Hop\n| start3SA     =\n| color3SB     = #DAF910\n| link3SB      = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Soul Train special (2017)\n| linkT3SB     = Soul Train\n| start3SB     =\n| color3SC     = #DAF910\n| link3SC      = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Michael Jackson Celebration (2018)\n| linkT3SC     = Michael Jackson\n| start3SC     =\n| color4       = #D861FF\n| link4        = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Season 4 (2018)\n| episodes4    = 17\n| start4       =\n| end4         =\n| color5       = #2A5E76\n| link5        = List of Lip Sync Battle episodes#Season 5 (2019)\n| episodes5    = 13\n| start5       =\n| end5         =\n}}\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2015)\n:Note: Winners are listed in bold\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#A2C93A;\" width=\"5%\"  |  in series\n! style=\"background:#A2C93A;\" width=\"5%\"  |  in season\n! style=\"background:#A2C93A;\" width=\"55%\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#A2C93A;\" width=\"20%\" | Original airdate\n! style=\"background:#A2C93A;\" width=\"20%\" | U.S. viewers(millions)\n| Viewers = 2.20\n| ShortSummary =\nJohnson:\"Shake It Off\" by Taylor Swift\"Stayin' Alive\" by Bee Gees\nFallon:\"Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)\" by Harry Belafonte\"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna\n| LineColor = A2C93A\n}}\n| Viewers = 2.00\n| ShortSummary =\nCommon:\"I Want You Back\" by Jackson 5\"All Night Long\" by Lionel Richie\nLegend:\"Slow Motion\" by Juvenile\"U Can't Touch This\" by MC Hammer\n| LineColor = A2C93A\n}}\n| Viewers = 1.83\n| ShortSummary =\nHathaway:\"Love\" by Mary J.
