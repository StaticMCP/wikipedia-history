Released on March 3, 2008, it was the band's seventh studio album and first studio album in almost seven years, and its first with new members Luther Dickinson and Adam MacDougall, as well as the first to be released on the band's own Silver Arrow Records label. Despite its predecessor, Lions, selling more copies, Warpaint debuted 15 spots higher in the United States, at number five.\nWriting and production\nFollowing the departures of Marc Ford and Eddie Harsch in September 2006, The Black Crowes enlisted Paul Stacey and Rob Clores to handle lead guitar and keyboard duties, respectively. Adam MacDougall replaced Clores just before the Warpaint sessions began, and Paul Stacey returned to the producer’s chair with the hiring of Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars to play guitar. (Aside from a couple of appearances in September, Dickinson didn’t join the band on the road until the release of Warpaint, leaving Stacey to play the remainder of their 2007 concerts.)\nThough the band had debuted new songs sporadically live since reforming in 2005, none were included on Warpaint, with only the intro of \"Movin’ On Down the Line\" having been performed for a live audience (as part of a jam in the middle of \"Soul Singing\"). It was a conscious decision to leave the road-tested songs behind; as Chris Robinson told Rolling Stone, \"I wanted to show people where we are now.\"  Rich Robinson wrote the music and would send CDs to Chris, who would add the lyrics and their melodies.\nIn July 2007, the band gathered at Allaire Studios in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York to record, finding that the remote setting contributed to the relative ease of recording. }}\nAccording to Chris, so as not to lose \"the dynamic of the group, the dynamic of music and the balance within that,\" the tracks were recorded live, with few overdubs. Only one take was necessary to capture \"Evergreen,\" while \"Whoa, Mule\" was recorded outdoors. The atmosphere and the band’s approach allowed the sessions to be completed in just three weeks.\nVarious band members have spoken about the contributions of Dickinson and MacDougall. \"Sometimes when new people come in it brings so many positive changes,\" said Rich. \"Adam came in and tried out and everyone was impressed, but when we got into the studio everyone's jaws dropped.\"\nSven Pipien remarked, \"The beauty of Luther, more than any note he's playing is the feeling behind that note. He was saying exactly what we want to say, and the same thing goes for Adam. Eddie [Harsch] is not the easiest guy to replace but Adam is his own man AND he fills those shoes really well.\"\nMaxim review controversy\nA review of Warpaint published by Maxim in its March 2008 issue prompted The Black Crowes' management to issue a press release denouncing the publication, as no promotional copies of the album had been distributed, meaning only the single edit of \"Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution\" could have been heard before the review was written. The story was picked up by the Associated Press, and preceded an exchange in which Maxim apologized to its readers and The Black Crowes' management slammed the magazine's editors for not apologizing to the band. Black Crowes' manager Pete Angelus then followed up with an open letter to Maxim and its editorial director, James Kaminsky.\nThe writer of the review, David Peisner, claimed in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that he had been assigned to write a preview of the album, and that his writing had been presented by Maxim as if it were a full review.  With the magazine facing increased criticism over rating unheard albums, including one by rapper Nas, Kaminsky promised that future previews will be labeled as such.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Chris Robinson and Rich Robinson, except where noted.\n# \"Goodbye Daughters of the Revolution\"&nbsp;– 5:03\n# \"Walk Believer Walk\"&nbsp;– 4:39\n# \"Oh Josephine\"&nbsp;– 6:38\n# \"Evergreen\"&nbsp;– 4:20\n# \"Wee Who See the Deep\"&nbsp;– 4:50\n# \"Locust Street\"&nbsp;– 4:14\n# \"Movin' On Down the Line\"&nbsp;– 5:42\n# \"Wounded Bird\"&nbsp;– 4:23\n# \"God's Got It\" (Rev.
