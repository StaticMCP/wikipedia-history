The awards are given out annually at the Ostend Film Festival.\nThe trophy was created by Ostend artist Yves Velter from Ostend and named after James Ensor, it is the successor of the Joseph Plateau Award that honored films from the entire country. Since its discontinuation, the Magritte Awards are given to French speaking movies, while the Ensors honor Flemish productions.\nThe nominees are decided by a jury panel. While the winners are voted by the entire board of Ensor Academy, which consists of members from the film industry. In 2018 categories for achievement in television were introduced.\nSince 2022, the Ensors, have been gender neutral, meaning the awards do not separate male and female performances in acting categories. This has led to some years where men are the only winners in acting categories.\nNoteworthy Winners\nAt the ninth edition, two films tied for the top prize as best film. The tenth Ensor Awards ceremony was held on September 14, 2019 and saw the film Girl dominating by winning eight trophies including best film.\nAwards ceremonies\nThe following is a listing of all Ensor Awards ceremonies and Best picture winners.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:180px;\"|Ceremony\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date\n! style=\"width:240px;\"|Best Film winner\n|-\n| 1st Ensor Awards || 10 September 2010 || The Misfortunates\n|-\n| 2nd Ensor Awards || 10 September 2011 || Bullhead\n|-\n| 3rd Ensor Awards || 14 and 15 September 2012 || Time of My Life\n|-\n| 4th Ensor Awards || 13 and 14 September 2013 || The Broken Circle Breakdown\n|-\n| 5th Ensor Awards || 20 September 2014 || Marina\n|-\n| 6th Ensor Awards || 19 September 2015 || N – The Madness of Reason\n|-\n| 7th Ensor Awards || 16 September 2016 || The Ardennes\n|-\n| 8th Ensor Awards || 15 and 16 September 2017 || Home\n|-\n| 9th Ensor Awards || 15 September 2018 || Racer and the Jailbird and Zagros\n|-\n| 10th Ensor Awards || 14 September 2019 || Girl\n|-\n| 11th Ensor Awards || 23 January 2021 || Patrick\n|-\n| 12th Ensor Awards || 12 March 2022 || Dealer\n|-\n| 13th Ensor Awards || 4 February 2023 || Close\n|-\n| 14th Ensor Awards || 3 February 2024 || WIL\n|-\n| 15th Ensor Awards || 8 February 2024 || SKUNK\n|}\nNominations and Voting\nVoters\nEvery active member of the Flemish audiovisual industry can the Academy, including employees in 'non-artistic' jobs in Flemish production companies.
