It was the band's first album in 12 years (after 1984's Moving).\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Ed Buller. The Raincoats' original members, Gina Birch and Ana da Silva, had to relearn their instruments prior to recording Looking in the Shadows.\nCritical reception\nThe Hartford Courant wrote: \"With a bent toward electronic sounds and a playful, revealing manner in the lyrics, the band succeeds in creating music that reflects not some sort of nostalgia for what the Raincoats used to be but considerable understanding in what they came to be.\" The Washington Post wrote that \"the Raincoats may be grown up now, but on songs like 'Love a Loser' they still juxtapose harsh and sweet as bracingly as ever.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;The Raincoats\n*Gina Birch – vocals, bass, guitar, feedback, fuzz guitar, distortion\n*Ana da Silva – vocals, bass, rhythm guitar, keyboards, 12-string guitar, slide guitar, sruthi, design\n*Anne Wood – bass, guitar, violin\nwith:\n*Ed Buller – piano, Moog synthesizer\n*Heather Dunn – bass, drums\n*Simon Fisher Turner – vocals on \"Love a Loser\"\n*Pete Shelley – vocals on \"Love a Loser\"\n;Technical\n*Gary Stout – programming, computer editing\n*Shirley O'Loughlin – photography\n*Maria Mochnacz – photography\nReferences"
