It had previously borne that name when it was a dance club for seniors. Then it changed hands, becoming the  \"Ovo\" and the \"China Club\" before reverting again to the \"Warsaw,\" but this time as a gay club.\nIn 1989 Andrew Delaplaine took over the lease on what had been the China Club and renamed the club the \"Warsaw Ballroom\".\nIn 1989 David Padilla was offered the resident DJ spot at the reincarnated Ovo, which would soon become (Warsaw Ballroom). The Warsaw Ballroom went out of business in 1999 and Jerry's Famous Deli replaced it.\nFinal days\n\n---\n\n## Warsaw ballroom\n\n#REDIRECT Warsaw Ballroom"
