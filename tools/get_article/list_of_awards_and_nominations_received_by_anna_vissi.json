She has also released two live albums: Live! (1993) and Live (2004). Vissi had her biggest commercial success with Fotia, followed by the double Kravgi, which is the best-selling album of the 2000s (decade) in Greece and eighth best-selling of all time in terms of units, while five other albums &mdash;Kitrino Galazio, I Epomeni Kinisi, Klima Tropiko, Travma, and Antidoto''&mdash; have achieved six-figure shipments. These albums have been released on Minos (1973&ndash;78), EMI Greece (1979&ndash;82), CarVi (1982), and Sony Music Entertainment Greece (1983&ndash;present). She has released material abroad on Moda Records.\nVissi and her family moved to Greece after she won a national talent competition in Cyprus, which was followed by her debut at the Thessaloniki Song Festival where she was awarded the top prizes for \"Best Vocals\" and \"Best Composition\" for the song \"As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi\" in 1978. This led to her recording multiple promo singles, collaborating with well-known producers, and releasing a debut album of the same name. In the 1980s, Vissi became a prominent figure in Greek music and participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1980 for Greece and 1982 for Cyprus, finishing 13th and fifth respectively. While her first performance was not a success, her second remains the highest placement that Cyprus has earned in the Contest. Vissi returned to the Contest in 2006 finishing ninth, however, she later regretted her latest performance, calling it a \"big mistake\".\nVissi's popularity culminated in the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s (decade), becoming a prominent performer of the laiko-pop genre reigning at the time. The first annual music awards were materialized in Greece with the launch of the Pop Corn Music Awards; in 1996 Vissi won three awards for her album Klima Tropiko. She was further awarded a record eight awards for Travma in 1998 and a further five awards for Kravgi in 2000, while she won the Song of the Decade honour in 1999 for \"Den Thelo Na Xereis\". With a total of 22 awards, she became one of the most-awarded artists in the awards' history and received honors for Best Female Artist, Best Female Vocal Performance, Best Female Stage Performance, Best Song, and Best Album. Vissi has also received four Cyprus Music Awards, seven Arion Music Awards, including three for \"Video of the Year\", and a Life & Style Women of the Year Award, while she has also won nine MAD Video Music Awards in eight different categories, and set the record for most awards won in one night with four honours at the first ceremony in 2004. Apart from these Vissi has been honoured for her contribution to contemporary Greek music at the Balkan Music Awards and Hellenic Charity Ball. She has been nominated for awards in laïko, contemporary laïko, pop, dance and hip hop categories and has won 48 recognized awards from over 70 nominations.\nThis list includes only recognized awards and not polls and other awards. Also, the list may be incomplete due to the lack of sources on Greek awards prior to 2000.\nArion Music Awards\nThe Arion Music Awards are the official Greek music industry awards by IFPI Greece since 2002, after the Pop Corn Music Awards, which were organized by the Greek magazine Pop Corn from 1997 to 2001, were discontinued.
