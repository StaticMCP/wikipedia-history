It took place on 26 March 1995 in Hamilton, Ontario at a ceremony in the Copps Coliseum. Mary Walsh, Rick Mercer and other regulars of the television series This Hour Has 22 Minutes were the hosts for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television. Almost 10,000 people were in attendance, and over 6,500 public tickets were sold. It was the first time the Awards event was open to the public.\nNominees were announced on 1 February 1995. Susan Aglukark and Jann Arden were among the prominent nominees this year. Vancouver rock band 54-40's album ''Smilin' Buddha Cabaret'' was accidentally left off the nomination list for Best Alternative Album; after realizing the error, the Academy decided to add them to the category, and rather than remove another band's album simply widened the category to six nominees.\nLeonard Rambeau, the long-time manager of Anne Murray, received a special lifetime achievement award; Rambeau died later that year of cancer.\nNominees and winners\nEntertainer of the Year\nThis award was chosen by a national poll rather than by Juno organisers CARAS.\nWinner: The Tragically Hip\nOther Nominees:\n* Celine Dion\n* Crash Test Dummies\n* Sarah McLachlan\n* Neil Young\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Jann Arden\nOther Nominees:\n* Sass Jordan\n* Julie Masse\n* Loreena McKennitt\n* Michelle Wright\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Neil Young\nOther Nominees:\n* Bruce Cockburn\n* Colin James\n* John McDermott\n* Roch Voisine\nBest New Solo Artist\nWinner: Susan Aglukark\nOther Nominees:\n* Sara Craig\n* David Gogo\n* Éric Lapointe\n* Andrew Matheson\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: The Tragically Hip\nOther Nominees:\n* Barenaked Ladies\n* Crash Test Dummies\n* Spirit of the West\n* The Watchmen\nBest New Group\nWinner: Moist\nOther Nominees:\n* Big Sugar\n* Farmer's Daughter\n* The Gandharvas\n* Wild Strawberries\nSongwriter of the Year\nWinner: Jann Arden\nOther Nominees:\n* Bryan Adams\n* Greg Keelor and Jim Cuddy\n* Joni Mitchell\n* Neil Young\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Michelle Wright\nOther Nominees:\n* Lisa Brokop\n* Cindy Church\n* Patricia Conroy\n* Anne Murray\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Charlie Major\nOther Nominees:\n* Joel Feeney\n* George Fox\n* Terry Kelly\n* Jim Witter\nCountry Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: Prairie Oyster\nOther Nominees:\n* Coda the West\n* Farmer's Daughter\n* Prescott-Brown\n* Quartette\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: André Gagnon\nOther Nominees:\n* Hennie Bekker\n* Wayne Chaulk\n* Marie-Andree Ostiguy\n* Quartetto Gelato\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: Robbie Robertson, \"Skin Walker\" and \"It Is a Good Day to Die\" by Robbie Robertson\nOther Nominees:\n* Arnold Lanni, \"Birdman\" and \"Naveed\" by Our Lady Peace\n* David Foster, \"Power of My Love\" and \"Colour of My Love\" by Celine Dion, \"I Swear\" and \"All-4-One\" by All-4-One\n* Mark Howard and The Tragically Hip, \"Grace, Too\", \"Day for Night\", \"Nautical Disaster\" by The Tragically Hip\n* Pierre Marchand, \"Possession\", \"Stumbling Towards Ecstasy\", \"Good Enough\" by Sarah McLachlan\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: Lenny DeRose, \"Lay My Body Down\" and \"Charms\" by The Philosopher Kings\nOther nominees:\n* Mike Fraser, \"Push Comes to Shove\" by Jackyl and \"Deuces Are Wild\" by Aerosmith\n* Michael Phillip Wojewoda, Music from the Motion Picture Whale Music by Rheostatics\n* Marc Ramaer, \"Hush Sweet Lover\" by k.d. lang and \"Jane\" by Barenaked Ladies\n* Jeff Wolpert, \"The Bonny Swans\" and \"The Dark Night of the Soul\" by Loreena McKennitt\nGlobal Achievement Award\nWinner: Leonard Rambeau\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: Buffy Sainte-Marie\nThe induction was rescinded in 2025, over her American citizenship.\nWalt Grealis Special Achievement Award\nWinner: Louis Applebaum\nNominated and winning albums\nAlbum of the Year\nWinner: The Colour of My Love, Celine Dion\nOther Nominees:\n* Day for Night, The Tragically Hip\n* Five Days in July, Blue Rodeo\n* Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Sarah McLachlan\n* North Country, The Rankin Family\nBest Children's Album\nWinner: Bananaphone, Raffi\nOther Nominees:\n* ''Eric's World Record, Eric Nagler\n* J'ai tant danse, Carmen Campagne\n* Jacob Two Two and the Dinosaur, Mordecai Richler\n* What a day!, Fred Penner\nBest Classical Album (Solo or Chamber Ensemble)\nWinner: Erica Goodman Plays Canadian Harp Music, Erica Goodman\nOther Nominees:\n* Bibor: Instrumental Works, Tafelmusik, musical director Jeanne Lamon\n* Gabrielli for Brass, The Canadian Brass\n* The Joy of Piano, Valerie Tryon\n* Quartetto Gelato, Quartetto Gelato\nBest Classical Album (Large Ensemble)\nWinner: Bach: Brandenburg Concertos Nos. 1-6, Tafelmusik, director Jeanne Lamon\nOther Nominees:\n* Ibert: Escales, Flute Concerto, flute Timothy Hutchins, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, conductor Charles Dutoit\n* Shostakovich: Symphonies 1 and 15, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, conductor Charles Dutoit\n* Stravinsky: Apollon Musagete, Sinfonietta de Montréal, conductor Charles Dutoit\n* The Romantic Piano Concerto Vol. 7 -
