Following the war, he transitioned to become a naval aviator. His radar and electrical engineering background led to his near decade long involvement with the development of the Marine Tactical Data System (MTDS). He served as the commanding officer (CO) of Marine Air Control Squadron 3 (MACS-3) for more than four years from 1961-1965 as MTDS went through operational test and evaluation.\nLater assignments included a tour in Vietnam as the CO of Marine Air Control Group 18 (MACG-18), time as Commanding General Marine Corps Air Bases Western Area and two years as the Director of Marine Corps Aviation.

From September 1961 until February 1965, he served as the Commanding Officer of Marine Air Control Squadron 3 (MACS-3) at Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana, California. During this time, MACS-3 was the designated operational test and evaluation squadron for MTDS seeing it through numerous financial and developmental issues until it was officially fielded in 1966.\nHe returned to Washington, D.C., in April 1965, and served as Head, Marine Corps Amphibious Electronics Branch, Electronics Division, Bureau of Ships. Fris was reassigned to Headquarters Marine Corps in August 1966, as Head, Aviation Command Control and Communications Branch, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff (Air).
