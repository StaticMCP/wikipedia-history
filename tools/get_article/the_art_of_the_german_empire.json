It began publication in January 1937 and was published monthly until September 1944; occasionally in double issues.\nThe magazine was very strict and selective in what it featured, and extremely few of its arist were women. Exhibits at the Great German Art Exhibition amounted for approximately one third of the magazine's illustrations. In 1939, its circulation was 50,000 copies.\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLibrary-preserved issues\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/_/Bdt87u3BV8cC Volume 5]\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/Die_Kunst_im_deutschen_Reich/Max3ScZIJIMC Volume 8, part 1]\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/_/IgDkGtwAuIQC Volume 8, issue 2]\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/_/q7rJGI-zCiMC Volume 8, issue 3]\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/_/Ryo1sUOFXDcC Volume 8, issue 4]\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/_/RVy-Oa29OBsC Volume 8, issue 5]\n* [https://books.google.com/books/edition/_/9K7iy2YbAYQC Volume 8, issues 6-7]"
