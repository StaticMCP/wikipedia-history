It serves the town of Longwarry, in Victoria, Australia. Longwarry station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 1 July 1881.\nHistory\nThe track east of the station to Drouin was duplicated in 1952, but the section between Bunyip and Longwarry remains single track, because the bridge over the Bunyip River has not been duplicated. The line through Longwarry to Warragul was electrified in July 1954, but electrification was removed in December 1998.\nOn 26 August 1988, the electric staff safeworking system between Longwarry and Bunyip was abolished, and was replaced with automatic three-position signalling. The double line block system between Longwarry and Warragul was also abolished, along with the signal box and all two position signals. At the same time, boom barriers were provided at the Yannathan Road level crossing, replacing hand-operated gates. By October 1989, the connections to the former goods siding was abolished, as was the overhead wire above the siding.\nAs part of the Regional Rail Revival project, a second platform will be built at the station, and the line between Bunyip and Longwarry was scheduled to be duplicated, with the project to be completed in late 2022. However, it was reported in May 2022, that the duplication of the Bunyip-Longwarry track would not go ahead.\nPlatforms and services\nLongwarry has two platforms. The second of which commenced operations in 2024. It is served by V/Line Traralgon and selected Bairnsdale line trains.\n{| class=\"wikitable defaultcenter col1left\"\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#;background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #); \" |Longwarry platform arrangement\n|-\n!Platform\n!Line\n!Destination\n!Service Type\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n||white}}|white}}\n|Southern Cross\n|All stations and limited express services\n|\n|-\n|2\n||white}}|white}}\n|Traralgon, Bairnsdale\n|All stations\n|\n|}\nTransport links\nWarragul Bus Lines operates one route via Longwarry station:\n*Garfield station – Traralgon Centre Plaza\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.vicrailstations.com/Orbost/Longwarry/Longwarry.html Victorian Railway Stations Gallery]\n*[http://www.street-directory.com.au/sd3/map.php?x=145.76739617955718&y=-38.11119573960624&l=14&mt=4 Melway map]"
