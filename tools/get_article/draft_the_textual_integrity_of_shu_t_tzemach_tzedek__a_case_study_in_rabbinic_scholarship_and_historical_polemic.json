This article delves into a significant textual controversy surrounding a passage in the Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek, a foundational work of Chabad Hasidism, which involves a purported comment on the Vilna Gaon. The dispute highlights the complexities of textual transmission within rabbinic literature and illuminates the historical dynamics between two influential movements in Jewish thought: Chabad Hasidism and the Mitnagdim.\n1. Background\n1.1. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn: The Tzemach Tzedek\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (1789–1866) was the third leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic dynasty, serving as Rebbe from 1827 until his passing in 1866.\nHe is widely known by the title of his monumental work, Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek (Responsa of the Tzemach Tzedek), a multi-volume compendium of Halakha (Jewish law) and Talmudic novellae.\nThis work established him as one of the preeminent halachic authorities of his time, with his responsa recognized for their profound depth, extensive erudition, and comprehensive scope.\nUnder his leadership, the Chabad movement experienced significant growth and expansion, and he was known to cultivate positive relationships with other leading Torah scholars of his generation.\n1.2. Rabbi Eliyahu ben Shlomo Zalman Kremer: The Vilna Gaon (GRA)\nContemporaneous with the early Chabad movement, Rabbi Eliyahu ben Shlomo Zalman Kremer (1720–1797), universally known as the Vilna Gaon (GRA), stands as one of the most pivotal figures in Jewish history.\nHailed as \"Gadol HaAcharonim\" (the greatest of the later sages), his prodigious scholarship was evident from a young age, leading rabbis across Europe to seek his legal rulings even when he was in his early twenties.\nThe Vilna Gaon championed a rigorous approach to Torah study, emphasizing the peshat (literal meaning) of texts and dedicating considerable effort to establishing accurate textual readings through his own emendations, drawing upon his unparalleled mastery of rabbinic literature.\nHis halachic decisions were often highly original, sometimes diverging from established customs or even the authoritative Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law).\nDespite never holding an official rabbinic position, his influence was immense, with many considering his halachic authority on par with the Rishonim, the great medieval authorities.\nHe maintained that true greatness in Torah and Jewish observance must arise from natural human efforts in Torah study, rather than relying on external \"miracles\" or \"wonders\".\n1.3. The Chabad-Mitnagdim Historical Divide\nThe historical backdrop to the textual controversy is the profound and often contentious relationship between Hasidism and its opponents, the Misnagdim.\nThe Vilna Gaon emerged as the foremost leader of the Misnagdim, a movement that actively resisted the burgeoning Hasidic movement throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.\nThe Gaon viewed Hasidism with deep suspicion, perceiving certain practices and theological tenets as dangerous and potentially heretical, leading him to issue bans against the movement.\nNotably, he famously refused to meet with Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, the founder of Chabad, despite the latter's attempts to initiate dialogue and bridge the divide.\nThe points of contention between these movements were multifaceted. They included theological interpretations, such as differing understandings of tzimtzum (Divine contraction) – whether it was literal or non-literal.\nThere were also significant divergences in emphasis, with the Mitnagdim prioritizing intense intellectual Talmudic study and the Hasidim placing greater stress on devotional prayer, emotional fervor, and the charismatic leadership of the Rebbe.\nThe Vilna Gaon viewed some Hasidic concepts, such as panentheism (the belief in God's literal presence in all things), as potentially dangerous or even heretical.\nThe textual controversy examined in this report is not merely a debate over a few words; it is deeply embedded in these historical and theological tensions that characterized the relationship between Chabad and Mitnagdim. The pre-existing personal animosity, exemplified by the Vilna Gaon's refusal to meet the Alter Rebbe, combined with fundamental theological differences (e.g., tzimtzum and the relative emphasis on study versus emotional devotion), created an environment where any perceived textual manipulation concerning one figure by the followers of the other would immediately be viewed with suspicion and fuel the existing polemic. The specific halachic discussion, such as one pertaining to tzitzit, might in isolation appear minor, but the alteration of the Tzemach Tzedek's response to the Gaon's opinion transforms it into a major point of contention, symbolizing the broader power dynamics and intellectual independence that each movement sought to assert. The textual variant thus became a battleground for historical narratives and contemporary inter-communal relations, extending far beyond the specific halachic point itself.\n1.4. The Textual Enigma in The Piskei Dinim of the Tzemach Tzedek\nWithin this historical context, a particular passage in the The Piskei Dinim of the Tzemach Tzedek specifically in Volume 2, Page 138 (Leaf 69/2), became the focal point of a significant textual controversy.\nThis dispute, centered on the precise wording of the Tzemach Tzedek's response to a halachic point raised by the Vilna Gaon, serves as a compelling case study for examining broader issues of textual integrity, the processes of transmission, and the assertion of authority within rabbinic literature, particularly when it involves interactions between leading figures of historically opposing movements.\n2. The Heart of the Dispute: Two Readings of a Responsum\nThe core of the controversy lies in two distinct versions of a single phrase within the Tzemach Tzedek's responsa, each conveying a dramatically different stance towards the Vilna Gaon's opinion.\n2.1. The Disputed Passage and Its Variants\nThe passage in question appears in a halachic discussion where the Tzemach Tzedek addresses a point raised by the Vilna Gaon.\nThe first edition of The Piskei Dinim of the Tzemach Tzedek, published in Vilna in 1884, contains a specific phrasing that became widely known as the \"Humble Version\".\nThis version reads: \"ואני בעניי לא זכיתי להבין דברי קדשו\".\nTranslated, this means: \"And I, in my lowliness, was not privileged to understand his holy words\".\nThis phrasing conveys a tone of profound humility and deference from the Tzemach Tzedek towards the Vilna Gaon, a sentiment that might appear surprising given the historical antagonism between Chabad and Mitnagdim.\nConversely, a different reading, known as the \"Critical Version,\" emerged in the 1949 Kehot Publication Society (K.H.T.) edition of Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek.\nThis version reads: \"ואינה תשובה\".\nThis translates to: \"and this is not an answer\" or \"and it is not a valid response\".\nThis phrasing represents a direct and critical dismissal of the Vilna Gaon's argument, reflecting a scholarly disagreement rather than an expression of deference.\n2.2. Initial Reactions and Accusations of Falsification\nThe appearance of the \"Critical Version\" in the 1949 Kehot edition ignited a significant polemic within the Jewish scholarly world.\nAccusations were quickly leveled against Chabad Chassidim, alleging that they had \"falsified\" the text by removing the original words of humility to portray the Tzemach Tzedek in a more assertive light.\nRabbi Yitzchak Hutner, a highly respected non-Hasidic Rosh Yeshiva, reportedly sent a letter of protest to the printers of the 1949 edition, expressing his concern over the perceived alteration.\nIn response, the printers of the 1949 edition asserted that the \"humble\" version found in the earlier 1884 Vilna print was itself a \"forgery\".\nFurther adding to the complexity, Rabbi David Kaminetsky, a renowned bibliographer, undertook extensive research in major libraries and private collections.\nHe initially reported that he could not find any \"corrected\" copies (i.e., those with the \"critical\" version) of the 1884 Vilna edition, suggesting that the \"humble\" version was indeed the original and prevalent one.\nHe later stated he found only \"one single lone copy\" with the \"critical\" version.\nThe stark difference between the two textual variants—one conveying profound humility, the other a direct dismissal—directly reflects the historical Chabad-Mitnagdim polemic. This is not simply a textual error; it is a statement about the relationship between two major religious movements and their leaders. The \"humble\" version, if authentic, would serve to bridge the historical divide or demonstrate a deferential acknowledgment of the Vilna Gaon's supreme authority even by a Chabad leader. Conversely, the \"dismissive\" version, if original, would reinforce the intellectual independence and potential opposition inherent in the Chassidic movement's stance against the Mitnagdim. The very intensity of the controversy over these few words underscores their symbolic weight within the context of the historical Chabad-Mitnagdim dispute, where the Tzemach Tzedek's stance towards the Gaon's opinion held significant implications for inter-communal relations and the assertion of distinct halachic and philosophical paths. The textual variant thus became a battleground for historical narratives and contemporary inter-communal relations, extending far beyond the specific halachic point itself.\n3. Yehoshua Mondshine's Scholarly Investigation\nThe resolution of this complex textual puzzle largely stems from the meticulous scholarly investigation conducted by Rabbi Dr. Yehoshua Mondshine.\n3.1. Yehoshua Mondshine: Scholar and Textual Critic\nRabbi Dr. Yehoshua Mondshine (1947–2014) was an Israeli rabbi, scholar, researcher, and historian deeply associated with the Chabad-Lubavitch movement.\nHe served as a distinguished bibliographer in the manuscript department of the National Library of Israel.\nMondshine was widely recognized for his rigorous academic methodology and his unique ability to integrate his unambiguous Chassidic identity with uncompromising academic scholarship.\nHis reputation as \"Chabad's critic from within\" was earned through his critical examination of popular Hasidic tales, notably in his series \"Yalkut Hakzavim\" (Mekor Hakzavim), where he exposed fictitious stories.\nThis reputation for critical honesty, even within his own community, lent significant weight and credibility to his findings in the textual controversy. His extensive body of work included publishing scholarly articles, bibliographies, and polemical essays on Chabad and general Hasidic history, frequently drawing upon original manuscripts.\nHis scholarly endeavors were actively encouraged by the Lubavitcher Rebbe.\n3.2. Mondshine's Central Thesis: Vilna Printers as the Source of Alteration\nMondshine's investigation led him to a definitive conclusion that sharply challenged the prevailing accusations. He argued that the textual alteration was not performed by Chabad Chassidim.\nInstead, his research indicated that the words of humility were inserted into the Tzemach Tzedek's original text by the printers in Vilna, likely motivated by their profound respect for the Vilna Gaon.\nThis thesis fundamentally re-framed the nature of the alleged \"falsification.\"\n3.3. Evidence from Existing Copies of the 1884 Vilna Edition\nMondshine directly refuted Professor Shmuel Glick's assertion that no copies of the original 1884 Vilna edition of Piskei Dinim contained the \"ואינה תשובה\" (critical) phrase.\nThrough diligent research, Mondshine provided concrete evidence by locating and identifying several such copies. These included: a copy in the library of Rabbi Yaakov Landau; two copies held by Rabbi Glazman, the Rabbi of Riga (one of which was subsequently transferred to the Chabad library in Brooklyn); and a fourth copy with the \"Lithuanian\" bookseller Rabbi David Kamenetzky.\nThis directly contradicted Kamenetzky's earlier published statement about finding only one lone copy with the \"critical\" version.\nFurthermore, Mondshine himself had seen such a copy in the Yeshiva University library approximately 25 years prior, a fact later confirmed by the university's librarian.\nThese five identified copies, according to Mondshine, thoroughly undermined the claim that the \"critical\" version was a later Chabad falsification or that original copies with it were non-existent.\n3.4. Analysis of Pre-Printing Manuscripts\nA critical aspect of Mondshine's argument rested on the examination of manuscript evidence that predated the 1884 printed edition.\nHe demonstrated that the \"ואינה תשובה\" text was present in two distinct manuscripts compiled from the Tzemach Tzedek's various writings, including his questions, answers, and halachic rulings.\nOne of these manuscripts explicitly records its year of writing as 1862 (תרכ\"ב), which is four years before the Tzemach Tzedek's passing and more than two decades before the 1884 printed edition.\nThe second manuscript was also clearly written during the Tzemach Tzedek's lifetime.\nMondshine argued that these manuscripts were independent of the printed edition, thereby providing compelling evidence that the \"critical\" version was the original text penned by the Tzemach Tzedek.\nMondshine's detailed refutation of Glick's claims, particularly his direct evidence from multiple extant copies and, crucially, pre-dating manuscripts,\nhighlights a fundamental methodological principle in textual criticism: the paramount importance of primary source verification. Glick's apparent failure to perform such basic checks and his reliance on secondary interpretations or assumptions\nillustrate how pre-existing biases or insufficient scholarly rigor can lead to erroneous conclusions and perpetuate academic disputes. Mondshine, with his established reputation as \"Chabad's critic from within\",\nbrought a level of objectivity to his findings that strengthened their credibility, as he was known for his critical approach even within his own community. This case serves as a powerful example of how rigorous textual scholarship can correct long-standing historical misconceptions.\n3.5. Critique of Opposing Academic Arguments\nMondshine did not merely present his own evidence; he also rigorously critiqued the arguments put forth by those who maintained the \"humble\" version as original.\nHe sharply criticized Glick's interpretation of a letter from the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe), which Glick had used to support his claim that the \"humble\" version was original and the \"critical\" version was rare.\nMondshine meticulously quoted the relevant passage from the Rebbe's letter, demonstrating that the Rebbe stated that \"all necessary measures were taken, and the last pages were reprinted with the Tzemach Tzedek's text, and it is understood that I was unable to eradicate all copies with the falsified text\".\nMondshine clarified that the \"falsified text\" referred to the inserted humble version, and the \"Tzemach Tzedek's text\" was the original \"ואינה תשובה\".\nThe Rebbe's statement that \"in most of the copies it was possible to correct this, and only in a small number it remained\" referred specifically to the initial copies that reached Lubavitch, not the entire worldwide distribution.\nMondshine accused Glick of selective omission and misrepresentation of sources, asserting that Glick demonstrated a \"complete lack of understanding\" of the manuscripts and engaged in \"delusional discussions\" without factual basis.\n3.6. Historical Reconstruction of the Printing and Distribution\nTo further bolster his thesis, Mondshine provided a plausible historical scenario explaining how the alteration likely occurred and why the \"humble\" version became so prevalent in the first edition.\nHe suggested that in 1884, Piskei Dinim was probably printed simultaneously by two different printing houses in Vilna.\nAs Vilna was a major distribution hub, the majority of printed copies likely remained there, with only a minority reaching Lubavitch.\nWhen the textual falsification was discovered in Lubavitch, local sales and distribution of the affected copies were likely halted.\nWhile efforts were made to arrange for the reprinting of the corrected pages, it would have been impractical, if not impossible, to recall and correct all copies that had already been distributed across Russia and Poland.\nFor books still with sellers in Vilna, corrected pages may have been provided, but full cooperation in replacing pages was improbable, and these loose pages likely disappeared quickly.\nThis scenario explains why the uncorrected (humble) version remained widespread globally, even if the \"critical\" version was the original and was subsequently corrected in copies retained in Lubavitch.\nIf Mondshine's findings are accepted, they fundamentally shift the narrative from one of Chabad \"falsifying\" a text to one of external parties (the Vilna printers) attempting to \"correct\" a text to align with their perception of appropriate deference to the Vilna Gaon.\nThis re-frames the incident as an act of Mitnagdic intervention rather than Chabad manipulation, significantly altering the historical understanding of textual integrity within these communities and the dynamics of their relationship.\nThe initial accusation against Chabad was one of intentional textual corruption to remove a statement of humility.\nMondshine's evidence, particularly the pre-existing manuscripts and the historical reconstruction of the printing process,\nsuggests the opposite: that the \"humble\" phrase was an insertion by the Vilna printers. The motivation for such an insertion, as Mondshine suggests, was likely \"out of respect for the Vilna Gaon\",\na figure highly revered in Vilna. This reveals a complex dynamic where external parties might have taken editorial liberties with a text to align it with prevailing communal sentiments or to protect the honor of their revered leader.\nThis re-frames the historical understanding of textual transmission in this period, suggesting that \"corrections\" could arise from various, sometimes well-intentioned, sources, and highlights the challenges of establishing definitive original texts in a pre-modern publishing environment.\n4. The Broader Context: Halachic Authority and Textual Integrity\nThe textual controversy surrounding the Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek is not isolated; it is inextricably linked to broader discussions of halachic authority, differing customs, and the complex interplay between Chabad Hasidism and the Mitnagdim.\n4.1. The Halachic Context: Tzitzit and Tallit Katan\nWhile the specific halachic debate in Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek, Yoreh De'ah, Siman 91, regarding the Vilna Gaon's opinion on tzitzit is not fully detailed in the available sources,\nthe broader halachic discussions surrounding the commandment of tzitzit and the garment known as tallit katan provide essential context for understanding the differing approaches of these two movements.\nHalachic differences between Chabad and the followers of the Vilna Gaon regarding tzitzit customs are well-documented. These include variations in:\n* Material: The Vilna Gaon reportedly wore a tallit katan made of cotton, a material whose halachic status for tzitzit is debated, while wool is often considered preferable by other opinions.       In contrast, some Chabad customs permit the use of synthetic fabrics for tallit katan.\n* Wearing Style: Many Chassidim traditionally wear the tallit katan on top of their shirt, making the fringes visible.       The Vilna Gaon's custom, however, was to tuck the strings in, concealing them beneath outer garments.\n* Tying Methods: Distinct customs exist for tying the tzitzit strings themselves, including methods associated with the Vilna Gaon and the Arizal, whose teachings are foundational for Chabad practice.\nThese variations in practice illustrate the broader divergence in halachic interpretation and custom that characterized the relationship between the Chabad and Mitnagdic movements, contributing to the context in which a textual alteration regarding a halachic opinion would be highly sensitive.\n4.2. The Tzemach Tzedek's Halachic Style and Relationship with the Vilna Gaon\nDespite the narrative of humility suggested by the altered text, Mondshine's computerized search of the Tzemach Tzedek's responsa revealed a consistent pattern of critical engagement with the Vilna Gaon's opinions.\nThe Tzemach Tzedek frequently employed phrases indicating disagreement or questioning the Gaon's reasoning. Examples include \"not difficult at all\" when addressing a query of the Vilna Gaon, stating \"not as the Vilna Gaon wrote,\" expressing \"much to wonder about this\" regarding the Gaon's objection, and finding \"his words are puzzling\".\nThis consistent critical style in his other responsa strengthens Mondshine's conclusion that the laconic \"ואינה תשובה\" (and it is not an answer) is more characteristic of the Tzemach Tzedek's original mode of expression than the deferential phrase.\nThere is a fascinating tension between the Tzemach Tzedek's actual scholarly style, as revealed by Mondshine's textual analysis showing critical engagement with the Gaon,\nand a narrative presented in Mekor Baruch.\nMekor Baruch, a controversial source whose historicity is questioned by scholars like Marc B. Shapiro,\nclaims that the Tzemach Tzedek, along with his predecessors, acknowledged the Vilna Gaon's crucial role in safeguarding early Chassidism from antinomian tendencies.\nThis apparent contradiction points to different historical interpretations and the selective use of sources to construct a desired narrative, either emphasizing intellectual independence or inter-communal reconciliation. The existence of these two distinct portrayals suggests that various historical actors or later generations emphasized aspects of the relationship that served their own ideological or communal purposes. The \"critical\" textual variant supports the view of Chabad's intellectual independence, while the Mekor Baruch narrative might have aimed to foster a sense of shared heritage or to legitimize Chassidism within broader Orthodox circles by acknowledging the Gaon's \"positive\" influence.\nDespite these intellectual and historical tensions, the Tzemach Tzedek's public activities and his extensive responsa were instrumental in fostering more positive attitudes between Mitnagdim and Chassidim, indicating a complex relationship that evolved beyond initial polemics.\n4.3. Impact on Chabad-Mitnagdim Relations and Jewish Scholarship\nThe controversy over the Tzemach Tzedek's text reveals a deeper struggle over halachic authority and textual integrity in post-Talmudic Judaism, particularly between nascent movements and established rabbinic centers.\nThe alleged alteration by Vilna printers\nsuggests a perceived right, or even duty, among certain parties to \"correct\" texts to conform to prevailing norms or to protect the honor of a revered figure like the Vilna Gaon. This raises significant questions about the fluidity of sacred texts in print culture and the role of printers and editors as de facto arbiters of tradition, rather than merely disseminators.\nThis incident underscores the deep-seated disagreements over halachic authority and textual integrity that characterized the Chabad-Mitnagdim dispute.\nThe resolution of this textual dispute, if widely accepted, necessitates a re-evaluation of how the Tzemach Tzedek is perceived in relation to the Vilna Gaon, moving away from a narrative of universal deference towards one of respectful but firm scholarly independence.\nFurthermore, this implies a need for greater scrutiny of other historical accounts and printed editions, particularly those produced during periods of intense inter-communal polemic.\nIf Mondshine's findings are correct, the alteration was not an act of malicious forgery but rather a \"pietistic\" one by the Vilna printers.\nThis implies that in the 19th-century Jewish printing world, there was sometimes an unstated editorial prerogative to \"improve\" or \"harmonize\" texts with prevailing communal sentiments or the perceived stature of a great sage.\nThis challenges the modern academic ideal of strict textual fidelity to the author's original intent.\nIt suggests that textual transmission in Jewish tradition was not always a purely mechanical process but could be influenced by theological or communal considerations.\nThis has broader implications for understanding the reliability of printed editions of rabbinic works from this period and highlights the need for careful manuscript comparison in all such studies.\nDespite the historical animosity, the shared opposition to the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) movement in the 19th century led to improved relations and cooperation between the Tzemach Tzedek and prominent Mitnagdic leaders, such as Rabbi Yitzchak of Volozhin.\nThe enduring nature of this textual debate underscores the vital role of rigorous academic textual criticism in Jewish studies, ensuring accuracy and providing a nuanced understanding of complex historical and religious dynamics.\n5. Conclusion: Resolving the Textual Puzzle\n5.1. Summary of Findings: Mondshine's Resolution\nYehoshua Mondshine's meticulous research offers a compelling resolution to the long-standing textual controversy surrounding the Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek.\nHis findings, based on the discovery of multiple original copies of the 1884 Vilna edition containing the \"critical\" reading and, crucially, pre-dating manuscripts that consistently feature the same phrasing, provide strong evidence that \"ואינה תשובה\" (and it is not an answer) is the authentic, original text penned by the Tzemach Tzedek.\nMondshine's analysis suggests that the \"humble\" version, \"ואני בעניי לא זכיתי להבין דברי קדשו\" (\"And I, in my lowliness, was not privileged to understand his holy words\"), was an insertion by the Vilna printers.\nThis alteration was likely motivated by a desire to show deference to the esteemed Vilna Gaon, reflecting the prevailing reverence for him in Vilna.\nThis conclusion is further supported by Mondshine's demonstration that the Tzemach Tzedek's scholarly style, as evidenced in his other responsa, consistently involved critical engagement with the opinions of other great Torah scholars, including the Vilna Gaon.\n5.2. The Importance of Textual Criticism\nThis case serves as a powerful illustration of the indispensable role of textual criticism in Jewish studies.\nIt demonstrates how the careful examination of manuscripts and early printed editions can uncover alterations, resolve historical disputes, and restore the integrity of sacred texts.\nThe incident highlights the inherent complexities of textual transmission within Jewish tradition, where scribal practices, editorial decisions, and even broader communal dynamics could influence the final printed form of a work.\nThe resolution of this textual dispute, if widely accepted, necessitates a re-evaluation of how the Tzemach Tzedek is perceived in relation to the Vilna Gaon, shifting from a narrative of universal deference towards one of respectful but firm scholarly independence.\nThis also implies a need for greater scrutiny of other historical accounts and printed editions, particularly those produced during periods of intense inter-communal polemic.\nThis case suggests that textual \"corrections\" or \"improvements\" by printers were a real phenomenon, especially in sensitive areas of inter-communal relations.\nThis raises a broader question for Jewish scholarship: how many other such \"harmonizing\" alterations might exist in printed editions of rabbinic works from periods of intense ideological or communal strife? It underscores the ongoing need for critical editions based on comprehensive manuscript evidence to accurately reconstruct the original voices of the sages.\n5.3. Nuance in Historical Relations and Enduring Legacy\nThe controversy, and its subsequent resolution by Mondshine, adds a crucial layer of nuance to the understanding of the historical relationship between Chabad Hasidism and the Mitnagdim.\nIt reveals that textual interventions could stem from various motivations and sources, not solely from one side attempting to manipulate historical narratives.\nUltimately, both the Tzemach Tzedek and the Vilna Gaon remain towering figures in Jewish thought, whose profound works and enduring legacies continue to be studied and revered across different Jewish communities.\nThe scholarly pursuit of textual accuracy, as exemplified by Mondshine's work, ensures that their authentic voices and intellectual contributions are preserved for future generations, fostering a more precise and nuanced understanding of Jewish intellectual history.\nTables\n'Table 1: Key Textual Variants in Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek (Volume 2, Page 138 / Leaf 69/2)'\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Variant Name\n|Hebrew Text\n|English Translation\n|Primary Source\n|-\n|The Humble Version\n|וְאֲנִי בְעָנְיִי לֹא זָכִיתִי לְהָבִין דִּבְרֵי קָדְשׁוֹ\n|\"And I, in my lowliness, was not privileged to understand his holy words.\"\n|Most copies of Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek, First Edition, Vilna 1884\n|\n|-\n|The Critical Version\n|וְאֵינָהּ תְּשׁוּבָה\n|\"and this is not an answer.\"\n|1949 Kehot Edition; Pre-1884 Manuscripts (e.g., 1862); Rare copies of Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek, First Edition, Vilna 1884 (found by Mondshine)\n|}\nTable 2: Chronology of Key Events and Publications Related to the Controversy\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Date (Gregorian)\n|Event/Publication\n|-\n|1772\n|Vilna Gaon issues first ban against Hasidism\n|\n|-\n|1789\n|Birth of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the Tzemach Tzedek\n|-\n|1797\n|Passing of the Vilna Gaon\n|-\n|1827\n|Passing of the Mitteler Rebbe; Tzemach Tzedek assumes leadership\n|-\n|1862\n|Manuscript containing the \"ואינה תשובה\" text is written\n|\n|-\n|1866\n|Passing of the Tzemach Tzedek\n|-\n|1884\n|First edition of Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek (Vilna) published, containing the \"humble\" variant\n|-\n|1949\n|Kehot edition of Shu\"t Tzemach Tzedek published, containing the \"critical\" variant\n|\n|-\n|2008 (Adar)\n|Rabbi David Kaminetsky's article in Yeshurun (Vol. 20) discusses the controversy\n|-\n|c. 2008\n|Yehoshua Mondshine's response in Kfar Chabad and \"ואינה תשובה\" article, presenting his findings\n|}\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
