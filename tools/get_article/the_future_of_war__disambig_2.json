In May 2002, The Future of War was placed on the Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien index in Germany, meaning that it may not be advertised or sold to minors. According to band member Alec Empire, Future of War was notable for its \"left-rooted critique of the 'modern' high-tech-war, as we had seen it all some years previously during the Gulf War.\"\nTrack listing\nSamples credits\n* \"Sick To Death\" samples \"Sick of You\" by The Users, \"Decadent Jew\" by The Nuns, and anime \"Urotsukidoji II: Legend of the Demon Womb\" (English dubbed version).\n* \"Fuck All\" samples \"Pay to Cum\" by Bad Brains.\n* \"Destroy 2000 Years of Culture\" samples \"Dead Skin Mask\" by Slayer.\n* \"Heatwave\" samples \"Supertouch\" by Bad Brains.\n* \"Not Your Business\" samples \"Back to Bataan\" by The Maids.\n* \"Deutschland (Has Gotta Die!)\" samples \"I'm In Love With Today\" by The Users\nPersonnel\n;Atari Teenage Riot\n*Alec Empire – vocals, programming, production\n*Hanin Elias – vocals\n*Carl Crack – MC\n;Additional\n*Janek Siegle – assistant engineer\n*Henni Hell – cover art\n*Phillipp Virus – photography\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.myspace.com/atr922000 Atari Teenage Riot] at MySpace\n* [http://www.digitalhardcore.com Official Digital Hardcore Recordings site]"
