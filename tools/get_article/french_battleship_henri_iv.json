She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She was sent to reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.\nDesign\nHenri IV was designed by the famous French naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin to evaluate some of his ideas. She was designed to make her a small target and lacked most of the normal rear superstructure common to ships of her period, other than that needed to keep her rear turret from being washed out. Her rear hull had only  of freeboard, although she was built up to the normal upper deck height amidships and at the bow for better sea-keeping and to provide for her crew. Her superstructure was narrow and recessed from the hull above the main deck.\nGeneral characteristics\nHenri IV was smaller than her predecessors, at  overall. She had a beam of  and a maximum draft of . She was significantly lighter than the Charlemagne-class battleships and displaced only  normally, some  less than the earlier ships. Her crew consisted of 26 officers and 438 enlisted men.\nPropulsion\nHenri IV had three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft. The engines were rated at  using steam provided by 24 Niclausse boilers and gave a top speed of . She carried a maximum of  of coal that gave her a range of  at a speed of .\nArmament\n]]\nHenri IV carried her main armament of two 40-caliber  Canon de 274 modèle 1893/1896s in two single-gun turrets, one forward on the upper deck and the other on the main deck at the rear. The guns fired  armor-piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of .\nThe ship's secondary armament consisted of seven 45-caliber  Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1893 naval guns. Four were mounted in individual casemates on the main deck; two more were mounted on the shelter deck with gun shields and the last gun was mounted in a shelter deck turret superfiring over the rear main gun turret. This was the first superfiring turret in naval history and, in this case, was not very successful because the barrel of the 138&nbsp;mm gun was too short to clear the sighting hood of the turret below. These guns fired  shells at muzzle velocities of .\nTwelve  40-caliber Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns were mounted as anti-torpedo boat guns. They were mounted in platforms in the foremast and mainmast and on the superstructure. They fired a  projectile at  to a maximum range of . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute, but only seven rounds per minute sustained. Two submerged  torpedo tubes were also carried. Exactly which types of torpedoes carried is unknown, but most of the torpedoes in service during the war had warheads of , maximum speeds of  and maximum ranges of .\nArmor\nHenri IV had a waterline armor belt of Harvey armor that was  high and tapered from the maximum thickness of  that to  at the ship's ends. The belt ended short of the stern in a  traverse bulkhead. The lower edge of this belt tapered as well from  in thickness. The upper armor belt was mostly  thick and ran from the bow to  aft of the midsection. It was generally  high, but increased to  forward and ended in a  traverse bulkhead. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was , but tapered to  at the ship's ends. Below this was a thinner armored deck that tapered from  on the centerline to  at the edges. It curved down about  to form a torpedo bulkhead before it met up with the inner bottom. This system was based on experiments conducted in 1894 and was more modern than that used in the Russian battleship Tsesarevich although it was still too close to the side of the ship. The main turret armor was  in thickness and the ammunition shafts were protected by  of armor. The casemates for the 138&nbsp;mm guns ranged from  in thickness and their ammunition tubes had  of armor.\nConstruction and service\nHenri IV was laid down at Cherbourg on 15 July 1897 and launched on 23 August 1899, but did not enter service until September 1903, at a cost of ₣15,660,000 francs. By 1911, Henri IV was assigned as the guard ship of the French naval base in Tunis in French Tunisia. After the Italian destroyer  stopped and thoroughly searched the French mail steamer  for contraband on 25&nbsp;January&nbsp;1912 during the Italo-Turkish War, Henri IV and four French torpedo boats deployed from Bizerte to the southeastern border of Tunisia to stop contraband traffic between Tunisia and the Ottoman Empire and enforce France's obligations as a neutral country.\nThe ship spent the early part of World War I as the guard ship at Bizerte until February 1915, when she was assigned to the newly formed Syrian Squadron (Escadre de Syrie). This squadron was intended to attack Ottoman positions and lines of communication in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and the Sinai Peninsula. Henri IV was transferred to the French squadron in the Dardanelles campaign to replace the sunken battleship  and the damaged  after the Allies suffered heavily during their first attempt to steam through the Dardanelles and past the fortifications on 18 March 1915. The ship bombarded Kum Kale, on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles in support of the French diversionary landing on 25&nbsp;April&nbsp;1915, and provided fire support for the troops ashore for the rest of the month. She was hit eight times while providing support during this time.\nThree of her  guns had been dismounted by November 1914 and sent by rail from Salonica to reinforce the French naval mission to Serbia, known as \"Mission D\". In 1916, she was assigned to the Complementary (Reserve) Division of the 3rd Battle Squadron. Subsequently she served with the French Eastern Division in Egypt and then she was sent to Taranto in 1918 to serve as a depot ship. Henri IV was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and scrapped in 1921.\nNotes\nReferences\n* }} (reprinted from Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute with additions)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/henry_iv.htm picture gallery of Henri IV]"
