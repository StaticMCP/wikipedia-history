Founded as the Committee for a Marxist International (CMI) by British-based South African political theorist Ted Grant and his supporters after a break with the Committee for a Workers' International in 1992, it was subsequently renamed the International Marxist Tendency (IMT) in 2004 before adopting its current name in June 2024. The organization's website, Marxist.com, is edited by Alan Woods. The site is multilingual, and publishes international current affairs articles written from a Marxist perspective, as well as historical and theoretical articles.\nThe international maintains a list of national sections on its website.\nHistory\nMilitant tendency was an entryist group within the British Labour Party based around the Militant newspaper that was founded in 1964. In 1974, Militant and its allies in Sweden, Ireland, and other countries formed the Committee for a Workers' International. The organisation gained more members during the 1970s and early 1980s and dominated the Liverpool City Council. In 1983, the five members of the Militant newspaper's editorial board were expelled for contravening the Labour Party constitution and expulsions of Militant members continued throughout the rest of the decade.\nTed Grant was a longtime leader of Militant until it split in early 1992 over a number of issues and he was expelled. In 1992, Grant and his supporters formed the Socialist Appeal (SA) in Britain. The SA were expelled from the Labour Party in 2021 as part of a wider purge of left wing groups who had supported the previous Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, with any Labour member being found to be a member of Socialist Appeal could be automatically removed.\nAt its World Congress in 2004, the organisation was renamed the International Marxist Tendency (IMT).\nIn late 2009, a dispute developed between the IMT leadership and the leaderships of its sections in Spain (), Venezuela () and Mexico (Partido Comunista Revolucionario). In January 2010, these organisations, together with the group in Colombia and the Mexican section, broke with the IMT and established a new international body, the  (Revolutionary Left). Minorities in Venezuela and Spain chose to remain with the IMT and set up new sections. The new IMT Venezuelan section launched their newspaper, , in April 2010. In the same year, another smaller split occurred. The majority of the Swedish section, factions in Poland and Britain and individuals from several other sections left the IMT to form a new group called Towards a New International Tendency. The Iranian section of the IMT also split away over the international's position on Venezuela's friendly relations with the Iranian government and in 2011 launched Marxist Revival.\nAs part of a wider reorganisation of its sections, the International Marxist Tendency renamed itself the Revolutionary Communist International in June 2024.\nIn 2024, two former members of the Swedish section of the international,  (RKP), made various allegations in the newspaper ETC, including that they had been sexually abused by a member of the party's executive committee. The former members also accused the party of encouraging them to \"give away their savings, distance themselves from their families, drop out of education and engage in sexual relationships with older party comrades.\" A Malmö-based publication, , while critical of the RKP's politics, noted that the alleged abuser was asked to resign, while the party denied the other claims.  also disagreed with some of the characterisations made in the ETC report, such as the RKP having internal disciplinary processes being unusual for a political organisation, as well as noting the lack of substantiation of some of the more serious allegations. When asked for a comment, the RKP stated they have a \"zero-tolerance to violence and harassment in the party\" but their investigation was inconclusive but still even prior to the investigation the alleged abuser was asked to resign as they \"did not show the responsibility that one would expect from a leading comrade\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [http://www.wellredbooks.net/ Publishing (UK)]\n* [http://www.marxistbooks.com Publishing (US)]"
