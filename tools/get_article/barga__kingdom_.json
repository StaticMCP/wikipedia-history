The text also mentions the city-state of Tunip. However, the text is very fragmented making it impossible to draw any conclusions about the location of Barga.\nHittite Period\nAfter 1350 BC, the entire region west of Euphrates was conquered by Suppiluliuma I of Hatti.\nDuring the reign of Mursili II of Hatti, a text (CTH 63) has Mursili II arbitrate in a border dispute between Nuḫašše and Barga, and it also included an agreement with Duppi-Teššup of Amurru. Barga and Nuḫašše disputed the dominion of the city Yaruqatta (URU i-ia-ru-wata-an/aš).\nIt is mentioned as the \"land of Barga\" by Mursilis II in treaties, (see Habiru).\nTheories\nThe location of Barga is uncertain.\nWest of Nuhasse\nSome have suggested that it was southwest of Aleppo, west of Nuhasse, near the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range\nEast of Nuhasse\nHowever, it is possible that Barga was east of Nuhasse. Nuhasse was succeeded by the Iron Age state of Lu'ash, centered on Tell Afis which may be used as a point of reference. Nuhasse bordered directly or indirectly Aleppo in the north, Mukish/Alalakh in the northwest, Niya in the east, Ugarit even further east beyond the mountains, Amurru in the southeast, Kadesh in the south, Qatna in the southwest. Thus, Barga may have been east of Nuhasse, north of Qatna, and southeast of Aleppo. If Aleppo/Yamhad and Qatna disputed over Barga in the MBA, then this further adds to a realm east of the city-state of Ebla which was absorbed by Yamhad.\nShort list of plausible candidates:\n*Tell Tuqan / Tell Touqan — a large tell (c. ~26 ha) immediately east of Tell Afis in the Matkh/Jazr plain; excavated and attested from EB–MB onward, a site directly east of Afis.\n*Tell Umm el-Marra — the largest Bronze-Age tell on the Jabbul Plain (c. 20–25 ha), east / ESE of Aleppo; long Bronze Age occupation and regional role (often equated with ancient Tuba). Its position fits the “SE of Aleppo / north of the Homs–Qatna area” sector.\n*Tell Aran (ancient Arne) — a very large, high tell southeast of Aleppo (major Iron-Age / Bronze remnant); regionally important and visible in the same landscape, though usually identified with Arne/Bit-Agusi rather than Barga.\nSee also\n*Amarna letters\n*Habiru\n*Nuhašše, Niya (kingdom), relative kingdoms\n*Akizzi, Prince of Qatna\n*Amarna letters–localities and their rulers\nReferences\n*Moran, William L.
