It makes use of the tapping technique a few months before Eddie Van Halen's use of the tapping technique on the Van Halen album. May told Guitar Player Magazine that his use of the tapping technique was inspired by Texas guitarist Rocky Athas, after seeing one of his performances at Mother Blues, a Dallas club.\nThe lyrics describe a love affair that is on the verge of ending.\nAccording to Billboard, the music of the single version \"shifts gear from subdued balladry to thunderous rock'n'roll.\"  Cash Box said that \"Brian May's guitar work excellently [complements] Freddie Mercury’s embracing vocals.\" Record World called it a \"thundering rocker [that] has quiet passages and a good melody, then roars through the choruses.\"\nRelease\nThe song was released as a single in North America, Japan and New Zealand in 1978, albeit in heavily edited form, and peaked at #74 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and #66 on the Cash Box Top 100.  The song was later included on the Queen Rocks compilation in 1997.\nPersonnel\nQueen\n*Freddie Mercury – lead and backing vocals\n*Brian May – electric guitar, backing vocals\n*Roger Taylor – drums, backing vocals\n*John Deacon – bass guitar\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/queen-rocks/#lyrics Lyrics at Queen official website] (from Queen Rocks'')"
