They are awarded under the auspices of the Australian Dance Council (Ausdance) for performance, choreography, design, dance writing, teaching and related professions. They especially recognise and honour professional Australian dance artists who have made an outstanding contribution to Australian dance.\nHistory\nThe awards have their origin in the informal community Dancers' Picnic founded by Keith Bain first held in 1986 on or close to International Dance Day.\nIn 1997, Ausdance NSW with support from the City of Sydney and The Australian Ballet, presented the inaugural Australian Dance Awards at the Sydney Opera House. Over time, the Awards have evolved into a major industry event. For three years from 2008, the Awards were held in Melbourne and produced by Ausdance Victoria with support from the Joan and Peter Clemenger Trust and The Australian Ballet.\nFrom 2011 until 2017 the location varied, as the awards were held by tender among the state-based organisations of the Ausdance network. In 2018 Ausdance National hosted the event at the Brisbane Powerhouse in Brisbane, Queensland, and owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, the event was held online by the national body in 2020, covering the years 2018 and 2019.\nIn 2022 the board of Ausdance National announced that the awards were under review and on hold.\n2019\nAwards not held.\n2018\nPresented by Ausdance National and Harlequin Floors, the 2018 Australian Dance Awards were presented on Saturday 8 September at Brisbane Powerhouse.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"25%\"|Award\n!width=\"25%\"|Recipient\n!width=\"25%\"|Work\n!width=\"25%\"|Notes\n|-\n|Lifetime Achievement
