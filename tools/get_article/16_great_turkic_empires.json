The Turkish Postal administration issued a series of stamps dedicated to the 16 Empires in 1984, showing portraits of their respective founders as well as attributed flags. In 1985, Özbek's 16 Empires were invoked as a retrospective explanation of the 16 stars in the presidential seal of Turkey (introduced in 1936).\nSeveral municipal buildings and public parks in Turkey have collections of busts or statues of the founders of the \"16 Empires\" alongside a statue of Kemal Atatürk, including the municipal buildings of Keçiören (Ankara), Mamak, Ankara, Etimesgut, Niğde, Nevşehir and Pınarbaşı, Kayseri.\nIn 2000, Türk Telekom produced a series of smart cards dedicated to the topic.\nIn January 2015, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in the Turkish Presidential Palace with a guard of 16 \"warriors\", actors wearing loosely historical armour and costume, intended to symbolise the 16 empires. The costumes were ridiculed in Turkish media outlets, and one of the costumes in particular was mocked as a \"bathrobe\", becoming a trend on social media under the name of Duşakabinoğulları (lit. \"sons of the shower cabin\").\nSee also\nReferences"
