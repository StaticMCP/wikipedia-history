Peter Stone adapted the screenplay from the 1973 novel written by Morton Freedgood under the pen name John Godey.\nThe film follows a group of criminals who hijack a New York City Subway car and hold the passengers for ransom. The title is derived from the train's radio call sign, which is based on where and when the train began its run; in this case, the train originated at the Pelham Bay Park station in the Bronx at 1:23&nbsp;p.m. For several years after the film was released, the New York City Transit Authority would not schedule any train to leave Pelham Bay Park station at 1:23.\nThe film received critical acclaim. Several critics called it one of 1974's finest films, and it was a box-office success. The music has been described as \"one of the best and most inventive thriller scores of the 1970s\". It was remade in 1998 as a television film and in 2009 as a theatrical film.\nPlot\nIn New York City, four men wearing similar disguises and carrying concealed weapons board the same downtown 6 train, \"Pelham 1-2-3,\" at different stations. Using their code names Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown, they take eighteen people, including the conductor and an off-duty undercover police officer, hostage in the front car.\nCommunicating over the radio with New York City Transit Police lieutenant Zachary Garber, Blue demands that a $1million ransom be delivered within exactly one hour or he will kill one hostage for every minute it is late. Green sneezes periodically, to which Garber always responds, \"Gesundheit.\" Garber, Lt. Rico Patrone and others cooperate while speculating about the hijackers' escape plan. Garber surmises that one hijacker must be a former motorman because the hijackers uncoupled the head car and parked it farther down the tunnel below 28th Street.\nConversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue is a former British Army colonel and was a mercenary in Africa; Green was a motorman who lost his job after being caught in a drug bust; and Blue does not trust Grey, who was ousted from the Mafia for being erratic. Unexpectedly, Grey guns down a transit supervisor from Grand Central as he approaches the hijacked train.\nThe ransom is transported uptown in a speeding police car that crashes well before arriving at 28th Street. As the deadline is reached, Garber bluffs Blue by claiming that the money has reached the station entrance and just has to be walked down the tunnel to the train. Meanwhile, a police motorcycle arrives with the ransom. As two patrolmen carry the money down the tunnel, one of the many police snipers in the tunnel shoots at Brown, and the hijackers exchange gunfire with them. In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.\nThe money is delivered and divided among the hijackers. Blue orders Garber to restore power to the subway line, set the signals to green all the way to South Ferry, and clear the police from stations along the route. Before this is done, however, Green moves the train farther south. When Garber becomes alarmed, Blue explains that he wanted more distance from the police inside the tunnel.\nThe hijackers override the dead man's switch so that the train will run without anyone at the controls. Garber joins Inspector Daniels above ground where the train stopped. The hijackers set the train in motion and get off. As they walk to the tunnel's emergency exit, the off-duty undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails. Unaware that the hijackers have left the train, Garber and Daniels drive south above its route. With no one at the controls, the train gains speed.\nThe hijackers collect their disguises and weapons for disposal, but Grey refuses to surrender his gun, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who kills him. The undercover officer kills Brown and exchanges fire with Blue while Green escapes through an emergency exit onto the street.\nGarber, contemplating the train's suspicious last movement, concludes that the hijackers have bypassed the dead man's switch and are no longer on board. He returns to where the train had stopped, enters the same emergency exit from street level, and confronts Blue before he kills the undercover cop. With no escape, Blue deliberately steps against the third rail and electrocutes himself.\nMeanwhile, Pelham 1-2-3 hurtles through the southbound tunnel. When it enters the South Ferry loop, its speed triggers the automatic safeties. The train screeches to a halt, leaving the hostages bruised but safe.\nSince none of the dead hijackers was a motorman, Garber infers that the lone survivor must be. Working their way through a list of recently discharged motormen, Garber and Patrone knock on the door of Harold Longman (Green). After hastily hiding the loot, Longman lets them in, bluffs his way through their interrogation and complains indignantly about being suspected. Garber vows to return with a search warrant. As Garber closes the apartment door behind him, Longman sneezes, and Garber reflexively says \"Gesundheit,\" as he had over the radio. Garber re-opens the door and gives Longman a caustic stare.\nCast\nMillan)\n* Doris Roberts as mayor's wife\n* Julius Harris as Inspector Daniels\n}}\nProduction\nGodey's novel was published in February 1973 by Putnam, but Palomar Productions had secured the film rights, and Dell had bought the paperback rights months earlier in September 1972. The paperback rights sold for  (equivalent to $million in ).\nGodey (Morton Freedgood) was a \"subway buff\". The novel and the film came out during the so-called \"Golden Age\" of skyjacking in the United States from 1968 through 1979. Additionally, New York City was edging toward a financial crisis; crime had risen citywide, and the subway was perceived as neither safe nor reliable.\nAt first, the New York City Transit Authority (TA) refused to cooperate with the filmmakers. Godey's novel was more detailed about how the hijackers would accomplish their goal and recognized that the caper's success did not rely solely on defeating the \"deadman feature\" in the motorman's cab. Screenwriter Stone, however, made a fictional override mechanism the linchpin of the script. Director Sargent explained, \"We're making a movie, not a handbook on subway hijacking. ... I must admit the seriousness of Pelham never occurred to me until we got the initial TA reaction. They thought it potentially a stimulant—not to hardened professional criminals like the ones in our movie, but to kooks. Cold professionals can see the absurdities of the plot right off, but kooks don't reason it out. That's why they're kooks. Yes, we gladly gave in about the 'deadman feature'. Any responsible filmmaker would if he stumbled onto something that could spread into a new form of madness.\"\nSargent said, \"It's important that we don't be too plausible. We're counting on the film's style and charm and comedy to say, subliminally at least, 'Don't take us too seriously. The credits have a disclaimer that the TA did not give advice or information for use in the film.\nAfter eight weeks of negotiations, and through the influence of Mayor John Lindsay, the TA relented but required that the producers take out $20 million in insurance policies, including special \"kook coverage\" in case the movie inspired a real-life hijacking. This was in addition to a $250,000 fee for use of the track, station, subway cars and TA personnel.\nThe TA also insisted that no graffiti appear in the film. Graffiti had become increasingly prevalent on trains starting in 1969. Mayor Lindsay had first announced his intention to remove graffiti in 1972, but the last graffiti-covered car was not removed from service until 1989. \"New Yorkers are going to hoot when they see our spotless subway cars,\" Sargent said. \"But the TA was adamant on that score. They said to show graffiti would be to glorify it. We argued that it was artistically expressive. But we got nowhere. They said the graffiti fad would be dead by the time the movie got out. I really doubt that.\"\nOther changes included beefing up Matthau's role. In the novel, Garber is the equivalent of the Patrone character in the film. \"I like the piece,\" Matthau said. \"It moves swiftly and stays interesting right down to the wire. That's the reason I wanted to do it. The TA inspector I play is really a supporting role—they built it up a bit when I expressed interest in it—but it's still secondary.\" In the novel, Inspector Daniels confronts Mr. Blue in the tunnel during the climax. Additionally, screenwriter Peter Stone gave the hijackers their color code names, with hats whose colors matched their code names, as well as Longman his telltale cold.\nFilming began on November 23, 1973, and was completed in late April 1974. The budget was $3.8 million.\nFilming locations\nProduction began with scenes inside the subway tunnel. These were filmed over the course of eight weeks on the local tracks of the IND Fulton Street Line at the abandoned Court Street station in Brooklyn. Closed to the public in 1946, it became a filming location and later home to the New York Transit Museum. Among other films, the Court Street station was used for The French Connection (1971), Death Wish (1974), and the 2009 remake of Pelham.\nThe production company set up chess boards, card tables, and ping pong tables along the Court Street platform for cast and crew recreation between set-ups. Robert Shaw apparently beat all comers in ping pong.\nAlthough this was an abandoned spur of track, passing A, E and GG trains rumbled through adjacent tracks on their regular schedules. Dialogue that was marred by the noise was later post-dubbed. The third rail, which carries 600 volts of direct current, was shut off, and three protective bars were placed against the rail, but the cast and crew were told to treat it as if it were still live. \"Those TA people ... are super careful,\" Sargent said. \"They anticipate everything. By the fifth week we were dancing our way through those tunnels like nobody's business. They were expecting that, too. That's when they told us of the fatalities in the tunnels. They're mostly old-timers. The young guys still have a healthy fear of the place.\"\n\"There was one scene where Robert Shaw was to step on the third rail,\" Sargent recalled. \"When we were rehearsing the scene, Shaw accidentally stubbed his toe and the sparks from his special-effects boot flew everywhere. He turned white as a sheet. We had eight weeks of that. I think we got out just in time.\"\nShaw's biographer John French reported, \"There were rats everywhere and every time someone jumped from the train, or tripped over the lines, clouds of black dust rose into the air, making it impossible to shoot until it had settled. It was stiflingly hot and the noise from the frequent trains braking on the approach to the nearby Hoyt-Schermerhorn Station was deafening. At the end of a day’s work actors and crew alike emerged looking as though they had been mining for coal.\"\nAccording to Backstage, the filmmakers were the first to use a \"flash\" process developed by Movielabs to bring out detail when shooting with low light in the tunnel. The process reportedly increased film speed by two stops. It allowed the filmmakers to use fewer lights and generators, and cut five days out of the schedule.\nAt least two R22 trains portrayed Pelham 123. As it enters the 28th Street station, the head car is labeled 7339. However, in an early scene at Grand Central, 7339 is seen on the express track across the platform. Later, after being cut from the rest of the train, the head car is labeled 7434.\nAfter two months in the tunnel, production moved to Filmways Studios at 246 East 127th Street in East Harlem, where a replica of the Transit Authority's Brooklyn control center was constructed.\nThe exterior street scenes above the hijacked subway train were filmed at the subway entrance at 28th and Park Avenue South in Manhattan. The mayor's residence, Gracie Mansion, was used for exteriors. Wave Hill, a nineteenth-century mansion overlooking the Hudson River in Riverdale, the Bronx, was used for the interior scenes set in Gracie Mansion.\nMusic\nThe score, composed and conducted by David Shire, \"layers explosive horn arrangements and serpentine keyboard riffs over a rhythm section that pits hard-grooving basslines against constantly shifting but always insistent layers of percussion\". Shire used the 12-tone composition method to create unusual, somewhat dissonant melodic elements.\nThe soundtrack album was the first CD release by Film Score Monthly and was soon released by Retrograde Records. The end titles contain a more expansive arrangement of the theme, courtesy of Shire's wife at the time, Talia Shire, who suggested that he end the score with a more traditional ode to New York.\nRelease\nThe Taking of Pelham One Two Three was released to theaters on October 2, 1974.\nCritical reception\nThe film holds a 98% score on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews and a weighted average of 8.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Breezy, thrilling, and quite funny, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three sees Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw pitted against each other in effortlessly high form.\"\nThe film was well received by critics. Variety called it \"a good action caper\", but \"the major liability is Peter Stone's screenplay, which develops little interest in either Matthau or Shaw's gang, nor the innocent hostages\", who are \"simply stereotyped baggage\". Although the trade paper complained that the Mayor was \"played for silly laughs\", it called Shaw \"superb in another versatile characterization\".\nBoxOffice thought that \"some of the excitement has been lost\" translating the novel to the screen, but \"there is entertainment value in Peter Stone's screenplay\".\nNora Sayre of The New York Times thought that it captured the mood of New York and New Yorkers. \"Throughout there's a skillful balance between the vulnerability of New Yorkers and the drastic, provocative sense of comedy that thrives all over our sidewalks. And the hijacking seems like a perfectly probable event for this town. (Perhaps the only element of fantasy is the implication that the city's departments could function so smoothly together). Meanwhile, the movie adds up to a fine piece of reporting—and it's the only action picture I've seen this year that has a rousing plot.\"\nThe film was one of several released that year that gave New York a bad image, including Law and Disorder, Death Wish, Serpico and The Super Cops. Vincent Canby, another critic for The New York Times, wrote, \"New York is a mess, say these films. It's run by fools. Its citizens are at the mercy of its criminals who, as often as not, are protected by an unholy alliance of civil libertarians and crooked cops. The air is foul. The traffic impossible. Services are diminishing and the morale is such that ordering a cup of coffee in a diner can turn into a request for a fat lip.\" But The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, \"compared to the general run of New York City films, is practically a tonic, a good-humored, often witty suspense melodrama in which the representatives of law and decency triumph without bending the rules.\"\nThe Boston Globe called it \"fast, funny and fairly terrifying\" and \"a nerve-racking ride\", and appreciated the \"wry humor\" of Stone's script. It tapped into a darker reality: \"A short time ago subways were safe; today some of them are full of the dark rage of asylums. And who really is to say a Pelham-type incident is out of the question?\"\nCharles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \"coarse-textured and effective, a cartoon-vivid melodrama and not, it's nice to know, a case study of psychopathic behavior. 'Pelham' is in fact the best to date of the new multiple-jeopardy capers, fresh, lively and suspenseful... . There are some marvelously managed scenes in the subway tunnels and on teeming platforms and at the barricaded street-level entrances. The subway nerve center is fascinating, and indeed one of the pleasures of the film is its glimpse of how things work... . The violence is handled with restraint; the dangers are mixed with raucous humor and what stays clear is that the aim is swift entertainment.\"\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 stars out of 4. He praised the film's \"unforced realism\" and the supporting characters who elevated what could have been a predictable crime thriller: \"We care about the people not the plot mechanics. And what could have been formula trash turns out to be fairly classy trash, after all.\"\nGene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, describing it as a \"solid new thriller laced with equal amounts of tension and comedy\".\nAccolades\nBAFTA Awards\n* 1976: Nominated, \"Best Film Music\"—David Shire\n* 1976: Nominated, \"Best Supporting Actor\"—Martin Balsam\nWriters Guild of America Award\n* 1975: Nominated, \"Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium\"—Peter Stone\nRemakes\nIn 1998, the film was remade as a television film with the same title, with Edward James Olmos in the role that Walter Matthau played in the movie, and Vincent D'Onofrio replacing Shaw as the senior hijacker. Although not particularly well received by critics or viewers, this version was reportedly more faithful to the book, although it revised the setting with new technologies. It was filmed in Toronto, Ontario.\nAnother remake, set in post 9/11 New York City, directed by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington and John Travolta, was released in 2009 to mixed reviews.\nLegacy\nThe color-coded thieves' names in Reservoir Dogs were a deliberate homage by Quentin Tarantino to The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film has also been cited as an inspiration for the cinematography of the 2024 film Anora by Sean Baker.\nSee also\n* List of American films of 1974\n* The Incident (1967)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
