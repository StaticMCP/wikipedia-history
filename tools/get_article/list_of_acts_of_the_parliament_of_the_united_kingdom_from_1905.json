For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n5 Edw. 7\nThe sixth session of the 27th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 14 February 1905 until 11 August 1905.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 5 Ed. 7 or 5 E. 7.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  which relate to the Weighing of Minerals.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\n|  and certain Confirming Acts.\n|po2=Burslem Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Burslem Local Board Gas Act 1877.\n|po3=Newbury Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering a Confirming Act.\n|po4=Southport Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Southport Improvement Act 1871 and a Confirming Act.\n|po5=Ulverston Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Ulverston Local Board Act 1874 and certain Confirming Acts.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the Marylebone Chapels (St. Paul, Great Portland Street and St. Peter, Vere Street) Act 1905|local|7|30-06-1905|maintained=y|An Act to provide for the sale of the Chapel of Saint Paul Great Portland Street and for the endowment of the Chapel of Saint Peter Vere Street in the event of that chapel having a district assigned to it and for other purposes connected therewith.}}\n|  to extend the period limited by the West Cumberland Electric Tramways Act 1903 within which distributing mains for the supply of electricity were to be laid down and for other purposes.}}\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  and the Hastings Harbour Act 1897 and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to amend that Act in various respects and for other purposes.}}\n-\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and 1903. }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and the Rawmarsh Urban District Council (Tramways) Act 1900 and for other purposes.}}\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  and to enable the Corporation to purchase further lands and to borrow further moneys for their Waterworks and for other purposes.}}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n-\n|  }}\n|  to amend the Acts relating to the Hull Barnsley and West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|  and the London United Tramways Act 1902 for the construction of tramways and the acquisition of lands.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  relating to lands in the parishes of Erith and Barking.|note4= }}\n|  relating to Alexander Scott's Hospital.|po1=Alexander Scott's Hospital Order 1905|Provisional Order to extend the qualifications for the admission of Inmates to Alexander Scott's Hospital to amalgamate the Trust Funds administered by the Trustees and Managers of the Hospital and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Grangemouth Waterworks and Burgh Extension.|po1=Grangemouth Waterworks and Burgh Extension Order 1905|Provisional Order to construct additional Waterworks to abandon certain authorised Works to extend the Boundaries of the Burgh of Grangemouth and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Arbroath Corporation Water.|po1=Arbroath Corporation Water Order 1905|Provisional Order to authorise the Provost Magistrates and Councillors of the Burgh of Aberbrothock or Arbroath to construct and maintain additional waterworks and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Dundee Water.|note4=|po1=Dundee Water Order 1905|Provisional Order to empower the Dundee Water Commissioners to construct additional Waterworks to further extend their limits of supply and of compulsory supply and for other purposes.}}\n| }}\n-\n|\n|po2=Sheringham Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Sheringham and Beeston Protection Act 1898.\n|po3=Stalybridge Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Stalybridge and Mossley Gas Act 1885.\n|po4=Swinton Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Swinton Local Board Act 1894. }}\n|\n|po2=Bradford Order 1905|Provisional Order for altering the Bradford Corporation Act 1901.\n|po3=Chester Order 1905|Provisivnal Order for altering the Chester Improvement Act 1884.\n|po4=Derby Order 1905|Provisivnal Order for altering the Derby Corporation Act 1882 the Derby Corporation Tramways &c.
