In 1999 the awards were expanded to include other bNet stations, were renamed the bNet Music Awards, and later became the bNet NZ Music Awards.\nFounded as an alternative to RIANZ's New Zealand Music Awards, the bNet awards were largely determined by a public vote, and in early years the awards had irreverent categories such as Male Fox and Female Fox, Most Incomprehensible Lyric and Biggest Cock-Up. But the awards also included categories that were otherwise overlooked by mainstream music awards of the time, such as Best DJ, Best Independent Album and Best Website. 2007 was the final year the bNet Awards were held.\n1998 bFM Music Awards\nThe first awards were called the bFM Music Awards and were organised by Auckland student radio station bFM.
