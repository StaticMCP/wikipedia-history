In the 1930s, the palace's gardens were sold for the construction of a new road - the Avenue of Friends (Aleja Przyjaciół). During the Polish People's Republic, the building housed the headquarters for the Front of National Unity, proceeded by the Patriotic Movement for National Rebirth.\nIn the 1990s, the building served as the centre for the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, later for the Institute of Lech Wałęsa. In 1996, the building was purchased by Jan Wejchert, Polish billionaire media mogul and founder of TVN Group. Presently, the palace houses the Polish Business Council (Polska Rada Biznesu) and a restaurant.\nGallery\nFile:Warszawa - Aleje Ujazdowskie 13 - ZJ001.jpg|Entrance of Sobański Palace\nFile:Sob1DSC 0997.JPG|Garden view of Sobański Palace\nFile:Wawa47DSC 1077.JPG|View from Ujazdów Avenue\nSee also\n*Sobański Palace in Guzów\n*Sobański family\n*List of palaces in Poland\nReferences"
