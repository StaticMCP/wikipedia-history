In their sixth season under head coach Volney Ashford, the Vikings compiled a perfect 9–0 record (4–0 against MCAU teams), won the MCAU championship, and outscored opponents by a total of 391 to 59.\nMissouri Valley was ranked at No. 117 (out of 590 college and military teams) in the final rankings under the Litkenhous Difference by Score System for 1942.\nThe season was part of a 41-game winning streak (1941–1942, 1946–1948) that still ranks as the fifth longest in college football history. Coach Ashford, who led the team during the streak, was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nSchedule\n||Marshall, MO|W 53-6||\n|October 2|||||Marshall, MO|W 31-14||\n|October 9|||||Marshall, MO|W 39-7||\n|October 16||at|||Liberty, MO|W 59-0||\n|October 30|||||Marshall, MO|W 55-13||\n|November 6|||||Marshall, MO|W 33-0||\n|November 11||at|Chillicothe Business School||Chillicothe, MO (Armistice Day)|W 26-12||\n|November 14|8:00 p.m.|at||Bourke Field|Kansas City, MO|W 33-7||\n|November 26|||Central (MO)||Marshall, MO|W 62-0||\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
