It was both written and produced by the group with Martin Brammer, and peaked at No. 79 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 14 on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\nCritical reception\nLarry Flick from Billboard magazine commented, \"Trance/rave masters dip into their glorious Guru Mother album, pulling out this sparkling jewel. Kirsty Hawkshaw's angelic presence provides poetic depth, while remixes by Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osbourne embellish the song's strong melody with a trend-conscious rhythm base.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media wrote, \"Imagine all those clubbers trying to follow Opus III's instructions to dance hand in hand. Luckily the beat and the lyrics are dead simple, maybe your station can lend a hand too.\" Tim Jeffery from Music Weeks RM Dance Update noted, \"Paul Oakenfold provides the mixes and they're very pleasant, quite mellow trancey excursions that are listenable but very unremarkable due to a lacklustre song which drifts along but goes nowhere. As a result the vocal-less trance mix is the best.\" A reviewer from Select said, \"With some careful remixing, however, 'Hand in Hand (Looking for Sweet Inspiration)' could turn into a pretty mean floor-filler.\"\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"Hand in Hand (Looking for Sweet Inspiration)\" was directed by Peter Sherrard and produced by Annabel O'Grady for Medialab. It was released on 29 August 1994 and is a sepia drenched fantasy in the rolling fields of Derbyshire.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Scotland (OCC)\n| 84\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| 79\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|UK Club Chart (Music Week)\n| 17\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance Club Play (Billboard)\n| 14\n|}\nGrace version\n| producer   =\n* Paul Oakenfold\n* Steve Osborne\n| prev_title = If I Could Fly\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = You're Not Mine/Down to Earth\n| next_year  = 1997\n}}\nIn 1997, British dance act Grace covered the song and released it as their sixth single from their only album, If I Could Fly (1996), titled as \"Hand in Hand\", on Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label. It reached number 38 on the UK Singles Chart, number 32 in Scotland and number 85 on the Eurochart Hot 100. Remixes of the song included a complete reworking of the song by Jam El Mar of European dance act Jam & Spoon.

The Guardian called it \"Grace's strongest single to date\", while The Baltimore Sun thought the song had \"too much exuberance.\"\nTrack listings and formats\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !! Title !!
