The PR was created in 1960 by  and Max Delvalle and Eric Arturo Delvalle, all of them Jewish and backed by the Jewish business community.\nThe PR supported the Roberto Francisco Chiari Remón administration in 1960-1964 and the Marco Aurelio Robles administration in 1964-1968.\nwas briefly Vice-President to Arnulfo Arias in his 11-day government of 1968, despite Arias' well-known anti-semitism.\nThe PPR survived the period of suspension under Omar Torrijos (1969-1981) and did not participate in the 1980 balloting.\nThe PR joined the National Opposition Front (FRENO), a coalition of eight parties, in 1979.\nThe party was reborn officially on 30 June 1981 with a view to participating in the 1984 elections, though this time the 'Jewish vote' was more widely dispersed. Bazán and the Delvalles were again at its head, and the party was even more clearly allied to the country's wealthy elite, with policies of untrammeled free enterprise and embryonic authoritarianism.\nIt joined the UNADE coalition behind official candidate Nicolás Ardito Barletta in 1984, winning 2 seats. Eric Arturo Delvalle became First Vice-President, taking over the presidency when Nicolás Ardito Barletta was overthrown by the military on 27 September 1985, but he in turn was ousted on 27 February 1988 when he tried to dismiss Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Noriega.\nHe refused to accept the action of the National Assembly in dismissing him from the latter post, and continued to be recognized thereafter as constitutional chief executive by the US government.\nThe Manuel Noriega’ regime provoked a split in the RP. The PR joined the official COLINA coalition for the 1989 elections, but the majority of the legitimate leadership of the RP participated in the ADOC coalition.\nThe PR was abolished by the Electoral Tribunal on 1 July 1991.\nReferences"
