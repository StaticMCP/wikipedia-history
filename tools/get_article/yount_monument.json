It is located in front of American Family Field west of downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The sculpture depicts Robin Yount, a member of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team, following through after taking a swing at a pitch. The figure wears a 1980s-style uniform with close-fitting calf-length pants, a button-front short-sleeved jersey and a batting helmet. The sculpture was dedicated on April 5, 2001.\nReferences"
