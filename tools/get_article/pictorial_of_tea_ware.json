The green tea was ground into a fine powder and hot water was added then whisked in a bowl with a brush to make tea and foam, this Chinese method of preparing tea spread to Japan and became the way matcha tea is made in Japan today. While in China this method gave way to the brewing tea method, which is the infusion of loose tea.\nOld Man Shenan’s 12 Tea Ware\nThis book described 12 tea wares (審安老人的12茶具):\nSome of the tea terms of Shenan and Lu Yu have the same names and use, because some of the tea wares from the Tang dynasty were also used in the Song dynasty, although Shenan does give them special names.\nSong dynasty tea ware\n*Brazier 風爐 (hong lu 韋鴻臚)\n*Crushing Block 砧椎 (mu dai zhi 木待制)\n*Crushing Roller 碾 (jin fa cao 金法曹)\n*Stone Mill 石磨 ( shi zhuan yun 石轉運 )\n*Gourd Scooper 瓢 (hu yuan wai 胡員外)\n*Sieve Box 羅合 (luo shu mi 羅樞密)\n*Brush 札 (zong cong shi 宗從事)\n*Bowl Basket 畚 (qi diao mi ge 漆雕秘閣)\n*Bowl 碗 (tao bao wen 陶寶文)\n*Water Vessel 水方 (tang ti dian 湯提點)\n*Tea Whisk 茶筅 (zhu fu shi 竺副師)\n*Tea Cloth 巾 (si zhi fang 司職方)\nThe above tea wares, except for stone mill (石磨) and tea whisk (茶筅), were also mentioned by Lu Yu in The Classic of Tea.\nSee also\n*The Classic of Tea (Tang dynasty)\nReferences\n*[https://teaarts.blogspot.com/2010/06/tea-terms-2010.html Tea Terms 2010 中英文茶術語]\nExternal links\n*[https://teaarts.blogspot.com/2007/10/seven-tea-methods.html 抹茶法 - Whisking (Fine powder) Tea Method]"
