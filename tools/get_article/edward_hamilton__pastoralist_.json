In 1851 he was appointed the first provost of the University of Sydney, resigning in 1854.\nReturn to England\nIn January 1855 Hamilton returned to England, having sold his shares in the livestock stations. He was appointed chairman of the London-based Australian Agricultural Company in 1854, a position he held until his death. He was also appointed chairman of the Bank of Australasia.\nMember of parliament\nAt the 1865 general election Hamilton was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom as one of two members of parliament for the City of Salisbury. In August 1869 Hamilton resigned his parliamentary seat.\nLater life\nHamilton continued with his business activities until his death. He maintained his links with New South Wales, and was the colony's representative agent in London for some years. He made his home at Charters, Sunningdale, Berkshire, and was appointed High Sheriff in 1879. He died there in 1898 survived by 2 sons and 6 daughters.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
