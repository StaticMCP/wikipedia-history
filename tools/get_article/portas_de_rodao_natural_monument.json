Established in 2009, the monument preserves not only natural, but historical heritage, including the medieval Castle of Ródão which oversees the river.\nThe Natural Monument serves as habitat for the largest colony of griffon vultures in the national territory. The  high cliffs make it an ideal place for nesting birds of prey.\nVegetation is primarily Mediterranean: Myrtus communis, Arbutus unedo, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus coccifera and Juniperus oxycedrus (considered a relict species in Portugal) are common throughout the monument.\nReferences"
