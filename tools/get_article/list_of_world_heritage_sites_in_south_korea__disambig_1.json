Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. The Republic of Korea (South Korea) accepted the convention on 14 September 1988, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. There are 17 World Heritage Sites in South Korea and a further 13 on the tentative list.\nThe first three sites of South Korea, the Haeinsa Temple, Jongmyo Shrine, and Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple, were inscribed on the list at the 19th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Berlin, Germany, in 1995. The most recent site listed was Petroglyphs along the Bangucheon Stream, in 2025. Getbol and the Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes are natural sites; the other 14 sites are cultural.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (province)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple\n|\n| North Gyeongsang\n| 1995\n| 736; i, iv (cultural)\n| The Buddhist complex was founded in the 8th century under the Silla kingdom.
