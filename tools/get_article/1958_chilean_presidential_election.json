Allende's defeat has been commonly attributed to Antonio Zamorano, also known as \"Cura de Catapilco\", entering the race as a populist left-wing candidate and taking votes from Allende's electorate. This explanation has been questioned by modern research that infers Zamorano took votes from across the political spectrum. The \"Catapilco\" effect remains a trope in Chilean electoral discourse used to indicate a candidate that finishes third and is believed to have hindered the runner-up.\nElectoral system\nThe election was held using the absolute majority system, under which a candidate had to receive over 50% of the popular vote to be elected. If no candidate received over 50% of the vote, both houses of the National Congress would come together to vote on the two candidates that received the most votes.\nResults\n|cand2=Salvador Allende|party2=Socialist Party|votes2=356493|votes2_2=26\n|cand3=Eduardo Frei Montalva|party3=Christian Democratic Party|votes3=255769\n|cand4=Luis Bossay|party4=Radical Party|votes4=192077\n|cand5=Antonio Zamorano|party5=Independent|votes5=41304\n|invalid=14798|invalid2=14\n|electorate=1497493|electorate2=192\n|source=Nohlen, [http://eleccion.atspace.com/presidente1958.htm Chilean Electoral Database]\n}}\nReferences"
