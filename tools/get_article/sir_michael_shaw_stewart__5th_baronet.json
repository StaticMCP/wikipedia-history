He was invested in these lands in 1813 and dropped the name of Nicholson and became Sir Michael Shaw Stewart of Ardgowan, 5th Baronet.\nHe served as an officer of the Yeomanry of Renfrewshire, a high office-bearer in the Grand Masonic Lodge of Scotland, and as a keen horseman, Sir Michael was a member of the Royal Caledonian Hunt.

The previous day he had paraded with the Yeomanry on Portobello Sands for the King's display. Fellow notable members of the Yeomanry on parade and attending the dinner included Sir Walter Scott and Adam Ferguson. Sir Michael's eldest daughter Margaret, also attended aged 20, recorded as wearing \"a most elegant dress\" of white net, richly embroidered with pearls, and trimmed with a profusion of blond lace, a Manteau of the richest white gros-de-Naples, garniture en-blond and pearls to correspond. A headdress of feathers, pearls, and diamonds.\nOn 27 August in the library at Melville Castle, Sir Michael with other members of the Caledonian Hunt presented the King with an elegantly bound book containing a list of names and the rules of the Caledonian Hunt.\nSir Michael contributed to many charities at home, such as the payment of land rental for the Greenock Infirmary; the education of many poor children in Inverkip over a number of years, providing them with books paper, pens and pencils as well as paying most of the Schoolmasters salary. His most important scheme of all was to commission the building of a reservoir to provide the water for Greenock and neighbouring districts. With friends, he set up Shaws Water Joint Stock Company, which was ratified by Parliament in 1825. The engineer responsible for the building of the reservoir was Robert Thom, and the artificial lake, completed in 1827, became Loch Thom.
