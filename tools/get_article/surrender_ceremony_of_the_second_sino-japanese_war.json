The forces of the Imperial Japanese Army agreed with the Allies terms to cease all armed conflict. The ceremony occurred a week after the war had officially ended in Asia on September 2.\nThe Pacific War came to an end when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japan in August 1945. Imperial Japanese armed forces were ordered to surrender in the Hirohito surrender broadcast on 15 August 1945.\nThe official surrender ceremony of World War II in China was held in the auditorium of the Central Army Military Academy in Nanjing, Republic of China at 9:00 on September 9, 1945. During the 15-minute ceremony, General Yasuji Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Expeditionary Force of the Imperial Japanese Army, signed the surrender letter which was written in Japanese and Chinese. The unconditional surrender was accepted by Kuomintang General He Yingqin, the representative of Allies of World War II and the commander-in-chief of the Republic of China National Revolutionary Army.\nSubsequently, on 10 October 1945, 47 Divisions from the former Imperial Japanese Army officially surrendered to Chinese military officials and representatives of the allied forces at the Forbidden City, Beijing.\nReferences"
