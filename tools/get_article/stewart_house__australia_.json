Sick or malnourished children visited the centre because of the healthy atmosphere near the sea, good food, and available exercise.\nDuring their stay, children are provided with optometric, dental and medical treatment as well as emotional support.\nSince its foundation, Stewart House has catered for over 200,000 children who typically spend a fortnight at the house. It is currently funded by donations from public school teachers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.stewarthouse.org.au/our-school/ Official Site]"
