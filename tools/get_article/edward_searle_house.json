The house is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the state.\nThe house was rebuilt in 1677 on the site of the original 1670 house off of the remaining Stone end and chimney which survived the burning by Native Americans during King Philip's War, and was remodeled around 1720.  The -story gable-roofed stone-ender remains a part of the newer house.  Edward Searle was a son-in-law of Thomas Ralph who was one of the original purchasers of the land from the Native Americans.  The owner of the house has placed a large chalkboard on the front porch often containing messages for passers-by.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*\n*\nSee also\n*List of the oldest buildings in Rhode Island"
