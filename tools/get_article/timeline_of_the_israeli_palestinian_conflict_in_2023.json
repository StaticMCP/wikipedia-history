He said he \"cannot argue with the facts. As of right now, the occupation is permanent. And as of right now I would like to continue to apply Israeli sovereignty over all the areas that I can.\" Earlier, incoming prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the referral \"despicable\" and said \"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land nor occupiers in our eternal capital Jerusalem and no U.N. resolution can distort that historical truth\". To the concern of the US administration, Netanyahu has made agreements with coalition partners to expand Israeli settlements and legalize dozens of Israeli outposts.\n2 January\nIsraeli forces killed two Palestinians, 22 and 25 years old, in a demolition raid on Kafr Dan, northwest of Jenin.
