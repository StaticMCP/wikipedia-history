This is a dynasty of kings-priests who replaced the Sorimangaraja dynasty in the North Batak Land.\nBakkara as the capital\nBakkara, and also Muara, is situated on a small delta on the shores of Lake Toba. From behind it is protected by very steep cliffs, and ±400 meters high. One analysis suggests that Sisingamangaraja I's choice of Bakkara, rather than Balige, which was located in an open area, as the capital, was correct.\nIn history, Bakkara was finally captured by the Padri fighter (1819) and the Dutch troops (1884), after being bombarded with cannon fire.\nSisingamangaraja and external influences\nUp to the 9th generation, the history of this dynasty is closer to Batak myth than Batak history. The whole story is more like Batak mythology which has no comparative material to prove its truth, and it is very difficult to simply accept the history of Sisingamangaraja I up to Sisingamangaraja IX with no other sources except Batak books (Pustaha Batak). The only sources that tell about the Sisingamangaraja dynasty are a number of books belonging to the royal family known as the Bakkara Archives, or by the family called Pustaha Harajaon, or royal library, consists of 24 volumes, and each volume is 8&nbsp;cm thick. These books, according to the family of Sisingamangaraja XII, now housed in the Leiden library (Universiteit Biblioteek), who was found and saved by a Dutch priest, Pilgrams, during the Dutch attack on the capital of Sisingamangaraja in Huta Lumban Pande, Bakkara, in 1883. The contents of the book archive include:\n* Volumes I to III, concerning the reign of Tuan Sorimangaraja for 90 generations, starting from the daughter of Tapi Donda Nauasan.\n* Volumes IV to VII, the reign of the Singamangaraja from dynasties I to IX.\n* Volume VIII, about the war by the Padri under the leadership of Tuanku Rao against Ompu Tuan Nabolon, Sisingamangaraja X.\n* Volume IX, about Si Pongkinangolngolan and Datu Aman Tagor Simanullang.\n* Volumes XI to XII, concerning the Pilgrams and the murder of Reverend Lymann and Munson by King Panggulamai in Silindung.\n* Volume XIII to XVI, the period of rebuilding the center of the Si Singamangaraja kingdom in Bakkara in Huta Lumban Raja between 1835 and 1846, after the burning of the old government center Huta Lumban Pande by Padri's forces.\n* Volume XVII, about Junghun, van der Tuuk who came to meet Ompu Sohahuaon, Sisingamangaraja XI, and about the making of the photo.\n* Volumes XVIII to XXIV the coronation of Ompu Sohahuaon as Sisingamangaraja XI, his reign until 1866 and regarding the infectious disease that hit Tano Toba which also claimed the life of Sisingamangaraja XI.\nThis source is written in the Toba Batak language and Toba Batak script, and the language used is of course a sacred language, so reading it requires expertise. This Pustaha Harajaon was written on the initiative of Sisingamangaraja XI, so most of the stories had to be subjected to more thorough research and comparison. About Sisingamangaraja XII is not included in this library, because he himself did not have time to continue his father's work.\nIn the history of the Sisingamangaraja family, it is seen that they did have relations with areas outside the Tano Toba, but as comparative material, sources or folk tales from the areas he has visited still need to be researched further or which is said to have been related to Sisingamangaraja.\nRegarding Sisingamangaraja X and XI, there has been clear contact with outside the Tano Toba which can be compared with historical sources, so it can be proven that Sisingamangaraja X and XI did indeed exist in the history of Tano Toba. At least once, Sisingamangaraja X had contact with outsiders, namely when Padri fighter invaded Tano Toba, while Sisingamangaraja XI had made contact with Europeans who recorded the meeting.\nExamining the history of Sisingamangaraja's ancestors, it can be seen that his influence, and not his power, expanded little by little throughout the Tano Toba, even reaching the areas of Eastern Sumatra and Asahan, which at that time were already familiar with the commonly known form of kingdom, complete with palaces and Malay-based royal customs. Never did Sisingamangaraja use violent means to exert his influence on the surrounding areas or those he visited. What he always does is try to provide assistance to the difficulties faced by the people, either in the form of treatment or repelling disease or efforts to prevent natural disasters with martonggo or praying to Mulajadi na Bolon. At that time, the martonggo ceremony that he held was believed by the people to be very effective in freeing them from the difficulties they were experiencing. During his travels, he also encouraged people to help each other and also respect fellow human beings regardless of whether they are rich or poor. Also in social life, he encouraged residents to preserve relationships between individuals with the dalihan na tolu a system which clearly regulates the position and obligations of each citizen in society, both in traditional environments and in everyday life. Due to the strict regulations in dalihan na tolu, each citizen is safe but also responsible for maintaining harmonious relations between citizens. This responsibility helps reduce crimes in society. The respect that the people gave to Sisingamangaraja was given as a result of his own actions which he carried out in accordance with what he said, He is consistent with his words and his advice is 'as fair and as cold' to those who listen, and is a way out for those who are arguing or confused. Because of this, he is often referred to as a king who sits in an honorable place and is wise in speaking or solving problems (raja na hundul di patuan jala malo marhata-hata).\nSeveral Western writers have tried to place Sisingamangaraja as someone who came from outside the Tano Toba, that he was someone who came and influenced the lives of the Batak people and not the other way around, a Batak who travels throughout Tano Toba, even to the border areas and has a strong influence on the minds of the people.\nForeign authors' study of the supernatural Sisingamangaraja\nIn his book, Bataksche Vertellingen, C.M. Pleyte said: \"This prince, who held the hereditary title of Si-Singa Mangaradja (Sisingamangaraja), The Grand Duke Lion, who brings all sorts of supernatural things to the objects he is associated with. He was, as it is believed, a boy born at the age of seven, and had hair on his tongue, which, if one looked at it, was deadly. When speaking, he kept his mouth shut as much as possible and always gave orders in writing. Sometimes he lived for seven months without eating, or even for three months straight in a deep sleep. Rain and sunshine are his messengers. So, his people pray to him to bless the harvest.\"\nRelationship between Sisingamangaraja and Parmalim\nThe connection between King Sisingamangaraja and Parmalim (Ugamo Malim) can be seen in the explanation by Sylvia L. Thrupp in the book Millennial Dreams in Action: Essays in Comparative Study:\n\"''The last Si-Singa Mangaradja (Sisingamangaraja) is generally regarded as the founder of this sect (Parmalim), the members of which are scattered all over the Toba highlands, singly or in other huta, The sect first appeared in the late 1870's. A guru (teacher) called Somailang is said to have acquired leadership of the sect after the Si-Singa Mangaradja's demise, although other pormalim imply that the priest-king merely spoke through Somailang (who was later exiled by the Dutch) and his successors. To the pormalim, Si-Singa Mangaradja is not merely a messenger of God, he is the living High God himself. The word \"pormalim\" has nothing to do with the Malay term malim (priest) but comes from the Batak malim which means 'to be independent', or 'to be different from other men'. In their beliefs and myths, the pormalim show many Christian, but no Islamic, influences.\"\nProposal to continue the Sisingamangaraja title\nAfter the death of Sisingamangaraja XII, there was a discourse/proposal from Batak community leaders at that time, that one of the sons of the late Sisingamangaraja XII, Karel Buntal Sinambela, who at that time had been permitted by the Dutch East Indies government to return to Tano Toba from Java, to become the next Sisingamangaraja. A magazine published in Den Haag, Het Koloniaal Weekblad, issue 23 November 1933,  write a dialogue between eight Toba Batak people leaders (Porbaringin) with the assistant resident in Tarutung, regarding the proposal:\"Ass. resident: Met welk doel hebben de porbaringin een rekest gezonden aan den gouverneur-generaal?\nWoordvoerder: Om te smeeken, dat de titel van Radja Singa Mangaradja weer worde hersteld en geschonken worde aan diens zoon, radja Boental, die hier reeds aanwezig is.\nAss. resident: Maar dat is onmogelijk. Wij hebben al een radja, n.l. Koningin Wilhelmina.\nWoordvoerder: Het is niet, dat wij Koningin Wilhelmina niet erkennen. Maar Koningin Wilhelmina en de regeering zullen niet wenschen dat onze adat verloren gaat; zij zullen de adat willen verstevigen. En volgens de Bataksche adat moet er een Radja Singa Mangaradja zijn.\nAss. resident: Radja Singa Mangaradja was geen wereldsch vorst, doch een priestervorst.\nWoordvoerder: Hij was niet alleen een priestervorst, maar hij was ook met wereldsch gezag bekleed. En hij moet niet alleen een kampong onder zich hebben, want het is van geen beteekenis wanneer de radja porbaringin, als vertegenwoordiger van den Radja Singa Mangaradja, niet met gezag bekleed zijn. Bij iedere kwestie van beteekenis moeten de porbaringin zijn als vertegenwoordigers van den Radja Singa Mangaradja. Daarom is Radja Singa Mangaradja een wereldsch vorst. De machtige vorst, die door de Bataksche bangsa (stam, volk) erkend wordt.\nAss. resident: Dat kan niet, en dat is nu ook niet urgent. R.K. Boental heeft reeds een betrekking waarmee hij in zijn onderhoud kan voorzien op een wijze, welke met zijn behoeften overeenkomt. En daar komt het nu maar op aan.\nWoordvoerder: Wij zijn niet tevreden gesteld, Toean Besar.\n(English translation:\nAssistant Resident: For what purpose did Porbaringin send a petition to the Governor General?\nPorbaringin: To request that the title of Sisingamangaraja be returned and bestowed on his son, King Buntal, who is already here.\nAssistant Resident: But that's impossible. We already have a king, Queen Wilhelmina.\nPorbaringin: It's not that we don't recognize Queen Wilhelmina. But Queen Wilhelmina and the government, they don't want our traditions to disappear; they want to strengthen them. And according to Batak tradition, there must be a Sisingamangaraja.\nAssistant Resident: Sisingamangaraja was not a worldly leader, but a religious leader.\nPorbaringin: He was not only a religious leader, but he also had worldly power. And he cannot only control one village, because it is useless if he is in trouble, as the representative of Sisingamangaraja, was not given the authority. In every important matter, the Porbaringin must be present as the representative of Sisingamangaraja. Therefore, King Sisingamangaraja was a worldly leader, a mighty ruler recognized by the Batak people.\nAssistant Resident: It is not possible to do so and is not urgent to do so at this time. Karel Buntal already has a job that allows him to support himself according to his needs. And that's what matters most right now.\nPorbaringin: We are not satisfied, Sir.'')\nList of Sisingamangaraja\nThe following is Sisingamangaraja who was once the leader of the dynasty for the Toba Batak people.\n# Sisingamangaraja I\n# Sisingamangaraja II\n# Sisingamangaraja III\n# Sisingamangaraja IV\n# Sisingamangaraja V\n# Sisingamangaraja VI\n# Sisingamangaraja VII\n# Sisingamangaraja VIII\n# Sisingamangaraja IX\n# Sisingamangaraja X\n# Sisingamangaraja XI\n# Sisingamangaraja XII\nSee also\n*Toba Batak people\n*Toba Regency\n*Flag of King Sisingamangaraja\nReferences"
