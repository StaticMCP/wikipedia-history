The fuselage is welded steel tubing with fabric covering. The lower wing design is unusual, passing below the fuselage rather than attaching to it on either side. The first aircraft built used a Ford Falcon 200 CID engine that proved to be too heavy. A Franklin 130&nbsp;hp engine was used next, but the engine went out of production. The final design was changed to accommodate a Lycoming O-235 or O-320 engine.\nOperational history\nThe Foo Fighter was demonstrated for over 30 hours during the one-week Experimental Aircraft Association Convention in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, In 1972.\nSpecifications (Stewart Foo Fighter)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lycoming O-235\n|eng1 type=piston aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=\n|prop blade number=\n|prop name=\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=145\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=135\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=45\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=345\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=1200\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\n* Sport Aviation, Jan 1973, pp 53–55.
