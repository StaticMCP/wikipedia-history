The vice presidency was created by the 2010 amendments made to the Zanzibar Constitution. First Vice President is supposed to come from a political party other than that of the President of Zanzibar. According to the Constitution, the Second Vice President is supposed to be a member of the Zanzibar House of Representatives, and must come from the same political party as the President.\nThe vice presidency could be considered only ceremonial.\nVice presidents of Zanzibar\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!
