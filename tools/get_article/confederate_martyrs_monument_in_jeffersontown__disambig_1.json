Their execution was under Order 59, created by Union General Stephen G. Burbridge, known as \"Butcher Burbridge\" in Kentucky, which called for the execution of four Confederate prisoners for every unarmed Union citizen killed.  The total number of executions performed as a result of this order was fifty. The four soldiers commemorated on the stone were Wilson P. Lilly, Rev. Sherwood Hatley, Lindsey Duke Buckner and M. Blincoe.\nHistory\nThe execution of the four Confederate soldiers was the only significant event of the American Civil War in Jeffersontown.  It was done in retaliation for the extrajudicial murder of a Union soldier on Bardstown Pike, as was common during the Civil War.  The soldiers were shot while confined, and their bodies were dumped in a ditch until their interment here.\nThe monument was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1997, the same day as the Louisville Confederate Monument and the Union Monument in Louisville.  The Confederate Soldiers Martyrs Monument in Eminence, Kentucky, that was also established to honor victims of Order 59, was also established on the same day.\nInscriptions\nThe monument was erected by the Albert Sidney Johnston chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (U.D.C).\nThe inscription on the front reads:\nWilson P.
