Has largely been replaced by PCI Express since the mid 2000s.}}\n, , or  designed to offload a specific task from the , often containing  hardware. A common example is a .}}\nor an input/output port in an .}}\ninto physical memory or other .}}\nspecification developed by Intel in 1995 to improve on previous DE factor standards like the AT form factor.}}\naimed at running artificial neural networks or other machine learning and machine vision algorithms (either training or deployment), e.g. Movidius Myriad 2, TrueNorth, tensor processing unit, etc.}}\ns to discover, configure, manage, and monitor status of the hardware.}}\nB\ndesigned to supersede the  format. Blu-ray Disc is capable of storing about 5 times as much data as a standard DVD. Most computers do not come shipped with Blu-ray drives, however they can be purchased and added as a separate upgrade. Blu-ray won a format war against HD DVD and for a time drives offering both formats were sold.}}\nC\nsynchronised in a   system, also required when  modifies the underlying memory.}}\nto make room for new cache entries to be allocated; controlled by a cache replacement policy. Caused by a  whilst a cache is already full.}}\n, preventing the need to search for that resource in a more distant location (or to repeat a calculation).}}\nwithin a ; the granularity of allocation, refills, eviction; typically 32–128 bytes in size.}}\n, requiring use of the cache policy to allocate and fill this data, and possibly performing evicting other data to make room.}}\ncause cyclical cache misses by evicting data that is needed in the near future.}}\nin an associative cache that specific physical addresses can be mapped to; higher values reduce potential collisions in allocation.}}\nwhere an  is dynamically shifted between  based on demand.}}\nsuch as a .}}\nwhich can be written to once.}}\nwhich can be written to many times.}}\nwhich contains data or music playback and which cannot be written to.}}\nusing a fan to cause air cooling.}}\nof a .}}\nfor attaching hardware devices in a computer.}}\nwhich actually performs arithmetic and logical operations; nearly all CPUs produced since the late 2000s decade have multiple cores (e.g. \"a quad-core processor\").}}\n, dating back from the pre-semiconductor-chip times when the dominant main memory technology was magnetic core memory.}}\nD\nin a  or  servicing data load and store requests, mirroring  (or  for a ).}}\nassociated with a hardware device such as a  or OpenCL compute device, distinct from .}}\n.}}\nwhere each  may only be mapped to one , indexed using the low bits of the . Simple but highly prone to allocation conflicts.}}\nor network interface controller to access  without intervention from the , provided by one or more DMA channels in a system.}}\n, DisplayPort is open source.}}\nfor adding  (hard drives, CD drives, etc.) to a computer.}}\n.}}\nE\nwhich moves information between the internal hardware of a computer system (including the CPU and RAM) and peripheral devices. It is a collection of wires and protocols that allows for the expansion of a computer.}}\n, , or  to add functionality to a computer system via an .}}\nF\n. These were common on computers made prior to 2010.}}\nwhich can be used to connect a  to it.}}\nG\nH\nthat stores data on rapidly rotating rigid (i.e. hard) platters with magnetic surfaces.}}\nwhere program machine code and data are held in separate , more commonly seen in  and digital signal processors.}}\nI\n.}}\nand usually one or more .}}\nin a  or  servicing  requests for program code (or shaders for a ), possibly implementing modified Harvard architecture if program machine code is stored in the same  and physical memory as data.}}\nthat loads the next  referred to by the .}}\nJ\n.}}\nK\n, partially modeled after the typewriter keyboard, which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.}}\nL\nand .}}\n, relying on separate  for all data transfers.}}\nassociated closely with a , e.g. a , , the memory connected to one  in a  or  system, or  (such as ) in an .}}\nM\nin a  (before offline storage) in a computer system. Main memory usually consists of , and is distinct from  and .}}\n(ROM) whose contents are programmed by the  manufacturer.}}\nor some other system (such as an  or ) accesses, reads, and writes  on secondary storage. These patterns have implications for , , and the distribution of workload in shared memory systems.}}\nof a location in a  or other .}}\n, , , etc.}}\n.}}\nconnector.}}\nused for most  with separate non-coherent  and  (assuming that code is immutable), but still mirroring the same  , and possibly sharing higher levels of the same .}}\n(PCB) in many modern computers which provides a physical platform for attaching and arranging many of the crucial components of the system, usually while also providing connection space for .}}\nthat functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface; motion is usually mapped to a cursor in screen space; typically used to control a graphical user interface on a desktop computer or for CAD, etc.}}\nN\n}}\non a single semiconductor chip, connecting ,  hardware, or even  and . Increasingly common in system on a chip designs.}}\nthat can retain the stored data even when not powered, as opposed to .}}\n(RAM) that retains its data when power is turned off.}}\nO\nand provides common services for computer programs, typically loaded by the BIOS on booting.}}\nthat specify which operation to perform.}}\nthat uses laser light or electromagnetic waves near the light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs.}}\nP\n.}}\nhave a manual switch for selecting input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage.}}\nahead of time, either under manual control via prefetch instructions or automatically by a prefetch unit which may use runtime heuristics to predict the future memory access pattern.}}\nwhich produces a text or graphics of documents stored in electronic form, usually on physical print media such as paper or transparencies. The two most common types of printers available are inkjet, which uses ink cartridges, and laser, which uses toner.}}\n, and possibly connected to other processing elements via a network, network on a chip, or cache hierarchy.}}\nstandard designed to replace the older , , and  bus standards.}}\nand  standard that enhances the 32-bit PCI Local Bus for higher bandwidth demanded by servers.}}\nR\n.}}\nS\nused in computers from the early 1980s to the late 1990s.
