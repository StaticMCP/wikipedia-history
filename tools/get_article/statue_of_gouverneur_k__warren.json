Warren by artist Henry Baerer is installed in Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza, in the U.S. state of New York. The bronze sculpture of Warren in military garb rests on a Conway green granite pedestal quarried from Little Round Top. It was cast in 1893, commissioned by the G.K. Warren Post, No. 286, G.A.R. for $10,000, and dedicated on June 26, 1896. The memorial was cleaned in 1938, and conserved in 2001.\nThere is another bronze statue of Warren on Little Round Top.\nReferences"
