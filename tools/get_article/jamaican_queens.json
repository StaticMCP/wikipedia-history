      "text": "# Jamaican Queens\n\nJamaican Queens is an American electronic pop band based in Detroit, Michigan.\nHistory\nAdam Pressley and Ryan Spencer formed Jamaican Queens in Detroit in 2011. Pressley and Spencer had previously performed together in the defunct band Prussia. The duo wrote the songs that would comprise their first album. Jamaican Queens later expanded to include drummer Ryan Clancy. The band name comes from Spencer's love of Jamaican dancehall music.\nIn March 2013, Jamaican Queens released their debut album, Wormfood. Abby Fiscus provided vocals on two tracks, and also appeared on the album's cover. L Magazine ranked Wormfood #3 on its list of the 20 Best Albums of 2013, calling it the year's \"best debut record.\" The band's music has been described as having elements of pop, glam rock and electronic dance music. Some of their influences include David Bowie, the Magnetic Fields, and Three Six Mafia. Spencer has called Morrissey his biggest influence when writing lyrics.\nIn October 2014, the band released a new single, \"Bored + Lazy\". On June 2, 2015, the band's second album, Downers, was released.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Wormfood\n|\n* Released: March 5, 2013\n* Label: self-released\n* Formats: Digital download, CD, vinyl, cassette\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Downers\n|\n* Released: June 2, 2015\n* Label: Freakish Pleasures\n* Formats: Digital download, vinyl, cassette (limited edition)\n|-\n|}\nEPs\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Bored + Lazy\n|\n* Released: February 6, 2015\n* Label: Freakish Pleasures\n* Formats: Digital download, 12\" white label vinyl\n|-\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!|Year\n!|Title\n!|Album\n|-\n|2012\n|\"When You Sleep\"\n* Released: September 11, 2012\n* Formats: Digital download\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|\"Kids Get Away\"\n* Released: June 17, 2013\n* Formats: Digital download\n|rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Wormfood\n|-\n|2014\n|\"Bored + Lazy\"\n* Released: November 4, 2014\n* Formats: Digital download, vinyl\n|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Downers\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://jamaicanqueens.com/ Official website]\n*[http://jamaicanqueens.bandcamp.com/ Bandcamp]"
