The neighborhood is roughly bounded by the Van Wyck Expressway to the west, Parsons Boulevard to the east, Union Turnpike to the north, and Hillside Avenue to the south.\nBriarwood is named for the Briarwood Land Company, headed by Herbert A. O'Brien, who started around 1905 developing the heavily wooded area that gave the neighborhood its name; O'Brien's efforts ended in bankruptcy and development in the area finally started in the 1920s. Today, Briarwood contains a diverse community of Asian-American, White American, Hispanic/Latino, and African American and Afro-Caribbean residents. It is part of Queens Community Board 8.\nGeography\nBriarwood, located northwest of downtown Jamaica, contains one of the highest points in Queens. It is located approximately between the Van Wyck Expressway (Interstate 678) to the west, Union Turnpike to the north, Parsons Boulevard to the east, and Hillside Avenue (NY 25) to the south.\nDemographics\nBriarwood is a diverse community, according to 2010 census data that groups Briarwood with neighboring Jamaica Hills, the population consists of Asian-Americans (14.4%), White (26.7%), Hispanics (29.3%), and African Americans (33.3%). This is a marked change from the post-World War II period (1950s–1980s) when the neighborhood was almost exclusively white, with a large and active Jewish community. Economic activity is mostly confined to small restaurants, delis, markets, and other small businesses.\nThe neighborhood contains housing for middle-class families.\nEducation\nBriarwood is home to the Catholic Archbishop Molloy High School, which moved to Briarwood from the Upper East Side in 1957. Some of the school's more famous alumni are New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, actor David Caruso, former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, NBA professional basketball players Kenny Smith and Kenny Anderson and professional wrestler Colin Cassady.

Van Wyck M.S. 217Q, a middle school of 1,300 students in grades 6–8. The school was established in 1955 and was named after the first mayor of the Greater City of New York, Robert A. Van Wyck, a Tammany Hall lawyer.\nTransportation\nThe neighborhood is served by the IND Queens Boulevard Line of the New York City Subway at the Briarwood station (). In that subway station, there were many paintings done by the students of Archbishop Molloy High School, M.S. 217Q, and [https://www.schools.nyc.gov/schools/Q117 P.S.117Q] during the mid-1980s. They are titled, \"Beautifying Briarwood\". The paintings were removed during a renovation of the station in 2014. The New York City Bus routes serving the neighborhood are the .\nHistory\nThe neighborhood is named for the Briarwood Land Company, headed by Herbert A. O'Brien, which built housing there around 1905 or 1907.   O'Brien decided on the name Briarwood because of the brambles in its thick woods. The Ottilie Orphan Home was built on 148th Street in 1906. The Briarwood Land Company went bankrupt soon afterward, however, and the area was largely empty until 1924 when it was divided and sold at auction. Land went for $300 each for inside residential lots to $2,800 for lots along Queens Boulevard. Over the next four years, several single-family homes were built on the land. Briarwood's first school, P.S. 117, was built in 1927. Additional land was auctioned in 1928.\nOn May 30, 1928, about 500 members of the Klansmen of Queens assembled in the forest of Briarwood. They burned a 50-foot cross, sang songs, and gave speeches. When police officers arrived, the group's leader, Major Emmett J. Smith, said that they had the right to assemble and speak on the land, because they had signed a lease to the land the previous day. The group soon left the area, without any physical violence or arrests having taken place.\nIn 1936, a company called Briarwood Estates, owned by Leon, Morty and A. B. Wolosoff, started building Colonial and old English-style homes north of 84th Drive and west of Main Street. The homes sold for about $5,000, the . After World War II ended, other developers built houses closer to Parsons Boulevard.\nThe United Nations built Parkway Village, a 670-unit development, as housing for its employees around 1947. The development is along Union Turnpike, between Main Street and Parsons Boulevard. Parkway Village is now a co-op and no longer connected to the United Nations.\nOn November 23, 1954, Main Street's extension south to Queens Boulevard opened, and apartments were built in the neighborhood around the same time.\nNotable residents\nNotable residents of Briarwood have included:\n* Ralph Bunche (1904–1971), United States diplomat who received the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for his mediation in Israel in the late 1940s\n* Mario Cuomo (1932–2015) 52nd Governor of New York from 1983–1994\n* Betty Friedan (1921–2006), author of The Feminine Mystique, which sparked the second wave of feminism\n* Steve Hofstetter (born 1979), radio personality and comedian\n* John Kerwin, talk show host of The John Kerwin Show\n* Elyakim Rosenblatt (1933–2019), Orthodox Jewish rabbi, who was the founder and rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Kesser Torah\n* Hanna Rosin (born 1970), journalist and author of ''God's Harvard\n* Steven Weber (born 1961), actor who appeared on television series, including As the World Turns, Wings, iZombie, and NCIS: New Orleans\n* Roy Wilkins (1901–1981), activist in the Civil Rights Movement in the United States from the 1930s to the 1970s\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
