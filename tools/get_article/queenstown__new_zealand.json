It is the seat and largest town in the Queenstown-Lakes District.\nThe town is on the northwestern edge of Lake Wakatipu, a long, thin, S-shaped lake formed by glacial processes, and has views of nearby mountains such as The Remarkables, Cecil Peak, Walter Peak and, just above the town, Ben Lomond and Queenstown Hill. Queenstown is known for its tourism businesses, especially adventure and ski tourism.\nToponymy\nTāhuna, the te reo name for Queenstown, means 'shallow bay'.}}\nThere was then a public meeting to name the township on the lake in January 1863 (probably the weekend of the 3rd and 4th) in which the town was officially given the name of Queenstown in reference to Ireland's Queenstown. By 9–10 January 1863, the town was called Queenstown in several reports written by a correspondent in the Otago Witness on 5 and 6 January.\nHistory\nMāori settlement and presence\nThe area was discovered and first settled by Māori. Kāi Tahu say that the lake was dug by the Waitaha  ancestor, Rākaihautū, with his kō (digging stick) named Tūwhakaroria. After arriving at Whakatū Nelson in the waka Uruao, Rākaihautū divided his crew into two. He led one group through the interior of Te Waipounamu, digging the freshwater lakes of the island. After digging the lakes Hāwea, Wānaka, and Whakatipu Waimāori, he travelled through the Greenstone and Hollyford valleys before finally digging Whakatipu Waitai (Lake McKerrow).\nThe first non-Māori to see Lake Wakatipu was European Nathanael Chalmers who was guided by Reko, the chief of the Tuturau, over the Waimea Plains and up the Mataura River in September 1853. Evidence of stake nets, baskets for catching eels, spears and ashes indicated the Glenorchy area was visited by Māori. It is likely Ngāi Tahu Māori visited Queenstown en route to collect Pounamu (greenstone). The tribe of Kāti Māmoe occupied a settlement called Te Kirikiri Pa where the Queenstown Gardens are today, but by the time European migrants arrived in the 1860s this settlement was no longer being used.\nEuropean settlement\nEuropean explorers William Gilbert Rees and Nicholas von Tunzelmann were the first non-Māori to settle the area. In 1860, Rees established a high country farm where Queenstown's town centre now stands, but the discovery of gold in the Arrow River in 1862 encouraged him to convert his wool shed into a hotel named the Queen's Arms, now known as Eichardt's.\nMany Queenstown streets bear names from the gold mining era (such as Camp Street) and some historic buildings remain. William's Cottage, the Lake Lodge of Ophir (now Artbay Gallery), Queenstown Police Station, and St Peter's Anglican Church lie close together in a designated historic precinct.\n1999 flooding\nThere was a severe weather event in the South Island in November 1999, bringing torrential rainfall in the catchments of Lake Wakatipu. The level of the lake rose from 310.5&nbsp;m to 312.77&nbsp;m, leading to the most severe flooding in Queenstown's recorded history. Properties in central Queenstown close to the lakeshore were flooded up to 1&nbsp;m deep, causing major damage. Total insurance claims were around $50 million. Properties in Glenorchy and Kingston were also flooded, and the road from Queenstown to Glenorchy was damaged by washouts.\nGeography\nQueenstown is on the shore of Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand's third-largest lake by surface area. The town is close to the lake's northeastern bend, at which point a small arm, the Frankton Arm, joins the lake with its principal outflow, the Kawarau River. The centre of the town is on the north shore at the point where the Frankton Arm links with the main body of the lake, but also extends to the major suburb of Frankton at the eastern end of the arm, and across to Kelvin Heights on the Kelvin Peninsula, which forms the Frankton Arm's southern shore.\nThe town is at a relatively low altitude for a ski and snowboarding centre, at  above sea level at the lake shore, but is nestled among mountains, most notably the scenic attraction of The Remarkables, to the town's southeast. Below the lake lies the deep Kawarau Gorge, and there are nearby plains suitable for agriculture and viticulture. Queenstown lies close to the heart of the Central Otago wine region.\nSuburbs\nCentral Queenstown contains many businesses, apartments and homes but is near many suburbs or large areas of housing: Fernhill, Sunshine Bay, Queenstown Hill, Goldfield Heights, Marina Heights, Kelvin Heights, Arthurs Point and Frankton.\nJust outside Queenstown are the areas of: Arrowtown, Closeburn, Dalefield, Gibbston, Jack's Point, Hanley's Farm, Hayes Creek, Lake Hayes Estate, Shotover Country and Quail Rise.\nClimate\nBecause of its relatively moderate altitude (310 metres) and high mountain surroundings, Queenstown has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb). Summer has long warm days with temperatures that can reach 30&nbsp;°C while winters are cold with temperatures often in single digits and frequent snowfall, although there is no permanent snow cover during the year. As with the rest of Central Otago, Queenstown lies within the rain shadow of the Southern Alps, but being closer to the west coast the town is more susceptible to rain-bearing fronts than nearby Cromwell, Wānaka and Alexandra. The hottest recorded temperature in Queenstown is  and the coldest is , while for Queenstown Airport the hottest is  and the coldest is .\n|date=August 2010\n|source 2 = Weather Spark\n}}\n}}\nFlood risk\nLow-lying areas of Queenstown close to Lake Wakatipu are at risk of flooding because during heavy rain and snowmelt, the lake's outflows via the Kawarau River are less than the inflows and the lake level can rise significantly. Further, the outflow down the Kawarau River is impeded by the large delta of the Shotover River – a major tributary. A narrow gorge also restricts flow in the Kawarau river. As a consequence, Queenstown has been flooded several times, and there is an ongoing risk of flooding in low-lying areas. As the lake level rises, backflow through the town's stormwater system leads to flooding in some streets when the lake level reaches 311.3 m. This has occurred around 20 times since 1878. In any year, there is a 13% chance that the lake will reach this level. In any ten-year period, there is a 75% chance of an event that exceeds this level.\nDemography\nQueenstown is described by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area with an area of . It had an urban population of  making it the 24th-largest urban area in New Zealand. In 2016, Queenstown overtook Oamaru to become the second-largest urban area in Otago, behind Dunedin. Prior to 2023, the Queenstown urban area as defined by Statistics New Zealand didn't include Lake Hayes or Arthurs Point, which are contiguous with Queenstown but were designated as separate urban areas.\nBefore the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, the Queenstown urban area had a population of 13,539 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,205 people (19.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 3,111 people (29.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 4,254 households. There were 7,089 males and 6,447 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.1 males per female, with 1,341 people (9.9%) aged under 15 years, 4,887 (36.1%) aged 15 to 29, 6,264 (46.3%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,041 (7.7%) aged 65 or older.\nEthnicities were 71.2% European/Pākehā, 4.5% Māori, 1.2% Pacific peoples, 17.8% Asian, and 10.5% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities).\nThe proportion of people born overseas was 58.3%, compared with 27.1% nationally.\nAlthough some people objected to giving their religion, 58.5% had no religion, 29.1% were Christian, 2.8% were Hindu, 0.6% were Muslim, 1.7% were Buddhist and 3.4% had other religions.\nOf those at least 15 years old, 3,234 (26.5%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 759 (6.2%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,692 people (13.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 9,165 (75.1%) people were employed full-time, 1,263 (10.4%) were part-time, and 138 (1.1%) were unemployed.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Individual statistical areas in 2018\n|-\n!Name !!

Queenstown is rated the least affordable place in New Zealand to buy a property, overtaking Auckland at the start of 2017. In December 2016 the average house price in the Queenstown area rose to $1 million NZD. Between 2016 and 2019, average rents in Queenstown rose progressively; reaching 10.8% in 2016, 16% in 2017, and 7.4% in 2018, and 9.6% in 2019. 2018 census data showed 27 percent of Queenstown homes were marked as unoccupied.\nDuring the early 2020s, Queenstown experienced a decline in rental housing. Between December 2021 and December 2022, the online auction platform Trade Me reported a 49% decline in rental listings across the Queenstown-Lakes District. Similarly, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) reported that the number of rental houses in the District had dropped by 100 between November 2021 and November 2022. Despite a building boom in 2022, Stuff reported that 27% of homes in the Lakes District were unoccupied since their owners preferred to use them as holiday homes or short-term accommodation rather than rentals By November 2022, Radio New Zealand reported that the average home in the Lakes District cost NZ$1.7 million while a three-bedroom rental cost a minimum of NZ$800 per week and a single bedroom rental NZ$500 or more per week.\nIn October 2022, Environment Minister David Parker confirmed that the New Zealand Government had fast-tracked the Te Pūtahi project at Lake Hayes Estate to build 748 more homes, a public transport area, and a possible school.\nBy early 2023, Stuff, Radio New Zealand, and The New Zealand Herald reported that a shortage of rental housing had forced many workers and businesspeople to sleep in cars, couches, tents, visitor hostels, and others to leave the town. In addition, the housing shortage had contributed to a worker shortage among local businesses since they had trouble attracting foreign visa workers or those from outside Queenstown. The Herald also reported that some workers in Queenstown were asking local rental agents if they could stay in vacant properties being sold. In late March 2023, 100 people participated in a protest at Queenstown's waterfront to raise awareness of the resort town's acute rental housing shortage. The protest was attended by National Party Southland electorate Member of Parliament Joseph Mooney and Queenstown Lakes District Councillor Craig Ferguson.\nEmployment\nThe area’s growth rate is one of the fastest in the country with the population growing 7.1% from 2015 to 2016 in a 12-month period. Most jobs in Queenstown are tourism- or accommodation-related. Employment growth was also the highest of any area in New Zealand at 10.3% in the March 2016 year.\nRetail\nQueenstown has a tourist-focused shopping area, centred around the Queenstown Mall. The public pedestrian street opened in 1990, and includes Reading Cinemas.\nO'Connells Shopping Centre also opened in 1990, and was upgraded from 2020 through 2022.\nIn 1986, Queenstown was granted an exemption to allow shops to open every day of the year except Christmas Day, Easter Sunday and before 12 noon on Anzac Day (at the time, shops in New Zealand were required to close on Sundays and public holidays). The exemption was extended in 1990 allow shops to open on Easter Sunday. The exemption applies to all shops within a  radius of the intersection of Camp Street and Ballarat Street (the location of the Queenstown post office in 1986), and makes Queenstown and the Lake Wakatipu basin one of only three areas in New Zealand where shops may open on Good Friday (the other two are Picton and Paihia).\nGovernment\nLocal\nQueenstown lies in the Queenstown-Lakes District territorial authority. It is also part of the Otago region, administered by the Otago Regional Council.\nNational\nFor the New Zealand Parliament, Queenstown is covered by one general electorate, Southland, and one Maori electorate, Te Tai Tonga. As of the 2023 general election, Southland is represented by Joseph Mooney (National) and Te Tai Tonga is represented by Tākuta Ferris (Te Pāti Māori).\nTourism\n]]\nTourism is a large component of the Queenstown economy, particularly outdoor and adventure tourism activities including skiing and snowboarding, jet boating, whitewater rafting, bungy jumping, mountain biking, skateboarding, tramping, paragliding, sky diving and fly fishing.\nQueenstown is a major centre for snow sports in New Zealand, with four main mountain ski fields: Cardrona Alpine Resort, Coronet Peak, The Remarkables and Treble Cone. Cross country skiing is also available at the Waiorau Snow Farm, near Cardrona village.\nA heritage steamship, the twin screw coal fired steamer TSS Earnslaw operates on Lake Wakatipu.\nQueenstown lies close to the centre of the world's southernmost wine region, the Central Otago wine region, which has a growing international reputation for its quality Pinot Noir. The Two Paddocks vineyard is owned by internationally known New Zealand actor Sam Neill, and neighbouring, historic Arrowtown features restaurants and bars.\nOther tourist activities include Ben Lomond, a nearby mountain with a panoramic outlook on Bob's Peak, and its Skyline Queenstown gondola. Queenstown hosts the Kiwi Park wildlife sanctuary, and Paradise is a nearby rural location known for its paradise duck population (Tadorna variegata). The Queenstown Trail and Skippers Road are popular walking, running, and mountain-biking tracks.\nStar-gazing and astrotourism opportunities are available, with two certified dark sky reserves in the district. The Kawarau Gibbston Dark Sky Park is located along the Kawarau River valley between Queenstown and Cromwell, and centred on the small settlement of Gibbston. A much larger dark sky reserve was certified in 2025 as the Tāhuna Glenorchy Dark Sky Sanctuary. This covers an area of  at the head of Lake Wakatipu, and includes a large portion of Mount Aspiring National Park. There are no visible light domes in any direction from within the sanctuary because the light dome from Queenstown is shielded by the mountains. One of the attractions of the star-gazing in the Queenstown region is that it is amongst the few places on land where both the core of the Milky Way and the Aurora Australis can be seen.\nCulture\nFestivals\nQueenstown has many festivals. Examples include the ten-day Bike Festival in January, Winter Festival (June), Jazz Festival (October), and Winter Pride (August–September) the largest winter pride event in the Southern Hemisphere.\nLocations for television and film\nJane Campion's six-part drama mystery Top of the Lake was shot during 2012 for pay TV release in 2013. The lakes of the Wakatipu appear ominous and the Southern Alps spectacular. The main location is Moke Lake and scenes were shot on Lower Beach Street and Coronation Drive, and at a supermarket and bottle store on Shotover Street.\nIn 2010, Cycle 14 of ''America's Next Top Model was in part filmed in Queenstown and was won by Krista White. Raina Hein was runner-up.\nQueenstown and the surrounding area contain many locations used in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, including Paradise, near Glenorchy at the head of Lake Wakatipu.\nQueenstown became popular in South Asia after the release of Bollywood blockbuster Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, which was partially shot there. Queenstown featured for 17 minutes in I Hate Luv Storys, a 2010 Bollywood romantic comedy. Queenstown and the surrounding areas were also used in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Mee-Shee: The Water Giant was shot in Queenstown in 2005, and released to DVD the same year. Queenstown was also used to film most of the 1988 film The Rescue. Queenstown was the base for filming the 1988 film Willow.\nFilming of the 1981 film Race for the Yankee Zephyr'' took place in and around Queenstown, the area's first major motion picture production.\nA 1989 TV Commercial for the Toyota Hilux starring Barry Crump and Lloyd Scott in which the two drive off the cliff was filmed at nearby Queenstown Hill.\nThe first and last episodes of the fifth season of The Mole were filmed in Queenstown.\nThe 2017 Filipino drama film Northern Lights was shot entirely on location, with Queenstown substituting for Alaska.\nIn 2017 the Korean variety show Running Man shot an episode in Queenstown.\nThe 2020 crime drama One Lane Bridge and the 2024 crime drama A Remarkable Place to Die were filmed in Queenstown. The One Lane Bridge series focuses on events that take place at a bridge over the Dart River / Te Awa Whakatipu.\nSports and recreation\n* Queenstown Events Centre and stadium\n* Paragliding or Hang Gliding\n* Aerobatics with the Wakatipu Aero Club at Queenstown Airport at Frankton\n* Golf at Millbrook Resort, Jack's Point, or Queenstown Golf Club\n* Disc golf at the Queenstown Gardens\n* Tennis at the Queenstown Tennis Club in Queenstown Gardens\n* Cricket at the Queenstown Cricket Club\n* Netball at the Wakatipu Netball Centre\n* Rugby league and Rugby union at the Wakatipu Rugby League Club Memorial Park\n* Touch rugby during the summer season\n* Scuba diving or snorkeling in a river, bridge wreck, or in Lake Wakatipu\n* Adventure sport, canyon-swing, parachute, jetboat, bungy jump, river-surf, or kitesurf\nIn the area\n* Central Otago region\n* Central Otago wine region\n* History of the Otago gold rush\n* Fiordland National Park, including the Milford Road and Homer Tunnel to Milford Sound / Piopiotahi, as well as the Fiordland Lakes and Doubtful Sound / Patea\n* Tramping track near Glenorchy\n* Routeburn, one of the New Zealand Great Walks\nEducation\nPrimary schools\nQueenstown Primary School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of  as of .\nSt Joseph's School is a co-educational Catholic state-integrated primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of .\nThere are also two primary schools in Frankton and a school in Shotover Country.\nSecondary schools\nWakatipu High School, a state secondary school for Year 9 to 13 students, is located in Frankton.\nTertiary education\nSouthern Institute of Technology (SIT), based in Invercargill, has a campus in Queenstown.\nQueenstown Resort College is a tertiary education provider focussing on tourism. The college actively supports events for international travel agents.\nACE Wakatipu has a community focus, and provides links to many adult training opportunities.\nChurches\nSaint Andrew's church\nSaint Andrew's Presbyterian church was completed in 1968 to replace the previous church, which was sold and demolished to reuse the land. The church is designed to seat 350 parishioners. The Presbyterian church has been active in the Wakatipu area since 1865.\nSaint Peter's church\nSaint Peter's Anglican church was built in 1932 for a cost of 2862 pounds and consecrated on 23 November 1932. It replaced the previous wooden church, which was built in 1863.\nSaint Joseph's church\nSaint Joseph's Catholic church was built in 1898. It replaced Queenstown's first Catholic church, built in 1863. It is built from schist sourced from Arthur's Point. Built in the Gothic Revival style, it was designed by the architect Francis Petre. It is a category two historic place.\nFile:Queenstown Catholic Church 27.jpg|Saint Joseph's Catholic Church\nFile:Queenstown Anglican church 27.jpg|Saint Peter's Anglican Church\nFile:St Peter's Anglican Church (Queenstown, NZ) (5).jpg|Interior of Saint Peter's Anglican Church\nFile:Queenstown Presbyterian Church 27.jpg|Saint Andrew's Presbyterian Church\nInfrastructure\nTransport\nQueenstown is accessible by road and air but not rail (like Kaitaia, Taupō and Nelson).\nThe primary road access to the Queenstown area is via  (SH6), from Cromwell through the Kawarau Gorge to Frankton, where a 9&nbsp;km spur (SH6A) leads to the CBD and connects with the Glenorchy Road. SH6 continues south, crossing the Kawarau river before heading down Lake Wakatipu's eastern side to Kingston before crossing the provincial boundary and emerging on the plains of Southland, terminating in Invercargill. A difficult road over the Crown Range leads to Cardrona skifield and Wānaka, and is New Zealand's highest paved public road pass.\nQueenstown Airport takes flights from Australia by Air New Zealand, Qantas, Virgin Australia and Jetstar and has destinations that include Brisbane, Gold Coast, Melbourne and Sydney (the frequency is much increased over the ski season and during summer). Domestic flights fly to Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington. Queenstown Airport is New Zealand's busiest helicopter base and the fourth-busiest airport by passenger traffic. It is also heavily used for tourist 'flightseeing', especially to Milford Sound / Piopiotahi and Aoraki / Mount Cook, using both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.\nMany bus services (mainly for package tours) operate to destinations like the Milford Sound, which entails a return trip of approximately 12 hours. Scenic flights are available to and from Milford Sound. A return flight, including a two-hour cruise, takes about four hours.\nPublic transport\nPublic bus services are operated under the Orbus branding by the Otago Regional Council, Go Bus Transport, and Ritchies Transport. A ferry service from the Kelvin Heights suburb to central Queenstown is also operated by Orbus. Bee Cards replaced GoCards on local buses on 15 September 2020. Bee Cards are planned to be phased out in favour of Motu Move in early 2026.\nLong distance daily services to and from Invercargill, Dunedin, and Christchurch are also operated by InterCity, Ritches also operate daily services around Otago.\nAs of 2025 Southern Infrastructure and Doppelmayr are developing plans for a gondola service to connect Downtown Queenstown and Frankton/Queenstown Airport. The first stage of the project could open in late 2028. Another company, Whoosh has also proposed its own service (in partnership with Alistair Porter) for the Remarkables Park.\nUtilities\nIn September 2023, there was an outbreak of illness caused by cryptosporidium in Queenstown, with most cases in the central business area and affecting people under 40. Health officials could not immediately link the cases or identify the source of the outbreak, and called the outbreak very unusual. A \"boil water\" notice was issued for all water supplies across Queenstown. The regulator Taumata Arowai issued a compliance order to the Queenstown Lakes District Council for one of its water treatment plants because it did not have a protozoa barrier to prevent cryptosporidium entering the water supply.\nElectricity distribution in Queenstown is the responsibility of two companies, Dunedin-based Aurora Energy and Invercargill-based Powernet. Electricity is supplied from Transpower's national grid at its substation in Frankton, which in turn is fed by a twin-circuit 110,000-volt line from Transpower's Cromwell substation.\nQueenstown was one New Zealand's last towns to rely on a manual telephone exchange, requiring all calls to be connected by an operator. By the early 1980s, the outdated system was overloaded, causing frequent delays—sometimes over an hour for toll calls—frustrating locals and businesses, particularly in the tourism sector. Despite long-standing promises of an upgrade, progress was slow, prompting growing concerns and calls for urgent action. Temporary measures, such as additional switchboards and staff, provided limited relief. After years of setbacks, Queenstown’s long-awaited automatic exchange finally opened in 1986. Fibre to the premises was rolled out in Queenstown as part of the Fifth National Government's Ultra-Fast Broadband programme, with the rollout completed in July 2016.\nNotable people\n*Sam Neill (born 1947), actor, has a home in Queenstown\n*Tim Bevan (born 1957), film producer, was born in Queenstown\n*Jaime Passier-Armstrong (born 1981), actress, was born in Queenstown\n*Jane Taylor, lawyer and current Chair of New Zealand Post, lives in Queenstown\n*Kim Dotcom, internet entrepreneur\nSister cities\n* Aspen, Colorado, United States\n* Hangzhou, Zhejiang\n*Hikimi, Shimane (now a part of Masuda), Japan\nSee also\n* Tourism in New Zealand\nBibliography\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.qldc.govt.nz/ Queenstown Lakes District Council]\n* [http://www.queenstownnz.co.nz/ Queenstown Tourism official site]"
