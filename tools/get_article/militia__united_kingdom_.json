Militia units were repeatedly raised in Great Britain during the Victorian and Edwardian eras for internal security duties and to defend against external invasions. The British Militia was transformed into the Special Reserve under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7. c. 9), which integrated all militia formations into the British Army.\n19th century\nA separate voluntary Local Militia was created in 1808 before being disbanded in 1816.\nBy 1813 the British Army was experiencing a shortage of manpower to maintain their battalions at full strength. Some consideration was given to recruiting foreign nationals; however, on 4 November 1813 a bill was introduced to Parliament to allow Militia volunteers to serve in Europe. In the event only three battalions were raised, and these were sent to serve under Henry Bayly. On 12 April 1814 they arrived in Bordeaux, where they were attached to the 7th Division.\nAfter the Napoleonic Wars, the Militia fell into disuse, although regimental colonels and adjutants continued to appear in the Army List. Whilst muster rolls were still prepared during the 1820s, the element of compulsion was abandoned. For example, the City Of York Militia & Muster Rolls run to 1829. They used a pre-printed form with a printer's date of Sept 1828.\nThe Militia was revived by the Militia Act 1852 (15 & 16 Vict. c. 50), enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the militia ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). It was intended to be seen as an alternative to the army. Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then the recruits would return to civilian life but report for 21–28 days training per year. The full army pay during training and a financial retainer thereafter made a useful addition to the men's civilian wage. Of course, many saw the annual camp as the equivalent of a paid holiday. The militia thus appealed to agricultural labourers, colliers and the like, men in casual occupations, who could leave their civilian job and pick it up again. The militia was also a significant source of recruits for the Regular Army, where men had received a taste of army life. An officer's commission in the militia was often a 'back door' route to a Regular Army commission for young men who could not obtain one through purchase or gain entry to Sandhurst.\nUnder the act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time service in three circumstances:\n# 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'.\n# 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'.\n# 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'.\nUntil 1852 the militia were an entirely infantry force, but the Militia Act 1852 introduced Militia Artillery units whose role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery for active service. Some of these units were converted from existing infantry militia regiments, others were newly raised. In 1877 the militia of Anglesey and Monmouthshire were converted to Royal Engineers.\nUp to 1855, the Home Office administered the Militia and Yeomanry, until such time as they were 'embodied'. The resultant 'confusion and inconvenience' it caused, from 1854 to 1855, resulted in being administered exclusively by the War Office from that time onwards.\nUnder the reforms introduced by Secretary of State for War Hugh Childers in 1881, the remaining militia infantry regiments were redesignated as numbered battalions of regiments of the line, ranking after the two regular battalions. Typically, an English, Welsh or Scottish regiment would have two militia battalions (the 3rd and 4th) and Irish regiments three (numbered 3rd – 5th).\nThe militia must not be confused with the volunteer units created in a wave of enthusiasm in the second half of the nineteenth century. In contrast with the Volunteer Force, and the similar Yeomanry Cavalry, they were considered rather plebeian. Volunteer units appealed to better-off recruits as, unlike the Militia which engaged a recruit for a term of service, a volunteer could quit his corps with fourteen days notice, except while embodied for war or training with the regular forces. Volunteer Corps required recruits to fund their own equipment, however, effectively barring those with low incomes.\n| type = Act\n| parliament = Parliament of the United Kingdom\n| long_title = An Act to consolidate and amend certain Laws relating to the Militia of the United Kingdom.\n| year = 1875\n| citation = 38 & 39 Vict. c. 69\n| territorial_extent = United Kingdom\n| royal_assent = 11 August 1875\n| commencement = 11 August 1875\n| repeal_date = 1 January 1883\n| amends =\n| replaces = |Militia Act 1859|Militia Act 1869|Militia Act 1870}}\n| repealing_legislation = Militia Act 1882\n| related_legislation =\n| status = Repealed\n| original_text = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/38-39/69/contents/enacted\n| collapsed = yes\n}}\nThe  (38 & 39 Vict. c. 69) consolidated enactments related to the militia.\n| type = Act\n| parliament = Parliament of the United Kingdom\n| long_title = An Act to consolidate the Acts relating to the Militia.\n| year = 1882\n| citation = 45 & 46 Vict. c. 49\n| territorial_extent = United Kingdom\n| royal_assent = 18 August 1882\n| commencement = 1 January 1883\n| repeal_date = 20 April 1980\n| amends =\n| replaces =\n| amendments =\n| repealing_legislation = Reserve Forces Act 1980\n| related_legislation =\n| status = Repealed\n| collapsed = yes\n}}\nThe  (45 & 46 Vict. c. 49) consolidated enactments related to the militia.\nThe Special Reserve\nThe militia was transformed into the Special Reserve by the military reforms of Haldane in the reforming post 1906 Liberal government. In 1908 the militia infantry battalions were redesignated as \"reserve\" and a number were amalgamated or disbanded. Altogether, 101 infantry battalions, 33 artillery regiments and two engineer regiments of special reservists were formed.\nIn contrast with the soldier serving in the militia, those who served under Special Reserve terms of service had an obligation to serve overseas, as stipulated in paragraph 54. The standards of medical fitness were lower than for recruits to the regular infantry. The possibility of enlisting in the army under Regular terms of service were facilitated under paragraph 38, one precondition was that the recruit 'fulfils the necessary physical requirements.'\nA further contrast was the replacement of several weeks of preliminary training with six months of full time training upon enlisting in the Special Reserve.\nUpon mobilisation, the special reserve units would be formed at the depot and continue training while guarding vulnerable points in Britain. The special reserve units remained in Britain throughout the First World War, but their rank and file did not, since the object of the special reserve was to supply drafts of replacements for the overseas units of the regiment.\nThe Special Reserve reverted to its militia designation in 1921, then to Supplementary Reserve in 1924, though the units were effectively placed in \"suspended animation\" until disbanded in 1953.\nThe Militiamen\nThe term militiaman was briefly revived in 1939. In the aftermath of the Munich Crisis Leslie Hore-Belisha, Secretary of State for War, wished to introduce a limited form of conscription, an unheard of concept in peacetime. It was thought that calling the conscripts 'militiamen' would make this more acceptable, as it would render them distinct from the rest of the army. Only single men aged 20–22 were to be conscripted (given a free suit of civilian clothes as well as a uniform), and after six months full-time training would be discharged into the reserve. The first intake was called up, but the Second World War was declared soon afterwards, and the militiamen lost their identity in the rapidly expanding army.\nModern survivals\nTwo units still maintain their militia designation in the British Army, in the Army Reserve. These are the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers (formed in 1539) and the Jersey Field Squadron (The Royal Militia Island of Jersey) (formed in 1337).\nSee also\n*Lord-lieutenant\n*Fencibles\n*Home Guard\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}"
