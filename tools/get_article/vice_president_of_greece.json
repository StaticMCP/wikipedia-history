Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos, the self-appointed Regent of Greece, abolished the Greek monarchy in June 1973 and declared himself President. Along with the new office of president, the office of vice president was also established and General Odysseas Angelis, then Chief of the Armed Forces, was chosen to occupy the seat.\nAfter less than six months, the Papadopoulos regime was ousted by hardliner Brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis, who installed General Phaedon Gizikis as the new (figurehead and not executive) president. The office of vice president, however, was abolished together with the 1973 Constitution following the regime change, and thus Angelis remains to date the only holder of the office of Vice President of Greece.\nSee also\n*Deputy Prime Minister of Greece\nReferences"
