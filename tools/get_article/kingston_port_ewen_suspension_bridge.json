It connects the City of Kingston to the north, with the village of Port Ewen to the south. Completed in 1921, it was the final link in New York's first north-south highway on the West Shore of the Hudson, and is considered an important engineering accomplishment associated with the development of early motoring.\nThe bridge has a very hilly approach on the north side and crosses over a small island in the creek. It forms a dramatic backdrop to the Rondout-West Strand Historic District in Kingston, to the east.\nConstruction\nConstruction began in 1916, with the intent to replacing the Rondout Creek chain ferry named Skillypot, known for sporadic service. The Skillypot was named after a derivative of a Dutch word for tortoise, schildpad.  The bridge was designed by the firms of Holton D. Robinson and John A. Roebling's Sons Company, with Holton D. Robinson, Daniel E. Moran, William Yates listed as chief engineers Construction was hampered by local political and financial difficulties, as well as material shortages caused by entry by the United States into World War I, and was suspended until 1920.\nWhen construction resumed, David B. Steinman was among the engineering staff, acting as Assistant Engineer. Terry & Tench was the contracting company assigned to build the bridge; remaining completion took about a year. Noteworthy was the work of Danish-American master welder Catherine Nelson, employed by Weehawken Welding Company, who welded together the cable splices that made up the longest length of the cable span. While commonplace during World War II, women working in the trades was opposed by men in the 1920's. Ten thousand people attended the bridge's dedication on November 2, 1921.\nRenovation\nThe bridge was closed on September 25, 2020, for a three-year reconstruction project estimated to cost $44.6&nbsp;million.  The final cost of the project was $60 million according to Governor Hochul's office.  The construction was completed and the bridge was reopened in July 2024.\nPop Culture References\nThe Kingston–Port Ewen Suspension Bridge was featured in the 2017 film Growing Up Smith, a coming-of-age story set in 1979 about an Indian-American boy navigating life in a small American town. The bridge serves as a backdrop in several scenes.\nThe bridge also appears in the final episode of the HBO drama “The Undoing“, with Nicole Kidman, Hugh, Grant, and Donald Sutherland.\nThe bridge appears in several scenes in the Apple TV+ series Severance.\nSee also\n* List of crossings of Rondout Creek\n* List of bridges and tunnels on the National Register of Historic Places in New York\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Ulster County, New York\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010211130333/http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/kingston/k22.htm description] from National Park Service website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000919213152/http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/kingston/buildings/bridge2.jpg ca. 1922 image] from National Park Service website\n* [https://www.wurtsstreetbridgefilm.com/ History and 2020-2024 renovation] The Bridge Across Time: The Renovation of the century old Wurts Street Bridge"
