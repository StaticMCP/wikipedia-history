This has pushed banks to revise rates on loans and deposits downwards, evidenced by dropping credit and deposit rates from 14,7% to 10,7% and from 9,7% to 5,3% in 2016-2017 respectively.\nSee also\n* List of banks in Armenia\n* Economy of Armenia\n* Central Bank of Armenia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221858/http://bankinginfo.org/central_bank/armenia.htm Armenia Banking Information]\n*[http://www.hsbc.am/1/2/en/home HSBC Bank Armenia website]"
