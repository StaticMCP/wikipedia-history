Abu al-As was the nephew of Khadija (Muhammad’s first wife) and a prosperous trader in Mecca. When Muhammad received the prophet hood, Abu al-As declined to embrace Islam. But he also refused to divorce Zaynab at the insistence of the Quraysh.\nAbul-As escaped and took refuge in Zaynab’s house. He begged her to ask Muhammad for the restitution of his wealth. Muhammad recommended, but without coercion, that the people do that. They immediately gave the man back all his wealth.\nAbu al-As captors immediately agreed to release him from their captivity. Abu al-As was greatly moved by this generosity; returned to Mecca, completed his affairs there, then returned to Medina and accepted Islam. He then rejoined his wife Zaynab.\nThe verse relating to prohibition of marriage between women Muslims and disbelievers had not been revealed then according to Muslim scholar Saifur Rahman al Mubarakpuri. In this expedition the whole caravan was plundered, and a large store of silver was captured, some of those who guarded the Caravan were taken prisoner.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nNotes"
