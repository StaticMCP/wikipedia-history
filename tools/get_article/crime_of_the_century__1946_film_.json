Ford was assigned as director by Republic Pictures after his directorial debut The Tiger Woman.\nPlot\nHank Rogers is released from prison after serving time for a minor crime. He arranges to meet his brother Jim, a newspaper reporter, in a bar, where Hank is distracted by attractive Audrey Brandon. His brother doesn't show up, and at Jim's apartment, Audrey drugs his drink, rendering Hank unconscious.\nWith his brother missing, Hank tracks him to the mansion of a wealthy industrialist, whose daughter Margaret Waldham eyes him suspiciously. Hank ultimately finds that the industrialist is dead, but being kept on ice by Margaret and her cronies, who also have made Jim their prisoner.
