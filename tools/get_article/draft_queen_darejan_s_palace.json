Joseph Korghanashvili (საჩინო), the financial-administrative manager and steward of the Queen, was crucial in the construction of the palace. In fact, as reported in a 1797 decree, Queen Darejan award him with an oil factory in Avlabari for his work in the construction of the complex. The palace withstood the 1795 Battle of Krtsanisi, conducted by the Iranian Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Following 1803 Queen Darejan's  deportation to Russia, the Russian exarch Teopilakte acquired the complex. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the complex was returned to Georgian Patriarchate.\nArchitecture\nThe structure was built using a mix of river stones and bricks in Georgian style. The arrangement of the stones in the wall structure creates stripes horizontally and vertically, creating a patterns that resembles a vine.\nThe palace is mostly famous for its balcony, which offers a panoramic view over the city. The structure of the balcony is round and is made from carved wood in a light blue colour. In the past, the balcony served a practical purpose, since its buttress allows to have control over the surroundings of the complex. The lower wall with arched niches and arrow slits also served a defensive purpose, while being decorative.\nReferences"
