When word of this reached Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah, the commanded his nephew Sikandar Khan Ghazi to lead an army against the Raja. Sikandar marched with his soldiers towards the low-lying hills of Sylhet via Mymensingh. Govinda appointed Chakrapani as his commander-in-chief. The army was confronted by Govinda's skilful archery. Govinda's army was noted as Bengal's first army which practised the skillful art of archery. The Bengali army, inexperienced in the foreign terrain which consisted of many low-lying hills and valleys, were brought to utter shame by Govinda's archers and had no option but to retreat back to Muslim Bengal to avoid casualties.\nThe Sultan was not happy at all with the result of the first battle and decided that the army should train and prepare before readying themselves for another battle. In the second expedition, Sikandar took the same recognised route through Mymensingh. As the army marched through the hills, a storm took place. Due to heavy rainfall and flooding, nearly half of the army died by the time Sikandar reached Govinda. They were defeated once again and Sikandar retreated back to Bengal for a second time, humiliated by what had occurred.\nFiroz Shah then turned to his Sipah Salar (commander-in-chief) Syed Nasiruddin as he realised that this undertaking was much bigger than he anticipated and he would need a larger and more skilled army. The two armies decided to attack together but it ended in failure due to Govinda's superior military strategy. Govinda's family rejoiced over the three consecutive victories and his aunt Apurna, the queen-mother and wife of the previous Raja Govardhan, celebrated by building a large 20-acre water tank in Ambarkhana known as Rajar Mar Dighi.\nIn the meantime, a religious scholar and mistic Saint from Yamen arrived in the palace of Firuz Shah with his companions. He decided to join the army of Nasiruddin. It made\nNasiruddin very happy. They returned to Bengal where they heard that Govinda and his army blocked the crossing of the river Borak (present Surma river) before arrival of the famous saint Shah Jalal, as well as his companions who at this point numbered around 360. There were no boats available to cross the river. Also the river bank was spread over with rice as Govinda knew that Muslims don't walking over any food. Shah Jalal was a pair of pigeon by another Indian saint Nizam Uddin Awliya as a gift. Shaj Jalal asked his region to clear out a way to the river by eating the rice spread in the river bank. Once the pigeon eat the rice and made way to the river, he put his prayers mat over the water and asked everyone to hold hands each other with him and close their eyes. Shahjalal was famed for his strong miracles and extra ordinary knowledge. He crossed the river along with his companions. When Govinda saw the miracles of Shahjalal, he ran away with his family! It's their third time war against Govinda and Shah Jalal won the battle without any loss. He called out for the adhan as the time for salah approached and the sound of Adhan destroy Govinda's 7-storey Gorduar palace. His army was lost against Shahjalal and his companions. After hearing that his commander Mona Rai was killed, Govinda was forced to retreat and Srihatta was brought under Muslim control. According to tradition, another disciple of Shah Jalal, Shah Chashni Pir at this point compared the soil in Srihatta with that which was previously given by Ahmad Kabir, finding them to be identical. In any case, following the battle, Shah Jalal along with his followers permanently settled in Sylhet.\nGovinda retreated with his family to Harong Hurong cave in Mulnicherra. He then went to the shrine of Grivakali, where he left his aunt, Apurna, and his cousin Garuda and cousin-in-law Shantipriya (or Shantirani) in the care of the priest. Following this, he took his wife, Hiravati, and son, Nirvana, with him to Kamrup.\nAn granite inscription dated (918 AH) 1512-13 AD during the reign of Alauddin Husain Shah, records the conquest of Sylhet in (703 AH) 1302–1303 corresponding with the reign of Sultan Shams al-Din Firuz Shah () as follows: In honour of the exalted Shaykh al-Mashāyikh (spiritual master), Shaykh Jalāl ibn Muḥammad\nThe first Islamic conquest of the city in the 'arṣah (an administrative unit) of Sylhet was accomplished at the hand of Sikandar Khān Ghāzī during the reign of Sulṭān Fīruz Shāh Dalwi (Dahlawi), the year seven hundred three.\nThis edifice (has been erected) by Rukn Khān who conquered Hasht Kāmhāriyān (the eight tribes), being the vizier and the chief of the army for months at the time of the conquest of Kamrup and Kamta and Jaznagar and Orissa as he served the army at different places following the king in the year nine hundred and eighteen.\nCapture of Taraf\n, Habiganj).]]\nGaruda and his family, taking shelter at Grivakali shrine, then decided to head off to Tungachal. They set on a boat at Dhanuhatta driven by the royal servants Ghaturam and Jharuram. However, they were seen by Subid, a rebel from the time of Raja Govardhan's fall, who informed the Muslims of their actions; leading to Garuda's boat being followed by the Muslims. Out of embarrassment, Garuda appeared to committed suicide, jumping off the boat at Puni beel. The boatmen, however, continued taking Apurna and Shantipriya to Tungachal, eventually finding refuge with Raja Achak Narayan, though the boatmen themselves were killed. Apurna and Shantipriya made a vow in Tunganath Shiva temple to fast for ninety days, hoping for safety. The incident is mentioned in a ballad known as Shantiranir Baromashi (Shantirani's twelve months). After the successful conquest of Gour, Syed Nasiruddin set off on an expedition against the feudal Raja Achak Narayan of Tungachal, which had been a part of the Gour Kingdom. Nasiruddin arrived with 1000 lascars and 12 Saints sent by Shahjalal (r) to help him. He camped in a place now known as Laskarpur. Raja Achak Narayan was also defeated and fled with his family to Mathura. Shantipriya was said to have also committed suicide. Following a victory, Tungachal was annexed to Bengal and renamed as Taraf. The 12 saints who accompanied Nasiruddin are as follows:\n# Shah Arifin (buried in Tahirpur)\n# Shah Tajuddin Qureshi (buried in Chowkhi Pargana, Sylhet)\n# Shah Ruknuddin Aswari (buried in Sarail)\n# Shah Badr (buried in Badarpur, Karimganj, India)\n# Shah Mahmud (buried in Urdu Bazar, Laskarpur)\n# Shah Sultan (buried in Badarpur, Mymensingh)\n# Shah Ghazi (buried in Bishgram, Sylhet)\n# Shah Badruddin (buried in Bakhshirghat, Chittagong)\n# Shah Majlis Amin (buried in Shankarpasha, Habiganj Sadar)\n# Shah Fateh Ghazi (buried in Fatehpur-Shahjibazar, Madhabpur)\n# Syed Shah Saif Minnatuddin (buried in Laskarpur)\n# Syed Ahmad Gesudaraz (buried in Kharampur Mazar Sharif, Brahmanbaria)\nAftermath\ncave which Govinda and his family supposedly retreated to.]]\nGour and Taraf were then incorporated into Shamsuddin Firoz Shah's kingdom with Sikandar Khan Ghazi being the first Wazir of Sylhet. Gour was nicknamed Jalalabad after Shah Jalal for his aid in delivering Islam to the population. To this day, the remains of Gour Govinda's fort can be found in Chowhatta, Sylhet. Many of Shah Jalal's companions migrated to other places in Eastern India to preach the religion of Islam. The Muslims were not interested in conquering other neighbouring kingdoms such as Laur, Jaintia and Twipra, which would be conquered much later during Mughal rule and British rule.\nSee also\n* Muharram Rebellion\n* Nankar Rebellion\n* Revolt of Radharam\nReferences"
