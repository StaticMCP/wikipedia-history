Although handsome enough in their own right, these two items are hardly vital to play of the game.\"\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser Deck Plans in Space Gamer No. 70. Barton commented that \"With the recent release of the Klingons supplement for ST:RPG and of a basic set minus the deck plans, the 15mm Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser Deck Plans prove to be a better value for ST players and GMs than they are even in their own right. Still, if you can afford them now, they are quite nice.\"\nReferences"
