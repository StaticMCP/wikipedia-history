Union Colonel William A. Phillips sent out an advance of approximately 350 men from the 14th Kansas Cavalry (led by Maj. Charles Willetts) and two howitzers (led by Captain Solomon Kaufman) to attack a Confederate outpost guarding the Trail's crossing of Middle Boggy River. The outpost was about 36 miles (58 km) from Boggy Depot, which was held by 90 underprepared Confederate soldiers when Willett's army ambushed.\nHistorical Context\n| place             = Choctaw Nation, Indian Territory, near present-day Allen, Oklahoma in Pontotoc County (exact location unknown).\n| result            = Union victory\n| combatant1        =  United States of America (Union)\n| combatant2        =  CSA (Confederacy)\n| commander1        = Col.

Many tribes believed that staying with the United States government was their best course of action, while others believed it would be better to side with the Confederacy. The Chickasaw and Choctaw both supported the Confederacy. The First Regiment for both the Chickasaw and Choctaw was formed in 1861, and throughout the war the Chickasaw and Choctaw were assigned to different companies and regiments, continuing to serve the Confederacy.\nBackground\nAt this point during the Civil War, both the Union and Confederacy were suffering. The winter of 1864 was unforgiving, and the Union's Colonel William Phillips was marching towards the Confederate troops in Indian Territory. All winter, the Confederacy had troops stationed in the east and west to defend North Texas. They had troops stretching from Ft Washita to the north side of the Red River. Phillips marched along the Dragoon Trail into Indian Territory, where his goal was to separate the Confederate troops from one another. The Confederacy had troops stationed along the Dragoon Trail that were meant to watch for a situation such as this.\nSkirmish at the outpost\nThe Confederate outpost was very near the point where the Dragoon Road crossed the Middle Boggy. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture says that the battlefield was 15 miles northeast of the depot, whereas the battlefield marker says the distance was 12 miles. Maj. Willetts' advance group camped a short distance away on the night of February 12 and made final preparations to attack. Willett's group began the skirmish with an artillery barrage at 7 A.M. the following morning. The 14th Kansas Cavalry immediately charged, throwing the Confederates into confusion. Outnumbered and outgunned, the Confederates held off the Union cavalry attack for approximately 30 minutes before retreating to the rest of Lt. Col. John Jumper's Seminole Battalion, who were not at the main skirmish. The Confederates retreated 45 miles (72 km) southwest along the Dragoon Trail. The Union advance continued south toward Ft Washita the next day, but when the expected reinforcements did not arrive, Philips' Expedition into Indian Territory stalled on February 15, near old Cochran’s Store. Col. Phillips reported that his soldiers had killed 48 Confederate soldiers and had taken no prisoners.\nAftermath\nThe night after the battle, Col. Phillips camped at a site known as Camp Kansas.  By the following morning, he understood that the remainder of the 14th Cavalry would not be coming to his assistance. Phillips divided his command into two groups: he sent Major Willetts and the cavalry soldiers south to pursue Gov. Colbert and the fleeing Confederates, and ordered Colonel Wattles to take command of the infantry and proceed to old Fort Holmes. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved January 6, 2015.}}\nPhillips followed Major Willetts south, eventually arriving at the town of Cochran—present-day Stonewall, Oklahoma—where residents had already been warned by the retreating Confederate soldiers of his coming. Philips ordered his troops to burn businesses, residences, and all other Confederate or Chickasaw buildings, including Pontotoc Court House and the Colbert Institute, a pre-war Chickasaw school that had been used to house Confederate troops. During the destruction, several Southern sympathizers were shot and killed by Union soldiers. Days later, on February 17, 1864, Philips's assault ended, 400 miles deep in enemy territory.\nUltimately, though the battle was a defeat for the Confederates, the Union troops' destruction, mistreatment of civilians, and killing of wounded soldiers effectively re-energized and reinforced the resolve of the Confederates and their sympathizers to continue the fight. This kind of destruction perpetrated by the Union Army extended throughout the South, generating a similar effect, inadvertently strengthening Confederate sympathy.\nLegacy & Battle Marker\nIn 1959, the Oklahoma Historical Society erected a marker at a small Confederate cemetery about  north of Atoka, Oklahoma where local residents believed fallen Confederate soldiers were buried following the Battle of Middle Boggy. However, forensic research in 1988 enabled site manager Gwen Walker to positively identify some of the bodies as soldiers of the 19th Arkansas Infantry—subsequently discovering that the dead were sent to construct earthworks at Fort McCulloch in 1862, and that they actually died of a measles epidemic.\nRegardless, a new marker commemorating the Battle of Middle Boggy was placed in the Atoka Confederate Cemetery in 2014. It now reads:\n\"MIDDLE BOGGY BATTLE\nON THIS SITE LIE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WHO DIED IN BATTLE, FEBRUARY 13, 1864\n\"The Confederate encampment here at Middle (or Muddy) Boggy Crossing on the Boggy Depot Road held by Lt. Col. John Jumper's Seminole Battalion, Capt. Adam Nail's Company \"A\" of First Choctaw and Chickasaw Cavalry, and a detachment of the Twentieth Texas Regiment was suddenly attacked by Federal Forces --- 3 companies of Fourteenth Kansas Cavalry, Maj. Charles Willetts in command, and a section of howitzers under Capt. Solomon Kaufman.\nThe Confederates, though poorly armed, made a firm stand in a hot fight of 30 minutes in which 47 of their men were killed and others wounded. Word of Confederate forces riding in from Boggy Depot, 12 miles southwest, caused a hurried retreat of the Federal troops toward Fort Gibson, north. The dead were buried 1 mile north of Atoka, Oklahoma on the west side of Boggy River, and 100 yards north of Hwy. 69. This cemetery was also a burial ground for travelers on the old Boggy Depot Road before the Civil War.\"\nSince 1994, the Atoka County Historical Society has commemorated the Battle of Middle Boggy with a reenactment every third year; all proceeds go to Atoka's Confederate Memorial Museum.\nSee also\n* List of battles fought in Oklahoma\n* Indian Territory in the American Civil War\nNotes\nReferences\n* [https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battles-detail.htm?battleCode=ok005 National Park Service battle description]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108183216/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/CWSACReportOklahomaUpdate.pdf CWSAC Report Update and Resurvey: Individual Battlefield Profiles]\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716084932/http://www.civilwaralbum.com/atoka/battle.htm Battle of Middle Boggy]"
