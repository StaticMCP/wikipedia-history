One can also get a sense of how the field has changed with recent works veering off into the fantastic in this Showcase.\" While regretting the dearth of such traditional themes as \"interstellar travel, journeys in time and encounters with extraterrestrials [and] the dream of a clear cut divide between good and evil,\" he notes the emergence in the anthology of \"new directions and genre hybrids [and] some interesting literary stories requiring a close or second reading [that] seem more appropriate for more mature audiences, but maybe one should not underestimate the young.\" He notes the presence of \"[s]ome big names\" along with \"new writers and disparate voices\" and finds some of the pieces \"oceanic, rather than cosmic.\" He concludes that while \"[o]ne is not likely to enjoy everything, ... there is a fair bit to be impressed by.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Wendy Bousfield in SFRA Review no. 305 Summer 2013, Don Sakers in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 2013, and Cherith Baldry in Vector 274, Winter 2013.\nNotes"
