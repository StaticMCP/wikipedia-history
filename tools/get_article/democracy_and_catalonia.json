As the heavily crowded Catalan political space was in the process of reorganization ahead of the general election, speculation emerged in late March 1977 that talks were ongoing for a broad agreement of political parties within the centre ground of the political spectrum, including the Catalan Centre (CC), the Socialist Party of Catalonia–Regrouping (PSC–R), Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC), Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC), Democratic Left of Catalonia (EDC), the Social Democratic Party of Catalonia (PSDC) and the National Front of Catalonia (FNC); such an alliance was planned to be running under the \"Democracy and Catalonia\" label.\nWhile the Democracy and Catalonia alliance had been initially scheduled to comprise all Catalan democratic opposition parties within a joint candidacy of broad spectrum, on 3 May 1977 it came to be established by the parties forming the Democratic Pact for Catalonia (CDC, EDC, FNC and PSC–R) and the Union of the Centre and Christian Democracy of Catalonia (CC and UDC) electoral coalitions to the Congress of Deputies, excluding the parties that would go on to form the Agreement of the Catalans over the incorporation of the communist Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) in the lists.\nComposition\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Socialist Party of Catalonia–Regrouping (PSC–R)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Democratic Left of Catalonia (EDC)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| National Front of Catalonia (FNC)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC)\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\"|\n| Catalan Centre (CC)\n|}\nElectoral performance\nSenate\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"| Senate\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"75\"| Election\n! colspan=\"5\"| Catalonia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Votes\n! width=\"35\"| %\n!
