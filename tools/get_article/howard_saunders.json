He received his early education at Leatherhead and Rottingdean. He entered business as a merchant banker, which allowed him to travel widely. From 1855 to 1862 he travelled in Brazil and Chile.\nAfter 1862 Saunders devoted himself to the study of the birds of Spain.  He published several articles on the subject in The Ibis, having visited the Pyrenees in 1883 and 1884. He also published articles on the birds of Switzerland in 1891, and an account of The Distribution of Birds in France in 1893. He was the co-editor with P. L. Sclater for The Ibis in 1883–1886 and 1895–1900.\nSaunders was an expert on gulls and terns. Among other duties, he wrote about the gull specimens from the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876.\nSaunders served as secretary of the British Ornithologists' Union from 1901 to 1907, and first secretary and treasurer of the British Ornithologists' Club. He was also an active member of the Zoological, Linnean and Royal Geographical Societies.\nOrnithological publications\nIn 1869 his first article on the birds of Spain was published in The Ibis.\nIn 1872 he described a new species of green woodpecker, the Iberian green woodpecker, that inhibits the Iberian Peninsula. He called it Gecinus sharpii (now Picus sharpii), after the name of its discoverer, Richard Bowdler Sharpe (1847-1909).\nIn 1889 the first edition of the Illustrated Manual of British Birds was published. It was issued in twenty parts in 1888 and 1889. In The Zoologist of 1888 appeared a 'notice' about parts i-iv.\nTen years later a second edition appeared. The third edition was published twenty years after the death of Saunders and was revised and enlarged by William Eagle Clarke.\nLegacy\nTwo species of birds have been named after him:\n* Saunders's gull\n* Saunders's tern\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n* ; also published as\n* Third and fourth (1885) editions of Yarrell's A History of British Birds\n*\n**  |reference=1899: 2nd ed., revised and enlarged, \"with 384 illustrations and 3 coloured maps\"}}\n**  |reference=1927: 3rd ed.: \"Manual of British Birds\" by Howard Saunders; Third edition revised and enlarged by William Eagle Clarke, I.S.O., LL.D.
