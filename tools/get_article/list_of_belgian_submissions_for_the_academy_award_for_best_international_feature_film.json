The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The \"Best Foreign Language Film\" category was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. Between 1947 and 1955, the academy presented a non-competitive Honorary Award for the best foreign language films released in the United States.\nAs of 2025, Belgium was nominated eight times, but never won the award.\nSubmissions\ndirected two Belgian films nominated for the award, The Music Teacher and Farinelli.]]\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nEven though Belgium was nominated eight times, two-times Palme d'Or winners and acclaimed filmmakers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne were never nominated. They hold the record of most submitted directors, with 5 films selected to represent the country: Rosetta (1999), The Son (2002), The Child (2005), Two Days, One Night (2014) and Young Mothers (2025). However, for Two Days, One Night, Marion Cotillard was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\nTwo of the nominees were directed by Gérard Corbiau: The Music Teacher and Farinelli. The six other Belgian directors to have films accepted as nominees are Jacques Boigelot, Stijn Coninx, Dominique Deruddere, Michaël R. Roskam, Felix Van Groeningen and Lukas Dhont. Boigelot's Peace in the Fields was accepted as a nominee at the 43rd Academy Awards, Stijn Coninx's Daens was a nominee in 1993, Deruddere's ''Everybody's Famous!'' was a nominee at the 73rd Academy Awards, Roskam's Bullhead for the 84th, Van Groeningen's The Broken Circle Breakdown for the 86th, and Dhont's Close for the 95th.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Belgium for review by the academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
