The BRAT called the Associated Press and took credit for the attack claiming it was protesting apartheid.\nBRAT's second and final action took place on September 20, 1971, when it placed bombs at the UN Missions of Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of Malawi. The Congo bomb was placed at the top of a stairway outside the door of the second floor office of the mission. The 11:33AM blasts' main force was downward and jolted a glass panel door off its hinges and sent flying glass onto three passers-by. Nobody in the mission was hurt, but Jodie Della Femina, the three-year-old daughter of Jerry Della Femina, was struck by the flying glass and suffered six facial lacerations to the eyelid, cheek, lip and chin, necessitating 2 hours of surgery and 75-100 stitches. She also lost an upper front tooth. Her nine-year-old brother Michael and mother Barbara sustained minor injuries.\nShortly after the blasts the United Press International received a telephone message:\nThe Black Revolutionary Assault Team has just bombed the Congo mission. We bombed it because it refused to allow our freedom fighters to cross their country to get to Angola.\nThe caller also claimed that the group had planted a bomb at the Malawi mission four blocks from the Congo site. The Malawian mission was evacuated as police found and defused a  low-grade pipe bomb.\nMinutes before the Congo bomb exploded Larry Pearson, an eighteen-year-old black Louis Brandeis High School student rushed into a taxi operated by Marvin Ellias. Ellias noted that the youth was nervous and \"acting suspiciously\", and then he heard the explosion. The cab driver alerted his dispatcher through his car radio and then drove around until he found a traffic cop who arrested Pearson. After more than five hours of questioning, Pearson was charged with arson, possession of a bomb and a loaded weapon, and criminal mischief, and held on $50,000 bond.\nSee also\n*Black nationalism\n*George Jackson Brigade\n*Black Liberation Army\n*Symbionese Liberation Army\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131221120411/http://start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=3970 START profile]\n*[http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?page=1&casualties_type=&casualties_max=&perpetrator=3948&charttype=line&chart=overtime&ob=GTDID&od=desc&expanded=yes#results-table Incidents attributed to BRAT] on the START database"
