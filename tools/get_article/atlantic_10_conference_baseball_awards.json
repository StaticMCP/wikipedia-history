It names a Coach, Pitcher, Player, and Rookie of the Year.  The Coach of the Year, dating to 1988, is the oldest.  Pitcher and Player were added in 1993, Rookie in 1994.\nThrough the end of 2014, Rhode Island has won the most major awards, with 12. The only other school to win more than ten is George Washington, with 11.\nThree players have won more than one of the awards. In 2000, George Washington's Greg Conden was named both Rookie and Pitcher of the Year. Duquesne's B. J. Barns was Rookie of the Year in 1997 and Player of the Year in 1999; Rhode Island's Dan Batz did the same in 2001 and 2004.\nCoach of the Year\nThe Coach of the Year award is presented annually to the conference's most outstanding coach, as voted by the A-10's coaches at the end of each regular season.  The award has been presented since 1988.\nIn 2014, Saint Joseph's head coach Fritz Hamburg received the award for the first time.  After tying for 8th and missing the conference tournament in 2013, the Hawks went 35-16 (18-8 A-10) in 2014, setting a program wins record.\nMike Stone of UMass and Fred Hill of Rutgers have each won the award three times, a conference record.  Both coaches won their awards in consecutive seasons, Stone from 1994–1996 and Hill from 1991–1993.  Only one other coach, Rhode Island's Frank Leoni from 2003–2004, has won the award in consecutive years.\nGeorge Washington is the only school to have three coaches win the award. The Revolutionaries' (known as Colonials before the 2023 season) John Castleberry won it in 1989, Tom Walter in 1998, and Gregg Ritchie in 2013.  Three other schools have had two coaches earn the honor: Xavier (John Morrey in 1997 and Scott Googins in 2008), La Salle (Larry Conti in 1999 and Mike Lake in 2010), and Rhode Island (Frank Leoni in 2003 and 2004 and Jim Foster in 2011).\nWinners by school\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Coach\n!School\n!Conf.
