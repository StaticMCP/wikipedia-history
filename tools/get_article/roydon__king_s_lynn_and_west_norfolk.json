The station opened in 1879, and closed to passengers in 1959 (freight traffic continued to pass through the village until this section of the M&GN railway finally closed in 1968).\nRoydon today has a large common which is managed as a nature reserve.\nThe most significant building architecturally is the parish church of All Saints, parts of which date back to the 12th century although it was subject to major renovations by the prolific ecclesiastical architect GE Street in 1857. The church is Grade II* listed.\nNotes\nExternal links"
