Palrang were ambushed by Sandinista forces led by Miguel Angel Ortez after leaving Ocotal to repair the telephone line with San Fernando.\nEight Marines were killed in the firefight (including Palrang), with the two survivors being wounded. It was the largest loss of American life in a single battle during the occupation of Nicaragua.\nThe battle resulted in the Sandinistas capturing \"two Browning automatic rifles, one Thompson submachine gun, three Springfield rifles, and eight fully equipped mules.\" The battle lasted two and a half hours.\nIn the United States, the incident reignited controversy over the military occupation of Nicaragua. On 2 January 1931, Senator William E. Borah, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for a withdrawal of American military personnel from Nicaragua.\nAmerican casualties\nKilled:\n* Sergeant Arthur M.
