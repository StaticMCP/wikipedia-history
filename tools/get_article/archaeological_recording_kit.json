ARK is primarily designed for recording excavations, but can also be used for archaeological surveys, palaeoenvironmental research and collections management.\nARK is based on the LAMP stack and MapServer, and is free software released under the GNU GPL. It was developed by L-P Archaeology, a British commercial archaeology practice.\nThe Fasti Online project was built using an ARK back-end, and demonstrates its usage beyond normal archaeological recording.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://ark.lparchaeology.com ARK]"
