It was designed by Berlinghof & Davis and George A. Berlinghof in Classical Revival style.\nIt is a four-story building made of brick, partly faced with Bedford, Indiana limestone.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.  The listing included one contributing building and one contributing object.\nIt was deemed significant architecturally and for its association with local politics and government of Howard County, Nebraska.  It was asserted to be \"an important example\" of Nebraska\narchitect George A. Berlinghof's work, in this case as part of Berlinghof & Davis;  it included features later used by Berlinghof in the Greeley County Courthouse and the Franklin County Courthouse and therefore demonstrated \"the evolution of his designs.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*More photos of the Howard County Courthouse at Wikimedia Commons"
