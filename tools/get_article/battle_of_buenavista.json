Dublé Almeyda and three soldiers managed to mount and escape towards Moquegua, leaving eight Chileans dead and the rest prisoners, who were sent to Tacna and then La Paz.\nDue to the disaster at Locumba, Dublé was tried in a court-martial before being acquitted. This motivated the mobilization of a Chilean column, of about 600 soldiers under the command of Commander José Francisco Vergara, with the aim of confronting Albarracín, who was arming the populations of the interior against the Chileans.\nOn April 10, the Chileans went looking for Gregorio Albarracín, but didn't find him at Locumba.\nAlbarracin withdrew towards Mirave, some 30 kilometers into the valley, and from there headed south towards the Rio Sama Valley.\nThe Battle\nAlbarracín gathered the residents of Sama to confront Vergara, and on April 18, 1880, the Battle of Buenavista took place, in the same valley of the Sama River. Albarracín attacked a Chilean outpost led by Ensign Souper, who withdrew from the valley, to return with 450 men under the command of Tomás Yávar. Then Albarracín withdrew to Tacna, leaving the sameños in the valley, those who, without weapons, were decimated in the grasslands of Sama. The battle caused the loss of 100 men, and 35 prisoners. Albarracín managed to withdraw to Tacna with only 30 men.\nJust 3 kilometers south of Buenavista, the Chilean army would be concentrated a few weeks later, in the so-called Las Yaras camp, prior to the Battle of Tacna.\nReferences\n* Gonzalo Bulnes (1914).
