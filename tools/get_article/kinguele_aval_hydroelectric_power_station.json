It is the first grid-ready, privately owned hydroelectric power station in the country.\nLocation\nThe power station is located across the Mbei River, in Estuaire Province, approximately  east of Libreville, the capital and largest city in Gabon. Kinguélé Aval Hydroelectric Power Station will be downstream of the 69 megawatt Tchimbélé Hydroelectric Power Station and downstream of the 58 megawatt Kinguélé Hydroelectric Power Station.\nOverview\nThe power station is under development by a consortium comprising Meridiam, an international firm based in Paris, France, that focuses on \"developing, financing and managing long-term public infrastructure projects\", and the Gabonese Strategic Investment Fund (FGIS).\nThe owners have established a special-purpose vehicle company called Asonha Energie SA, to develop, manage and maintain the proposed power station and associated infrastructure developments. The energy generated at this power station will be sold to Société d’énergie et d’eau du Gabon (SEEG), the national electricity utility company, under a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA).\nOwnership\nThe table below illustrates the shareholding in Asonha Energie, the special vehicle company, established to own, develop and manage the Kinguélé Aval Hydroelectric Power Station.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 0.5em auto\"\n|+ Shareholding in Asonha Energie SA\n!

The construction budget has been reported as €176 million (approx. US$209 million). Later, this was revised to €179 million (117.4 billion CFA francs).\nThe funders for this power station include the entities listed in the table below:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 0.5em auto\"\n|+ Sources of funding for Kinguélé Aval Hydroelectric Dam\n!
