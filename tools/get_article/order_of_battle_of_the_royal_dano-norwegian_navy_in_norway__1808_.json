Lacking the time and resources to build a new battle fleet, they concentrated on smaller craft capable of carrying heavy, long range cannon viz. gunboats that were effective in the calmer, narrower inshore waters, but could not challenge enemy warships in rougher seas. For the rougher waters of the Norwegian Sea from 1808 onward, a new class of gunship, the seaworthy 50-man pine-built Norske Kanonskonnert were to be built in Bergen and Trondheim. Ten such gunships were constructed before 1814, and more after Norway achieved independence from Denmark.\nCommand structure\nAdjutant General of the navy: Commander Lorenz Fisker\nThe station at Hvaløerne and Grændsen (Hvaler Islands and the border with Sweden at the mouth of the Oslofjord):\n*First Division Kanonchalupper (Larger Gunboats) commanded by Kapteinløitnant S.
