It began as a character design contest for each of the 47 prefectures, and is currently composed of three games, an anime series and a manga serialization.\nThe Magica Wars concept started development on June 28, 2012, coinciding the premiere of 2.5 Jigen Terebi. Using the concept of \"livening up one's locale\", a character design contest was hosted on the illustration SNS Pixiv during June 28 to August 8 wherein each entry consists of a magical girl and her familiar. By the end of the contest, a staggering 3,248 entries from Japan and other countries joined the period. Of these entries, 60 were chosen as official designs for the magical girls that would represent the 47 prefectures of Japan and Taiwan, with 3D sprites especially made for three of these entries, which are representatives for the Miyagi, Aomori and Kanagawa prefectures.\nAfter the selection of the 60 entries from the character design contest, three games were green-lit for release. Two of these games, Magica Wars Lock On! and Magica Wars Tactics, were designed for smartphones, while a third, Magica Wars Zanbatsu, is released for the PlayStation Vita handheld console. An anime series and a manga based on the concept were also green-lit. Each project has a different number of cast of Magical Girls, the anime and manga having the fewest featured. The Zanbatsu game featured 47 prefecture magical girls, two original girls, the amnesiac protagonist Sakaki Amane and another original character Maki Inada who gives the amnesiac Amane her name and is the first person who Amane meets; also guest starring in Zanbatsu are some Magatsuhi-corrupted magical girl cast from Lock-On as antagonists. The Zanbatsu game ended service on December 22, 2015 after slightly over a year's run from March 2014.\nAnime\nEpisode list\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF;\"\n! style=\"width:3em;\"  | No.\n!

It is revealed that Rin was the previous magical girl of the Tokyo ward before Kobarin, and in a fight against a monster, a building's debris broke off and hurt some civilians, which Rin witnessed and ran away in guilt; when Rin had retreated to a dark street alley, doubting herself as a magical girl, her now corrupted familiar Libby appeared and corrupted her power as a Magical Girl, resulting in the current corrupted Rin. In the present, Rin mentions to herself that she's been dirtied now. Soon, Mebuki confronts the corrupted Rin and attempts to stop her from draining the leylines of their power, which would end up killing the land.\n}}\n)\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary    = Above Kyoto, Mebuki fights the corrupted former Tokyo magical girl Rin and her corrupted familiar Libby as they attempt to drain the country's leylines of their power having allowed their corruptive power to take form of a dark phoenix that drains the nearby power sources. Down below, the citizens are helped by the reporter woman to safety from the fight's debris. The citizens' efforts to block the leyline from connecting to the phoenix is successful in distracting the corrupted Rin, at which Mebuki is able to then purify her from the dark powers, reverting Rin to her human form and destroying the corrupted Libby in the process. Mebuki now answers Rin's question at the start of the episode of how the Magical Girls can continue their role when despair and pain can be caused to innocents as consequence of their fights to keep the country safe from monsters; Mebuki tells Rin that while not every effort will go well, they can continue as Magical Girls because Magical Girls are the peoples' hopes.\n}}\n)\n| OriginalAirDate =\n| ShortSummary    = At daytime, a falling object resembling a shooting star moves across the sky which is spotted by several Magical Girls across Japan, including a now purified Rin who Kobarin spots, in the street carrying a flower bouquet presumably for her now deceased familiar. The scene then cuts to an unrelated girl named Yakumo Hina (anime original) spots the falling object and attempts but fails to make a wish on it, in the process missing her bus ride. The falling object lands in a forest near Shimane revealing the 'shooting star' to be Amane, alongside Yamada, both the amnesiac main characters of ZANBATSU. Amane then says she has come to slay the gods and walks up the nearby steps while Yamada follows along, roughly connecting and giving way to the ZANBATSU story-line. Yakumo Hina, Amane, and Yamada do the final 4th wallbreaker cutscene talking about their hopes of an animation featuring themselves in it and ending with the \"Kashi Komi Kashi komi masu\" transformation phrase.\n}}\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
