A lawyer, he served one term in Congress from 1993 to 1998 as a member of the center-left National Encounter Party. In 2018, Cubas was elected to the Senate as a sole member of the National Crusade Movement but was suspended for outbursts and physical altercations with Senate colleagues.\nHistory\nFollowing the results of the 2018 elections, the party elected its representative, Paraguayo \"Payo\" Cubas, to the Senate. In November 2019, he was expelled from the Senate on charges of abuse of power and hooliganism.\nIn February 2020, the National Crusade Movement was renamed to the National Crusade Party.\nIn 2020, the party suffered a split after some members of the MCN accused the leader of the party, Cubas, and his wife, Yolanda Paredes, of authoritarianism.\nAfter the party's failure in the 2021 municipal elections, Paraguayo Cubas, the president of the party, announced his resignation.\nOn the eve of the 2023 general election, the Cubas party participated in the creation of the Concertación coalition, but soon left it before the election of a single opposition candidate, deciding to participate in the elections independently. In the 2023 elections, Cubas was considered an outsider or spoiler candidate for the Concertación, who would gain support among the anti-systemic electorate, advocating the death penalty for corruption.\nIn the general election, despite Cubas losing the presidential election (winning almost 23% of the vote), the party became the third largest political force in both Chambers of Congress (after the Colorado Party and the PLRA), winning four seats in the Chamber of Deputies and five seats in the Senate. Among the Senators-elect are Cubas's wife Yolanda Paredes and  plastic artist Rafael \"Mbururú\" Esquivel, the latter arrested over child sexual abuse charges at the time of the election.\nElectoral results\nPresident\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
