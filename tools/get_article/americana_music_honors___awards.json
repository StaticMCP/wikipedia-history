Beginning in 2002, the Americana Music Association honors distinguished members of the music community. Six member-voted awards and several Lifetime Achievement Awards are handed out while over 2000 artists, music-loving fans and entertainment industry executives look on.\nThe Honors & Awards have featured a variety of musical events, including Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash's last live performance together.  Artists such as The Carolina Chocolate Drops, Robert Plant & His Band of Joy, Steve Earle & Allison Moorer, Rosanne Cash and John Fogerty have also performed for the event, and special appearances by artists like Kris Kristofferson (2003), Loretta Lynn (2004/2014), Billy Bob Thornton (2005), Bonnie Raitt (2012/2016), Dwight Yoakam (2016) and George Strait (2016) demonstrate the prestige of the genre and awards show.\nThe Honors & Awards show was first broadcast on national television in 2005. Also in 2005, SiriusXM, BBC2, and Voice of America began broadcasting the show on radio. PBS began airing an abbreviated version during Austin City Limits in 2011.\nThe Americana Honors & Awards Show returned to the historic Ryman Auditorium on September 12, 2012. It was once again hosted by Jim Lauderdale, while the All Star Band was led by Buddy Miller. The 2012 Honors & Awards show was aired live on AXS TV and later aired on Austin City Limits on PBS and replayed on AXS TV. Lauderdale stepped down from hosting duties after the 2017 ceremony and the 2018–19 Honors & Awards were hosted by The Milk Carton Kids. The show did not include a host in 2021.\nNomination process\nThe eligibility period for the Americana Music Association's “Of The Year” categories typically runs from April 1 through March 31 of the following year.
