It starred Seth Green, Josh Cooke, Shane McRae, and Todd Grinnell. The show was created by David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, both of whom created Will & Grace.\nThe show centers on four childhood friends who live in New York City. The show's theme is \"Hanginaround\" by Counting Crows. Four Kings was pulled from NBC's schedule after its airing on March 16, 2006, and on May 15, 2006, NBC confirmed the show's cancellation. Two of the show's stars had already signed on to new projects, which did not bode well for the show's chances of renewal. Though NBC originally announced that they would air the remaining episodes beginning May 25, 2006, they did not follow through. The unaired episodes would eventually air in syndication on the Living network in the UK, and on the Nine Network in Australia.\nCast\n*Seth Green as Barry Klein\n*Todd Grinnell as Jason\n*Shane McRae as Robert \"Bobby\"\n*Josh Cooke as Benjamin \"Ben\" Wolf\n*Kathryn Hahn as Sharon\n*Kate Micucci as Toni\n*Rachelle Lefevre as Lauren\n*Michael Des Barres as Nick Dresden\nEpisodes\n| Viewers = 8.86\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = eee8aa\n}}\n| Viewers = 9.12\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = eee8aa\n}}\n| Viewers = 7.43\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = eee8aa\n}}\n| Viewers = 6.28\n| ShortSummary =\n| LineColor = eee8aa\n}}\n| Title = The Elephant in the Room | DirectedBy = | WrittenBy = | Viewers = 6.60\n| LineColor = eee8aa }}  | Title = Follow the Money | DirectedBy = | WrittenBy = | Viewers = 6.33\n| LineColor = eee8aa }}  | Title = Night of the Iguana | DirectedBy = | WrittenBy = | Viewers = 6.83\n| LineColor = eee8aa }}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*  at EpisodeWorld\nhttps://www.ween.wiki/wiki/4_Kings"
