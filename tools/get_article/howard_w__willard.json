He is known for his lithographs and woodcuts, and his western and \"ethnic\" dust jackets.\nLife and career\nBorn in 1894, in Illinois, he moved to California as a child and spent part of his life there, along with an extended period in New York City, where he was a prominent member of the art scene. He studied at the Art Students League of New York. In 1938, he joined the staff of the Cooper Union in design instruction as an \"illustrative designer.\" He was married to art critic Charlotte Willard.\nWillard worked in both commercial publishing and fine press publishing, producing work for a range of audiences, from children to literary collectors to readers of textbooks. In 1943, the US War Department hired him to illustrate guidebooks used by American troops overseas. A year earlier he had been one of a group of American artists selected for a joint Cuban-American project to design postage stamps for Cuba that sought to raise awareness of the danger of \"Fifth Columnists\" in that country.  In the 1940s, Willard was associated with artists of the New Masses such as Art Young and Rockwell Kent, participating with them in an effort to raise money for the periodical in 1943. Willard served as president of the Advertisers Guild in New York in 1940.\nThe Howard W. Willard Papers are held at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.\nList of illustrations\nLimited edition books\n* Design for Carolyn Wells, “Lavinia Dickinson.” The Colophon: A Book Collectors’ Quarterly, Part Three (September 1930).
