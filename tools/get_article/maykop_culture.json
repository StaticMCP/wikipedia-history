      "text": "# Maykop culture\n\nThe Maykop culture or Maikop culture (, , scientific transliteration: Majkop,), c. 3700 BC – 3000 BC, is a major archaeological culture of the Bronze Age in the western Caucasus region.\nIt extends along the area from the Taman Peninsula at the Kerch Strait to near the modern border of Dagestan and southwards to the Kura River. The culture takes its name from a royal burial, the Maykop kurgan, in the Kuban River valley.\nAccording to genetic studies on ancient DNA published in 2018, the Maykop population came from the south, from Imereti, and was descended from the Chalcolithic farmers known as Darkveti-Meshoko who first colonized the north side of the Caucasus. Maykop is therefore the \"ideal archaeological candidate for the founders of the Northwest Caucasian language family\".\nTerritory\nIn the south, the Maykop culture bordered the approximately contemporaneous Kura–Araxes culture (3500–2200 BC), which extends into the Armenian Plateau and apparently influenced it. To the north is the Yamna culture, including the Novotitarovskaya culture (3300–2700), which it overlaps in territorial extent. It is contemporaneous with the late Uruk period in Mesopotamia.\nThe Kuban River is navigable for much of its length and provides an easy water-passage through the Sea of Azov to the territory of the Yamna culture, along the Don and Donets River systems. The Maykop culture was thus well-situated to exploit the trading possibilities with the central Ukraine area.\nRadiocarbon dates for various monuments of the Maykop culture are from 3950 - 3650 - 3610 - 2980 calBC.\nAfter the discovery of the Leyla-Tepe culture in the 1980s, some links were noted with the Maykop culture.\nThe Leyla-Tepe culture is a culture of archaeological interest from the Chalcolithic era. Its population was distributed on the southern slopes of the Central Caucasus, in the Aghdam District of modern Azerbaijan, from 4350 until 4000 B.C. Similar amphora burials in the South Caucasus are found in the Jar-Burial Culture of western Georgia.\nThe Leyla-Tepe culture has also been linked to the Ubaid period monuments, in particular with the settlements in the Eastern Anatolia region. The settlement is of a typical Western-Asian variety, with the dwellings packed closely together and made of mud bricks with smoke outlets.\nIt has been suggested that the Leyla-Tepe were the founders of the Maykop culture. An expedition to Syria by the Russian Academy of Sciences revealed the similarity of the Maykop and Leyla-Tepe artifacts with those found recently while excavating the ancient city of Tel Khazneh I, dated to the 4th millennium BC.\nIn 2010, nearly 200 Bronze Age sites were reported stretching over 60 miles from the Kuban River to Nalchik, at an altitude of between 4,620 feet and 7,920 feet. They were all \"visibly constructed according to the same architectural plan, with an oval courtyard in the center, and connected by roads.\"\nCulture\nGolden ox figurine found in the Maykop kurgan (mid-4th millennium BC), [[Hermitage Museum]]\n}}\nArt\nIn the early 20th century, researchers established the existence of a local Maykop animal style in the artifacts found. This style was seen as the prototype for animal styles of later archaeological cultures: the Maykop animal style is more than a thousand years older than the Scythian, Sarmatian and Celtic animal styles.\nAttributed to the Maykop culture are petroglyphs which have yet to be deciphered.\nHorse breeding\nThe Maykop people lived sedentary lives, and horses formed a very low percentage of their livestock, which mostly consisted of pigs and cattle.\nArchaeologists have discovered a unique form of bronze cheek-piece, which consists of a bronze rod with a twisted loop in the middle that threads through the nodes and connects to the bridle, halter strap, and headband. Notches and bumps on the edges of the cheek-pieces were, apparently, to attach nose and under-lip straps.\nSome of the earliest wagon wheels in the world are found in Maykop culture area. The two solid wooden wheels from the kurgan of Novokorsunskaya in the Kuban region have been dated to the second half of the fourth millennium.\nTerrace agriculture\nThe construction of artificial terrace complexes in the mountains is evidence of their sedentary living, high population density, and high levels of agricultural and technical skills. The terraces were built around the fourth millennium BC. and all subsequent cultures used them for agricultural purposes. The vast majority of pottery found on the terraces are from the Maykop period, the rest from the Scythian and Alan period. The Maykop terraces are among the most ancient in the world, but they are little studied. The longevity of the terraces (more than 5000 years) points to a tradition of landscape engineering.\nOrigins\nColchis region\nBased on Wang (2018), David W. Anthony (2019) notes that \"the Maikop population was descended from the Chalcolithic farmers [that] came from the south, probably from western Georgia [the Darkveti-Meshoko culture], and are the ideal archaeological candidate for the founders of the Northwest Caucasian language family.\" He also notes that the Bronze Age Maykop individuals tested by Wang (2018) could not have contributed to the Yamnaya gene pool, Yamnaya being the archeological culture most likely connected to the spread of Indo-European languages. Wang (2018) further found that 'Steppe Maykop' (a population related to the Maykop culture) probably had a minor East Asian-related component, which was estimated at ~6.9% of their ancestry, relating them to Ancient North Eurasians (Upper Palaeolithic Siberians AG3, MA1) and Native Americans.\nPontic–Caspian steppe\nIts burial practices resemble the burial practices described in the Kurgan hypothesis of Marija Gimbutas, and it has been speculated that the Maykop culture may have contributed to the Yamnaya culture which is nowadays recognised as the ancestor of most Indo-European languages. According to a 2019 article by David Anthony,\nHowever, more detailed studies cast doubt on this scenario. The Maykop DNA contains quite a large admixture (30%–40%) of Anatolian Farmer ancestry. Anthony continues:}}\nAnthony agrees that the Maykop culture people probably spoke languages which are ancestral to the Northwest Caucasian languages found in the same region today. Nonetheless, their culture seems to have influenced that of the early Indo-Europeans. Anthony writes:\nIranian Plateau\nAccording to Mariya Ivanova the Maykop origins were on the Iranian Plateau:\nAzerbaijan\nMore recently, some very ancient kurgans have been discovered at Soyuqbulaq in Azerbaijan. These kurgans date to the beginning of the 4th millennium BC, and belong to Leylatepe Culture. According to the excavators of these kurgans, there are some significant parallels between Soyugbulaq kurgans and the Maykop kurgans:\nSee also\n* Lola culture\n* Yamnaya culture\n* Cucuteni-Trypillia culture\n* Varna culture\n* Koban culture\nSources\n*\n*J.
