The next were Toowoomba Golf Club in August 1896 and a few months later Brisbane Golf Club in November 1896. Other clubs quickly followed: Ipswich in 1897; Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Victoria Park (in Brisbane) in 1898, and Gladstone in 1899.\nThe Queensland Golf Union was formed in 1914. Golf Queensland was established in July 2007 from the merger of Queensland Golf Union and Women's Golf Queensland.\nSee also\n* Sport in Queensland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.hulkvehicle.com/product/golf-cart.html Electric Golf Cart]"
