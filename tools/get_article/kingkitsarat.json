Prince Raxabut was executed for adultery in 1700. Kingkitsarat fled to Chiang Rung in Sipsong Panna.\nHe returned with his cousin Ong Kham in 1705. His raised an army, expelled Ong Lo (Sai Ong Viet), the viceroy appointed by Setthathirath II (Sai Ong Hue), and seized Luang Phrabang. Then he marched on Vientiane to attack Setthathirath.
