It was the first election contested by the new Liberal Party. In Ireland, the Liberals increased their seat total. This composed the greater part of the increase of 13 seats for the Liberals led by Viscount Palmerston in the United Kingdom election as a whole, after which they stayed in office. Palmerston died later that year and was succeeded as prime minister by Earl Russell.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Candidates\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Unopposed\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 83\n| align=center| 28\n| align=center| 58\n| align=center| 8\n| align=center| 51,532\n| align=center| 55.6\n| align=center| 5.5\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 61\n| align=\"center\" | 27\n| align=\"center\" | 47\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 41,497\n| align=\"center\" | 44.4\n| align=\"center\" | 5.5\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n| colspan=2 style=text-align:right| Total\n| align=center| 142\n| align=center| 55\n| align=center| 105\n|\n| align=center| 93,029\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\nThe vote total does not include the result from Dublin University\n|55.39}}\n|44.61}}\n}}\n|55.24}}\n|44.76}}\n}}\nSee also\n* History of Ireland (1801–1923)\nReferences"
