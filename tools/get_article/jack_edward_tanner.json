He worked as a longshoreman in Tacoma until his graduation from law school. He received a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Washington School of Law in 1955. He was in private practice in Tacoma from 1955 to 1978. He was a regional leader of the NAACP from 1957 to 1965.\nFederal judicial service\nOn January 20, 1978, Tanner was nominated by President Jimmy Carter to a joint seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, vacated by Judge William Nelson Goodwin. Tanner was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 17, 1978, and received his commission on May 19, 1978, becoming the first black federal judge in the northwest United States. On November 8, 1978, Tanner was reassigned to the Western District alone. He assumed senior status on January 28, 1991, serving in that capacity until his death of pancreatic cancer, on January 10, 2006, in Tacoma.\nSee also\n* List of African-American federal judges\n* List of African-American jurists\n* List of first minority male lawyers and judges in Washington\nReferences\nSources\n*\n|years=1978}}\n|years=1978–1991}}"
