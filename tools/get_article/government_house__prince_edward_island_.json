The vice-regal residence is located in the provincial capital of Charlottetown. It stands in the provincial capital at 1 Terry Fox Drive; while the equivalent building in many provinces has a prominent, central place in the capital, the site of Prince Edward Island's Government House is relatively unobtrusive within Charlottetown, giving it more the character of a private home.\nHistory\ngathered on the steps of Government House for the Charlottetown Conference, 1864]]\nGovernment House was constructed between 1832 and 1834 as a viceregal residence for the lieutenant governor of the then British colony of Prince Edward Island. The land, a parcel of  known as Fanning Bank or ''Fanning's Bank'', was in 1789 set aside by Lieutenant Governor Edmund Fanning as Crown land, with the specific stipulation that it be used as the site for the governor's residence. In 1873, approximately  was retained for Government House and its grounds. 40 acres was given to the City of Charlottetown and later became Victoria Park.\nGovernment House was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1971.\nUse\nGovernment House is the official residence of the lieutenant governor and his or her spouse and \"also serves as a centre of official hospitality in the province\" where many distinguished visitors to Prince Edward Island are entertained. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh stayed at the house during their royal visit in 1959. The house hosts events such as the bestowing of provincial awards or inductions into the Order of Prince Edward Island, as well as luncheons, dinners, receptions, and speaking engagements. It is also at the vice-regal residence that the lieutenant governor drops the writs of election, swears-in new members of the Executive Council, and holds audiences with the premier.\nThe property is owned by the King in Right of Prince Edward Island and is open to the public for certain periods during the summer.\nArchitecture and interiors\nThe wood-frame building's architectural design is Georgian with echoes of the Palladian tradition. The two axis of the house converge on the main entrance hall, which has doric columns and pilasters and a double switchback stair leading to the second floor. The residence was designed by Yorkshire architect Isaac Smith, who also designed the Island's Colonial Building.\nSee also\n* Government Houses in Canada\n* Government Houses of the British Empire\nReferences"
