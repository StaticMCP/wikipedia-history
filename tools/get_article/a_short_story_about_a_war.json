Eric Lowers from Exclaim! said, \"Shad's A Short Story About a War isn't a one-listen album, but rather one with multiple layers that need to be peeled back to fully grasp its concept.\". The Spill Magazine declared the album for Editor's Picks and Nicholas Musilli states that, \"A Short Story About A War delivers the raw reality of injustice, greed, and racism in our present time and space. Shad's sixth studio album stands out as collage of expressionism, a mixed-media of sorts.\" and that \"A Short Story About A War delivers in the most uncomfortable way, while difficult at times, it speaks an honest emotional truth.\" In July 2019, A Short Story about a War was shortlisted for the 2019 Polaris Music Prize.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nThe following personnel are the known album contributors:\n* Tim \"2oolman\" Hill\n* Eternia\n* Ian Kamau\n* Kaytranada\n* Steven Mulcare\n* Lido Pimienta\n* DJ T Lo.\n* Yukon Blonde\n* Paul Chin\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
