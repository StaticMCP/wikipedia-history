It was built in 1825–1826, and is a one-story, frame dwelling with Greek Revival style interior decorative details.  It originally had an \"H\" shape, but was subsequently expanded with several additions.  It features a distinctive elongated octagonal wing at the west end, inspired by nearby Violet Bank.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/va0318/ Oak Hill, 151 Carroll Avenue, Colonial Heights, Colonial Heights, VA]: 6 photos and 2 data pages at Historic American Buildings Survey"
