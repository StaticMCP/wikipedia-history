It was designated as the 3rd National Treasure of Korea on December 20, 1962.\nThe stone monument was originally erected on the peak Bibong () of the mountain Bukhansan. The exact date of its creation is unclear, as the era name is illegible. However, it is believed to be from around 561 CE or 568 CE because the Changnyeongbi Monument and the Hwangchoryeongbi Monument were built on those dates respectively. It was rediscovered in 1816 during the reign of Emperor Sunjo by Kim Chŏnghŭi, a famous calligrapher. It was subsequently moved to Gyeongbokgung Palace for safekeeping and is now displayed in the National Museum of Korea.\nThe rectangular monument is built on a two-story pedestal. Because the monument was exposed to the elements for 1400 years it has suffered weathering and erosion damage. It is currently 154 centimeters high and 69 centimeters wide.\nThe monument is valuable for the historical information inscribed on its surface. It is written in a cursive regular script. There are 12 lines with 32 characters per line. The inscription praises the Silla King Jinheung's (r. 540–575) territorial expansion into the Han River valley and commemorates the occasion when the king came and inspected the new borders of his realm. The inscription explains why the monument was built, describes the achievements of King Jinheung, and also describes the royal retinue.\nSee also\n*National treasures of Korea\n*Stele\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cha.go.kr/english/search_plaza/ECulresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,00030000,11 Cultural Heritage Administration: Bukhansan Monument]"
