It was released on November 20, 2006, internationally, and November 21, 2006, in the United States and Canada. It was her first studio album after a 9-year gap. It has sold over a half a million copies worldwide since its release.\nOverview\nWork on An Ancient Muse started in 2005. According to reports on McKennitt's Quinlan Road website, most of the inspiration for the tracks of the album came from the music of Greece, Turkey, the Middle East and the Far East. Most of the tracks, with the exception of three revealed at the mid-September concerts in the Alhambra of Granada in Spain, were completely unknown until the release.\nAn Ancient Muse debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 83, with about 19,000 copies sold in its first week. This was also its peak position on the chart.\nTrack listing\nAll music and lyrics written by Loreena McKennitt except as noted.\n# \"Incantation\" – 2:35\n# \"The Gates of Istanbul\" – 6:59\n# \"Caravanserai\" – 7:36\n# \"The English Ladye and the Knight\" (lyrics by Sir Walter Scott) – 6:49\n# \"Kecharitomene\" – 6:34\n# \"Penelope's Song\" – 4:21\n# \"Sacred Shabbat\" (Kâtibim arr.
