He came to the United States as a stowaway on a freighter and began acting on stage in New York.\nOn Broadway, Warburton portrayed Cyril Beverley in Bird in Hand (1930). His film career began with RKO's Secrets of the French Police (1932). His work on television included performing on 35 episodes of Fireside Theater. He also guest-starred in television series such as Perry Mason and the Star Trek episode \"Balance of Terror\".\nIn 1933, Warburton was in the center of legal trouble in Los Angeles. A grand jury indicted two men for beating and robbing Warburton in revenge for his alleged beating of actress Alice White. She testified that an argument at a party led to Warburton's battery, which resulted in her spending four days in bed to recover.\nPersonal life\nAmong Warburton's five wives were Ruth Selwyn and Lucille Morrison.\nDeath\nHe died of cancer in Sherman Oaks, California at age 78.\nSelected filmography\n*The Silver Lining (1932) as Larry Clark\n*Secrets of the French Police (1932) as Leon Renault\n*Cavalcade (1933) as Edward Marryot\n*Love Is Dangerous (1933) as Steve\n*A Study in Scarlet (1933) as John Stanford\n*Blind Adventure (1933) as Reggie\n*''Charlie Chan's Greatest Case (1933) as John Quincy Winterslip\n* Love Is Dangerous (1933) as Steve\n*Let's Talk It Over (1934) as Alex Winters\n*Dizzy Dames (1935) as Rodney Stokes\n*Becky Sharp (1935) as Beau Brummel (uncredited)\n*Partners of the Plains (1938) as Ronald Harwood\n*The Sisters (1938) as Anthony Bittick\n*Captain Fury (1939) as Bob\n*The White Cliffs of Dover (1944) as Reggie Ashwood\n*Marriage Is a Private Affair (1944) as Chris (uncredited)\n*Nothing but Trouble (1944) as Ronetz\n*The Valley of Decision (1945) as Giles\n*Dangerous Partners (1945) as Clyde Ballister\n*Confidential Agent (1945) as Neil Forbes\n*Saratoga Trunk (1945) as Bartholomew Van Steed\n*Tarzan and the Huntress (1947) as Carl Marley\n*Living in a Big Way'' (1947) as 'Skippy' Stuart Simms\n*Bronco Buster (1952) as Crawford (uncredited)\n*City Beneath the Sea (1953) as Captain Clive\n*East of Sumatra (1953) as Gregory Keith\n*The Royal African Rifles (1953) as Col.
