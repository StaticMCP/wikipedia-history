It is Kokia's second most commercially successful single after \"The Power of Smile/Remember the Kiss,\" due to being used as the daytime TV drama Itoshiki Mono e's theme song.\nBackground\nThis single was the Kokia's first to be released under Victor Entertainment management, after being managed under Gai Records for her second album Trip Trip and Pony Canyon for her debut Songbird.- -  Previous to this single, Kokia had found severely limited chart success. Despite releasing two albums and 8 singles, only one of these had charted at all, \"Aishiteiru Kara\" at #99.\nPromotion\nOther than \"Kawaranai Koto (Since 1976)\" being featured in Itoshiki Mono e, the single was promoted in a variety of ways. The B-side \"Tell Tell Bōzu\" was used as the second ending theme song to the anime Hungry Heart: Wild Striker. Kokia was featured in many music-related and fashion-related magazines in May 2003, such as \"Barfout,\" \"Caz,\" \"CD Hits,\" \"Gekkan Piano,\" \"Girl Pop,\" \"Grand Magasin,\" \"What's In?\" and \"Zappy.\"\nComposition\n\"Kawaranai Koto (Since 1976)\" is a mid-tempo pop song, featuring a sparse piano, percussion and occasional strings arrangement. The two choruses, however, feature a band arrangement with added guitars and percussion. The lyrics express somebody thanking a person they have been watching over and protecting for making them realise how much they loved them, despite being unable to express this to them. The lyrics ask the person's beloved to \"instead of say thank you, look at me.\"\nMusic video\nKokia in the music video for \"Kawaranai Koto (Since 1976).\"\nThe music video was directed by Jun Hara (原淳).
