On 30 July 1919, it became a separate legal entity and was granted the status of an institution of higher education. The school was renamed Szkoła Główna Handlowa (SGH) in 1933. After World War II, SGH was nationalized and its name changed to Szkoła Główna Planowania i Statystyki (Main School of Planning and Statistics), abbreviation SGPiS. The school regained its pre-war name after the fall of communism in 1991.\nSGH Warsaw School of Economics offers courses leading to bachelor's or master's degrees to both full-time and extramural students. It also provides programs for doctoral and postgraduate degrees. Its Finance and Accounting program was ranked among the Top 60 Masters in Management by the Financial Times in 2018.\nSGH Warsaw School of Economics cooperates with around 200 higher education institutions worldwide within student and staff exchange areas. It is a member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), the Erasmus Programme, the Partnership in International Management Network (PIM), and the European University Association (EUA).\nThe main campus is located at the northern edge of the Mokotów district of Warsaw. Bus and tram stops, as well as the Pole Mokotowskie metro station, are nearby.\nOrganizational structure\nSGH Warsaw School of Economics abandoned the traditional departmental structure segregating students based on their major.\nProfessors and research and teaching programs are grouped in five Colleges (Collegiums) and several extra-collegial units, such as the foreign language teaching center.\nCourses offered\nFull-time and part-time studies are conducted in two levels. Bachelor studies, which last for six semesters, lead to a Bachelor's professional title. Holders of such a title may apply for a place and begin Master's studies, which last for four semesters. Accumulating the required minimum points, as well as credit terms, is necessary to earn a diploma. Individual subjects are divided into mandatory selections for particular fields, optional for those subjects, additional courses that develop knowledge unrelated to specific subjects, and courses essential for all economists. Certain subjects can have different numbers of points for each of these types of items.\nSGH full-time students are offered the following fields of study in Polish:\n* Economics,\n* European Master in Law and Economics,\n* European Studies,\n* Finance and Accounting,\n* Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems,\n* Management (Business Administration),\n* Public Sector Economics (Public Administration),\n* Social Policy,\n* Spatial Economic Policy,\n* International Economics,\n* Big Data.\nFrom the 2006/2007 Academic Year SGH Studies are divided into:\n* Bachelor's Studies (undergraduate) – 6-semester\n* Master's Studies (graduate) – 4-semester\n* Doctoral Studies – 6-semester\n* System based on ECTS credits\nDuring the first three semesters, all SGH students study basic macro- and micro-economics, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, social science, law, history, geography, and languages. After passing the required examinations for the first three semesters, they must register for one of the six offered areas of study. The BA degree is granted after completing a required number of credits (about six semesters of studies), and the MA (MSc) degree is awarded after completing about eight to ten semesters (including six semesters for the BA), which is the maximum period of tuition-free study at SGH. Students do not necessarily have a BA diploma before applying for a master's degree. The time required for the degree in the given specialization depends mostly on the students themselves due to the free choice of courses (some limitations apply), professors, and the maximum workload per semester.\nInternational cooperation\nSGH cooperates with over 250 foreign universities, as well as with many international organizations. The main partners are universities from the European Union, North America, and Asia. Each year, the international exchange involves about 500 SGH students, and the university hosts over 300 students from foreign institutes. Significant international cooperation programs include LLP Erasmus, CEMS (The Global Alliance in Management Education), Polish-German Academic Forum at SGH, Partnership in International Management (PIM), as well as double diploma programs (i.e. with Technische Universität Berlin), and other bilateral agreements.\nStudent organizations\nThe Student Union, an elective body representing all SGH students in the School's Senate and participating in setting all study regulations, provides students with housing and financial aid as well as organizes a wide range of cultural events.\nCollegia\n* Collegium of Economic Analysis (Kolegium Analiz Ekonomicznych)\n* Collegium of Socio-Economics (Kolegium Ekonomiczno-Społeczne)\n* Collegium of World Economy (Kolegium Gospodarki Światowej)\n* Collegium of Business Administration (Kolegium Nauk o Przedsiębiorstwie)\n* Collegium of Management and Finance (Kolegium Zarządzania i Finansów)\nLibrary\nThe Library of SGH Warsaw School of Economics is the largest economics library in Poland, with 786,334 volumes of monographs, 216,778 volumes of serials, 983 titles of subscribed periodicals – Polish and foreign, and approximately titles 30,000 foreign journals in electronic form.\nThe SGH Library holdings are organized in several collections. Each collection is available in different departments, on defined conditions: free access, library order slips, or borrowing. Students are allowed to borrow books exclusively from the Students’ Lending Library.\nGospodarka Narodowa: The Polish Journal of Economics\nGospodarka Narodowa. The Polish Journal of Economics is a quarterly scientific journal publishing leading research across all economics and economic policy fields. The journal was established in 1931.
