As of the 2010 Census, its population was&nbsp;1,527.\nHistory\nDiamond deposits were discovered in the area in 1954, in conjunction with which the nearby selo of Novy was founded in the same year. Almazny was founded in 1960 as a dormitory settlement for mine workers, and was granted urban-type settlement status in 1962.\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, the urban-type settlement of Almazny, together with two rural localities, is incorporated within Mirninsky District as the Settlement of Almazny. As a municipal division, the Settlement of Almazny is incorporated within Mirninsky Municipal District as Almazny Urban Settlement.\nEconomy and infrastructure\nEmployment in Almazny centers on diamond extraction from placer deposits in the valley of the Irelyakh River, using three specially-built semi-stationary dredgers.\nAlmazny lies on the Vilyuy Highway, which connects the diamond mining town of Mirny with the republic capital of Yakutsk. The road junction to Aykhal and Udachny, which is planned to be expanded into the Anabar Highway and ultimately connect to the Arctic Ocean coast in the Anabar River region,  is located  west of Almazny>\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*Official website of the Sakha Republic.
