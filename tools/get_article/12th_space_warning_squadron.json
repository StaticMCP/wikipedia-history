The BMEWS site is located approximately 11 miles northwest of Pituffik SB .  It provides early warning detection of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches from the Russian land mass and submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launches from the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans against North America. Additionally, BMEWS keeps track of polar orbiting satellites. The operational crews report through the Missile Warning Center to the NORAD/USNORTHCOM Center.\nThe Operation Support Flight (DOO) provides direct operational support to the missile warning crews. The flight's Operations Training Section (DOT) provides all crew force initial, recurring, and supplemental training. Other flight responsibilities include hardware, software and maintenance support (MA), operational test and evaluation (DOV), and crew force management (DOU).\nHistory\nThe 12th SWS was formed in January 1967 as a successor organization to the Air Defense Command 931st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, which was inactivated at the end of 1965. The 931st AC&WS operated a series of Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) radar sites in Greenland to detect intrusion of unknown aircraft. The squadron relayed information to the 64th NORAD Region Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system DC-31 Direction Center, and interceptor squadrons stationed at Thule Air Base.\nWith the development of ICBM and SLBM technologies, the mission to monitor aircraft coming over the horizon from the Soviet Union was transferred to other units, and the 931st AC&WS at Thule AB was inactivated.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 12th Missile Warning Squadron on 1 November 1966\n: Activated on 1 January 1967\n: Redesignated 12th Missile Warning Group on 31 March 1977\n: Redesignated 12th Missile Warning Squadron on 15 June 1983\n: Redesignated 12th Missile Warning Group on 1 October 1989\n: Redesignated 12th Space Warning Squadron on 15 May 1992\nAssignments\n* 71st Missile Warning Wing, 1 January 1967\n* Fourteenth Aerospace Force, 30 April 1971\n* 21st Air Division, 1 October 1976\n* Aerospace Defense Command, 1 October 1979\n* 40th Air Division, 1 December 1979\n* 1st Space Wing, 1 May 1993\n* 21st Operations Group, 15 May 1992\n* 21st Space Wing, 1 June 1995\n* 21st Operations Group, 1 August 1999\n* Space Delta 4, 24 July 2020 – Present\nBases stationed\n* Pituffik Space Base, Greenland, 1 January 1967 – present\nEquipment operated\nBallistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS)\nList of commanders\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
