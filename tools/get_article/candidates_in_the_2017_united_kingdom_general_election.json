is traditional, the Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats did not stand in the constituency of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Buckingham, although both the Green Party of England and Wales and the UK Independence Party contested the seat. Otherwise, the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats stood in all constituencies, except the Liberal Democrats who did not field candidates in Brighton Pavilion and Skipton and Ripon with local parties having decided to support the Green candidates there instead.\nUKIP and the Green Party of England and Wales stood in many constituencies across England, but both put up candidates in fewer seats than in 2015. In some cases, local parties opted to support other candidates: UKIP local parties stood aside to support Conservatives, while Green local parties stood aside in around 30 seats to support candidates from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, or, in one case, the National Health Action Party.\nAmong parties standing solely in England, the Christian Peoples Alliance stood 30 candidates, the Yorkshire Party put up 21 candidates, and the British National Party  ten.  The Workers' Revolutionary Party contested five seats, as did the National Health Action Party.  The Animal Welfare Party, Liberal Party and Libertarian Party each had four candidates.  The English Democrats, the Alliance for Green Socialism, Communist League, Socialist Labour Party, Socialist Party of Great Britain, Justice and Anti-Corruption Party, Friend's Party and Young People's Party UK stood in three seats each. The Peace Party had two candidates, and various parties stood single candidates.\nOther parties standing candidates in England included the Official Monster Raving Loony Party with eleven, the Pirate Party UK with nine, the Women's Equality Party with five, and the Social Democratic Party with five, all in Sheffield.

Unusually, all forty members of the previous Parliament from Wales stood for reelection.\nAmong minor parties, the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, New Society of Worth, Pirate Party UK, and Women's Equality Party each stood one candidate in Wales, and there were a number of independent candidates.\nNorthern Ireland\nIn Northern Ireland, a total of 109 candidates stood, down from 138 in 2015.  Sinn Féin, the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland stood in all eighteen seats.  The Democratic Unionist Party stood in 17, the Ulster Unionist Party in 15, and the Green Party in Northern Ireland and Conservatives in Northern Ireland both standing in seven.\nIn addition, the People Before Profit Alliance and Workers' Party ran in two seats each, Traditional Unionist Voice and Citizens Independent Social Thought Alliance in one each, and were are four independent candidates.
