The ceremony was jointly hosted by Shahrukh Khan and Ranbir Kapoor. Incidentally, both of them have hosted the award ceremonies previously but with different co-hosts (Khan with Saif Ali Khan, Kapoor with Imran Khan), hence making it the first time for this pair to host the show. The 57th Filmfare awards were televised on 19 February 2012 to the public.\nThe nominations for the awards were announced on 11 January 2012. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara led the ceremony with 13 nominations, followed by Rockstar with 10 nominations, Delhi Belly with 7 nominations and The Dirty Picture with 6 nominations.\nZindagi Na Milegi Dobara won 7 awards, including Best Film, Best Film (Critics), Best Director (both for Zoya Akhtar) and Best Supporting Actor (for Farhan Akhtar), thus becoming the most-awarded film at the ceremony.\nThe 2012 awards thus equaled 2011 (Udaan) for the maximum number of awards won by a single film, and this also marked the largest award tally for a single film since 2007 (Omkara).\n2012 also marked the first time after 2010 (3 Idiots) that the film with the most nominations also won the most awards.\nRanbir Kapoor won his first Best Actor award and second Best Actor (Critics) award for his role of Janardhan / Jordan in Rockstar, while Vidya Balan won her fourth Filmfare Award and second Best Actress award for her portrayal of Silk / Reshma in The Dirty Picture (in addition to a second Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony for her performance in No One Killed Jessica).\nAwards and nominees\nMain awards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" |Best Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" |Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara – Farhan Akhtar, Ritesh Sidhwani\n**Delhi Belly – Aamir Khan, Kiran Rao, Ronnie Screwvala\n**Don 2 – Farhan Akhtar, Ritesh Sidhwani, Shahrukh Khan\n**No One Killed Jessica – Ronnie Screwvala\n**Rockstar – Dhilin Mehta\n**The Dirty Picture – Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Zoya Akhtar – Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara'\n** Abhinay Deo – Delhi Belly\n** Farhan Akhtar – Don 2\n** Imtiaz Ali – Rockstar\n** Milan Luthria – The Dirty Picture\n** Raj Kumar Gupta – No One Killed Jessica\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Actress\n|-\n|\n* 'Ranbir Kapoor – Rockstar' as Janardhan \"Jordan\" Jakhar\n**Ajay Devgn – Singham as Bajirao Singham\n** Amitabh Bachchan – Aarakshan as Prabhakar Anand\n** Hrithik Roshan – Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara as Arjun\n** Salman Khan – Bodyguard as Lovely Singh\n** Shah Rukh Khan – Don 2 as Don\n|\n* 'Vidya Balan – The Dirty Picture as Reshma / Silk Smitha'\n** Katrina Kaif – Mere Brother Ki Dulhan as Dimple Dixit\n** Mahie Gill – Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster as Madhavi\n** Priyanka Chopra – 7 Khoon Maaf as Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes\n** Vidya Balan – No One Killed Jessica as Sabrina Lal\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Supporting Actor\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Supporting Actress\n|-\n|\n*'Farhan Akhtar – Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara as Imran Qureshi'\n**Abhay Deol – Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara as Kabir Dewan\n**Naseeruddin Shah – The Dirty Picture as Suryakanth\n**Pitobash Tripathy – Shor in the City as Mandook\n**Vir Das – Delhi Belly as Arup\n|\n*'Rani Mukerji – No One Killed Jessica as Meera Gaity'\n**Juhi Chawla – I Am as Megha\n**Kalki Koechlin – Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara as Natasha Arora\n**Parineeti Chopra – Ladies vs Ricky Bahl as Dimple Chaddha\n**Swara Bhaskar – Tanu Weds Manu as Payal Jassi Gill\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Male Debut\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Female Debut\n|-\n|\n*'Vidyut Jamwal – Force'\n**Gulshan Devaiah – Dum Maaro Dum, Shaitan, That Girl in Yellow Boots\n**Partho Gupte – Stanley Ka Dabba\n**Rana Daggubati – Dum Maaro Dum\n**Shiv Panditt – Shaitan\n|\n*'Parineeti Chopra – Ladies vs Ricky Bahl'\n**Kajal Aggarwal – Singham\n**Kriti Malhotra – Dhobi Ghat\n**Monica Dogra – Dhobi Ghat\n**Myra – No One Killed Jessica\n**Nargis Fakhri – Rockstar\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Music Director\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\" | Best Lyricist\n|-\n|\n*'A.
