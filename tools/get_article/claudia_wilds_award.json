Wilds was author of an important bird finding guide to the mid-Atlantic states and co-author of a handbook of the world's terns and skimmers, completed after her death.  Wilds served on the board of the ABA, was an associate editor of Birding magazine, wrote articles for The Audubon Society Master Guide to Birding, and was a consultant in the preparation of the National Geographic Society's field guide. She herself was posthumously awarded the ABA's Ludlow Griscom Award in 1998.\nThe Claudia Wilds Award was first bestowed on Larry Balch.\nList of recipients\nThe award was introduced in 2000.\nSource:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
