Former WRQ president Craig McKibben was CEO.\n* 2006: NetMotion merged with Padcom, Inc.\n* 2012: NetMotion was acquired by Clearlake Capital Group.\n* 2016: NetMotion was acquired by The Carlyle Group, with a new CEO.\nIn 2021, NetMotion was acquired by Absolute Software for an estimated US$340 million.\nNetMotion is headquartered in Seattle, Washington with offices in Chicago, London, Tokyo and Sydney. The company added a second headquarters in Victoria, British Columbia in 2019.\nProducts\nNetMotion products allow users to transition from traditional secure remote access technologies to a zero-trust approach, without affecting productivity or admin controls.  Fundamentally, it consists of client software on each mobile device, which communicates with a control server in the cloud or data center that pushes policies and actions to the client for execution. Through this architecture that gives administrators control of the endpoints, they can manage application delivery based on changing network conditions through software, regardless of the combination of networks used, including cellular and Wi-Fi networks that are outside of their direct administrative control.\nAn enhanced filtering feature named Aware was added in 2019.\nIn July, 2020, a new release of the software added the term software-defined perimeter (SDP).\nIn late 2020, NetMotion’s products were marketed with the term secure access service edge.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7136645B2/en  Patent by NetMotion Wireless, Inc.]"
