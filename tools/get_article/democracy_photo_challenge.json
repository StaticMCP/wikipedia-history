An independent jury narrowed the submissions to 36 finalists representing each region of the world.  The online public then voted for their favorites.  In total, more than half a million people took part in the voting.\nThe 12 winners were announced on September 15, 2010 during International Day of Democracy.  The winning photographs were displayed at the United Nations.\nJury\nThe 2010 jury was co-chaired by documentary photographer Phil Borges, International Center of Photography director Willis Hartshorn and Academy Award-winning director Louie Psihoyos.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
