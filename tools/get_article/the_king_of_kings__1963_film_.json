This error sets off a series of comedic events as Lojza is thrust into a world of political intrigue and social pretension.\nAs Lojza attempts to clarify his identity, he becomes entangled in the agendas of those around him. Izmail el Sarif ben Serfi (Miloš Kopecký), a foreign diplomat, seeks to manipulate the situation for his own gain, while Lenka, a coiffeuse, becomes an unlikely ally and potential romantic interest. The situation becomes further complicated when an assassin, Poupard, targets Lojza under the belief that he is the intended victim.\nCast\n* Jiří Sovák as Lojza Králu - mounter\n* Miloš Kopecký as Izmail el Sarif ben Serfi\n* Vlastimil Brodský as Eda Brabec\n* Jiřina Bohdalová as Coiffeuse Lenka\n*  as Assassin Poupard\n* Jiří Němeček as Company director\n* Ilja Prachař as Novák - Officer of Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Zdeněk Řehoř as Pantucek - Officer of Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Eduard Kohout as Deputy minister\n* Jan Skopeček as Chamberlain\n* Ota Motyčka as Janitor in factory\n* Lubomír Kostelka as Teacher of language\n* Zdenek Braunschläger as Constructor\n* Josef Bartůněk as Guard\n* Jitka Frantová as Prostitute\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
