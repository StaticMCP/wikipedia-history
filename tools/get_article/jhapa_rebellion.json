The government of Nepal attempted to suppress the rebellion and the large number of rebels were arrested. Among them some were illegally killed by the police forces, sending them in a dense jungle Sukhani under the false pretext of a jail transfer in order to suppress the rebellion and to stop it from turning into a full blown revolution.\nReferences"
