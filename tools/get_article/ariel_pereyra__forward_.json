There he played more than 100 games and scored 26 goals. In 1998, he moved to Chile and joined to Santiago Wanderers. He had an unsuccessful spell at Valparaíso's side. That season Wanderers was relegated to the Primera B after finishing in the annual table's bottom. Following a brief spell in Coquimbo Unido in 2001, the incoming year he moved to Everton (Wanderers' archi–rival), where he helped the team to won the 2003 Primera B championship (Chile second-level tournament).\nIn June 2005, after the entire 2004 in Venezuelan football playing for Italmaracaibo, Pereyra returned to Chile, signing for Unión La Calera, where he coincided with players such as Víctor Rivero and Christian Riffo. There he broke a record after reaching score more than 100 goals in the Chilean football. In 2008 he was Primera B tournament goalscorer.\nIn late 2010, he left Unión La Calera after five years playing there. After his unusual decision to disassociate from Unión La Calera (considering which the team achieved the promotion to 2011 Primera División de Chile season), then he moved to Curicó Unido, when he played two seasons (2011 and 2012).\nManagerial career\nIn 2021, he was the manager of San Antonio Unido in the Segunda División Profesional de Chile. In 2022, he worked as the manager of Deportes Melipilla.\nHonours\nClub\n;Everton\n* Primera B (1): 2003\n;Unión La Calera\n* Primera B (1): Runner-up 2010\nIndividual\n* Primera B goalscorer (2): 2010, 2011\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.football-lineups.com/footballer/34413/ Ariel Pereyra] at Football-Lineups\n*\n}}"
