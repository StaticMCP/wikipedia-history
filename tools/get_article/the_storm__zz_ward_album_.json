The album reached number 1 on the Billboard Blues Albums chart.\nProduction\nWard has said The Storm is influenced by the music of blues artists including Howlin' Wolf, Robert Johnson and Big Mama Thornton. Prior to the album's release, on March 2, 2017, Ward released the single \"The Deep\", featuring Chicago MC Joey Purp. The track is built around a sample of \"As Long As I've Got You\" by The Charmels, which is also sampled in \"C.R.E.A.M.\" by Wu-Tang Clan. The track \"Ride\" featuring Gary Clark, Jr. was originally featured in the 2017 Pixar film Cars 3. Ward performed the song on Dancing with the Stars on April 17, 2017. The music video for the single \"Cannonball\" was released in July 2017; it features blues singer Fantastic Negrito, with Ward playing harmonica on the song.\nTrack listing\n| extra_column  = Producer\n| title1        = Ghost\n| writer1       = Evan Bogart, Trevor Brown, Warren \"Oak\" Felder, Zaire Koalo, Zsuzsanna Ward\n| extra1        = Felder\n| length1       = 3:00\n| title2        = Cannonball\n| note2         = featuring Fantastic Negrito\n| writer2       = Xavier Dphrepaulezz, Ward\n| extra2        = Blended Babies\n| length2       = 3:58\n| title3        = Help Me Mama\n| writer3       = Bogart, Theron Feemster, Priscilla Renea, Ward\n| extra3        = Feemster\n| length3       = 3:06\n| title4        = The Storm\n| writer4       = Ward\n| extra4        = Feemster\n| length4       = 3:13\n| title5        = Domino\n| note5         = featuring Fitz\n| writer5       = Feemster, Michael Fitzpatrick, Ward\n| extra5        = Feemster, Fitzpatrick\n| length5       = 2:50\n| title6        = Let It Burn\n| writer6       = Bogart, Brown, Felder, Koalo, Ward\n| extra6        = Felder\n| length6       = 3:08\n| title7        = Bag of Bones\n| writer7       = Ward\n| extra7        = Feemster\n| length7       = 3:17\n| title8        = She Ain't Me\n| writer8       = Ludwig Göransson, Ward\n| extra8        = Göransson\n| length8       = 2:51\n| title9        = If U Stayed\n| writer9       = Ward\n| extra9        = Feemster\n| length9       = 3:33\n| title10       = Hold On\n| writer10      = Bogart, Brown, Felder, Ward\n| extra10       = Felder\n| length10      = 3:12\n| title11       = Ride\n| note11        = featuring Gary Clark Jr.) (bonus track\n| writer11      = Dave Bassett, Bogart, Ward\n| extra11       = Bassett\n| length11      = 4:05\n}}\nPersonnel\n* ZZ Ward – vocals, guitars, harmonica, drum programming, percussion, engineering\n* Trevor Brown – guitars, bass, background vocals\n* Erick Walls – guitars\n* Jonathan Keller – guitars, bass, drum programming, percussion, engineering\n* Theron \"Neff U\" Feemster – piano, keyboards, guitars, drum programming, string arrangements, engineering\n* Rich Parry – drum programming, percussion, engineering\n* Gary Clark, Jr. – guitars\n* Fantastic Negrito – vocals\n* Michael Fitzpatrick – vocals, keyboards, drum programming, engineering\n* Ludwig Göransson – programming, keyboards, guitars, bass, vocal engineering\n* Bianca McClure – violin\n* Thomas Drayton – bass\n* Zaire Koalo – background vocals\n* Warren \"Oak\" Felder – programming, engineering, background vocals\n* E.
