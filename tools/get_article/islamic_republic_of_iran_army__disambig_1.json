It is tasked to protect the territorial integrity of the country from external and internal threats and to project power.\nThe Artesh has its own Joint Staff which coordinates its four separate service branches: the Islamic Republic of Iran Army Ground Forces, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force, the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy and the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Defense Force.\nIn addition to the army, Iran also maintains the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a separate military force established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It was established by a decree of May 1979. The IRGC is tasked with safeguarding the ideological foundations of the Islamic Republic and defending the regime against internal and external threats. It operates its own ground, naval, and air units, as well as the elite Quds Force, which is responsible for extraterritorial operations. The IRGC functions independently of the Artesh and often holds significant influence in strategic, security, and economic affairs within the country.\nThe dual military structure of the Artesh and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has led to structural inefficiencies, these include overlapping command hierarchies, redundant logistics networks, and parallel military systems across all service branches.  This setup has been criticized for its lack of transparency, limited parliamentary oversight, and its questionable contribution to national defense.\nHistory\nClassical antiquity\nEarly modern\nA U.S. Director of Central Intelligence approved estimate wrote in December 1954:\nSince 1950 the US has assisted in efforts to modernize and improve the armed forces through maintenance of military missions to the army and the gendarmerie, and through provision of military equipment. Of the $110 million in such equipment aid allocated thus far, about $76 million had been shipped by mid-1954. The mission to the army is to be augmented by five U.S. training teams at brigade or division level in early 1955. The Iranian armed forces consist of a conscript army of 120,000; a gendarmerie or rural police force of 20,000; and a small air force, navy, and frontier guard, the latter for border patrol and customs duties. The Air Force, Navy, and Frontier Guard are subordinate units of the Army. The Gendarmerie is under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, except in time of war, when it comes under army command.\nMissions and deployments\nbattalion in a 2012 parade|left]]\n|left]]\nThe Iranian army has fought against two major invasions in contemporary times. The 1941 invasion by the Allies of World War II resulted in a decisive loss for the Iranian forces, the deposition of Iran's Shah and five years of subsequent occupation, while the 1980 Iraqi invasion began the Iran–Iraq War, which lasted almost eight years and ended in status quo ante bellum. The army has also been actively engaged in quelling tribal and separatist rebellions beginning in the 1940s in order to protect Iran's territorial integrity.\nExtraterritorial operations\nFrom 1972 to 1976, Iranian troops were sent to Oman to fight with the Royal Army of Oman against the Dhofar Rebellion. In 1976, a contingent was sent to Pakistan to assist the Pakistan Army against the Insurgency in Balochistan. Iranian personnel were also reportedly present in the Vietnam War.\nIn 2016, members of the special forces of Iran were deployed to fight in the Syrian civil war.\nInternational peacekeeping missions\nThe Iranian Army participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions in the 1970s. It sent a battalion to replace Peruvian forces in the Golan Heights as part of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. After the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the bulk of the forces were part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon until late 1978. Replaced by Finnish forces, Iranian peacekeepers were withdrawn in 1979 following the Islamic revolution.\nIn 1993, the Iranian Army reestablished its professional peacekeeping units and declared that they are ready to be dispatched at the UN's directive. Since then, Iran has deployed forces in Ethiopia and Eritrea in 2003 and the African Union Mission in Darfur in 2012.\nThe Iranian Army's maritime branch has launched several missions to fight piracy off the coast of Somalia, securing the release of many other countries' sailors.\nAid missions\nThe Iranian Army has deployed forces to help the Red Lion and Sun and Red Crescent societies in rescue and relief missions after domestic natural disasters, including clearing roads, reestablishing communications, supplying goods, airlifting equipment, transporting casualties and personnel and setting up field hospitals and post-hospital care centres.\nFuture missions\nIn 2021, the Iranian Army had announced that it will launch a satellite into space.\nAnniversary\nEquipment\nCommanders\nMilitary academies\nSymbols and uniforms\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Branch\n!rowspan=2|Insignia\n!rowspan=2|Flag\n!colspan=3|Uniform colors and patterns\n|-\n!Service\n!Combat\n!Specialized\n|-\n|Ground Force\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Air Defence Force\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Air Force\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Navy\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\n* Rank insignia of the Iranian military\n* Military history of Iran\n* Pasdar (IRGC)\nReferences\n*\n* Central Intelligence Agency, [https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP01-00707R000200070042-2.pdf National Intelligence Survey, Iran, Armed Forces] (c.1973)\nExternal links\n* [http://aja.ir/Portal/Home/ Official site of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army]"
