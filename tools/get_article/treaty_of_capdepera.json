The treaty was signed at the Castle of Capdepera, in what was known as the \"Torre den Nunis\". The treaty  permitted the island of Menorca to remain under Muslim rule, while remaining subject to the Aragonese king by means of the payment of a tribute.\nHaving conquered Majorca, James I decided against an invasion of the neighbouring island because he needed the forces for the conquest of Valencia. Thus he resorted to a stratagem of dissuasion. He ordered huge bonfires, which could be seen from Menorca, to be lit in the town so that the Muslims who lived there would think that there was a great army ready to invade. The committee in charge of going to Menorca to parley was formed by the Master of the Knights Templar, Fray Ramón de Serra, the knight Bernardo de Santa Eugenia, and Pero Masa, lord of Sangarrén.\nReferences"
