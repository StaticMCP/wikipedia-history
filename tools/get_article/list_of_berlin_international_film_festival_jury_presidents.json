      "text": "# List of Berlin International Film Festival jury presidents\n\nEach year, the jury of the Berlin International Film Festival is chaired by an internationally recognised personality of cinema. Being appointed to this position is the recognition of an outstanding career. This article lists all past presidents of the international jury, which is responsible for awarding the most prestigious prizes in the festival, including the Golden Bear and various Silver Bears.\nHistory\nThe winners of the first awards in 1951 were determined by an exclusively West German panel. The FIAPF (Fédération Internationale des Associations de Producteurs de Films) banned the awarding of jury prizes at the festival so between 1952 and 1955, the winners of the Golden Bear were determined by the audience members.\nIn 1956, FIAPF formally accredited the festival and since then the Golden Bear has been awarded by an international jury. In 2021 a jury presidency was not appointed for the first time since creation of the position.\nThe first foreign president of the jury and inaugural holder of this position was French film director Marcel Carné. The first woman who held the office of president of the jury was dancer Wendy Toye.\nSince creation, no one has been appointed as president of the jury more than once.\nMain competition jury presidents\n, 1962 president.|thumb|225x225px]]\n, 1977 president.|thumb|255x255px]]\n, 2005 president.|236x236px]]\n, 2010 president.|thumb|240x240px]]\n, 2019 president.|thumb|215x215px]]\n, 2020 president.|thumb|270x270px]]\n, 2025 president.|thumb|243x243px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
