Administratively it is part of the Northeast Greenland National Park zone.\nThe highest point of Queen Louise Land is Gefiontinde, with a height of , the highest of the Gefiontinder group of peaks located at .\nGeologically Queen Louise Land is made up of orthogneiss overlain by sedimentary rocks.\nHistory\n() who the region is named after]]\nThis remote area was named Dronning Louises Land after Queen Louise of Denmark (1851–1926), wife of King Frederik VIII of Denmark, by the ill-fated 1906–08 Denmark Expedition —the expedition that aimed to map one of the last unknown parts of Greenland. Danish Arctic explorer Alf Trolle claimed that this area had been originally named as Den Store Nanuták —The Big Nunatak.\nQueen Louise Land was subsequently visited by the 1912–13 Danish Expedition to Queen Louise Land led by J.P. Koch, as well as the 1952–54 British North Greenland Expedition led by Commander James Simpson.\nGeography\nSurrounded by ice masses, Queen Louise Land is clearly delimited. It is an extensive area made up of several very large and numerous small nunataks (summits or ridges of mountains that protrude from the ice). Its western boundary is the Greenland ice sheet and its eastern limits are the massive Storstrommen and L. Bistrup Brae glaciers. Kap Aage Bertelsen is a small headland at the confluence of the large Storstrømmen and L. Bistrup Bræ glaciers in the east. Dryasdal is a valley seasonally covered with Dryas octopetala flowers. The area of Queen Louise Land is uninhabited.\nThe main geographic divisions or parts of Queen Louise Land from north to south are:\n*Ymer Nunatak, a large nunatak located at the northern end of Queen Louise Land, south of the Alabama Nunatak. The Suzanne Glacier flows to the south and from it flows the Britannia Glacier southwards into main Queen Louise Land.\n*Central Queen Louise Land, the main part or Queen Louise Land proper.\n*Carlsbergfondet Land, the southwestern part of Queen Louise Land, between Budolfi Isstrom and A.B. Drachmann Glacier.\n*Eventyrfjelde, the southernmost part of Queen Louise Land, south of A.B. Drachmann Glacier.\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n|}\nGlaciers, ice caps, lakes and rivers\n*A.B.

Mountains are generally rounded and rarely craggy, but there are numerous cliffs. The average elevation is around 1,500 m.\n*Barrieren (2,200 m)\n*Bohr Bjerg\n*Cloos Klippe, a cliff\n*Curie Klippe, a cliff\n*Dickens Bjerg\n*Dannebrogsfjeldene, range east of Revaltoppe\n*Dronningestolen\n*Durham Klippe, a cliff\n*Falkonerklippe, a nunatak\n*Farvel Nunatak, nunatak group\n*Fermi Klippe, cliff\n*Gefiontinder (2,364 m), peak group\n*Glückstadt Nunatak\n*Grimm Fjelde, hilly area\n*Gultop\n*Gundahl Knold\n*H.A.
