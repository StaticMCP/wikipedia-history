The team was led by first-year head coach Gary Waters. In 2005–06, the Vikings finished 10–18 (6–10 in the Horizon League). Cleveland State's last winning season was the 2000–2001 season when they finished 19–13 overall and 9–5 in conference play. Their last NCAA tournament appearance was their run to the Sweet Sixteen in 1986. The highlight of the season was arguably when the Vikings went on a four-game winning streak defeating Miami (FL), John Carroll, Delaware, and Kent State. It was the 76th season of Cleveland State basketball.\nPreseason\nThe preseason Horizon League Coaches' Poll picked the Vikings to finish ninth. J'Nathan Bullock was named to the preseason all-Horizon League 2nd team.\nNotable players\n* Carlos English\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n|-\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Date\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Opponent*\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Rank*\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Location\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Time#\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Result\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Overall\n| BGCOLOR=\"#003300\" |  Conference\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd; \"\n| November 7, 2006 || Slippery Rock || || Cleveland, OH || 7:00&nbsp;p.m. || W 72–51  ||1–0||0–0\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| November 11, 2006 || George Mason ||  || Cleveland, OH ||3:00&nbsp;p.m. || L 79–74 ||0–1||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd; \"\n| November 13, 2006 || Notre Dame College ||  || Cleveland, OH ||7:00&nbsp;p.m. || W 88–62 ||1–1||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| November 17, 2006 || Buffalo ||  || Evansville, IN ||9:30&nbsp;p.m. || L 77–73 ||1–2||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| November 18, 2006 || Evansville ||  || Evansville, IN ||6:00&nbsp;p.m. || L 63–49 ||1–3||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd; \"\n| November 19, 2006 || Miami ||  || Evansville, IN ||2:00&nbsp;p.m. || W 78–67 ||2–3||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd; \"\n| November 22, 2006 || John Carroll ||  || Cleveland, OH ||7:00&nbsp;p.m. || W 84–65 ||3–3||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd; \"\n| November 26, 2006 || Delaware ||  || Newark, DE ||1:00&nbsp;p.m. || W 59–53 ||4–3||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ddffdd; \"\n| November 29, 2006 || Kent State ||  || Cleveland, OH ||7:00&nbsp;p.m. || W 66–59 ||5–3||0–0\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| December 2, 2006 || Butler ||  || Indianapolis, IN ||8:00&nbsp;p.m. || L 70–45 ||5–4||0–1\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| December 5, 2006 || Kansas State ||  || Manhattan, KS ||8:00&nbsp;p.m. || L 93–60 ||5–5||0–1\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| December 9, 2006 || Ohio State ||  || Columbus, OH ||4:00&nbsp;p.m. || L 78–57 ||5–6||0–1\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#ffdddd; \"\n| December 17, 2006 || Central Michigan ||  || Mt.
