He was an eighth generation descendant of Zhu Jing, Prince Ding of Tang, who was the 23rd son of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang (Hongwu Emperor).\nEarly life\nBefore ascending to the throne, he followed his father as the Prince of Tang, their fief being situated in Nanyang prefecture, in Henan province. In 1636, he was stripped of his title by the Chongzhen Emperor and put under house arrest in Fengyang. His former title was transferred to his younger brother Zhu Yumo (). In 1641, Zhu Yumo committed suicide when Li Zicheng invaded Nanyang. After the death of the Chongzhen Emperor 1644, his successor on the Ming throne, the Hongguang Emperor, released the Prince of Tang from his arrest.\nReign\nWhen Qing forces captured Nanjing in June 1645, he fled to Hangzhou. However, when Hangzhou fell to the Qing on 6 July 1645, the Prince of Tang managed to escape by land to the southeastern province of Fujian.\nIn August of the same year, at the behest of several high officials, he ascended to the Ming throne in Fuzhou, taking the reign title \"Longwu\" (隆武; pinyin: Lóngwǔ). His era name means \"plentiful and martial\". After a promising start, Fujian's geographical position on the margin of the empire, cut off from the heartland by several mountain ranges, as well as his lack of effective troops and the failure on part of the officialdom to find a united stance doomed the Longwu government. When Qing forces invaded Fujian in the late summer of 1646, Zheng Zhilong, the emperor's strongest ally, surrendered while his son Zheng Chenggong (the famous Koxinga) retreated to the sea.\nThe Prince of Tang was left with a dwindling court. On 6 October 1646, he was captured and immediately executed.\nPersonality\nAgainst the Ming policy of keeping imperial princes out of politics, the Prince of Tang early on showed interest in the government of the empire and strove for a larger role of the princes in it. His initiatives had brought him under house arrest during the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor, but his knowledge of history and of Ming institutions, paired with a diligent personality, made him take his imperial role seriously.\nZhu Yujian is said to have had a very close relationship with his wife, who had shared his hardship when he was incarcerated. Contrary to Chinese custom, he steadfastly declined to take any concubines.\nConsorts and issue\n* Empress Xiaoyixiang, of the Zeng clan (孝毅襄皇后 曾氏; d. 1646)\n** Zhu Linyuan, Crown Prince Zhuangjing (莊敬太子 朱琳源; 1646－1646), first son\n* Concubine, of the Shen clan (沈嫔)\n* Concubine, of the Chen clan (陳嬪)\nAncestry\nZhu Yujian was the senior-most male-line descendants of Zhu Jing, Prince Ding of Tang, the 23rd son of Zhu Yuanzhang, after his father's death. Therefore, he was an eighth cousin of the Wanli Emperor.
