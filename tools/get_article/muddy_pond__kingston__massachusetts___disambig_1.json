The pond is not open to the public. The Sisters of Divine Providence ran Camp Mishannock, a summer camp for girls, at this pond for forty years.  The campground was purchased by the Native Land Conservancy a nonprofit associated with the Wampanoag tribe. It has been redeveloped in the style of a traditional wetu encampment. The water quality is impaired due to non-native aquatic plants.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://oaspub.epa.gov/tmdl/enviro_v2.wcontrol?p_id305b=MA94104 Environmental Protection Agency]\n*[http://www.mass.gov/dep/water/resources/94wqar3.pdf South Shore Coastal Watersheds - Lake Assessments]"
