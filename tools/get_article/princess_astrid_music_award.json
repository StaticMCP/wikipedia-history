      "text": "# Princess Astrid Music Award\n\nThe Princess Astrid Music Award (, established in 1953) is a Norwegian prize awarded to young Nordic musicians under the age of 30. The competition is sponsored by Princess Astrid (born 1932). The competition is held every other year (but was not held from 1968 to 1984). The competition is not held the same year as the Queen Sonja International Music Competition, which is also held every other year.\nFinn Audun Oftedal, the conductor of the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra, first took the initiative to hold the competition. The competition is managed by the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra and Opera.\nAward winners receive diplomas and cash prizes, and the first-prize winner also receives soloist engagements or conducting engagements with the orchestra. Since 2016, the Finn Audun Oftedal Memorial Grant has been awarded to the best Norwegian participant.\nList of winners\n*1953 Kjell Bækkelund, pianist from Oslo\n*1956 Arve Tellefsen, violinist from Trondheim, runner-up Trond Øyen from Mosjøen\n*1958 Alf Andersen, flautist, awarded NOK 3,000, runners-up Ole Henrik Dahl and Torkil Bye\n*1961 Jan Henrik Kayser piano, runners-up Astrid Tese Krognes and Eva Christiansen Øierud\n*1963 Ørnulf Boye Hansen fiolin, runners-up Otto W.
