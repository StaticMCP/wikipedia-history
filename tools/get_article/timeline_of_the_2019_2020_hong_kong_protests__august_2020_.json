      "text": "# Timeline of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests (August 2020)\n\nThe month of August 2020 in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests saw only sparse and relatively small protests, mainly due to the city going through a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and an outdoor gathering ban on groups of more than two people. As the impact of the Hong Kong National Security Law on the city became increasingly evident, and additionally in response to acts by representatives of the local and mainland governments throughout the protests, Western democracies continued to voice sharp criticism and implemented sanctions against China, with the United States imposing sanctions on 11 Hong Kong officials on 7 August. These developments supported the opinion expressed by former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in late June that the protests had morphed from a mostly local dispute into an international one.\nThe arrest of Apple Daily proprietor Jimmy Lai on 10 August was seen by representatives of Western democracies and many observers as a violation of journalistic freedom. The arrest of pro-democracy politician and activist Agnes Chow on the same day fueled concerns that the National Security Law would, contrary to its Article 39, be applied retroactively. Concerns about opaque mainland laws taking precedence over Hong Kong's traditional legal procedures rose further after the mainland Chinese coastguard foiled an attempted escape of twelve people, including several activists, to Taiwan on 23 August. The twelve were detained across the Hong Kong border in Shenzhen, with no substantial further information about them transpiring well into September.\nEvents\n1 August\nSolidarity protest in Toronto\nA group of various Asian-Canadians gathered in front of Toronto's China embassy on Saturday to voice their concern of China's growing oppression in the region. Indian-Canadians protested Chinese invasion of Galwan Valley, Iranian-Canadians objected the recent talk of a potential \"25-year land sale deal\" the Iranian government plans to sell to China, Tibetan-Canadians denounced the decade-long invasion into the Tibetan Plateau, and Hong Kong-Canadians denounced the Hong Kong national security law and China's violation of Hong Kong's autonomy. The protesters demanded strong reactions from the Canadian government, and encouraged all Canadians to boycott Chinese-made products.\n2 August\nInternational response: Switzerland\nSwitzerland's foreign minister Ignazio Cassis noted in a local newspaper interview that human rights violations are on the rise in China, and that China's recent policies on Hong Kong would affect many Swiss companies that have long invested in Hong Kong. He stated that Switzerland \"must defend its interests and values more robustly, for example by strengthening international law and the multilateral system\" if China were to continue its current path. Spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry Wang Wenbin later denounced Cassis' statement as baseless accusation and meddling in China's internal affairs.\nSolidarity protest in New York\nHosted by the pro-Hong Kong group New Yorkers Supporting Hong Kong (NY4HK), around 50 people could be seen waving flags, singing, and chanting in Times Square for a protest, with organizers saying that over 50 more protesters were on the sidelines as they had not wanted to be photographed.\n3 August\nInternational response: France\nFrance halted ratifying its extradition agreement with Hong Kong. The agreement was signed in May 2017 but it was never ratified.\n4 August\nUK Parliamentary group found Hong Kong Police in violation of international humanitarian law\nThe parliamentary organization, All-Party Parliamentary Group on Hong Kong (APPG), published the results from its five-month long investigation into claims that the Hong Kong Police Force consistently violated humanitarian principles and human rights laws during the year-long Hong Kong Anti-extradition Protest since 2019. Medical workers, as protected by the Geneva Convention, “shall be respected and protected” in war and civil unrests, and “in no circumstances shall any person be punished for having carried out medical activities”. The 80-page report, titled The Shrinking Safe Space for Humanitarian Aid Workers in Hong Kong, found no evidence to justify “stripping [first aiders] of the protections otherwise available to humanitarian aid workers”, concluding with strong statements denouncing Hong Kong Police Force's treatment of first-aiders. The group urged the UK to urgently \"impose Magnitsky-style sanctions on those responsible for permitting the excessive police violence at high level in the administration, including but not limited to Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the Commissioner of Police.\"\n6 August\nUnited Nation's Human Rights Committee listed a 27-point clarification request to the Hong Kong government over possible human rights abuse. The document, titled \"List of issues in relation to the fourth periodic report of Hong Kong, China\" raises questions and concerns over the legitimacy, procedural details, and compatibility of the new national security law with the Hong Kong Basic Law, the disqualification of legislative council election candidates, domestic abuse, gender-based violence, right to life and prohibition of torture, treatments to migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, fairness and access to independence of judiciary and trial, right to privacy, freedom of expression, rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and freedom to participation in public affairs.\n7 August\nUS imposes sanctions on 11 Hong Kong officials\nThe US imposed sanctions on 11 Hong Kong officials for actions and involvements \"undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong\" during the year-long Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. The 11 individuals are: Carrie Lam, chief executive officer of Hong Kong, Chris Tang, Commissioner of Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF); Stephen Lo, Former Commissioner of HKPF, John Lee Ka-chiu, HKSAR Secretary for Security, Teresa Cheng, HKSAR Secretary for Justice, Erick Tsang, HKSAR Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Xia Baolong, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Luo Huining, Director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Zheng Yanxiong, Director, Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong, and Eric Chan, Secretary General, Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR. Under the sanctions, companies and banks are not to make \"contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods or services from any such person.\"\n9 August\nInternational response: Five countries urge reinstatement of candidates, hastened elections\nIn a joint statement by the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, the Hong Kong government was urged to reinstate the eligibility of disqualified candidates and to hold elections for the Legislative Council at the earliest, thus reversing the previous postponement by a year to September 2021.\n10 August\nPolice arrest Jimmy Lai, raid Apple Daily newsroom\n]]\nJimmy Lai, founder of Next Digital and owner of the only pro-democracy print newspaper in Hong Kong, Apple Daily'', was arrested at his home on August 10 under the new national security law for alleged collusion with foreign forces. He was later taken to Next Digital's headquarter by approximately 200 police members as they raided the newspaper office for hours. Several computers and digital devices were confiscated. His newspaper, Apple Daily, live-streamed the entire raid on their social media platform. In response to this arrest, pro-democracy supporters \"rallied\" Next Digital's stock for over 300% at some point during the day, and ended the trading day with over 180% increase. The day after the arrest, more than 500,000 copies were printed – the normal volume being 100,000 copies –, and citizens began to queue as early as 2:00&nbsp;a.m. to buy these.\nPolice raids Nikkei office\nOn 29 August, AFP reported that three police officers came to the Hong Kong office of Nihon Keizai Shimbun with court orders to investigate. It was related to the advertisement published by Demosistō one year ago calling on the international community to support the anti-extradition bill protests. It was suspected for 'dealing with property known or believed to represent of an indictable offences', and did not involve national security law. The source said that the police did not take away anything that day, and the Nikkei submitted the relevant documents two weeks later.\nFurther arrests under the national security law\nwas taken by police from her home in Tai Po]]\nIn addition to the arrest of Jimmy Lai, nine other individuals were also arrested or wanted by the end of the day under the new national security law. Lai's two sons, Lai Yiu Yan and Lai Gin Yan, were arrested separately from Jimmy Lai, four other Next Digital staff, including chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung and chief operating officer and chief financial officer Royston Chow Tat-Kuen, Agnes Chow, the 23-year-old prominent pro-democracy activist and the now-defunct Demosisto founder was arrested at her home, European news agency ITV Freelance journalist and Demosisto former member Wilson Li, Edward Lei, a donor to a localist pro-democracy group, and finally, Mark Simon, a journalist with close ties to Jimmy Lai, were wanted by the Hong Kong Police.\nInternational responses to the arrests\nVarious United States government officials spoke out on Jimmy Lai's arrest. Vice President Mike Pence posted a picture of him and Jimmy Lai on his Twitter account along with #FreeJimmyLai. State Secretary Mike Pompeo in an interview mentioned Jimmy Lai's arrest and the new Chinese sanction of US politicians. He stated that the United States is \"going to respond in real ways so that the actions they've taken with respect to Jimmy Lai and the sanctions that they have nebulously imposed on some senior American officials in Congress, you can be sure the United States will measure them, respond to them, and help the Chinese Communist Party understand you're not going to take action against America or Americans without President Trump responding.\" National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien in a White House statement said that the United States was \"deeply troubled\" by the arrest, closing with the words, \"We stand with Jimmy Lai and his sons and colleagues, and call on Beijing to repeal the national security law and restore Hong Kong's rule of law immediately\". The following day, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi made a statement condemning the series of arrests and Beijing's erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. She ended her statement stating that the US is watching, and \"the world is watching.\"\nJapan citizens focused primarily on Agnes Chow's arrest and trended the #FreeAgnes hashtag on social media. Many high-profile celebrities supported the call to Agnes and her fight for democracy. While Japanese government officials did not specifically comment on the arrest, individual politicians commented on Hong Kong's overall social unrest and called for China to respect \"One Country, Two Systems\".\nTaiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) condemned the arrest as an erosion of Hong Kong's press and speech freedom.\nPolice defend limiting media access during Apple Daily operation\nDuring the raid on the Apple Daily offices in the morning, police had only admitted 15 news outlets inside the cordon. Those not admitted included international news agencies Reuters, AFP and AP, as well as local online media Stand News and InMedia. This step was seen by observers as a violation of the freedom of the press enshrined in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and also at odds with an October 2019 statement by Chief Executive Carrie Lam that \"no vetting on who can conduct reporting\" had been planned in the city. Police defended its decision by operational and safety concerns, constraints of the area, and \"some police assessments\". It was rare, it said, to have dozens of media agencies inside a cordoned-off area; also, police had been providing information on their operations to reporters and newsroom editors.\nOther developments\nIn retaliation for the sanctioning of Hong Kong officials by the United States on 7 August, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian announced unspecified sanctions against 11 US individuals including senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio – who both had been vocal supporters of the protesters since the early stages of the protest –, Human Rights Watch director Kenneth Roth, and National Endowment for Democracy president Carl Gershman. Zhao said that the sanctions were imposed on the individuals because they had \"behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues\" while White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the sanctions were “symbolic and ineffectual”.\n11 August\nProtests in Hong Kong\nFollowing an online call on Telegram messenger, dozens of protesters gathered at four shopping malls for \"Sing with You\" events to protest against the arrest of Jimmy Lai and other Apple Daily staff the previous day, and against the erosion of press freedom in the city in general. Some protesters wielded blank placards. During a protest in Langham Place shopping mall in Mong Kok, police raised a purple flag to warn that protesters' chants or displayed materials may be in violation of the national security law. They fined several individuals for not being \"proper journalists\", notwithstanding that Hong Kong does not have an accreditation system for journalists.  In Sha Tin New Town Plaza, police media liaison officers ordered reporters to prove their status and restricted them to outside a cordoned area within the mall. The Hong Kong Journalists Association protested against these acts as interference with journalistic freedom. Later that evening, police released a statement saying that the assemblies in Mong Kok and Sha Tin had been unauthorised and that, in reference to social distancing restrictions,  crowds had taken \"irresponsible actions\".\nInternational response: \"Made in Hong Kong\" no longer allowed in US customs\nCiting the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, the United States customs announced that goods made in Hong Kong and imported into the US  after September 25 must be labeled \"Made In China\" instead of \"Made In Hong Kong\".\nInternational response: Canadian House of Common testimony hearing on Hong Kong human rights\nBeginning today and for the next several days, human rights and democracy organizations began testifying before the Canadian House of Common's Special Committee on Canada-China Relation (CACN) in regards to China's recent actions its affects to Hong Kong's democracy struggle. Akram Keram, a program officer on China at National Endowment for Democracy (NED), along with Hong Kong Watch co-founder and trustee Aileen Calverley, and at least five other pro-democracy activists from Hong Kong and from around the world detailed the various happenings—such as deterioration of academic, press and speech freedom—in Hong Kong since July, the enactment of the national security law. Speakers called for international solidarity with Hong Kong against Communist China such as passing law similar to the United States' \"Hong Kong Autonomy Act\" in which Hong Kong officials are sanctioned for their human rights violations. When asked by a Canadian parliamentarian why should Canada care about Hong Kong's situation, Calverley responded, \"[i]f Canada, with its long history of defending human rights, is not willing to stand with like-minded partners in defen[s]e of Hong Kong, then those values that we all believe in will be degraded, along with Canada's standing in the world.\" In addition to sanction and diplomacy, the final proposal for Canadian government to show support for Hong Kong is to alter current immigration regulations to allow for high-profile activists settle in Canada, similar to the escape plan offered to protest leaders fleeing China after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre.\n12 August\nInternational response: Taiwan president condemns recent Hong Kong arrests\nTaiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen issued a statement in which the referenced the recent arrest of Apple Daily proprietor Jimmy Lai and other staff of Next Media. The National Security Law, she said, would not only exert a chilling effect on the media and gravely harm democracy in Hong Kong, but it would also seriously undermine the status of the city as a financial hub. She called for Beijing to have a proper dialog with Hong Kong people, as restrictive measures would be futile.\nInternational response: Japan's cross-party alliance urgently release Agnes Chow and other arrests, citizens start rally\nJapan held a rally in front of the Tokyo National Diet Building, demanding that the Japanese government respond to Hong Kong's freedom and democracy issues ]]\nJapan Parliamentary Alliance on China (JPAC) held an emergency press conference in the House of Representatives, criticizing the Hong Kong government for infringing on freedom of speech with the national security law, and concerned about the government's postponement of the Legislative Council election and disqualification of the candidates. A number of people in the Japanese education and legal circles issued a joint statement, claiming that the Hong Kong police's arrest was actually political suppression and groundless. At 6 pm, the Tokyo Executive Committee held the Stand With Hong Kong Rally in front of the main entrance of the National Diet Building, requesting the Japanese government to respond to the issue of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong. About 300 people participated in the rally.\n13 August\nHong Kong response: Extradition agreements\nIn response to France halting the ratification of its extradition agreements with Hong Kong and Germany suspending its extradition treaty, the Hong Kong government announced that it is shelving its extradition agreements with France and suspending the treaty with Germany.\n14 August\nGoogle will not respond to Hong Kong authorities' request of user data\nIn compliance with the recently suspended mutual legal assistance treaty between the United States and Hong Kong, Google announced it has terminated responding to Hong Kong authorities' request of user data. According to CNET, Google, Facebook and Twitter had already suspending processing Hong Kong authorities' requests since July, but today Google took one step further to not respond to requests made by Hong Kong police or government.  In a statement to CNET by a Google spokesperson, since the Beijing-passed national security law was enacted in June, Google has \"not produced data in response to new requests from Hong Kong authorities and that remains the case\".\n15 August\nLam resigns fellowship at Cambridge University's Wolfson College\nCarrie Lam received her Cambridge Wolfson Honorary Fellowship in 2017 after she was elected as the new Hong Kong Chief Executive Officer. Cambridge University's Wolfson College had since raised concerns with Carrie Lam about \"her commitment to the protection of human rights and the freedom of expression in Hong Kong\" following the year-long pro-democracy movements.  Wolfson in a statement today announced that while the college was due to consider Lam's Honorary Fellowship early next month, Lam took the first step and had \"resigned from her Honorary Fellowship.\" In a Facebook statement, Lam criticized Wolfson College for \"smearing a person on the basis of hearsay instead of facts\" and therefore she could no longer maintain any relationship with such college.\nInternational response: UK suspends Hong Kong police military training\nUK government has suspended its military training to Hong Kong police. While the COVID-19 crisis was given as reason, the statement also referred to concerns for the city's freedom due to the imposition of the national security law.\n16 August\nCanada solidarity protests\nOver 500 showed up to support Hong Kong democracy at downtown Ottawa, Canada demanding the Canadian government to place economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure on pro-China Hong Kong government officials. Rallies were also held in nine other cities across Canada including Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Calgary.\n19 August\nInternational response: US suspends extradition treaty\nThe US suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and the reciprocal tax exemptions.\n21 August\nInternational response: Australia's new visa arrangement for Hong Kong passport holders\nIn a response to the looming national security law enacted in July, Australia announced new visa arrangements for Hong Kong passport holders fleeing Hong Kong and seeking Australian citizenship. The modified visa regulations are applicable to Hong Kong students, temporary workers, and skilled workers, according to a government statement by Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge. Under the new arrangements, Hong Kong passport holders who held a selected visa on 9 July 2020 will automatically have that visa extended for five years; current and future students from Hong Kong will be eligible for a five-year Temporary Graduate visa on the successful completion of their tertiary studies; and Hong Kong passport holders who apply for a temporary skilled visa will be eligible for a five-year visa if they have qualifications listed on the occupational skills lists and meet Labour Market Testing requirements.\"\n23 August\nNational security law effect: 12 arrested by China coastguard at sea while allegedly fleeing to Taiwan\nalso see \"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\"\nAlthough the arrest incident was posted on their social media platform on August 23, the actual details were released to the public three days after the actual arrest, on August 26. The maritime coordinates of the arrest location published by Guangdong coastguard was (21°54E ), a location, if factually stated by Chinese authorities, that is technically not owned by China, but within its contiguous zone. According to Radio Free Asia, the arrestees are presumably charged of \"unlawful border crossing (into China territories)\" and are currently in custody with China, not Hong Kong, authorities. The published arrestee names include several Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, some of whom were earlier charged with protest-related crimes by the Hong Kong police under the new national security law. Hong Kong Police denied any cooperation with Chinese authorities in the arrest. Under Chinese law the arrestees may be jailed for one year on immigration offenses before being deported to Hong Kong.\nSolidarity human chain in Tokyo\nin Tokyo. About 50 Hong Kong and Japanese people participated ]]\nOne year ago in the height of the Hong Kong anti-extradition protest Hong Kongers formed a 60&nbsp;km human chain, also known as the Baltic Way, across Hong Kong to show support and solidarity in hope the government could accept their five demands.  One year later due to the newly enacted Hong Kong national security law human chains are now considered unlawful and so dozens of Hong Kongers took to Shinjuku, Tokyo to form this one-year anniversary \"Hong Kong Way\". In this \"Stand With Hong Kong\" demonstration, about 70 Hong Kongers living in Japan and Japanese activists socially-distancing each other in this peaceful demonstration. Participants chanted slogans to demand the release of the recently arrested Jimmy Lai and pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow while holding the now illegal \"liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\" banner and  singing the now-banned \"Glory to Hong Kong\".\n25 August\nNathan Law protests against Chinese presence in Italy\nChinese foreign minister Wang Yi is on a political tour to five European countries from August 25 to September 1. Members of the IPAC Alliance and activists organized protests to take place in each of the capitals Wang was to visit. On his first stop in Italy, dozens of Tibetans and Hong Kongers protested in Farnesina Square in Rome against China's increasingly repressive human rights violations in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang. Pro-democracy legislator and activist Nathan Law, who earlier fled Hong Kong for England and was later wanted by the Hong Kong authorities, was among those who protested in Italy. Italian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio met with Nathan Law prior to Wang's meeting to discuss the danger of Communist China and their growing repression and formally receive a letter from Law regarding the state of matter in Hong Kong. Later, after meeting with Wang Yi, Di Maio and Wang made a joint appearance in which Di Maio reiterated that Italy would closely monitor the situation in Hong Kong, and together with other European nations it is imperative to preserve Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, high degree of autonomy and the fundamental rights and freedoms as guaranteed to Hong Kong citizens by its one country, two system policy. Nathan Law's meeting with Di Maio was endorsed by 17 Italian parliamentarians.\n26 August\nArrests of pro-democracy lawmakers\nTwo pan-democracy lawmakers, Lam Cheuk-ting and Ted Hui, were arrested by the police. They were reported to have been involved in protests in Tuen Mun in 2019 and Lam for alleged participation in the 2019 Yuen Long attack.\nto the script of the government and the police]]\nHong Kong Police accused of rewriting 721 Yuen Long attack incident\nThe police press conference following the arrest of 16 individuals was widely reported by Hong Kong and international media as an attempt by police to rewrite the narrative of the 721 Yuen Long MTR station attack. One example of the alleged fact-altering statements made in that press conference was the police response time on July 21, 2019. In the press conference, a senior police superintendent, Chan Tin-chu claimed that police was present within 18 minutes of receiving 911 calls, not the earlier police-acknowledged 39 minutes.  Chan also stated that the attack was a clash between \"two evenly matched rivals\", and not a one-sided attack, contrary to hundreds of cellphone videos and award-winning reports. A day after this press conference, Police Chief Chris Tang retracted the \"18-minute\" assertion made earlier by Chan.\nFile:新界北警司陳天柱 see the press 20200826.png|Senior Superintendent of the Criminal Headquarters of New Territories North, Chan Tin-chu explains the case and described the attack as a conflict between two gangs\nFile:Junius Ho Kwan-yiu response Lam Cheuk Ting arrested 20200826.png|Legislative Council member Junius Ho welcomed the arrest by the police, describing that justice is late but will not be absent\nFile:Pan Democratic response Lam Cheuk Ting arrested 20200826.png|Pan-democrats and Civil Human Rights Front held a press conference to respond the arrests\nFile:Gwyneth Ho Kwai-lam see the press in Yuen Long Station 20200826.png|Former Stand News reporter Gwyneth Ho speaking to reporters\nProtest-related journalism awards and recognition\nSociety of Publishers in Asia, SOPA, was established in 1982. In 1999, the SOPA Awards for Editorial Excellence were formed to celebrate and recognize traditional and new media news reporting. Many international and Hong Kong media outlets won awards and honorable mentions in this year's SOPA Awards for covering the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest development and impacts. The 17 awards are categorized in “global”, “regional” and in “Chinese [language]”.\nAwards of Excellence\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Award Type\n!Category\n!Publication\n!Title of Entry\n!\nAward Recipients\n|-\n|Excellence in Video Reporting\n(卓越視頻報道獎)\n|Global\n|\nThe New York Times\n|[https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006624535/hong-kong-protest-police-triad-investigation.html Where Were Hong Kong's Police?]\n|Barbara Marcolini, Haley Willis, K.K., Rebecca Lai, Caroline Kim,\nDrew Jordan, Sameen Amin, Tiffany May,  Austin Ramzy, Dahlia Kozlowsky and Mark Scheffler\n|-\n|Excellence in Video Reporting\n(卓越視頻報道獎)\n|Regional\n|\nSouth China Morning Post\n|\n[https://www.scmp.com/video/scmp-films/3031647/citizens-group-protect-children-mission-safeguard-hong-kong-protesters Thin yellow line]\n|\nDayu Zhang\n|-\n|Excellence in Feature Writing\n(卓越專題特寫獎)\n|Global\n|Reuters\n|\n[https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hongkong-protests-radical/ Revolution 101]\n|\nTom Lasseter\n|-\n|Excellence in Arts & Culture Reporting\n(卓越藝術及文化報道獎)\n|Global\n|Nikkei Asian Review\n|[https://sopawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Art-amid-unrest.pdf Art amid unrest]\n|Laurel Chor, Michelle Chan, and Ken Smith\n|-\n|Excellence in Reporting Breaking News\n(卓越突發新聞獎)\n|Global & Regional\n|Bloomberg\n|\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2019-08-04/hong-kong-braces-for-citywide-strike-as-unrest-escalates Hong Kong in Turmoil]\n|Shelly Banjo, Natalie Lung, Annie Lee and Hannah Dormido, Iain Marlow,\nBlake Schmidt, Chloe Whiteaker, Adrian Leung, Demetrios Pogkas\n|-\n|Excellence in Photography\n(卓越攝影獎)\n|Global\n|Agence France-Presse\n|[https://sopawards.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AFP-Hong-Kong-Protests-2019.pdf Hong Kong Protests 2019]\n|Anthony Wallace, Philip Fong, Hector Retamal,\nNicolas Asfouri, Isaac Lawrence\n|-\n|Excellence in Photography\n(卓越攝影獎)\n|Chinese\n|Initium Media\n端傳媒\n|[https://theinitium.com/article/20191231-photo-extradition-law-protest/ Hong Kong's anti-extradition bill protest: a photo documentation]\n[https://theinitium.com/article/20191231-photo-extradition-law-protest/ 香港反修例運動影像記錄]\n|Lam Chun Tung 林振東\n|-\n|Excellence in Information Graphics\n(卓越數據圖像獎)\n|Global & Regional\n|The New York Times\n|[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/20/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-size.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/20/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-size.html Hong Kong's Turmoil, Illustrated]\n|Jin Wu, K.K.

Counterattack, Despair and Hope]\n|}\nInternational response: the Netherlands\nThe Netherlands is the second stop in Wang Yi's political European tour. A group of Dutch lawmakers, led by Martijin Van Helvert who serves on the newly formed IPAC, who are critical of how Beijing's national security law “severely curtails individual freedoms and violates Hong Kong's autonomy\", were not pleased with this secretive state visit. Wang declined an invitation by this group to discuss human rights issues on Hong Kong and Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang.  Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok discussed economy and trade but also raised human rights concerns with Wang regarding the \"extremely worrying developments\" in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.\n27 August\nPro-democracy lawmakers released on bail\n]]\nand Ted Hui speaking to reporters after released on bail]]\nEight people, including Ted Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting, were prosecuted by the police and appeared in West Kowloon Magistrates' Court on 27 August. The case was brought to court in two cases. A large number of citizens and many pro-democracy activists showed up in black clothes to support the scene and chanted the police slogan of \"reverse black and white.\" There are over a hundred plainclothes and uniformed police officers on guard.\nLam and Hui were charged with 'obstructing justice' during the demonstration at Tuen Mun Park on 6 July 2019. Hui was also charged with one crime of 'dishonest access to a computer' and one crime of 'criminal destruction'. The other two defendants were charged with intent to 'obstruction of justice', 'dishonest access to computers', 'criminal destruction' and 'unlawful assembly'.\nThe prosecution requested a postponement of the case in order to process the referral of the case to the District Court. The magistrate approved the adjournment until 6 November. All the defendants were granted cash bail, and some of them required personnel guarantees. During the period, they were not allowed to leave Hong Kong, they had to surrender their travel documents, and they had to report to the police station.\nIn the 21 July Yuen Long attack, Lam and six other people were charged with 'riots.' The prosecution pointed out that Lam had instructed the people in black, \"Everyone prays for nothing, and withstand the canal (the people in white)\", and called on the citizens on the platform to \"hold up the canal with helpers to stand up,\" adding insulting words. Provoking people in white, thus constituting a riot. At the same time, he pointed out that Lam ignored the police's advice and insisted on walking into Yuen Long. All the defendants stated that they understood the charges and were granted bail with HK$3,000 to HK$10,000 cash and sureties. They were not allowed to leave Hong Kong. They had to surrender their travel documents and report to the police station. The prosecution stated that because there were still 20 people at large in the case, it requested that the case be postponed pending further investigation by the police. The judge adjourned the hearing until 12 October. Lam criticized the current prosecution as the Carrie Lam regime's loss of basic human conscience, political persecution, ugly and evil; Hui described the current prosecution as \"unnecessarily guilty\" and emphasized that protecting the public is its bounden duty.\nInternational response: Norway\nDay three of Wang Yi's political tour landed him in Norway. Hong Kong is once again discussed even though Wang's trip was reportedly about mending post-COVID relations with these countries.  Earlier today and before the joint press conference, Amnesty International Norway, the Norwegian Uighur Committee, the Norwegian Tibet Committee, the Hong Kong Committee, the Norwegian-Taiwanese Friendship Association and the Norwegian PEN held a joint demonstration with hundreds of protesters protesting against Chinese violations of human rights in front of Norway's prime minister's residence. In the later press conference Wang was asked about the possibility of Hong Kong protesters being nominated or even winning the next Nobel Peace Prize. Wang sternly responded that the Chinese government shall firmly reject \"any attempt to use the Nobel Prize to interfere in China's internal affairs\".\n29 August\n\"Liberate Hong Kong\" statue opening ceremony in Yermo, California, USA\nHundreds of supporters gathered in the southern California Mojave Desert town Yermo to show solidarity with the yearlong pro-democracy resistance in Hong Kong. Artist Weiming Chen spent five months designing and building a \"Liberate Hong Kong\" sculpture to commemorate Hong Kong's fight for freedom against Communist China.  Many were waving \"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Time\" flags and wearing yellow helmets.  A group was singing \"Glory to Hong Kong\" in the ceremony. Liberty Sculpture Park, where the \"Liberate Hong Kong\" statue is located, also showcases other artists' freedom-themed art work and Chen's many other freedom-fighting pieces, such as his 1989 \"Tank Man\" sculpture commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. One participant in the celebration on that day told the Victorville Daily Press that he found himself on China's \"wanted list\" after participating in a previous liberty park unveiling event and warned today's participants to not be surprised if they woke up the next day being \"wanted\" by China.\nHong Kong public opinion poll two months after national security law\nReuters, partnering with Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI), released their 4th Hong Kong public opinion survey results. The Cantonese phone surveys polled approximately 1000 participants every three months since December 2019. A few of the questions have been modified to reflect the current post-national security law sentiment that showed 60% of respondents opposed the newly enacted national security law. What remained a majority opinion in the past 9 months is the public's support for an independent commission of inquiry to look into how police handled the demonstrations, fluctuating from 66% to 76% support, a median of 71%.\n30 August\nMong Kok demonstrations to commemorate 831 Prince Edward station attack\nOn the eve of the one year anniversary of the 2019 Prince Edward station attack, hundreds gathered in Mong Kok shopping malls chanting the protest slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, The Revolution of Our Time\" and demanding authorities to release the security camera footage of the attack. A total of 29 individuals were, some disputably, ticketed for violating gathering bans. Separately, two individuals were arrested for possession of a fake gun and a baton.\nNew York City solidarity event: 831 Prince Edward station attack commemoration\nOrganizer New Yorkers Supporting Hong Kong (NY4HK) constructed a life-size model of the entrance of Prince Edward station in Union Square to raise awareness of Hong Kong police brutality and the 2019 Prince Edward station attack.  More than 150 people placed flowers and support notes on the model.\n31 August\nMong Kok demonstrations to commemorate 831 Prince Edward station attack\nOn the one year anniversary of the 2019 Prince Edward station attack, hundreds gathered in Langham Place and at Prince Edward station. They chanted the protest slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\", in response to which police displayed a warning flag to alert the crowd that this would possibly constitute a violation of the national security law. A pregnant woman was pushed to the ground in a scuffle between police and protesters, allegedly by police; while the police expressed their concern for the woman, it refrained from commenting on the allegation.\nLondon assembly to commemorate 831 Prince Edward station attack\nAt noon, about a hundred people attended an assembly organized by human rights group \"NOW!\" outside the Embassy of China. Most of them wore black clothes and they showed the slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times\". After the assembly, some of them walked to Piccadilly Circus and Glory to Hong Kong was played with bagpipes. The participants of the assembly included Wong Mau-chun, who was previously referred by the media as \"Hon Bo-sun\" and was rumored to have died in the 2019 Prince Edward station attack. Simon Cheng and Benedict Rogers also participated in the event.\nTaiwan assembly to commemorate 831 Prince Edward station attack\nOver 400 people gathered locally in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung to show support at a solidarity event which started in the evening. The gathering in Taipei, titled \"831 Taipei Support Hong Kong Human Chain\"《831台北挺香港人鏈》took place in front of Aegis Cafe (保護傘餐廳), a new business that is run by exiled Hong Kong activists. Commemorators played and sang the protest anthem \"Glory to Hong Kong\", a song that is now banned in Hong Kong and formed a human chain. Kaohsiung saw about 150 attendees who wore black outfit and yellow helmets. They waved numerous \"Stand With Hong Kong\" flags. The gathering in Taichung attracted about 70 people.\nTokyo assembly to commemorate 831 Prince Edward station attack\nThis commemoration was organized by \"Stand With HK@JPN\". Outside of JR Shinjuku station they reenacted numerous scenes of police attacking subway riders and the scene outside of Prince Edward stations where first aiders pleaded with the police to let them enter the closed-off station.\nReferences"
