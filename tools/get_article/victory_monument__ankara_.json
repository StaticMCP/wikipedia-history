It is situated to the east of Atatürk Boulevard.\nHistory\nThe monument was a result of a nationwide fund drive organized by the journalist Yunus Nadi. After an international competition, the project of Heinrich Krippel from Austria was rewarded. The monument was inaugurated on 24 November 1927. It was restored in 2002.\nTechnical details\nThe monument is actually a group of bronze statues. In addition to equestrian Atatürk in the center, there are three more figures; two soldiers and one woman. One soldier is calling his friend to the battlefront and the other one is observing the front. The woman is carrying a cannonball, as a reference to the contributions of the Turkish women during the Turkish War of Independence.\nSee also\n*Atatürk monuments and memorials\nReferences"
