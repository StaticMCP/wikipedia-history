It comprises the estuary of a stream called Palmer's Brook, situated between East Cowes and Wootton Creek, about  north west of Wootton. It is said, probably apocryphally, to have been the place that King John fled to after signing Magna Carta, from which it derives its name.\nIt is private land, part of the  Barton Estate, and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Ramsar site. It is rich in fossils, particularly of oligocene fish and mesolithic artifacts in a rocky outcrop known as the Osborne Beds.\nIt comprises an area of saltmarsh, sand and marsh, bounded by ancient woodlands at Wallhill Copse, Curlew Copse, Woodhouse Copse and Brickhill Copse.\nThe Quay is a causeway which is breached in one place leading to a stone bridge.\nDuring the Middle Ages, King's Quay and the adjoining Meads Hole to the north in Osborne Bay was the site of a market of stolen goods, the plunder of Isle of Wight pirates upon French and Spanish shipping.\nIt is inaccessible to the public, but can be approached from the south western end by Forestry Commission land at Woodhouse Copse.\nSee also\n*List of places on the Isle of Wight\nReferences\n*[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/gcrdb/GCRsiteaccount2909.pdf Geological Conservation Review]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051227224337/http://www.iow.gov.uk/living_here/planning/images/SolentCoastalHAP.pdf Isle of Wight Biodiversity Action Plan]\n*[http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1004298.pdf Natural England citation sheet]\n*[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/HAM/IOW/Miscellaneous/index.html GENUKI information on the IOW]\n*[http://www.parkerseal.org.uk/articles/anchorages/kingsquay.aspx - An unusual anchorage]"
