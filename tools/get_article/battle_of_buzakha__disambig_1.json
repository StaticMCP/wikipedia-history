The apostate army, much like the Muslims, was ranged with a centre and wings, with individual clans grouped together.\nThe apostate army was commanded by one Uyaina, who also personally commanded the elite 700 Bani Hazari unit in the centre.\nSetting out of his camp, Khalid ordered a general attack along the whole line. The Muslims managed to dent the apostate front at several places, greatly pushing the wings back. Around this time, Uyaina rode to Tuhlaya and asked him for God's advice, to which the former simply replied with encouragement. After some more time, Khalid managed to make dents into his foe's centre, although the ground was more bitterly given by Uyaina's Banu Hazari. After another two rounds of asking Tuhlaya's advice - to no avail - Uyaina suspected his master of falsehood, and immediately ordered the Banu Hazari to withdraw from the field.\nThe remainder of the apostate army, already under pressure, soon broke under Muslims' attacks. Some isolated groups continued resistance, until they saw Tuhlaya and his family flee the battlefield on camel-back, after which they too fled.\nImmediately after the rout, Khalid sent flying columns to pursue the remnants of the army. Some 30 miles southeast of the field, one Muslim column overtook some of the apostates, who immediately surrendered without a struggle.\nKhalid personally led a column north, overtaking a largely intact part of the routed army 60 miles out at Ghamra, commanded by Uyaina and composed of his Banu Hazari. After some initial resistance, the rebels were overwhelmed and fled, and Uyaina was captured.\nAftermath\nAfter the rebels of Banu Asad had been brought down, Khalid continues his march to complete his mission to the series of pacification of the nearby uprising in the area of Naqra, which happen to be incited by tribe of Banu Sulaym which led by Amr bin Abdul Uzza(Abu Shajara). After Khalid from here went on to his next objective and almost a month later engaged salma at the battle of Zafar.\nTulayha on the other hand had killed a veteran Companions of the Prophet of the Prophet by the name of Ukasha Bin Mihsan faced a ban from joining in any war. He later asked for forgiveness from Caliph Abu Bakr, who forgave him but he was, along with his tribe, banned from joining in any external campaigns as they had indulged in apostasy and so couldn't be trusted. It would be in Caliph Umar's reign that they would be finally allowed to participate in battles.\nTulayha served with great distinction in the later Persian campaign, especially in the Battle of Qadisiya and the Battle of Nihawand.\nReferences\n* A.I.
