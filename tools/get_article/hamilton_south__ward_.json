Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 22,032 people.\nThe ward has produced strong results for both the Scottish National Party (SNP) – who won half the seats at the 2012, 2017 and 2022 elections – and Labour who won half the seats at the 2007, 2012 and 2022 elections. Following a by-election win in 2013, Labour held three of the four seats.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Hamilton South was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards. It contained all of the former Low Waters and Silvertonhill wards as well as part of the former Cadzow and Woodhead/Meikle Earnock wards and a small part of the former Hamilton Centre/Ferniegair and Hamilton Centre North wards. Hamilton South covers the southern part of Hamilton including the Avon Grove, Cadzow, Eddlewood, Fairhill, Laighstonehall, Low Waters, Meikle Earnock, Silvertonhill, Torhead Farm and Woodhead neighbourhoods. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, streets around Portland Place, Burnblea Street and Kemp Street were added to the ward from Hamilton North and East which resulted in the ward's northeastern boundary moving to the Argyle Line railway tracks.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|Joe Lowe(Labour/Independent)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Brian McCaig(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Bobby Lawson(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|John Murray(Conservative)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Angela Crawley(SNP)\n|-\n!2013by-election\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Stuart Gallacher(Labour)\n|-\n!2015by-election\n|rowspan=4|John Ross(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Lynne Mailon(Conservative)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Josh Wilson(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Gavin Wylie Keatt(Labour)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Celine Handibode(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Helen Toner(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2015 by-election\n2013 by-election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
