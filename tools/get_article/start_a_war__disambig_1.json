A special version was shipped with an additional DVD titled X-Rated. It is the last album for 15 years to feature Ulrich Wild as a producer and/or a mixer, until Project: Regeneration Vol. 1 in 2020.\nAlbum information\nThis is the first studio album with drumming provided by Nick Oshiro, and the second and last album that guitarist Tripp Eisen wrote and performed on. The album marks the return of former guitarist Koichi Fukuda, who helped with the programming, and according to Static-X's online forums, Fukuda completed additional guitar parts in three songs left unfinished by Eisen. The album continues the change in sound found on Shadow Zone but many of the songs featured on Start a War are heavier and feature a lot more screaming and aggressive lyrics. The whole tone of the album is more aggressive than Shadow Zone.\nThe song \"Pieces\" features a guitar solo, a feature not found in earlier albums, but playing a larger role in the following album, Cannibal. When asked about the album, Wayne Static said \"We wanted to try to recreate the fun spirit of Wisconsin Death Trip; having Koichi back, with his flavor, helped.\"\nThe song \"Start a War\" was featured on the WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 video game soundtrack, and later on in Project Gotham Racing 3. \"Skinnyman\" was featured on Need for Speed: Most Wanted, though in a censored version. \"I'm the One\" was featured in ''Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball'', both the original version and the \"Wayne Static's Destroyer Remix\".\nThe album debuted at #29 on the Billboard 200, selling 35,416 copies in its first week.\nTrack listing\nDVD version (X-Rated)\nStart a War was also available in a bonus edition digipak with a DVD titled X-Rated.\nBand footage\nMost of the DVD was filmed whilst guitarist Tripp Eisen was in the band. When he left the band, he had to be 'edited' out of the DVD, though he can still be seen in some shots. New live footage was filmed with Koichi Fukuda. Consequently, this means that most of the DVD has footage only of Static, Campos and Oshiro.\nContents of the DVD\n* Making of the record.
