The station was situated within the Goose Hollow neighborhood. Its incorrectly punctuated name refers to the hillside to the west of the station, which has historically been referred to as King's Hill. A section of King's Hill, which contains many historic buildings, qualified for inclusion within the King's Hill Historic District, the easternmost boundary of which is at SW 21st Avenue.\nDescription and history\nThe station was located in the center of SW 18th Avenue and had a single platform between the tracks. The platforms were accessed from the left-hand side of the train.\nDespite the Providence Park eastbound station being only two blocks away, the station was added at the request of the neighborhood.  It provides service to Lincoln High School and the Multnomah Athletic Club.  Though one of the least-used downtown MAX stations, in 2006 a new condominium development nearby was expected to boost ridership.\nOn March 1, 2020, TriMet closed the station, alongside the stations at Pioneer Place mall, as part of a pilot program to improve MAX journey times through Downtown Portland. While the station was supposed to be closed for only a year, it has remained closed since.\nPublic art\nArtwork around the station recalls Tanner Creek, which was buried and infilled early in Portland's history, and a bronze goose paying tribute to the Goose Hollow neighborhood. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening etched Bart Simpson into the east sidewalk of SW 18th Avenue in 1996 during the construction of this station.  The City of Portland has opted to leave the sidewalk intact.  SW 18th Avenue runs behind Lincoln High School, where Groening graduated in 1972.\nBus line connections\nWhen this station was in operation, it was served by the following bus lines:\n*15-Belmont/NW 23rd Ave\n*51-Vista\n*63-Washington Park\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://trimet.org/ride/stop.html?action=entry&Loc=9759 Station information (with northbound/eastbound ID number)] from TriMet\n*[http://trimet.org/ride/stop.html?action=entry&Loc=9820 Station information (with southbound/westbound ID number)] from TriMet\n*[http://trimet.org/max/stations.htm MAX Light Rail Stations] – more general TriMet page"
