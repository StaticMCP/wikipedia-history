Moser (1924&ndash;1976) was an American linguist and expert in the Seri language and culture working with the Summer institute of Linguistics.\nLife and career\nHe was born in 1924 in Joliet, Illinois. Son of a Baptist minister, he lived in various communities in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and New York State. During World War II he served as an ensign in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific theater. In 1946 he married Mary Beck (better known later as Becky) and in 1948 completed his B.A. degree in history at Wheaton College (Illinois). Becky and Edward studied descriptive linguistics at the Summer Institute of Linguistics program at the University of Oklahoma. In 1951 they went to live in the Mexican state of Sonora to live with the Seri people and learn the Seri language under the auspices of the Summer Institute of Linguistics.\nThey built a small three room adobe house in the Seri fishing camp called Haxöl Iihom; the camp eventually became known in Spanish as El Desemboque. This house served as their residence during the next twenty-five years. Two more small rooms and a small office were added ten years after the birth of their daughter Cathy. The home was frequently visited by scientists studying in the area.\nThe Mosers worked with others to help fight an early measles epidemic by distributing gamma globulin, provided emergency medical help and transportation to the hospital (90 miles away by dirt road to the Sonora state capital, Hermosillo) in the years before a government clinic was set up in Haxöl Iihom, helped provide water to the village, and helped the people in numerous other ways. During these years the Seri population began to rebound, increasing from about 215 in 1951 to more than 800 by 2005.\nContributions to the study of Seri language and culture\nEdward and Becky learned the Seri language and did the first scientific analysis of its phonology, morphology and grammar. A major collaborator with them on their work at that time was Roberto Herrera Marcos, a Seri man who also resided in Haxöl Iihom. Their earliest publications were Seri reading primers that were published by SIL in cooperation with the Secretaría de Educación Pública after developing the first alphabet for the language under the guidelines of that Mexican ministry. Later work produced books of traditional Seri stories.\nDuring their years of residence, the Mosers collected extensive lexical and cultural information, much of which would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish. A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an ethnobotany (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward's death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the past half century is part of their legacy.Edward Moser and Roberto Herrera Marcos at work in the late 1950s\nThe Mosers and Herrera also worked on a translation of the New Testament which was also completed in 1982, a few years after Edward's death.\nEdward completed a master's degree in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1966. Edward and Becky spent many summers (more than twenty for Edward, more than forty for Becky) at the University of North Dakota giving linguistics courses through the Summer Institute of Linguistics program.\nEdward's interest in the well-being of the Seri people and in their rich culture and history was unflagging up until his sudden and unexpected death in 1976. At about that same time, a Mexican government-sponsored building project in Haxöl Iihom laid out the first streets, and the street in front of Mosers’ home was called Calle Eduardo Moser, a name which it still bears today.\nBibliography of Edward W.
