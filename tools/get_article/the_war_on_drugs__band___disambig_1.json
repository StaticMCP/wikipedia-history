The band consists of Adam Granduciel (vocals, guitar), David Hartley (bass guitar), Robbie Bennett (keyboards), Charlie Hall (drums), Jon Natchez (saxophone, keyboards), Anthony LaMarca (guitar), and Eliza Hardy Jones (percussion, keyboards).\nFounded by close collaborators Granduciel and Kurt Vile, the War on Drugs released their debut studio album, Wagonwheel Blues, in 2008. Vile departed shortly after its release to focus on his solo career, with Granduciel serving as the band's sole constant member thereafter. The band's second studio album Slave Ambient was released in 2011 to favorable reviews and a lengthy tour. The band's third album, Lost in the Dream, was released in 2014 following extensive touring and a period of loneliness and clinical depression for primary songwriter Granduciel. The album was released to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure.\nPrevious collaborator Hall joined the band as its full-time drummer during the recording process, with saxophonist Natchez and additional guitarist LaMarca accompanying the band for its world tour. Signing to Atlantic Records, the six-piece band released their fourth album, A Deeper Understanding, in 2017, which won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. The band released their fifth album, ''I Don't Live Here Anymore, in 2021.\nHistory\nBeginnings and Wagonwheel Blues'' (2003–2008)\nIn 2003, frontman Adam Granduciel moved from Oakland, California, to Philadelphia, where he met Kurt Vile, who had also recently moved back to Philadelphia after living in Boston for two years. The duo began writing, recording and performing music together. Vile remembered, \"Adam was the first dude I met when I moved back to Philadelphia in 2003. We saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things. I was obsessed with Bob Dylan at the time, and we totally geeked-out on that. We started playing together in the early days and he would be in my band, the Violators. Then, eventually I played in the War On Drugs.\"\nGranduciel and Vile began playing together as the War on Drugs in 2005. Regarding the band's name, Granduciel said, \"My friend Julian and I came up with it a few years ago over a couple bottles of red wine and a few typewriters when we were living in Oakland. We were writing a lot back then, working on a dictionary, and it just came out and we were like 'hey, good band name' so eventually when I moved to Philadelphia and got a band together I used it. It was either that or The Rigatoni Danzas. I think we made the right choice. I always felt though that it was the kind of name I could record all sorts of different music under without any sort of predictability inherent in the name.\" While Vile and Granduciel formed the backbone of the band, they had a number of accompanists early in the group's career, before finally settling on a lineup adding Charlie Hall as a drummer and organist, Kyle Lloyd as a drummer, and Dave Hartley on bass. Granduciel had previously toured and recorded with the Capitol Years, and Vile has several solo albums. The group gave away its Barrel of Batteries EP for free early in 2008. Their debut LP for Secretly Canadian, Wagonwheel Blues, was released in 2008.\nAfter the album's release and then a European tour, Vile departed from the band to focus on his solo career, saying, \"I only went on the first European tour when their album came out, and then I basically left the band. I knew if I stuck with that, it would be all my time and my goal was to have my own musical career.\" Mike Zanghi, also a member of Kurt & the Violators, joined the band at the time with Vile. Vile said, \"Mike was my drummer first and then when the War on Drugs' first record came out I thought I was lending Mike to Adam for the European tour but... he just played with them all the time so I kind of had to like, while they were touring a lot, figure out my own thing.\"\nSlave Ambient (2008–2012)\nThe lineup had several changes and by the end of 2008, Kurt Vile, Charlie Hall, and Kyle Lloyd all had exited the group. At the time Granduciel and Hartley were joined by drummer Mike Zanghi, whom Granduciel played with in Kurt Vile's backing band, the Violators. After recording much of the band's forthcoming studio album, Slave Ambient, Zanghi quit the band in 2010. Drummer Steven Urgo joined the band, with keyboardist Robbie Bennett being added at about the same time. Regarding Zanghi's exit, Granduciel said, \"I loved Mike. But you have things like friendship, and he's down to tour and he's a great guy.\"\nIn 2012, Patrick Berkery replaced Urgo as the band's drummer.\nLost in the Dream (2013–2015)\nfestival in Hilvarenbeek, The Netherlands, 2014]]\nOn December 4, 2013, the band announced the upcoming release of its third studio album, Lost in the Dream (March 18, 2014). The band streamed the album in its entirety on NPR's First Listen site for a week before its release. Award-winning alt-country rocker Ryan Adams said on Twitter that Lost in the Dream was a perfect album.\nLost in the Dream was featured as the Vinyl Me, Please record of the month in August 2014. The pressing was a limited edition pressing on mint green colored vinyl.\nA Deeper Understanding (2015–2021)\nin April 2018]]\nIn June 2015, the War on Drugs signed with Atlantic Records for a two-album deal.\nOn Record Store Day, April 22, 2017, the War on Drugs released their new single \"Thinking of a Place\". The single was produced by frontman Granduciel and Shawn Everett. April 28, 2017, the War on Drugs announced a fall 2017 tour in North America and Europe and that a new album was imminent. On June 1, 2017, a new song, \"Holding On\", was released, and it was announced that the album would be titled A Deeper Understanding and was released on August 25, 2017. \"Holding On\" was also used on the official soundtrack of EA Sports' FIFA 18. The 2017 tour began in September, opening in the band's hometown, Philadelphia, and it concluded in November in Sweden.\nA Deeper Understanding was nominated for the International Album of the Year award at the 2018 UK Americana Awards. At the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, on January 28, 2018, A Deeper Understanding won the Grammy for Best Rock Album. On October 6, 2020, the War on Drugs announced a live album titled Live Drugs, which was released on November 20, 2020.\n''I Don't Live Here Anymore (2021–present)\nThe War on Drugs released their fifth studio album, I Don't Live Here Anymore'', on October 29, 2021. Along with the announcement of the album, the band released a single and accompanying music video for the album's lead track, \"Living Proof\", with a 2022 tour announcement. The album was released to widespread critical acclaim, placing highly on several end-of-year lists. For the album's accompanying tour, keyboardist Eliza Hardy Jones, who has previously played with bass guitarist Dave Hartley in his solo project, Nightlands, joined the band.\nThroughout 2024, Granduciel produced the third studio album by the English singer–songwriter Sam Fender, People Watching (2025), and the sixth solo studio album by The Hold Steady's Craig Finn, Always Been, concurrently. Always Been featured Granduciel and The War on Drugs appearing as Finn's backing band throughout.\nMusical style\nThe band has been described as indie rock, heartland rock and neo-psychedelia, as well as Americana. Not only do they draw inspiration from artists like Bruce Springsteen, Talk Talk, and Granduciel's \"favorite modern day band\", Wilco, but they have inspired their own wave of guitar-forward, synth-layered indie rockers, sounding like the band Dire Straits.\nSide projects and collaborations\nKurt Vile & the Violators\n, Switzerland, 2014]]\nGranduciel and Zanghi are both former members of founding guitarist Vile's backing band The Violators, with Granduciel saying, \"There was never, despite what lazy journalists have assumed, any sort of falling out, or resentment\" after Vile left The War on Drugs. In 2011, Vile said, \"When my record came out, I assumed Adam would want to focus on the War on Drugs but he came with us in The Violators when we toured the States. The Violators became a unit, and although the cast does rotate, we've developed an even tighter unity and sound. Adam is an incredible guitar player these days and there is a certain feeling [between us] that nobody else can tap into. We don't really have to tell each other what to play, it just happens.\"\nSharon Van Etten\nBoth Hartley and Granduciel contributed to singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten's fourth studio album, Are We There (2014). Hartley performs bass guitar on the entire album, with Granduciel contributing guitar to the songs \"Our Love\" and \"Every Time the Sun Comes Up\".\nSore Eros\nGranduciel produced Sore Eros's self-titled 2020 album.\nDay of the Dead\nIn 2016, the War on Drugs contributed a cover of \"Touch of Grey\" for a Grateful Dead tribute album called Day of the Dead. The album was curated by The National's twin brothers, Aaron Dessner and Bryce Dessner. Granduciel had been curious about the Grateful Dead and other jam bands beginning when he attended a Phish concert.\nBeyoncé\nIn 2024, Granduciel appeared on Beyoncé's eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter, performing electric guitar on the track, \"II Most Wanted\". The track was produced by The War on Drugs' producer Shawn Everett and featured Miley Cyrus dueting with Beyoncé.\nLucius\nLucius was the guest band on the title track from the War On Drugs' 2021 album ''I Don't Live Here Anymore'', and Granduciel contributed vocals and guitar to the 2024 Lucius single \"Old Tape\".\nCraig Finn\nGranduciel produced the sixth solo studio album by The Hold Steady's Craig Finn, Always Been, scheduled for release on April 4, 2025. The album features Granduciel and The War on Drugs appearing throughout as Finn's backing band.\nMembers\nCurrent members\n*Adam Granduciel – lead vocals, lead guitar, harmonica, keyboards, samplers (2005–present)\n*David Hartley – bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2005–present)\n*Robbie Bennett – keyboards, piano, rhythm and lead guitar (2010–present)\n*Charlie Hall – drums (2013–present), organ (2008)\n*Jon Natchez – saxophone, keyboards (2014–present)\n*Anthony LaMarca – rhythm and lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (2014–present)\n*Eliza Hardy Jones – keyboards, acoustic guitar, percussion, backing vocals (2021–present)\nFormer members\n*Kurt Vile – rhythm and lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (2005–2009)\n*Kyle Lloyd – drums (2008)\n*Mike Zanghi – drums, percussion, sampler (2008–2010)\n*Steven Urgo – drums, percussion, sampler (2010–2012)\n*Patrick Berkery – drums, percussion (2012–2013)\nDiscography\nAlbums\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+List of studio albums, with selected chart positions, sales and certifications shown\n!
