      "text": "# Draft:Eihwar\n\nEihwar is a French duo associated with the contemporary wave of Viking music, blending pagan and Nordic folk with electronic, dance-oriented production. The band describe their approach as \"Viking War Trance,\" combining tribal chants, ritual percussion and modern electronics.\nHistory\nEihwar was founded in 2023 by French musicians Asrunn and Mark. Early videos and live performances with a ritualistic character drew attention across the folk/metal scene.\nIn 2024, the duo signed with the independent French label Season of Mist and released their debut album, Viking War Trance, which received coverage and reviews from several music outlets.\nMusical style\nCritics and interviews frequently associate Eihwar with Viking music aesthetics and themes, situating the duo within the wider pagan/Nordic folk revival. Their self-described \"Viking War Trance\" merges Nordic folk timbres, shamanic drums and dancefloor-ready electronics, often characterized as immersive and entrancing.\nLive performances and festivals\nEihwar have appeared at several European festivals:\n* Hellfest Open Air (France, 2024).\n* Wacken Open Air (Germany, 2025).\n* Tuska Open Air (Finland, 2025).\n* Midgardsblot (Norway, 2025).\n* Resurrection Fest (Spain, 2025).\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* Viking War Trance (Season of Mist, 2024)\nReception\nWall of Sound described Viking War Trance as \"a sonic journey between tribal trance and ancestral folklore\" (8.5/10), while RAMzine highlighted how the duo \"merge modern energy with Nordic authenticity\". Distorted Sound called it \"a convincing debut that carves a singular path within the folk and pagan scene\".\nMembers\n* Asrunn – vocals, percussion\n* Mark – vocals, programming\nExternal links\n* [https://www.eihwar.com Official website]\n* [https://eihwar.bandcamp.com Bandcamp]\nReferences"
