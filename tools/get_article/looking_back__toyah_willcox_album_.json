It is a collection of re-recordings of songs from her back catalogue, mostly classic hits from the Toyah band repertoire. The material was originally conceived as part of a double album Toyah Classics slated for release in March 1995. The two sets would eventually be released individually, with Looking Back as an 'electric' accompaniment to The Acoustic Album, released the following year. The album has never been re-released digitally.\nTrack listing\n# \"I Wanna Be Free\" (Toyah Willcox, Joel Bogen) – 2:53\n# \"Obsolete\" (Willcox, Bogen, Nigel Glockler) – 2:56\n# \"It's a Mystery\" (Keith Hale) – 3:58\n# \"We Are\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 3:03\n# \"Thunder in the Mountains\" (Willcox, Adrian Lee, Nigel Glockler) – 4:16\n# \"Good Morning Universe\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 3:46\n# \"Angel & Me\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 3:22\n# \"Be Proud, Be Loud (Be Heard)\" (Willcox, Bogen) – 3:22\n# \"Danced\" (Willcox, Bogen, Peter Bush) – 5:09\n# \"Rebel Run\" (Willcox, Simon Darlow) – 3:14\n# \"Desire\" (Willcox, Robert Fripp) – 2:34\n# \"Ieya\" (Willcox, Bogen, Bush) – 6:11\nPersonnel\n* Toyah Willcox – vocals\n* Tony 'Pooh' Kelly – guitars\n* David Waddington – guitar\n* Andy Nye – keyboards\n* Bob Skeat – bass, acoustic bass\n* Andy Dewar – drums, percussion\n* Tacye Lynette – additional vocals\n;Production\n* Oliver Davis – producer\n* Paul Maddens – engineer\n* David Richardson – executive producer\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://toyahwillcox.com/ The official Toyah website]"
