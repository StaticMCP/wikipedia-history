The ward elects two councillors to Brighton & Hove City Council. Until July 2025, they were Milla Gauge and Tristram Burden, both of the Labour Party. However Tristram Burden resigned on 29 July 2025  triggering a by-election on 18 September 2025. This meant that both Labour councillors elected in the full 2023 council election quit before completing their terms, following the stepping down of Chandni Mistry in March 2024  after an investigation into claims that she was not a resident of Brighton & Hove and hence not legally qualified to stand.\nThe ward is part of the parliamentary constituency of Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven.\nThe area lies to the east of the centre of Brighton, north of Kemptown and south-east of Hanover. It is largely made up of Victorian terraced houses, with a smaller number of detached and semi-detached houses, and includes Queen's Park public park. There are also a number of low-rise blocks of modern flats.\nSt Luke's Church, an Anglican church built in the Early English style, serves the area. Designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield and constructed between 1881 and 1885, the large flint-walled building has an unusual layout of bays in the north and south aisles of its nave; Nikolaus Pevsner described this as \"curious\" and a \"disturbing motif\". The church was listed at Grade II in 1999.\nReferences"
