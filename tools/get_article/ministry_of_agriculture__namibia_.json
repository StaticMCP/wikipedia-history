The first Namibian minister of agriculture was Gert Hanekom. Its  minister is Inge Zaamwani-Kamwi.\nAdditional portfolios\nIn 1990 the ministry was established as Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development. In 1991 the portfolio of fisheries was split off, and a separate Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources was created. In 2000 the portfolio of rural development was removed, too, and given to the Ministry of Regional and Local Government. The agriculture ministry was renamed Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry.\nIn 2020 the portfolio of land reform was added after the disestablishment of the Ministry of Land Reform. The forestry portfolio was given to the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, and the agriculture ministry was thus renamed Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform. In 2025 the ministry experienced its  change when the Ministry of Fisheries was dissolved, and agriculture took over its responsibilities. The ministry is now named Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Land Reform (MAFWLR).\nMinisters\nAll agriculture ministers in chronological order are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! #\n!
