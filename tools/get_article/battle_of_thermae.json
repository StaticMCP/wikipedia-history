The Carthaginian general Hamilcar surprised and defeated 6,000 allied troops of Rome.\nSeparated from the main Roman force of 20,000 men due to disagreements, the allies were attacked and crushed near Thermae, losing 4,000–6,000 killed. Hamilcar went on to capture Enna and Camarina in the aftermath.\nPrelude\nHamilcar, the commander of the Carthaginian land forces in Sicily, had stationed his army near Panormus. He received word that the Romans and their allies, with a total force of 20,000 men, quarreled over their accomplishments in battle, and that the 6,000 allies were isolated in their encampment between Paropus and Thermae.\nBattle\nHamilcar attacked the Roman allies with his entire army of 50,000, taking by surprise the allies, who were preparing to move out. Some 4,000–6,000 allies were killed.\nAftermath\nHamilcar exploited his victory to capture Enna and Camarina that same year with the aid of traitors in the two cities.\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*"
