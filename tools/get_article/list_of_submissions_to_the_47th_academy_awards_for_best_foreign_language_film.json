The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 47th Academy Awards, nineteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The five nominated films came from Argentina, France, Hungary, Italy and Poland.\nItaly won for the tenth time with Amarcord by Federico Fellini, which was also nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay in the subsequent ceremony (48th Academy Awards).\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!

It appears likely that the film was not screened.\n*  The Soviet Union selected The Ferocious One, a film from the Kyrgyz Republic with mostly Russian dialogue.\nReferences\nSources\n* Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"
