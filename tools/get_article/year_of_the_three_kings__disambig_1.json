This list does  include all years in which a country has had three kings or three claimants to the throne.\n;1016 in England: Æthelred the Unready died in April, leaving the throne to Edmund Ironside, who reigned only until November, when he died and was succeeded by Cnut the Great.\n;1066 in England: Upon the death of Edward the Confessor in January, Harold Godwinson (Earl of Wessex), William the Conqueror (Duke of Normandy), and Harald Hardrada (King of Norway) all claimed the title of King of England. Harold defeated Hardrada at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, leaving him to face William at the Battle of Hastings. William defeated Harold's forces (killing him in the process) and became king.\n;1483 in England: Edward&nbsp;IV died in April. His son Edward&nbsp;V, reigned until June, when his uncle and Lord Protector, Richard, Duke of Gloucester deposed him and assumed the throne as Richard&nbsp;III.\n;1888 and 1889 in Buganda: Mwanga&nbsp;II fled in September 1888 after his chiefs sought to replace him with his brother, Kiweewa.
