Apart from that, the predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation, except for the east of the locality along the river where the land use is crop growing.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from a heavily timbered landholding on the Condamine River, resumed from the Yandilla pastoral run and selected by Francis Claudius Brodribb in 1870. It consisted of   of plain, river flats and open forest country, with frontage of  to the river. Many thought Brodribb was foolhardy as the land would require so much effort to remove the trees. However, after 30 years of persistence, the property looked like \"pleasant park land\" and had become known for the good quality of its wool.\nFrancis Claudius Brodribb had a son Frank Kenric Brodribb, who, having received a large inheritance his father, built the mansion Kurrowah in Brisbane, which is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.\nDemographics\nIn the , Kurrowah had a population of 25 people.\nIn the , Kurrowah had a population of 10 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Kurrowah. The nearest government primary schools are Cecil Plains State School in neighbouring Cecil Plains to the north and Millmerran State School in Millmerran to the south. Both schools also offer secondary education to Year 10. For secondary education to Year 12, the nearest government secondary school is Pittsworth State High School in Pittsworth to the east; however, from some parts of the locality, it may be too distant for a daily commute and the other options are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
