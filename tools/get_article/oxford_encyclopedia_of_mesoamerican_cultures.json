Published in 2001, the encyclopedia builds on and updates the sixteen-volume Handbook of Middle American Indians (1964–76). The work's coverage spans Mesoamerica from the prehispanic era to the turn of the twenty-first century. Articles are presented alphabetically, but a synoptic outline of contents gives the titles of principal articles. These include geography and history; Mesoamerican cultures and ethnicities; Mesoamerican studies, with an overview article and articles on approaches, methods, and institutions; written and oral sources divided into prehispanic manuscripts and colonial manuscripts and sources; economy and subsistence; social political and religious organization, with principal articles on civil-religious hierarchy, ethnicity, family and kinship, gender, labor, law, political organization, land tenure, slavery, social stratification, an urbanization; social differentiation; institutions and organizations; cultural interaction and processes of social change; cosmovision and ritual performance, creative expressions and material forms; Mesoamerican sites, cities, and ceremonial centers. There are also biographies of historical figures as well as scholars of Mesoamerican culture.&nbsp; There is no coverage of colonialism per se, or race and racial conflict.\nReferences"
