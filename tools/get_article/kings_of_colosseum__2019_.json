Storylines were played out on MLW's television program Fusion.\nAt Intimidation Games, Tom Lawlor successfully defended the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Low Ki in a steel cage match and then Lawlor's former Team Filthy teammate Simon Gotch joined forces with the team of newcomers Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael to attack Lawlor after the match and formed a faction known as Contra Unit. At Battle Riot II, Contra Unit attacked Lawlor again during an interview after his successful title defense against Jimmy Havoc. On the April 20 episode of Fusion, Lawlor challenged Contra Unit to a match. Contra Unit attacked Lawlor again on numerous occasions throughout the next few weeks. On the June 8 episode of Fusion, it was announced that Lawlor would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Contra Unit member Jacob Fatu at Kings of Colosseum.\nOn June 29, MLW.com announced that a middleweight match would take place between Rey Horus and Myron Reed at Kings of Colosseum.\nOn July 2, it was announced that Alexander Hammerstone would defend the National Openweight Championship in a Star Sprangled Hammer Challenge at Kings of Colosseum.\nEvent\nPreliminary matches\nThe opening match of the event featured Alexander Hammerstone issued an open challenge, putting the National Openweight Championship on the line. Kotto Brazil answered the challenge to begin the match. Hammerstone executed a superplex and a Nightmare Pendulum on Brazil to retain the title. After the match, Hammerstone's The Dynasty teammate Maxwell Jacob Friedman issued a challenge to The Hart Foundation for the World Tag Team Championship.\nNext, Myron Reed took on Rey Horus in a middleweight match. Reed's ally Jordan Oliver distracted Horus enough to allow Reed to execute a Louisville Slugger on Horus for the win.\nMain event match\nIn the main event, Tom Lawlor defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Contra Unit member Jacob Fatu. Near the end of the match, Lawlor avoided a moonsault by Fatu and hit him with some strikes but Fatu superkicked Lawlor and then nailed a pop-up Samoan drop and a double jump moonsault to pin him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.\nAftermath\nDynasty received their title shot against Hart Foundation in a ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship on the July 13 episode of Fusion, which Dynasty won.\nTom Lawlor received his rematch for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship against Jacob Fatu on the August 31 episode of Fusion, where Fatu retained the title with the help of his Contra Unit teammates and then Lawlor was assaulted by Contra Unit after the match until Low Ki and The Von Erichs (Ross Von Erich and Marshall Von Erich) made the save for Lawlor. This led to a War Chamber match pitting Von Erichs, Lawlor and Low Ki against Contra Unit at War Chamber, which Team Von Erichs won.\nResults\nSee also\n*2019 in professional wrestling\n*List of Major League Wrestling events\nReferences"
