The street name refers to the name of the capital city of Warsaw.\nHistory\nAround the Branicki Palace and the town's market square, suburbs began to grow chaotically, including Bojary. The residents of the new districts, poor immigrants from the countryside, arrived with the entire baggage of rural traditions: the layout of houses, traditional behaviors and way of life. These people came from different regions, which resulted in a large variety of types of buildings being erected. By the mid 19th century this was the main street of the city, containing offices, tenement houses and shops. In 1910, Jews predominated among the owners of Warszawska Street. They constituted 46.2 percent of all owners, Poles made up 28.1 percent, Germans 12.4 percent and the Russians 3.3 percent.\nIn August 1920 the Battle of Białystok fierce street fight occurred in the street and its surroundings with Józef Marjański, one of the city defenders, killed in the intersection of Warszawska and Pałacowa streets.\nDuring World War II, one of the aspects of German policy in occupied Poland was the liquidation of material cultural heritage. It did not include the 19th-century wooden districts, which is why the Boyars survived the German occupation. In addition, the vast damage caused by the suppression of the Białystok Ghetto uprising and during the occupation of the city by the Red Army from the Wehrmacht in July 1944 spared this part of the city. Following the war and the inclusion of the city in the Polish People's Republic, a number of old buildings were demolished in favor of modern construction.\nBuildings\nThere are many notable and historic buildings and structures on Warszawska Street, including:\n*Warszawska 3 - Provincial Headquarters of the State Fire Service\n*Warszawska 5a - Built in 1894, but the history of the property dates back to the early 19th century and the period of the Prussian partition.\n*Warszawska 7 - Trylling Palace, dating back to 1871, alternating ownership with the Bulkowstein family and the Trylling family between the late 19th century and the early 20th century.
