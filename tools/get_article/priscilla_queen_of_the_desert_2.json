It serves as the sequel to the 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\nPlot\nElliott described the story as, \"Not what people expect… it is about old age... I wrote into the script of what it's like to get old and to be either gay, trans—I mean, it's a subject that's never been explored.\"\nCast\n* Terence Stamp as Bernadette Bassenger\n* Hugo Weaving as Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose / Mitzi Del Bra\n* Guy Pearce as Adam Whitely / Felicia Jollygoodfellow\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn April 2024, Elliott announced that work on the sequel was underway, with the original main cast reprising their roles. After Stamp died on 17 August 2025, Elliott told The Guardian: \"[Stamp] agreed to do the sequel a few years ago and we've been particularly busy over the past year.\"\nFilming\nIn September 2025, Elliott revealed that, with the blessing of the cast and financiers, Stamp spent the final months of his life pre-filming all of his scenes with \"a nine-camera array of the entire script\".\nSee also\n* Cinema of Australia\n* List of cult films\n* Transgender characters in film and television\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
