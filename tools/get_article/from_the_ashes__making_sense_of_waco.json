Richardson. Some of the essays are scholarly articles, while others are opinion pieces. Other contents include press releases, personal correspondences, and a poem from a surviving Branch Davidian.

Some of the essays are scholarly articles, while others are opinion pieces. Other contents include press releases, personal correspondences, and a poem from a surviving Branch Davidian.\nContributors\nPublication\nFrom the Ashes was published in 1994 by Rowman & Littlefield. Editor James R. Lewis was then academic director of the Association of World Academics for Religious Education.\nReception\nH. Newton Malony for the International Journal for the Psychology of Religion called the book a \"service\" to the public for its compilation of materials and criticisms of the Cult Awareness Network's influence over the federal government during the Waco siege in particular. However, he criticized Lewis for having a biased perspective on the topic, specifically against the federal government's actions.\nCatherine Wessinger for Nova Religio compliments the work for including military and law enforcement perspectives. She notes that essays by Robert D. Hicks and Charlie Beckwith are valuable, but one by Moorman Oliver, Jr., is \"filled with incorrect allegations of fact\". She notes in her review of the book that it was a chance for new religious movement scholars to respond to the siege.\nAnson Shupe for the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion criticizes the book for its strange colloquial tone which makes \"metaphors and similes that at times border on the irresponsible\" like comparing the Branch Davidians to the Holocaust or the Native American genocide, among other things. He also thinks the project was weakened by its improper timing – which prevented its contributors to use informative government reports – and the hyperbolic and ominous tone.\nJames A. Mathisen for Review of Religious Research criticized the work for not having a specific audience in mind when being edited together. He recommended libraries with smaller budgets to \"wait for Armageddon in Waco: Critical Perspectives on the Branch Davidian Conflict (1995) to compare before\" spending the money for only a few particularly good articles.\nBlake W. Burleson for The San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal believes that some of the contributors are like Carl Jung's \"cultural enthusiasts\" in that they exhibit \"naïve belief in human innocence, or, in this case, religious innocence\". He criticizes some contributors for going \"great lengths\" to defend David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians.\nReferences"
