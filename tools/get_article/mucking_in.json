It is hosted by Jim Mora. He is assisted by gardener Tony Murrell.\nThe show features a very similar premise to the show Ground Force, in which a team of gardeners, and local volunteers employed by the show descend on an individual's place and improve the garden for the cameras within a specified time limit. People whose gardens are made over are nominated by the public, often for the voluntary work they have done within the community.\nSee also\n* Ground Force\n* Backyard Blitz\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Jim Mora and Tony Murrell (2009).
