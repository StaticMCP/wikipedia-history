The film centers on the story of T-24, a male Bengal tiger popularly known as Ustad, who lived in Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan, India. In 2015, T-24 was accused of killing four people near the reserve, leading to his controversial capture and relocation to a zoo enclosure at Sajjangarh Biological Park in Udaipur. The decision sparked nationwide debate and protests among conservationists, local communities, and animal rights groups, raising larger questions about the coexistence of humans and tigers in India.\nBackground and themes\nThe documentary traces Pereira's decade-long engagement with tiger conservation in India, beginning in 2012. Originally conceived as a nature film, the project shifted focus after the incident involving T-24 and the subsequent legal proceedings. The film highlights the conflicting perspectives of forest officials, villagers, activists, and legal authorities, while also exploring the ecological role of apex predators in India’s protected reserves. Through interviews, field footage, and archival material, Tiger 24 examines the tension between wildlife protection and human safety, as well as the cultural symbolism of tigers in India.\nProduction\nFilming took place over several years in Ranthambore National Park, one of India's most famous tiger reserves. Pereira, who initially documented tiger behavior and tourism, expanded his project after gaining access to legal records and testimonies related to the T-24 case. The film was independently produced and financed, with Pereira serving as director, producer and cinematographer. After a fallout with a Los Angeles production company, he decided to finish the film independently, editing it himself in his loft in Los Angeles on an iMac. The project was completed in an indie style with support from fellow independent filmmakers, blending natural history cinematography, investigative documentary techniques, and narrative storytelling. Executive Producers include Ellen Goldsmith Vein, Jeremy Bell, Eagle Egilsson, Howard Barish, Zach Mann and Stephen Nemeth. The film's original score was composed by Kreng (Pepijn Caudron) and the theme song was composed by Mel Elias.\nRelease\nTiger 24 premiered at the Cleveland International Film Festival in April 2022, where it was nominated for the Greg Gund Memorial Standing Up Award. It won Best Feature Documentary at the 2022 Burbank International Film Festival. That same year, the film was a finalist at the Jackson Wild Media Awards and received two nominations at the Wildscreen Festival for the prestigious Panda Awards. It won the Panda Award for Onscreen Talent at Wildscreen 2022. The film was an official selection at the 2022 Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival.\nIn 2022, the film was picked up for US and Canadian distribution by Elevation Pictures. It received a limited theatrical release in the United States and qualified for the Academy Awards. Distribution in North America included transactional video on demand and a special edition Blu-ray through Universal Studios.\nTiger 24 was released theatrically in India on January 20, 2023, in collaboration with AA Films. The film opened in multiple cities including Mumbai, Pune, Jaipur, and Delhi, screening at major multiplex chains such as PVR and Cinépolis.
