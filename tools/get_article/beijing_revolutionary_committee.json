With the end of the Cultural Revolution, in December 1979, the Third Session of the Seventh Beijing Municipal People's Congress abolished the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and restored the Beijing Municipal People's Government.\nBackground\nand others met with members of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee on May 1, 1967]]\nIn 1959, Wu Han, the deputy mayor of Beijing, wrote works such as \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\", which were appreciated by Mao Zedong. On November 10, 1965, Yao Wenyuan wrote \"On the New Historical Play 'Dismissal of Hai Rui'\" and published it in Shanghai's Wenhui Bao, which suddenly criticized \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\", which had been praised for many years. However, the criticism of Wu Han was opposed by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Peng Zhen (the first secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee). On February 3, 1966, Peng Zhen convened an enlarged meeting of the Five Man Group and presided over the drafting of the \"Report Outline on Current Academic Discussions\" (the \"February Outline\"), pfroposing that academic issues should be separated from politics and opposing the involvement of Wu Han in the 1959 Lushan Conference. On the 5th, Peng Zhen attended the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee chaired by Liu Shaoqi, and the meeting discussed and passed the report outline. In February 1966, Liu Shaoqi presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in Beijing and adopted the \"February Outline\". It clearly opposed the elevation of academic issues to political issues, which formed a sharp contrast with Mao Zedong's intentions and the trend of the Cultural Revolution. In late March, Mao Zedong had several conversations with Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing and others, criticizing the \"February Outline\" for confusing class boundaries and being wrong. He ordered the entire Communist Party to issue a notice to revoke the \"February Outline\". Mao Zedong also said: \"The Beijing Municipal Committee is impenetrable. The Municipal Committee must be dissolved.\"\nAfterwards, the 16 May Notification drafted by Chen Boda and others, reviewed and revised by Mao Zedong eight times, and finally passed on May 16 after discussion at the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau. In addition to criticizing Peng Zhen by name, the \"Notice\" also announced the cancellation of the \"February Outline\" and the Five Man Group, and the establishment of the Cultural Revolution Group for guidance. On May 18, Lin Biao responded to Mao Zedong and issued a speech to prevent a coup (the May 18 Speech). Afterwards, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi, Yang Shangkun and others who were related to Liu Shaoqi and Peng Zhen were successively dismissed (known in history as the Peng, Luo, Lu, and Yang Anti-Party Group Case).\nFrom May 4 to 26, 1966, Peng Zhen was criticized at the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. He was removed from his post as secretary of the CCP Central Secretariat and dismissed from his posts as first secretary of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee and mayor of Beijing. On June 4, 1966, the ''People's Daily'' published the CCP Central Committee's Decision on the Reorganization of the Beijing Municipal Committee, appointing Li Xuefeng, first secretary of the North China Bureau, as first secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee and Wu De, first secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee, as secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, thus reorganizing the leadership team of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee. However, under the circumstances at the time, the new CCP Beijing Municipal Committee found it difficult to function normally and soon became paralyzed.\nhistory\nIn 1967, the January Storm broke out in Shanghai and had a wide and strong impact across the country, triggering a series of chain reactions. In the same year, Shanxi (January 14), Shandong (February 3), Heilongjiang (January 31), Guizhou (January 25) and other provinces seized power. On January 18, 1967, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Seizing Power was established, but it was not recognized by the central government. On April 20 of the same year, 100,000 people in Beijing gathered to celebrate the birth of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and passed the Revolutionary Committee's \"Letter of Tribute to Chairman Mao\". Zhou Enlai attended the meeting on behalf of Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, the Central Committee of the CCP, the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and the Central Military Commission to congratulate and speak. Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu and others attended. Jiang Qing spoke on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Xie Fuzhi spoke on behalf of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee. Zhang Chunqiao spoke on behalf of the delegation of the Revolutionary Committees of five provinces and cities. The chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee was Xie Fuzhi, and the vice chairmen were Wu De, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, and Nie Yuanzi.\nIn his speech, Xie Fuzhi said: \"The old Beijing Municipal Committee, which had long been entrenched by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, has always waved the 'red flag' to oppose the red flag under the protection and support of the largest handful of capitalist roaders in the Party. They have always implemented a blockade against the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, turning Beijing into an independent kingdom where 'no one can get in' and 'no water can get in', in a vain attempt to turn Beijing into a base for their counter-revolutionary restoration. This counter-revolutionary revisionist group is a big bully riding on the heads of the broad masses of the Beijing people, and has committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people.\" Therefore, it is necessary to \"smash the old nest of the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Municipal Committee and defeat them completely\", \"carry forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to take risks, and dare to revolutionize\", \"fully mobilize the masses and carry out mass movements\", and \"recapture all the positions usurped by them\". Workers' representatives, representatives of the People's Liberation Army of the garrison area, and representatives of the Red Guards from colleges and universities who attended the meeting spoke one after another. At the end of the conference, the audience sang \"Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman\" and \"The Internationale\".\nBecause of the advocacy of \"streamlining institutions\" and \"delegating cadres to work\", the Beijing Revolutionary Committee was \"united\" from its formal establishment on April 20, 1967, until the establishment of the Fourth Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP on March 15, 1971. That is, there was no title of Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP. After the establishment of the Fourth Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP, the powers of the party and government began to separate. In December 1979, the Third Session of the Seventh Beijing Municipal People's Congress abolished the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and restored the Beijing Municipal People's Government. The district and county people's governments and street offices were also restored.\nJurisdiction\nThe Beijing Revolutionary Committee has a total of 37 district, county and bureau-level units under its jurisdiction.\nAmong them, Pinggu, Changping, Daxing, Shunyi, Shijingshan, Fengtai, Xuanwu, Xicheng, Tongxian, Miyun, Huairou, Haidian, Chaoyang, Dongcheng, Chongwen, Mentougou, Fangshan, and Yanqing, a total of 18 districts and counties, successively established district and county revolutionary committees between September 1967 and February 1968, with a core leading group of the CCP. The Beijing Revolutionary Committee abolished the original 45 municipal bureaus and merged them into 19 bureaus. With the approval of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, each bureau established a revolutionary leading group with a core leading group for of the CCP.\nReferences"
