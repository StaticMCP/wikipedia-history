The film had 20 million  theatre admissions.\nPlot\nThe dedication in the opening credits reads:\nThe film depicts the combat routine of a crew operating a self-propelled gun during the Liberation of Right-Bank Ukraine in 1944.\nThe protagonist, Junior Lieutenant Maleshkin, is a recently graduated officer assigned to command a SU-100 self-propelled gun (referred to as an SU-85 in the original book). His crew consists of older, more battle-hardened soldiers whose experience often overshadows his authority. This dynamic creates tension, as Maleshkin struggles to assert himself while facing frequent challenges to his leadership. His relationship with the crew alternates between conflict and reconciliation, and his battery commander remains critical of his perceived ineptitude, threatening to relieve him of command.\nMaleshkin’s crew frequently encounters misfortunes, ranging from minor incidents, such as the driver appearing disheveled, to serious issues like discovering a live grenade with its pin removed inside the vehicle or mechanical failures during critical moments.\nDespite these setbacks, the crew rises to the occasion during their first battle. Joined by infantryman Gromykhalo, they unexpectedly find themselves leading an assault and later isolated behind enemy lines. The self-propelled gun crew, tasked with following the tanks per regulations, instead engages superior enemy forces heroically, ensuring victory in the battle. However, the skirmish comes at a cost, as the gunner, Mikhail Domeshek, is killed in action.\nCast\n* Mikhail Kononov as 2nd Lt. Alexander Alexandrovich Maleshkin\n* Oleg Borisov as Sgt.
