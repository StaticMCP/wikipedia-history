Conservative Robert Jenrick won the seat with a majority of 7,403.\nBackground\nMercer resigned the Conservative Party whip on 31 May 2013 after an investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme regarding allegations of paid lobbying without registering the interest. He was paid £4,000 for asking questions in Parliament, and the Panorama team considered that he asked five parliamentary questions, but declared only £2,000 of the £4,000. As a consequence, he said at the time that he would not stand in the 2015 general election.\nOn 29 April, after being told that the Committee on Standards would recommend that he be suspended from the House of Commons for six months, Mercer announced that he would resign his seat: he told journalists on College Green that he was standing down from \"God's county of Nottinghamshire\". Mercer was appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Three Chiltern Hundreds on 30 April 2014, a mechanism by which MPs resign.\nThe writ was moved on 1 May 2014 for the by-election to be held on 5 June.\nCandidates\nThe nominations closed at 4pm on Tuesday 13 May with 11 candidates being nominated.\nThe local Conservative Party had already selected Robert Jenrick to fight the seat. Jenrick trained as a solicitor and was a director of Christie's auction house. He is married with two children.\nLabour selected 27-year-old councillor Michael Payne, a former students' union president and current deputy leader of Gedling Borough Council.\nThe Liberal Democrats chose David Watts, leader of Broxtowe Borough Council.\nNigel Farage was immediately interviewed on the evening of 29 April and said he was \"tempted\" to stand, but the next morning he ruled himself out.[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27216474 \"Nigel Farage: Newark seat 'seriously tempting'\"], BBC News, 30 April 2014- Norman Smith, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-27218755 \"A pint with Nigel Farage as he mulled big decision\"], BBC News, 30 April 2014 UKIP instead announced that outspoken former Conservative and current UKIP MEP for the East Midlands Roger HelmerTom Payne, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/ukip-mep-roger-helmer-people-should-be-able-to-dislike-homosexuality-like-they-do-different-types-of-tea-9300202.html \"Ukip MEP Roger Helmer: People should be able to dislike homosexuality like they do different types of tea\"], The Independent, 29 April 2014- Adam Withnall, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/roger-helmer-mep-at-centre-of-homophobia-row-unveiled-as-ukip-candidate-for-newark-byelection-9327582.html \"Roger Helmer MEP at centre of homophobia row unveiled as Ukip candidate for Newark by-election\"], The Independent, 6 May 2014 would stand in the by-election.\nThe Bus Pass Elvis Party leader and perennial election candidate, David Bishop, announced on 6 May that he would stand in the by-election after taking fourth place ahead of the Liberal Democrats in a recent local authority by-election in Clifton North ward, Nottingham.\nResult\n}}\nThe Conservatives retained the seat with a majority of over 7,000 which was described by the BBC as 'a relatively comfortable victory'. While UKIP's performance decreased the Conservative majority the BBC's Alex Forsyth said this was 'not as much as Mr Farage had hoped - or predicted'. Christopher Hope, writing in The Daily Telegraph, argued that 'the scale of the victory is a vindication for the Tory high command which mounted a huge effort to win the seat' and claimed that David Cameron 'had halted the momentum of Ukip'. George Osborne hailed his party's victory and noted that it was the first time the Conservative's had held a seat at a by-election while in government for 25 years. However, both Nigel Farage and Labour's Chris Bryant suggested that the Conservative performance was not particularly impressive. It was suggested by Owen Jones in The Guardian that \"Labour and Lib Dem voters clearly voted tactically to keep Ukip out\". The poor performance for the Liberal Democrats was described by the BBC as one of 'worst performances in a post-war English by-election' for the party or its predecessors, and by The Telegraph as 'a disaster' for the party.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:95%;line-height:14px\"\n|-\n!! style=\"width:75px;\"| Date(s)conducted!! style=\"width:200px;\"|Polling organisation/client!! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Sample size!! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"background:#0087dc; width:60px;\"| Con!! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"background:#dc241f; width:60px;\"| Lab!! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"background:#fdbb30; width:60px;\"| LD!! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"background:#70147a; width:60px;\"| UKIP!! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"background:gray; width:60px;\"| Others!! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:85px;\"| Lead\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"|5 Jun 2014 ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 2014 by-election  ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 38,707 ||style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"| 45.0% || style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 17.7% || style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 3% ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 25.9% ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 8% || style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"| 19%\n|-\n| 2–3 Jun || [https://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Newark-poll-2.pdf Survation] || 678 || style=\"background:#B3E0FF\"|  42% || 22% || 4% || 27% || 5% || style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"| 15%\n|-\n| 27 May–1 Jun || [http://www.conservativehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/LORD-ASHCROFT-POLLS-Newark-poll-summary-June-2014-1.pdf Lord Ashcroft] || 1,000 || style=\"background:#B3E0FF\"|  42% || 20% || 6% || 27% || 5% || style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"| 15%\n|-\n| 27–28 May || [https://survation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Newark-Poll-Sun-Tables.pdf Survation/The Sun] || 606 || style=\"background:#B3E0FF\"|  36% || 27% || 5% || 28% || 5% || style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"| 8%\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"|6 May 2010 ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| [https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/d03.stm 2010 Results (Newark only)]  ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 51,228 || style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"|53.9% ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 22.3% || style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 20.0% ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| 3.8% ||style=\"background:#D5D5D5\"| - || style=\"background:#0087DC; color:white;\"| 31.5%\n|}\nPrevious result\n}}\nSee also\n*1943 Newark by-election\n*2014 United Kingdom local elections\n*2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom\n*List of United Kingdom by-elections\nNotes"
