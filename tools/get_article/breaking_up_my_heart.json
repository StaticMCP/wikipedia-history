It peaked at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was notable for its more contemporary, synthesiser-driven arrangement, departing from Stevens' trademark '50s rock-and-roll influenced sound.  A limited pop-up gatefold sleeve version was also released, where Stevens pops up from the middle of the sleeve when opened.\nTrack listings\n7\": Epic / A 6072 (UK)\n# \"Breaking Up My Heart\" – 3:57\n# \"I'll Give You My Heart\" – 2:54\n12\": Epic / TA 6072 (UK)\n# \"Breaking Up My Heart\" (Extended Remix) – 6:55\n# \"I'll Give You My Heart\" – 2:54\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1985)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark (Hitlisten)\n|15\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n|10\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
