She became a nanny but, at age 17, got her first modelling job by replying to an ad by Elite Model Management. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Stewart-Whyte performed runway shows for, among others, Versace, Armani, Saint-Laurent and Lagerfeld, and modeled for Victoria's Secret, Gucci, Christian Dior, and Maybelline. She also appeared on  magazine covers such as Vogue Paris in 1991 and 1992, and the British and Italian editions of both Elle and Marie Claire and French Elle.\nPersonal life\nStewart-Whyte married French tennis player Yannick Noah in 1995. They divorced in 1999, with Stewart-Whyte retaining custody of their two daughters. In 2001, Stewart-Whyte married French boxer and businessman Franck Ferrando, aka Dan Koonoo. Their son was born in 2001. In 2004, Ferrando/Koonoo died of a pulmonary edema while boxing at the Marcel-Cerdan gym in Noisy-le-Grand.\nIn 2001, Noah gained custody of their two daughters In 2003, Stewart-Whyte complained in the press that Noah had not respected her court-ordered visitation rights with their daughters and that Noah was using them to promote his album. Noah publicly remarked that they had not heard from her in two years. In 2017, her daughter Jenaye Noah became a model.\nIn March 2004, it was reported that Stewart-Whyte had been kidnapped, and that her mother and sister had received a ransom demand of several million dollars. After she had been missing for 10 days, French police reported that she had not been kidnapped, that she had been staying with friends and that the ransom demand was a misunderstanding.\nIn 2010, Stewart-Whyte's younger half-brother, Donald Stewart-Whyte, a Muslim convert who had changed his name to Abdul Waheed, was charged with plotting murder and terrorism but was acquitted.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
