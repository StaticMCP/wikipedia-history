The film is based on several nursery rhymes and fairy tales, including \"Old King Cole\". It was directed by David Hand and released on July 29, 1933.\nIt's a semi-remake of the 1931 Silly Symphony short Mother Goose Melodies, but in color, with more details and technically advanced animation.\nPlot\nOne evening in Storyland, the story book \"Old King Cole\" opens itself, and the king's castle folds open. Other nursery rhyme books do the same thing, and several famous characters leave their homes and go to Old King Cole's party. There, all the characters have a small sing-and-dance act. When the Ten Little Indians get on  stage, their dance is so catchy that Old King Cole and all the other characters join in as well. After Old Mother Hubbard accidentally pushes Old King Cole into a fountain, the mice from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\" tell everybody that it is midnight and that everybody should go home. All the characters return to their books, and Old King Cole sings a farewell song to everybody. Then he puts out a bottle of milk for the milkman before he runs back inside, and the cartoon ends.\nCharacters portrayed\nThe short features popular Nursery Rhyme and Fairy Tale characters.

(1938), A Gander at Mother Goose (1940), A Coy Decoy (1941) and Book Revue (1946).\nHome media\nThe short was released on December 19, 2006, on Walt Disney Treasures: More Silly Symphonies, Volume Two.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506964/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Bert Lewis on IMDB]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170608203653/http://www.disneyshorts.org/shorts.aspx?shortID=190 Disney Shorts information]"
