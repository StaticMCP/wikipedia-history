In the past, it was also called 23 August Boulevard, Queen Marie Boulevard, and Liget út. It received its current name by Local Council Decision no. 260/1990.\nArchitecture\nProminent along the boulevard are two groups of urban buildings designated as historical monuments. The first group consists of the Ciobanu, Gombos, Klein, and Banca Timișana palaces, showcasing a highly successful example of early 20th-century architecture (known as Secession) in Timișoara. Despite their varied stylistic expressions, all four palaces share cornices aligned at the same height. The second group includes the Post Office, the National Bank, the Institute of Medicine, and two student dormitories.\nDirectly opposite, at the site where the Transylvania Barracks once stood, rises the Continental Hotel—Timișoara's first tower building, inaugurated in 1971.\nReferences"
