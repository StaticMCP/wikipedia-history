The recording documents the rehearsals and backstages from their No Strings Attached Tour, the concert series promoting their March 2000 studio album.\nThe release features concert footage interspersed with backstage segments and interviews. Production elements visible in the film include pyrotechnic effects, hydraulic stage lifts, and aerial rigging, consistent with the tour's technical specifications.\nThe video was certified platinum by the RIAA on March 9, 2001.\nBackground\nThe video album documents the rehearsals and behind-the-scenes of *NSYNC's No Strings Attached Tour. The group initially mentioned the tour during an AOL group chat in late 1999, with JC Chasez revealing their plans. It was officially announced on March 21, 2000—the same day as the album's release—with rehearsals starting shortly after. Sponsored by MCY Music and Nabisco and produced by SFX Touring, the tour became an instant success, selling out all 50 initial dates and moving one million tickets on the first day.\nThe tour later spawned an IMAX concert film and an exclusive MSN partnership for fan content. It received positive to mixed reviews from music critics and fans who praised the band’s energy, vocal talents, and onstage persona. It spanned 85 shows across North America between May and October 2000, with reported gross earnings exceeding $70 million.\nRehearsals began in April 2000 at the Lakeland Center in Lakeland, Florida. Due to the closeness of their previous tour, the stage for this outing was very similar. However, the stage included new elements including pyrotechnics, stage lifts and aerial suspension. These elements were the reason why the band opted to perform in stadiums and arenas instead of outdoor amphitheatres. Lance Bass praised the show's spectacle, promising close audience interaction while keeping surprises under wraps.\nThe tour was first documented on the MTV series, Making the Tour. It followed the band's process from song selection, wardrobe and rehearsals. A full length performance of \"Space Cowboy (Yippie-Yi-Yay)\" at the Tacoma Dome was shown during the show. The episode aired on July 16, 2000. The video album contained more planning and backstage footage, performances of \"Bye Bye Bye\" and \"This I Promise You\", along with the music videos from their current album.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = KidzWorld\n| rev2score =\n}}\nThe KidzWorld review praised some scenes, like the stressful moments (such as Justin worrying over the choreography) and the tour bus interactions, but felt some parts seemed staged for the cameras. Still, they considered the DVD a must-have for hardcore fans, showcasing the hard work behind the expensive shows. According to the critic, it has a positive vibe but nothing over-the-top—not \"groundbreaking\", just solid content for fans.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the back cover of the DVD Making the Tour.\n* Management [Exclusive] – Johnny Wright\n* Supervised By [Executive Video] – Janet Kleinbaum\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2001)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Video Charts\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Top Music Videos\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format\n!scope=\"col\"|\n!scope=\"col\"|Label\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|United States\n|February 6, 2001\n|VHS\n|01241-41726-3\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Jive Records\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|February 13, 2001\n|rowspan=\"2\"|DVD\n|01241-41726-9\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
