The organization was inspired by the principles of the British Outward Bound School.\nOne of the early adopters of Man O' War ideals was the Hope Wadell Training Institute in Calabar. Notably, Sasa Ita Nsemoh and Ebiri Oteiri Okoro, who later became influential figures in Man O' War, were students at this institute and participated in various activities, including membership in the Boys Scouts and the Man O' War Club.\nEstablishment of the Man O' War Club, University of Ife\nIn 1971, Sasa Ita and Ebiri Okoro, fresh graduates of the Hope Wadell Training Institute, entered the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1972. Their experiences as Man O' War members and their involvement in the Nigerian Civil War (1967 – 1970) inspired them to create an organization aimed at instilling self-reliance, discipline, and physical fitness in university students.\nThe University of Ife's vice chancellor, Hezekiah Oluwasanmi, supported their proposal, and the Emir of Kano, the Ooni of Ife, and the Obi of Onitsha became Patrons of the club. On 5 May 1973, the Man O' War Club, University of Ife, was established. The club received official recognition from the university's Director of Student Affairs (DSA) and became a prominent student organization within the institution.\nOn 21 January 1974, the club was allocated a training base within the university campus, and it received support from subsequent vice chancellors. The Nigerian Army also recognized the club's potential and provided logistical support.\nExpansion and influence\nThe success of the Man O' War Club at the University of Ife inspired the creation of similar units at other universities. In 1976, additional units were established at the University of Lagos, Ado Bayero University in November 1977, and the University of Ibadan by 1984.\nNational Union of Man O' War Cadets in Colleges and Higher Institutions of Nigeria (NUMOWCHIN)\nNUMOWCHIN was established in 1981 with the aim of unifying Man O' War Cadets in higher institutions across Nigeria. Ifeolu Adewumi, the Commander-in-Chief of the Man O' War cadets at the University of Ife, was elected as the first Supreme Commandant (National President) of NUMOWCHIN.\nIn recent years, NUMOWCHIN has experienced internal tensions and reduced acceptability among higher institution students.\nEfforts to reconcile conflicting parties within NUMOWCHIN in 2000 failed due to allegations of misconduct by the Auchi Polytechnic cadets.\nRevival efforts\nRecent efforts have been made to revive NUMOWCHIN. Chief Coordinators from various Man O' War cadets agreed on the necessity of deliberate efforts to revive NUMOWCHIN during a Passing out Parade (PoP) ceremony held at the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) in 2006. Similar efforts are underway in other geopolitical zones of Nigeria.\nOrganizational structure\nMan O' War operates with a hierarchical structure, including:\n* National Command: Comprising all 6 Regional Commands.\n* Regional Command: Comprising all 36 State Commands, FCT Abuja, and Railway Command.\n* State Command: Comprising all Area Commands.\n* Area Command: Comprising Multiple Units.\n* Unit: The smallest base of Man O' War Nigeria.\n* NUMOWCHIN (Cadet): Comprising all Units in Primary, Secondary Schools, and Tertiary Institutions.\nVision and mission\nMan O' War Nigeria envisions a nation where people and communities coexist in peace, harmony, and mutual respect through sustainable community development, contributing to the socio-political and economic well-being of the nation in alignment with the Citizenship & Leadership Training Centre's goals.\nThe mission of Man O' War is to direct human resources towards rendering community services and creating unique life experiences that promote self-awareness.\nEstablishment of Man O' War\nThe establishment of Man O' War is governed by Section 8b of the Military Act, operating as a Uniform Organization with a ranking structure under the centre's supervision. The organization focuses on training for responsible leadership, safety & rescue, good citizenship, social & security services, and community development. It also serves as a reserve force for security agencies and is involved in community policing and security observations.\nMan O' War has formations in all Nigerian states, including Federal Capital Territory Command and Railway Command. Additionally, Man O' War cadets are present in primary schools, secondary schools, and higher institutions of learning.\nHistory of Man O' War Bay Training Centre\nMan O' War Bay Training Centre, later known as Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre (CLTC), was influenced by the outward bound type of education developed by Kurt Hahn. Han founded the first outward bound school in Aberdovey, Wales, in 1941. Alec Dickson, with an interest in community development, established the Man O' War Bay Training Centre in 1951 in Victoria, Southern Cameroon. It gained legal status through an ordinance published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 45 of 10 August 1960, and was modified by Decree No. 38 of December 1989.\nThe Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre is an affiliate member of the Outward Bound Organization present in over fifty countries. It was the first in Africa and the second in the world, having trained over seven million Nigerians from various backgrounds in its more than fifty-four years of operation.\nThe centre operates as an informal institution, using environmental challenges to instill core values such as courage, trust, integrity, and compassion for others in participants.\nSee also\n* Scout Association of Nigeria\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
