The position is mentioned for the first time in the reign of Sancho IV of Castile. In the Crónica (chronicle) of this monarch, the Portuguese nobleman Esteban Pérez Florián is mentioned as \"guard of the King\", and in the document from 1290 Diego Gómez de Roa is mentioned as \"guard-major of our Body\" (\"guarda-mor de nosso Corpo\").\nAround 1424, the position of chief guard was shared by two individuals, although it is not known whether this was because it had then become more of an \"honorific than an effective\" title, or because they alternated in holding it. However, it is certain that in 1447, during the reign of John II of Castile, and according to what is stated in one of the records of his reign, several individuals held the position, which had already become hereditary for several families of the kingdom, receiving 20,000 maravedis a year.\nDuties\n'']]\nIn the reign of Alfonso X of Castile, as Manuel González Jiménez has pointed out, the chief of the king's guard was responsible for the safety of the king and his family at court or in his palace, and a small group of men were at his command, including twenty infantry crossbowmen and ten on horseback, who protected the court or the place where the monarch was, although the twenty knights and a similar number of squires on foot were in charge of protecting the monarch and his family.\nOther duties of the chief guard were:\n* Commanding the personal guard that protected the king.\n* Coordinate everything related to the monarch's security and take charge of its organization.\n* Cooperate with other court officials such as the justiças-mores of the Royal House or the king's alguacis-mores, who were in charge of certain police and public order tasks within the court.\nList of chiefs of the king's guard\nof Castile.
