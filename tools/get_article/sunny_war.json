      "text": "# Sunny War\n\n}}\nSunny War is an American singer and songwriter from Nashville, Tennessee. Her sound is frequently categorized as folk-punk, while her songwriting is often described as introspective. Her songs blend rock, gospel, and country music. She began her music career in 2014 with the release of her extended play Worthless, but garnered mainstream attention and critical praise after the release of her 2020s albums.\nEarly life\nWar was born in 1990. At age 7, her mother bought her a guitar, and she took classes on the piano and the harmonica. When she was in middle school, she moved from Tennessee to California. She taught herself to play the guitar from watching and mimicking how her friend's father played the banjo, which resulted in her distinctive finger picking style.\nCareer\nCareer beginnings\nIn her early twenties, War quit her job in a mall to pursue music full time. Her first EP as a solo artist was Worthless. She sold Worthless CDs on  the Venice, California boardwalk.\nMainstream success\nHer 2021 album, Simple Syrup, saw her receive broader mainstream recognition. Her follow-up, Anarchist Gospel, was lauded by critics, with Jonathan Bernstein of Rolling Stone calling it a \"powerful statement\" and Pitchfork's Stephen Erlewine calling the record \"emotionally resonant and curiously hopeful.\" 2025's Armageddon in a Summer Dress was also critically acclaimed.\nDiscography\nEPs\n* Worthless (2014)\n* Red, White and Blue (2016)\n* With the Sun (2018)\n* Can I Sit With You?
