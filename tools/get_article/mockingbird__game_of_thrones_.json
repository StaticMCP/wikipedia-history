The 37th episode of the series overall, \"Mockingbird\" was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Alik Sakharov. It first aired on HBO on May 18, 2014.\nIn the episode, Tyrion Lannister struggles to find a fighter willing to stand as his champion in his upcoming trial by combat; Melisandre and Selyse Baratheon talk on Dragonstone; the Night's Watch continue to prepare for Mance Rayder's attack; Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne meet Hot Pie at an inn; Arya Stark and Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane are attacked by bandits on the road; Daenerys Targaryen orders Daario to retake Yunkai; and Petyr Baelish assassinates Lysa Arryn. The title refers to the sigil of House Baelish. The episode received positive reviews from critics, mainly praising the suspenseful tone and emotional depth.\nThis episode marks the final appearance of Kate Dickie (Lysa Arryn).\nPlot\nIn King's Landing\nJaime tells Tyrion that Cersei has chosen Gregor Clegane as her champion for Tyrion's trial by combat, and declines to be Tyrion's champion due to his poor performance with his left hand. Tyrion sends for Bronn, who tells him that Cersei has offered him a highborn bride and also declines to be Tyrion's champion. Oberyn comes to visit Tyrion; after recounting how he met him as a newborn and how Cersei always blamed him for the death of their mother, he tells Tyrion that he will be his champion to avenge the rape and murder of his sister at Clegane's hands.\nAt Castle Black\nJon suggests to Thorne to block the passage through the Wall to prevent Rayder's army from coming through, but his request is ridiculed.\nAt Dragonstone\nMelisandre tells Selyse that the Lord of Light needs Shireen to depart Dragonstone with them.\nIn the Riverlands\nBrienne and Podrick stop at an inn, where they meet Hot Pie, who tells them about his journey with Arya. They then decide to go to the Vale because Lysa is Sansa's and Arya's last living relative with money.\nArya and Sandor are attacked by two men who were part of the Night's Watch caravan that Arya travelled with, and one of them bites Sandor. After Sandor kills one, Arya kills the other since  there is a bounty on Sandor's head for killing Lannister soldiers. Later, Sandor recounts how Gregor had burned him as a child and how his father covered up the incident.\nIn Meereen\nDaenerys sleeps with Daario after he enters her chambers at night. The next morning, Daenerys tells Jorah that she has ordered Daario to retake Yunkai and kill all the remaining masters. Jorah points out that if Ned Stark had done the same to him, he would not be there to advise her. Daenerys instead orders Jorah to tell Daario to take Hizdahr with him to advise the masters to conform to her rule.\nAt the Eyrie\nSansa slaps Robin after he damages her snowcastle of Winterfell. Petyr then kisses Sansa and Lysa sees them. Soon after, Lysa threatens to throw Sansa out the Moon Door. Petyr intervenes and admits that he truly only loved Catelyn and pushes Lysa through the Moon Door.\nProduction\n\"Mockingbird\" adapts part of material from A Storm of Swords, chapters 65, 66 and 80 (Arya XII, Tyrion IX & Sansa VII).
