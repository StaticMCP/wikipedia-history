Edwards and Deanna Monteith.\nCory, Todd, and their younger sister Katie showed an interest in the arts from an early age. They would put on puppet shows and plays and used a tape recorder to create their own radio shows.\nCory was around seven or eight years old when they first started experimenting with their family's Super 8 video camera.\nTheir first film, succinctly titled Movie Stuff, did not have a plot and was simply a chance for them to learn how to use the camera and try out special effects.\nAs they continued, they made films in several different genres, including a superhero film called Captain Lightning that was directed by Cory, a Laurel and Hardy type comedy called ''Crime Doesn't Pay'' that was directed by Todd, and an action-adventure film that centered on a character named Jack Francisco. As they grew older, their films became more elaborate, often taking them months to complete. Starting with storyboarding the shots, they would go on to create their own sets, miniatures, and costumes. Neighborhood kids joined in as extras, and sound and special effects were added after filming. In school, Cory usually turned in films for class projects and occasionally won national competitions with them.\nWhile attending Anderson University, Cory and Todd served as directors for the on-campus comedy show Cheap Thrills. Cory interned at an animation studio in Ohio during his summers and graduated in 1990 with a major in Broadcasting and a minor in Art.\nCareer\nIn the early 1990s, he hosted a Christian music video show, Signal Exchange, on INSP network.\nCory Edwards acted in his brother Todd's 1999 film Chillicothe.
