Their herds were seized, and five people were captured. The fifth was released by the orders of Tinakhmat Khan and Urys Bi to deliver a message: Khakk-Nazar Khan had made peace with Tashkent and Urgench and was now waging war against them. The Kazakh Khanate attacked Saraychik, claiming control over the city, and seized all lands east of the Yaik River.\nIn a report delivered in November 1577 by Ivan Myasoyedov from Crimea, there were references to events from March and April 1579. These included previously unknown details about the Kazakh-Nogai region. One article quotes a letter from Prince Tinakhmat to the Crimean Khan, stating:\n\"The Kazakh king Ak-Nazar seeks to capture our settlement in the Nogai territory. He also declares that it is time to reclaim Yaseni, our lost homeland. We must remain vigilant, as the Kazakh king has a strong army.\"\nAnother article, dated April, describes a letter from Tinakhmat to Kazy-Murza, a vassal of the Crimean Khan, about Ak-Nazar Khan’s capture of Saraychik and the flight of Nogai rulers. The letter requested assistance from the Crimean Khan. Myasoyedov himself doubted the reliability of these reports, noting Tinakhmat’s reluctance to align with Russian lands, despite previous demands from the Crimean Khan.\nConflict with the Siberian Khan\nKhakk-Nazar Khan also actively fought against the Siberian Khan, Kuchum. Through a series of campaigns, he managed to annex territories in the upper reaches of the Tobol and Irtysh Rivers. Additionally, a significant part of the Bashkir uluses, previously under the rule of the Siberian and Kazan Khanates, came under his control.\nNogai Concerns\nThe Nogai leaders were well aware of the Kazakh khan’s ambitions. Rumors of Khakk-Nazar’s possible alliances with the Crimean Tatars and Russians worried them. To Din-Ahmed, the possibility of a Kazakh-Crimean-Russian coalition was particularly alarming, as it could leave the Nogais geopolitically encircled by powerful neighbors.\nDid the Nogai leaders have grounds to fear such alliances? In September 1569, Nogai envoys informed a Turkish pasha that Khakk-Nazar, allied with Crimean princes, had attacked their horde “in the name of the Crimean Khan.” The origin of this claim remains unclear. There is no evidence of anti-Nogai negotiations between Bakhchisarai and the Kazakhs. However, this narrative pushed the Nogai court to intensify its diplomatic efforts.\nTinakhmat informed Crimea that Khakk-Nazar, who was \"skilled in military affairs... and commands excellent marksmen and warriors,\" intended to march on Crimea after capturing Saraychik. He urged Muhammad Giray Khan to support the Nogais to protect his domains. Curiously, the Nogai leaders did not turn to Moscow or Astrakhan for assistance, despite their previous reliance on Russian support against Khakk-Nazar.\nRussian-Nogai Negotiations\nFrom Moscow, Tsar Ivan IV clarified that there were no consistent contacts with Khakk-Nazar. The Kazakh khan had only once sent envoys along with a Bukhara caravan, and Russian officials had dispatched Tatar emissaries as messengers. Ivan assured the Nogais:\n\"We do not send envoys without substantial reason. If you consider Khakk-Nazar an enemy, we will refrain from any friendly relations with him.\"\nIndeed, no significant Russo-Kazakh ties were observed for some time afterward. However, this was less a result of Nogai diplomacy and more due to Moscow's lack of interest in deepening eastern connections at the time. Meanwhile, the Russian government remained better informed about steppe affairs than the Nogais suspected, disregarding claims that relations between the Nogais and Girays were impossible.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
