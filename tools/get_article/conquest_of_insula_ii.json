      "text": "# Conquest of Insula II\n\nConquest of Insula II is a closed-ended, computer-moderated, play-by-mail (PBM) fantasy wargame.\nHistory and development\nConquest of Insula II was a computer-moderated play-by-mail game published by Clemens & Associates Inc. It was medium complexity. It shared similarities with the PBM game Terra II, including turn reports and the combat system.\nGameplay\nThe setting for this wargame was medieval times. In each game, ten players on an island led villages with the title of Baron. Games occurred on separate islands, with names such as \"Farraheim, Andarmark, Jiborokwi, Gizzenole, Karandala, and Raksharan.\" Players could conduct four actions per turn: \"forestry, herding, mining, weapons making, armor making, siege equipment making, refining, ditch repairing, or wall repairing.\" Combat involved sending armies from villages, laying siege to another village, or battling another army. Various tactics were available. Movement occurred on a hex map of ten miles per hex.\nVictory was achieved by conquering three villages or \"kill[ing] the most enemy warriors\" by game's end. Games lasted 25 weeks. Winners began the next game as a Count (and played it for free). A game ending in 1985 on the island of Matafunda was the first to end before 25 weeks, as a player conquered a third city.\nReception\nBob McLain, editor of Gaming Universal, stated that the game was \"tailor-made for battle lovers and armchair generals\".\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
