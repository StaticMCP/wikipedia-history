      "text": "# Mountain King Studios\n\nMountain King Studios (formerly known as Cygnus Studios) is a computer game company located in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded by game programmer/game designer Scott Host. In addition to the development of Raptor: Call of the Shadows, Cygnus also collaborated with Apogee Software on a number of their games. Some members of the company split to form Rogue Entertainment, while the company itself was renamed \"Mountain King Studios\".\nHistory\nThe company started with their former name \"Cygnus Studios\". After completing their first ever game Galactix, Scott Miller of Apogee Software sent a letter to the leading developer, Scott Host. In response Host contacted him and made an agreement to work with Apogee. After some work on the short-lived RPG The Second Sword, Cygnus Studios and Apogee worked on a vertical-scrolling shooter called \"Mercenary 2029\" as its working title and then renamed Raptor: Call of the Shadows. Cygnus also helped Apogee with some of their other games under the name \"Cygnus Multimedia Productions\" including Duke Nukem II, Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold, Hocus Pocus and Realms of Chaos.\nid Software was intrigued by the company's progress and convinced them to relocate to Texas by their office and work with them. Paul Radek, who worked on the audio for Raptor, provided id the DMX sound library for their game Doom. By December 1994, members of the company Jim Molinets, Rich Fleider and Tim Neveu went against Scott Host and left Cygnus to form their own company Rogue Entertainment. After this, Cygnus relocated back to their old place in Chicago and renamed themselves \"Mountain King Studios\".\nBy 2008, the president of Blitwise Productions, Michael P. Welch met up with Scott Host. Raptor: Call of the Shadows was Welch's favorite game on the PC and he proposed to Host to port it on the iPhone platform. Using the original source code, lead programmer Ben Moreno programmed the game on a Macintosh computer. The port took 1.5 years to make.\nGames\nReleased\n}}\nCancelled\nBefore Raptor: Call of the Shadows was in development, Cygnus Studios had worked on a game titled The Second Sword for Apogee Software, which was to be a Role playing game and use the Shadowcaster engine, but the project was cancelled. Strife was briefly under development and was to be published by id Software; after a few months and during a dispute between some developers and Scott Host, it was cancelled. It was later finished by Rogue Entertainment and published by Velocity in 1996. After renaming themselves \"Mountain King Studios\", the company tried to develop a 3D RPG titled Mantra, but this was also cancelled in favor of the Demonstar game.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mking.com/index.html Official website]\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/company/506/mountain-king-studios-inc/ Mountain King Studios] at MobyGames"
