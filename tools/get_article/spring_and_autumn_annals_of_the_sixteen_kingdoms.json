It became one of the chief sources for the compilation of the Book of Wei and Book of Jin.\nParts of the book went missing from the early Tang dynasty and did not survive intact. It originally contained 100 volumes, a preface and a chronological table. By the time of the early Song dynasty, many of them were lost and only about 20 volumes remained, which were quoted extensively by Sima Guang. There are two extant versions dating from the late Ming dynasty, the edition by Tu Qiaosun containing 100 volumes, and the one by He Tang containing 16 volumes, reprinted in the Hanwei Congshu, a compilation of histories. Tu's edition was published for the third time in 1781. Also there is a 100 volumes edition together with a chronological table from the mid-Qing dynasty by Tang Qiu, taken from the edition by He Tang and from other materials.\nReferences\n*  Zhou, Yiliang, [http://www.wordpedia.com/search/Content.asp?ID=52379 \"Shiliuguo Chunqiu\" (\"Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms\")].
