(The other two awards are the Scientific and Engineering Award and the Academy Award of Merit.) The Technical Achievement Award is an honorary award that is given annually to those whose particular technical accomplishments have contributed to the progress of the motion picture industry. The award is a certificate, which describes the achievement and lists the names of those being honored for the particular contribution. These awards are usually given at a dinner ceremony held weeks prior to the Academy Awards broadcast and a brief excerpt is shown in the Oscars telecast.\nWinners\n:See :Category:Academy Award for Technical Achievement winners.\nThe tables below show the honorees as listed in the Academy Awards database.\n1930–1950\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\"\n|+Technical Achievement Award recipients, by year of award (1930–1950)\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"min-width:5em;\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"min-width:13em;\"| Department\n|-\n!scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=\"3\"| 1930/1931 (4th)\n| Electrical Research Products, Inc., for moving coil microphone transmitters\n| Sound\n|-\n| RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., for reflex type microphone concentrators\n| Sound\n|-\n| RCA-Photophone, Inc., for ribbon microphone transmitters\n| Sound\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 1931/1932 (5th)\n| Eastman Kodak Company for its Type II-B Sensitometer\n| Laboratory\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| 1932/1933 (6th)\n| Fox Film Corporation, Fred Jackman and Warner Bros.
