The convention date was pushed back from 2014, when it was supposed to be held two years after the previous in 2012, due to the 18th Extraordinary Convention that was held in September 2014. It w held shortly after the CHP's defeat in the November 2015 general election. The party was expected to see challengers to the leadership of Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, however, Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected with no other candidate challenging him.\nIn November 2015, Kılıçdaroğlu ruled out any prospect of holding an Extraordinary Convention prior to the scheduled Ordinary Convention despite calls from some CHP MPs, claiming that the preparations for the Ordinary Convention had already begun.\nLeadership election\nCandidates\nStanding\nFile:Kemal Kilicdaroglu.png|Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, Member of Parliament for İzmir's second electoral district and incumbent leader of the CHP (announced 14 November 2015)\nMustafa Balbay MP.png|Mustafa Balbay, MP for İzmir (II) and former defendant in the Ergenekon trials\n*Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, Member of Parliament for İzmir's second electoral district and incumbent leader of the CHP (announced 14 November 2015)\n*Mustafa Balbay, Member of Parliament for İzmir's second electoral district and former defendant in the Ergenekon trials (announced 11 November 2015)\nPossible\nMetin Feyzioğlu (cropped).jpg|Metin Feyzioğlu, President of the Turkish Bars Association\nCihaner-Ilhan.jpg|İlhan Cihaner, Member of Parliament for Denizli\nSelin Sayek Böke.jpg|Selin Sayek Böke, Member of Parliament for İzmir's second electoral district and deputy leader of the CHP responsible for economic policy\n*Metin Feyzioğlu, President of the Turkish Bars Association\n*İlhan Cihaner, Member of Parliament for Denizli\n*Selin Sayek Böke, Member of Parliament for İzmir's second electoral district and deputy leader of the CHP responsible for economic policy\n*Aykut Erdoğdu, Member of Parliament for İstanbul\n*Ümit Kocasakal, President of the İstanbul Bar Association\nDeclined\n*Tuncay Özkan, Member of Parliament for İzmir (I) who was incriminated during the Ergenekon trials.
