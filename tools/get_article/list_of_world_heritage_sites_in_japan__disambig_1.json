Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Japan accepted the UNESCO World Heritage Convention on 30 June 1992.\nThere are 26 sites listed in Japan, with a further four sites on the tentative list. Japan's first entries to the list took place in 1993, when four sites were inscribed. The most recent site, the Sado mine, was listed in 2024. Among the sites, 21 are listed for their cultural and five for their natural significance. One site is transnational: The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier is shared with six other countries. Japan has served on the World Heritage Committee four times.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (prefecture)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Buddhist Monuments in the Hōryū-ji Area\n|\n| Nara\n| 1993\n| 660; i, ii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| This site comprises 48 Buddhist monuments in the Hōryū-ji (pictured) and Hokki-ji temple areas.

There are numerous Japanese cedar trees, some of which are over 1,000 years old. About a fifth of the island is protected.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Shirakami-Sanchi\n|\n| Aomori, Akita\n| 1993\n| 663; ix (natural)\n| The property covers a mountainous area with some of the last and largest remainders of the Japanese beech old-growth forests, a type of forest that used to cover the mountains of northern Japan following the Last Glacial Period. The area is home to the Japanese black bear, Japanese macaque, Japanese serow, and black woodpecker.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)\n|\n| Kyoto, Shiga\n| 1994\n| 688; ii, iv (cultural)\n| Kyoto served as the capital of Japan from its founding in 794 until the mid-19th century.

During the Age of Discovery, silver contributed to a substantial exchange between Japan and other Eurasian countries, while the political isolation during the Edo period prevented the introduction of the mining techniques developed in Europe during the Industrial Revolution. Mining focused on small-scale labour-intense units. The remains of mining settlements (Ōmori Ginzan village pictured), smelting and refining sites, and ports to transport the ore have been preserved. A minor boundary modification of the site took place in 2010.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hiraizumi – Temples, Gardens and Archaeological Sites Representing the Buddhist Pure Land\n|\n| Iwate\n| 2011\n| 1277rev; ii, vi (cultural)\n| Hiraizumi was the administrative centre of the realm of the Northern Fujiwara clan in the 11th and 12th centuries.

Because of its isolation, the islands have a high number of endemic species and are important for studies of ongoing evolutionary processes and speciation. The islands are home to 195 endangered bird species, the critically endangered Bonin flying fox, and over four hundred native plant taxa. The surrounding waters support numerous species of fish, cetaceans, and corals.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Fujisan, sacred place and source of artistic inspiration\n|\n| Shizuoka, Yamanashi\n| 2013\n| 1418; iii, vi (cultural)\n| Mount Fuji is a solitary stratovolcano with a height of .

This site comprises 23 components in eight areas, six of which are in the south-eastern part of the country. Miike coal mine is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\"| The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement\n|\n| Tokyo\n| 2016\n| 1321rev; i, ii, vi (cultural)\n| This transnational site (shared with Argentina, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, and India) encompasses 17 works of Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier.

Votive objects deposited on the island provide insight into how these rituals were changing through time and how the cultural exchange was taking place. The site also comprises properties on Kyushu, where \"distant worship\" takes place. The Munakata Taisha shrine is pictured.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region\n|\n| Nagasaki, Kumamoto\n| 2018\n| 1495; iii (cultural)\n| This site comprises 12 components related to Christianity in Japan. Although the religion was banned during the Edo period between the 17th and 19th centuries, hidden Christian communities survived in small villages in the northwestern part of Kyushu.

These mounds have geometric shapes, such as keyhole, square, or circle. Some have moats around them and several contained grave goods and clay figure decorations. Daisen-Kofun in Osaka is pictured. A minor boundary modification of the site took place in 2023.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Amami-Ōshima Island, Tokunoshima Island, northern part of Okinawa Island, and Iriomote Island\n|\n| Kagoshima, Okinawa\n| 2021\n| 1574; x (natural)\n| This site comprises protected areas in four islands, Amami Ōshima, Iriomote, Tokunoshima, and the northern part of Okinawa Island. The islands became separated from the mainland in the late Miocene epoch, resulting in isolation of terrestrial species that have since formed a unique biota, rich in biodiversity. Endemic species include the Okinawa rail (pictured), Iriomote cat, Amami rabbit, and Ryukyu long-tailed giant rat.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jōmon Prehistoric Sites in Northern Japan\n|\n| Hokkaidō, Aomori, Iwate, Akita\n| 2021\n| 1632; iii, v (cultural)\n| This site comprises 17 archaeological sites from the Jōmon period, spanning roughly from 13,000 BCE to 400 BCE.

People working in the mines came from all parts of Japan and formed their unique culture.\n|-\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Japan maintains four properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (prefecture)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |  Temples, Shrines and other structures of Ancient Kamakura\n|\n| Kanagawa\n| 1992\n| i, ii, iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| During the samurai rule of Japan, from 1192 to 1868, Kamakura and Edo served as administrative centres of the country.
