It lies on the Suffolk coast on the north edge of the town of Aldeburgh and to the south of Thorpeness and includes the Aldringham Walks area of heathland to the north. It is within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the Suffolk Heritage Coast area. Noted for its populations of Eurasian bittern, European nightjar and other bird species, it covers a range of coastal habitats and is protected with SSSI, SPA conservation status.\nEcology\nThe  site covers a mix of coastal habitats, with areas of grassland, lowland heath, reed bed, shingle, dune and woodland. Rare shingle flora such as sea pea, sea kale, sea holly and yellow horned-poppy can be found at North Warren. Key conservation bird species found at the site include Eurasian bittern, European nightjar, nightingale and western marsh harrier.\nIt is also an important over wintering site for wildfowl including large numbers of Eurasian wigeon, common teal and a flock of greater white-fronted geese. In 2007, three marsh harrier chicks fledged from three nests and seven nightjars, 23 pairs of woodlark, seven pairs of Dartford warbler and three booming bitterns were recorded.\nMammals found at the site include European otter, European water vole, European badger and European rabbit, and small numbers of red deer and muntjac can be seen. The reptiles adder, slow-worm and common lizard are present in heath areas, while the amphibians common frog, common toad, smooth newt and palmate newt can be found in wetland areas.\nMany insect species can be found at North Warren, with large numbers of dragonfly and butterfly in summer months (Northern Hemisphere), including the nationally rare silver-studded blue. In 2007, an invasive insect pest, the wheat bug Nysius huttoni, was found at North Warren for the first time in the UK. Originally from New Zealand the insect feeds on weeds and crop plants and has since been found at other sites in the UK.\nConservation\nProtected status\nIt is protected with Site of Special Scientific Interest status as part of the 'Leiston - Aldeburgh' SSSI.\nParts of the reserve are also covered by the 'Sandlings' Special Protection Area (SPA).
