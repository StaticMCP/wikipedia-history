The county was created in 1887 and organized in 1892. It is named for Thomas W. Ward, a soldier in the Texas Revolution.\nHistory\nNative Americans\nArcheological investigations conducted in northwestern Ward County have found evidence of prehistoric man in the form of occupational debris, petroglyphs, and pictographs. Tribes occupying the area include Suma-Jumano, Apache, and Comanche. The sand hills have contained native artifacts.\nGrowth\nThe Butterfield Overland Mail in 1858 used Emigrant's Crossing, where exposed rocks afford one of the few places safe for fording the Pecos River. The stage line had an adobe station and a high-walled adobe corral there.\nIn 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway crossed the region and established stations at Sand Hills, Monahans, Aroya, Pyote, Quito, Quito Quarry, and Barstow.\nThe Texas State Legislature carved Ward County from a portion of Tom Green County in 1887. The county was organized in 1892. Barstow became the county seat. Barstow became a farming and ranching trade center by 1904. Drought plagued the area in the early part of the 20th century.\nWard County benefitted from the opening of the Hendrick oilfield Winkler County in 1926. Pipelines and railroad loading tanks were constructed at Wickett, Pyote, and Monahans. Oil was discovered at Grandfalls  in 1929, and the nearby community of Royalty was established.  Shell Oil Company constructed an  tank that would hold a million barrels. By January 1, 1991,  of oil had been produced in the county since 1928.\nOn May 10, 1938, Monahans won a contested election to move the county seat from Barstow. The election was upheld in 1939, and the county seat moved to Monahans that year.\nPyote Air Force Station  opened in 1942, becoming the largest bomber installation in the United States. The plane Enola Gay, which dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, was later stored here. The base became inactive during the Korean War.\nMonahans Sandhills State Park opened in 1957. The Sealy-Smith Foundation leased much of the land to the state in 1956 until 2056. An additional  were leased from the Williams family of Monahans.\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which all but  (0.03% or about 125 ac) are land.\nMajor highways\n* 20px Interstate 20\n* 20px State Highway 18\n* 20px State Highway 115\n* 20px State Highway 329\nAdjacent counties\n* Winkler County (north)\n* Ector County (northeast)\n* Crane County (east)\n* Pecos County (south)\n* Reeves County (west)\n* Loving County (northwest)\nDemographics\n1850–2010 2010 2020\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Ward County, Texas – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 2000\n!Pop 2010\n!\n!% 2000\n!% 2010\n!\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|5,695\n|4,922\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |4,506\n|52.20%\n|46.18%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |38.70%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|476\n|474\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |415\n|4.36%\n|4.45%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.56%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|48\n|48\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |41\n|0.44%\n|0.45%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.35%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|31\n|31\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |69\n|0.28%\n|0.29%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.59%\n|-\n|Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|3\n|0\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |2\n|0.03%\n|0.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.02%\n|-\n|Other race alone (NH)\n|3\n|9\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |22\n|0.03%\n|0.08%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.19%\n|-\n|Multiracial (NH)\n|73\n|100\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |264\n|0.67%\n|0.94%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |2.27%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|4,580\n|5,074\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |6,325\n|41.98%\n|47.61%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |54.32%\n|-\n|Total\n|10,909\n|10,658\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |11,644\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |100.00%\n|}\nAs of the 2000 census, 10,909 people, 3,964 households, and 2,929 families were residing in the county.
