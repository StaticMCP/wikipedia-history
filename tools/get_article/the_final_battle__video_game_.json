The game was originally scheluded to be released in January of the same year. An MS-DOS port was released later in 1991. It is a sequel to Legend of the Sword from 1988.\nPlot\nAt the end of Legend of the Sword, the evil wizard, Suzar was imprisoned in a teardrop. He has now escaped and has stolen Avar's magical artifacts: the sword and the shield. The player character from the last game, Steroff, has been imprisoned underground with his surviving party members, Cysella and Pagan. The objective is to escape from prison and retrieve the stolen items from Suzar.\nGameplay\nThe game is a mouse-driven point-and-click adventure game with role-playing elements. The game is depicted from an isometric viewpoint. Each party member's abilities are required to solve different puzzles.\n| AmFormat = 56%\n| STAction = 71%\n| STFormat = 52%\n| rev1 = Génération 4\n| rev1Score = 62%\n}}\nAmiga Format said \"the sheer impenetrability of the game's command and control system is a deterrent from trying anything remotely innovative and ultimately from playing the game at all\". ST Format criticized the controls and the camera angle. ST Action called the icon system \"well implemented and simple to use\" and the gameplay \"challenging and entertaining\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
