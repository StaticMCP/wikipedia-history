The Habsburg army attempted to stop the Ottoman advance but was defeated by the Pasha of Buda.\nBackground\nA new war broke out in 1552. The Ottoman sultan, Suleiman, launched a campaign in Hungary. The Ottomans captured Temesvár and Veszprém. At that time, the Pasha of Buda, Ali Hadim, decided to invade Central Slovakia, which formed the economic support for the Habsburgs. The majority of the cities surrendered without bloodshed. Ferdinand I begged his brother Charles for help. But to no avail. Left alone, Ferdinand recruited 4,500 Italian mercenaries led by Sforza-Pallavicini and 3,000 German landsknechts by Marcel Detritz, added by 650 cavalry from different parts of Hungary. An additional 800 Bohemian-Moravian infantry and 800 Hajduk.\nThe entire army numbered 10,850 men. The Emperor appointed Erasmus von Teufel as the commander of the army. Ferdinand also gathered an insurgent force of 7,000 men stationed in the Fülek area. Ali Pasha heard of the Habsburg preparations and acted quickly to prevent both armies from meeting together. Ali Pasha left with an army of 12,000 men.\nBattle\nTeufel decided to set out to retake Drégely, which was taken by Ottomans earlier, instead of waiting for the insurgent forces. The Habsburg army arrived in Palást. On August 9, 1552, the Habsburg army met the Ottoman force led by Arslan Bey. The Ottomans, using 3 cannons, began harassing the Habsburgs. The Hungarian and German forces broke out of the camp and engaged in an indecisive battle where both sides sustained casualties. The Italians engaged but were surrounded by the Ottomans. The Hungarians managed to save the Italian force from the encirclement. Thus ending the first day of battle.\nThe next day, Teufel made the formation for battle, with the Germans and Italians in the center, the Hungarians in the right, and the German cuirassiers to the left. The battle started with the Habsburgs attacking the Ottomans; during the fight, the gunpowder storage exploded, throwing the Habsburgs in confusion and forcing them to retreat disorderly. The Ottomans used this advantage and attacked them, killing and capturing many of them. Among the captured were Teufel and Sforza-Pallavicini. Thousands were killed and around 4,000 prisoners were captured.\nAftermath\nThe prisoners were taken to Buda. The towns in Slovakia were shocked with panic upon hearing the news of the defeat. Ali Pasha, however, returned to Buda without attacking Slovakia. Sforzia ransomed himself with 8,000 pieces of gold. Teufel was sent to Istanbul before the Sultan and executed. The German prisoners were sold into slavery.\nReferences\nSources\n*József Bánlaky: Military history of the Hungarian nation (MEK-OSZK), 0014/1149.
