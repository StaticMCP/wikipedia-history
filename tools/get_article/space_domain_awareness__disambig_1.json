It involves the detection, tracking, cataloging and identification of artificial objects, i.e. active/inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, or fragmentation debris.\nAims\nSpace domain awareness accomplishes the following:\n* Predicting when and where a decaying space object will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere;\n* Preventing a returning space object, which to radar looks like a missile, from triggering a false alarm in missile-attack warning sensors;\n* Charting the present position of space objects and plot their anticipated orbital paths;\n* Detecting new human-made objects in space;\n* Producing a running catalogue of human-made space objects;\n* Determining which country owns a re-entering space object;\n* Informing countries whether or not objects may interfere with satellites and International Space Station orbits;\n* Providing data for future anti-satellite weapons systems.\nSystems\n.]]\nSystems include:\n* The DEEP-Sight prototype, designed by Deepinder Uppal on behalf of the Defense Innovation Unit, this system is designed to provide space domain awareness across a broad-spectrum of SDA use cases to Space Force, the United States Navy and PSRA (Public Satellite Research and Analysis) teams.\n* The United States Space Surveillance Network which has detectors such as the Space Fence (replacing the now defunct Air Force Space Surveillance System) and Space Surveillance Telescope\n* The Russian Centre for Outer Space Monitoring with facilities such as Okno and Krona and Sazhen-S, used to analyse the orbital parameters of space craft.\n* The French GRAVES (Grand Réseau Adapté à la Veille Spatiale) bi-static radar-based space surveillance system deploy by French Air Force\n* The European Space Situational Awareness Programme with multiple assets in its Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment\n* The Australian based Silentium Defence Oculus passive radar space observatory in Swan Reach, South Australia\n* The American National Reconnaissance Office's Silentbarker satellites\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20001101210011/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/usspc-fs/space.htm United States Space Surveillance]"
