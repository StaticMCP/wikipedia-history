They married in Keokuk, Iowa, where he was born on 20 June 1857. McManus was educated within local schools and later attended Baylies Commercial College. He subsequently became a schoolteacher, then joined a local company as a bookkeeper. After three years in that position, McManus became a traveling salesperson for the same company. He left the business for marriage, after which he became a farmer for eight years. McManus then worked for his father until the elder McManus died, and subsequently invited George S. Tucker to form a business partnership in stoneworking.\nPolitically, McManus was affiliated with the Democratic Party. He was elected to the Iowa Senate in 1906 and 1910 for District 1 and served through 1915. In later life, McManus was appointed postmaster of Keokuk, and was serving in this role when he died on 8 January 1918.\nReferences"
