The event serves as a successor and replacement for MLW WarGames, after WWE acquired the rights to the trademarks of the namesake WarGames match in 2019.\nThe first event served as a television taping for MLW Fusion, while the second event was taped for the MLW Fusion: Alpha miniseries, and the third event was taped for MLW Underground Wrestling.\nDates and venues\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\"\n|style=\"background:#FBB; width:2em\"|\n|Aired Live\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\"\n!width=\"1%\"|#\n!width=\"8%\"|Event\n!width=\"5%\"|Date\n!width=\"9%\"|City\n!width=\"10%\"|Venue\n!width=\"38%\"|Main Event\n!width=\"35%\"|Notes\n!width=\"5%\"|Ref\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|North Richland Hills, Texas\n|NYTEX Sports Centre\n|Team Von Erichs (Marshall Von Erich, Ross Von Erich, Low Ki, and Tom Lawlor) (with Kevin Von Erich) vs. Contra Unit (Ikuro Kwon, Jacob Fatu, Josef Samael, and Simon Gotch) in a War Chamber match\n|The main event aired on September 14, 2019\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|2300 Arena\n|Contra Unit (Ikuro Kwon, Jacob Fatu, Mads Krügger, Sentai Death Squad Soldier #1, and Sentai Death Squad Soldier #1) vs. The Hammerheads (Alexander Hammerstone, EJ Nduka, Richard Holliday, Matanza Duran, and Savio Vega) in a War Chamber match\n|The main event aired on November 17, 2021.\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Queens, New York\n|Melrose Ballroom\n|Alexander Hammerstone and The Second Gear Crew (Mance Warner, Matthew Justice, and 1 Called Manders) vs. The Calling (Rickey Shane Page, Delirious, Akira, and Dr. Cornwallus) in a War Chamber match\n|The main event aired on April 18, 2023.\n|\n|- style=\"background: #FBB;\"\n|\n|\n|\n|St. Petersburg, Florida\n|The Coliseum\n|Team MLW (CozyMax (Satoshi Kojima and Shigeo Okumura) and The Second Gear Crew (Matthew Justice and 1 Called Manders)) vs. World Titan Federation (Tom Lawlor, Davey Boy Smith Jr., Richard Holliday, and Josh Bishop) (with Mister Saint Laurent) in a War Chamber match\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|May 10, 2025\n|Cicero, Illinois\n|Cicero Stadium\n|The Bomaye Fight Club (Alex Kane and Mr. Thomas), Matthew Justice, and Paul London vs. The Rogue Horsemen (Bobby Fish, Brett Ryan Gosselin, Brock Anderson, and C.
