The following year, the School moved to 132 Queen's Gate, later expanding into the adjacent houses at 131 and 133. In May 2005, the school acquired 125/126 Queen's Gate and refurbished it as accommodation for Junior School pupils.\nIt celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2011, and a special service was held at the local parish church, St Augustine's, Queen's Gate.\nAcademics\nIt has a strong academic track record in examinations. In 2011, it placed in the top 100 independent schools nationally for the GCSEs.\nNotable former pupils\n*Queen Camilla\n*Bryony Gordon, journalist\n*Susannah Constantine, fashion designer and author\n*Angela Delevingne, socialite\n*Belinda Harris-Reid, knit-wear designer and promoter of hand-knitting\n*Lucinda Lambton, photographer and broadcaster\n*Emma McQuiston, fashion model\n*Nigella Lawson, food writer and television presenter\n*Imogen Poots, actress\n*Issy van Randwyck, singer\n*Vanessa Redgrave, actress, socialist and activist\n*Twinkle, singer\n*Samantha Robinson, actress\n*Sophia Swire, business woman\n*Tilda Swinton, actress\n*Trinny Woodall, fashion designer\n*Anya Taylor-Joy, actress\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.queensgate.org.uk/inspectionreport Inspection Reports]\n*[http://www.isc.co.uk/schools/england/london-area/london/queens-gate-school Profile] on ISC website"
