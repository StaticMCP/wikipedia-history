It is a specialized championship for NXT, the promotion's developmental brand, defended exclusively under British Rounds Rules. The current champion is Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo, who is in his first reign. He won the vacant title by defeating Tony D'Angelo by 2–1 on the June 24, 2025, episode of NXT.\nUnveiled on September 10, 2020, as the NXT UK Heritage Cup, it was originally established as a secondary championship for NXT UK, which was a sister brand of NXT based in the United Kingdom. The inaugural champion was A-Kid. At Worlds Collide on September 4, 2022, all other NXT UK championships were unified into their respective NXT championship counterparts due to the closure of NXT UK. The Heritage Cup, however, was the only championship from either brand that was not contested at the event. The title then saw months of inactivity until April 4, 2023, when it was transferred to NXT. During Lexis King's reign from January to April 2025, the British Rounds Rules were suspended.\nHistory\n]]\nOn September 10, 2020, the American professional wrestling promotion WWE announced the relaunch of the United Kingdom-based NXT UK brand, following a production hiatus since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with the relaunch, the promotion announced the NXT UK Heritage Cup tournament to crown the inaugural NXT UK Heritage Cup Champion. The announcement also revealed that the Heritage Cup would be defended just like any other championship, but all matches would be contested under British Rounds Rules.\nOnly seven of the eight competitors for the tournament were revealed during the initial announcement: \"Flash\" Morgan Webster, Noam Dar, Alexander Wolfe, A-Kid, Dave Mastiff, Trent Seven, and Joseph Conners. The eighth competitor was determined on the October 1 episode of NXT UK in a triple threat match in which Kenny Williams defeated Ashton Smith and Amir Jordan to win the final spot. The tournament itself also began on October 1 and took place across episodes of NXT UK. The final aired on tape delay on November 26 where A-Kid defeated Seven to become the inaugural champion (the date the episode was taped is unknown).\nIn August 2022, WWE announced that NXT UK would go on hiatus after the Worlds Collide event on September 4, and the brand would relaunch as NXT Europe at a later time. At Worlds Collide, all other NXT UK championships were retired after they were unified into their respective American-based NXT championship counterparts. The Heritage Cup was the only title from either brand to not be contested at the event. The last match for the title occurred during the July 7, 2022, taping of NXT UK, which aired on tape delay on August 25, where Noam Dar became a two-time Heritage Cup Champion. Following this, the title saw months of inactivity until the April 4, 2023, episode of NXT when Dar, with the Heritage Cup, made his NXT debut and stated he would defend the title whenever he wanted. The title was subsequently transferred to NXT and renamed NXT Heritage Cup, with the first NXT defense of the championship coming at NXT Battleground on May 28, which was also the first time the title was defended in the United States.\nAfter Charlie Dempsey won the Heritage Cup in February 2024, his stable, No Quarter Catch Crew, announced the \"Catch Clause\", where any member of the stable—Dempsey, Drew Gulak, Damon Kemp, and Myles Borne—could defend the Cup, but only Dempsey was officially recognized as champion. The Catch Clause was invoked for the first and only time on the March 19 episode of NXT, with Gulak defeating Chase University's Riley Osborne by 2–1. On the December 24 episode of NXT (taped December 17), Dempsey lost the Heritage Cup to Lexis King by disqualification, the first instance of the Heritage Cup changing hands by disqualification. However, according to NXT general manager Ava, there was a grey area in British Rounds Rules regarding disqualification of the reigning champion, and announced that Dempsey and King would compete for the Heritage Cup in a sudden death one-fall match at NXT: New Year's Evil on January 7, 2025, the first instance of the Heritage Cup not being contested under British Rounds Rules. King won to solidify his win of the Heritage Cup. Subsequently on the February 4 episode of NXT, King announced that his Heritage Cup defenses going forward would be one-fall matches instead of British Rounds Rules. After Noam Dar defeated King on the April 23 episode of NXT to win his record fourth Heritage Cup, the British Rounds Rules were reinstated.\nDuring reigning champion Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo's feud with Tony D'Angelo, D'Angelo tossed the NXT Heritage Cup off a bridge for the Cup \"to sleep with the fishes.\" Ever since then, Lorenzo has not been seen with the Cup and was no longer mentioned as NXT Heritage Cup Champion on-screen but is still officially recognized as champion by WWE.\nBritish Rounds Rules\n*Matches consist of six three-minute rounds with 20-second breaks between each round.\n*Matches are 2-out-of-3 falls.\n*Falls can be won by pinfall, submission, or knockout (countout).\n*Once a fall occurs, the round ends.\n*The match ends once a wrestler has won two falls.\n*In the event of a disqualification or knockout, the match instantly ends without the need for two falls.\n*If all six rounds are completed, whoever is ahead on falls wins the match. If tied, the champion retains.\nInaugural tournament\n| RD2 = SemifinalsNXT UK\n| RD3 = FinalNXT UK\n| RD1-team1  = Alexander Wolfe\n| RD1-score1 = 1\n| RD1-team2  = Noam Dar\n| RD1-score2 = 2\n| RD1-team3  = A-Kid\n| RD1-score3 = 2\n| RD1-team4  = Flash Morgan Webster\n| RD1-score4 = 1\n| RD1-team5  = Dave Mastiff\n| RD1-score5 =\n| RD1-team6  = Joseph Conners\n| RD1-score6 = —\n| RD1-team7  = Trent Seven\n| RD1-score7 = 2\n| RD1-team8  = Kenny Williams\n| RD1-score8 = 1\n| RD1-shade2-1 = #ffb\n| RD1-shade3-1 = #ffb\n| RD1-shade5-1 = #ffb\n| RD1-shade7-1 = #ffb\n| RD2-team1  = Noam Dar\n| RD2-score1 = 1\n| RD2-team2  = A-Kid\n| RD2-score2 = 2\n| RD2-team3  = Dave Mastiff\n| RD2-score3 = 1\n| RD2-team4  = Trent Seven\n| RD2-score4 = 2\n| RD2-shade2-1 = #ffb\n| RD2-shade4-1 = #ffb\n| RD3-team1 = A-Kid\n| RD3-team2 = Trent Seven\n| RD3-score1 = 2\n| RD3-score2 = 1\n| RD3-shade1-1 = #ffb\n}}\nNXT UK Heritage Cup #1 Contender Tournament\n| RD2 = SemifinalsNXT UK\n| RD3 = FinalNXT UK\n| RD1-team1  = Mark Andrews\n| RD1-score1 = 1\n| RD1-team2  = Noam Dar\n| RD1-score2 = 2\n| RD1-team3  = Oliver Carter\n| RD1-score3 = 1\n| RD1-team4  = Kenny Williams\n| RD1-score4 = 2\n| RD1-team5  = Wolfgang\n| RD1-score5 = 2\n| RD1-team6  = Sam Gradwell\n| RD1-score6 = 1\n| RD1-team7  = Nathan Frazer\n| RD1-score7 = 1\n| RD1-team8  = Teoman\n| RD1-score8 = 2\n| RD1-shade2-1 = #ffb\n| RD1-shade4-1 = #ffb\n| RD1-shade5-1 = #ffb\n| RD1-shade8-1 = #ffb\n| RD2-team1  = Noam Dar\n| RD2-score1 = 2\n| RD2-team2  = Kenny Williams\n| RD2-score2 = 1\n| RD2-team3  = Wolfgang\n| RD2-score3 = 2\n| RD2-team4  = Teoman\n| RD2-score4 = 1\n| RD2-shade1-1 = #ffb\n| RD2-shade3-1 = #ffb\n| RD3-team1  = Noam Dar\n| RD3-score1 = 2\n| RD3-team2  = Wolfgang\n| RD3-score2 = 1\n| RD3-shade1-1 = #ffb\n}}\nHeritage Cup trophy design\nUnlike other professional wrestling championships, the Heritage Cup is represented by a trophy instead of a title belt. The trophy itself is a silver cup, the front of which has a gold shield-shaped plaque that has a vertical NXT logo and below it the text \"Heritage Cup\". Below the cup is a physical representation of what was formerly the NXT UK logo, which is modeled after the United Kingdom's royal coat of arms, featuring a lion and a horse (instead of the traditional unicorn) on either side of the arms in gold, with a red shield at the center which has a gold vertical NXT logo. A small WWE logo is affixed at the center of the X in both NXT logos. A gold banner below this also says \"Heritage Cup\". This all sits atop a wooden base that is circled in gold name plaques which notate the current and previous champions.\nReigns\nAs of  , , there have been 12 reigns between eight different champions and one vacancy. A-Kid was the inaugural champion. Noam Dar has the most reigns at four and his second reign is the longest at 341 days; however, due to tape delay, WWE officially recognizes his second reign as lasting 292 days, but still the longest. Dar also has the longest combined reign at 850 days (799 days as recognized by WWE due to tape delay). Mark Coffey has the shortest reign at 14 days (42 days as recognized by WWE due to tape delay, but still the shortest). Coffey is also the oldest champion at 32 years old, while A-Kid is the youngest at 23.\nThe current champion is Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo, who is in his first reign. He won the vacant title by defeating Tony D'Angelo by 2–1 during the June 24, 2025, episode of NXT in Orlando, Florida; previous champion Noam Dar relinquished the title due to injury.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|NXT UK Heritage Cup\n|September 10, 2020 – April 18, 2023\n|-\n|NXT Heritage Cup\n|April 18, 2023 – present\n|}\n|days     = N/A\n|days2    =\n|location = London, England\n|event    = NXT UK\n|notes    = Defeated Trent Seven by 2–1 in a tournament final to become the inaugural champion.WWE recognizes this reign as beginning on November 26, 2020, and ending on May 20, 2021, when the matches aired on tape delay.
