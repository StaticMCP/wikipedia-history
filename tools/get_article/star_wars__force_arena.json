Players control customized squads of characters and vehicles in a card-powered multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) environment in the vein of Clash Royale, where the goal is to destroy the enemy squad's automatic defense turrets and shield generator to open their base to an airstrike.  The myriad of playable squad leaders and unique assistants not only include characters that appear in the films, but also characters who appear in spin-off films, TV series, and Marvel-published comic books, like Rogue One, Star Wars Rebels and Star Wars: Princess Leia, as well as Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the Star Wars sequel trilogy and Solo: A Star Wars Story\nEvery squad is headed by a leader character, which has a special ability that the player can reuse at will after a certain amount of time passes, as well as some passive abilities. Many leaders also each have a unique counterpart, which may be a side character or even a spacecraft strafing run, which can only be used with the character with whom they are paired. When a leader is defeated, they will respawn near the shield generator after some time passes, during which the player is unable to deploy any cards. The respawn time penalty also increases for each subsequent defeat, up to a maximum of ten seconds.\nDevelopment and legacy\nStar Wars: Force Arena was developed by Korean studio Netmarble and published in conjunction with Lucasfilm Games.
