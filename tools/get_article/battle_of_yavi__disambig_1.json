In November 1816, the royalists began a new invasion, advancing with 3,000 men under the command of Pedro Antonio de Olañeta, Juan Guillermo de Marquieguy, and Field Marshal José de la Serna.\nThe independentist troops in the area were commanded by Juan José Fernández Campero, a Spaniard landowner who supported the revolution.  Campero, popularly known as the \"Marquis of Yavi\", commanded the eastern flank of General Güemes' army.\nUnaware of the Spanish advance, Campero arrived at the town of Yavi, north of Humahuaca, on 14 November, in command of 600 men. There, he was surprised the next day by Marquiegui, who first seized their horses, then attacked the town from two directions, obtaining an easy victory. Campero, his second in command, and 300 men were taken prisoner.\nConsequences\nThe battle was a defeat for the Army of the North. As a result, the northern border of the Argentine territory collapsed and the provinces of Salta and Jujuy were invaded by the Spaniards.\nThe government in Buenos Aires decided then to continue the fight for independence through the Pacific flank (present-day Chile), under the command of General San Martín, while Salta's caudillo Martín Miguel de Güemes led a guerrilla war to keep at bay the royalist army in the northern provinces. This campaign is retrospectively known as La Guerra Gaucha (\"The Gaucho War\") after a 1905 novel by Leopoldo Lugones.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080924172713/http://www.boonic.com/enciclopedia/108217.php Ejército del Norte]\n* [http://argentinaturismo.org/jujuy/yavi/2/vacaciones-y-turismo-en-yavi/ argentinaturismo]\n* [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/turismo/9-1020-2007-04-02.html Página 12]"
