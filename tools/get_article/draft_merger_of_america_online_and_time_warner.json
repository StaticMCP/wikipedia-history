      "text": "# Draft:Merger of America Online and Time Warner\n\nOn January 10, 2000, America Online Inc. announced a $164 billion merger agreement with Time Warner Inc., (then the world's largest media conglomerate). Although Time Warner had far more assets and higher revenue, AOL was the acquiring party due to its market valuation. The merger was among the largest in history and viewed as a landmark union of traditional and digital media. After extensive regulatory review, the merger closed on January 11, 2001, resulting in the creation of AOL Time Warner. Despite hopes for synergies, it went on to become one of the most infamous mergers in history. Corporate clashes and shareholder losses led to the resignations of numerous executives and the divestments of several longtime subsidiaries. In January 2003, AOL Time Warner made corporate history when it announced to its shareholders than it experienced a loss of $99 billion during the 2002 fiscal year. By October 2003, the company dropped \"AOL\" from its name and renamed itself back to Time Warner. AOL continued to decline in profits and Time Warner spun it off as an independent company in December 2009, marking the end of what many regard as one of the worst mergers in history.\nBackground and Development\nAmerica Online's early dominance\nAOL was originally founded as Control Video Corporation in 1983, selling games for Atari consoles.\nTime Warner's renaissance period\nWarner Communications and Time Inc. were established between the 1920s and the 1960s and became the parent companies of numerous businesses in the entertainment industry. Warner Communications was originally founded as Kinney National in 1961 as a diversified service industry conglomerate and was involved in funerals, parking, cleaning, and renting. Steven Ross led Kinney National as its President and CEO and oversaw the company's diversification into the media industry. After acquiring the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts film studio, Kinney National separated its service businesses and reincorporated as Warner Communications (WCI) in 1972. WCI owned companies such as Warner Cable, Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, and later, Atari, but later sold the video game business after extensive losses. Time Inc. was co-founded by Henry Luce and Bruce Litton in 1922 as a major magazine publisher. Titles launched included Time, Life, Fortune, and People. Time Inc. became the world's largest magazine publisher and would acquire Home Box Office and launch a publishing division. Warner Communications and Time Inc. decided to merge in 1989 and became the world's largest entertainment company. Following the death of Steven Ross, Gerald Levin would oversee the company's efforts to bring down debt, purchase the Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System, and launched The WB.\nMerger Timeline\nCorporate clashes and Losses\nLater years and AOL Spinoff\nImpact and Legacy\nRecent Developments\nWorks Cited\nReferences"
