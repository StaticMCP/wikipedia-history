It was released on April 8, 2002, as the third single from their fourth studio album, Morning View (2001). The single peaked at No. 3, No. 27 and No. 4 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks, Mainstream Rock and Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts, respectively.\nMusic video\nThe video (set in Sydney, Australia and directed by Francis Lawrence) shows a girl in a hoodie, wearing a digital watch, who stares blankly ahead, apparently oblivious to anyone around her, even though she stands in the middle of crowded areas, namely:\n* an airport terminal\n* a school classroom\n* a church sanctuary aisle\n* a grocery aisle\n* a busy urban intersection\n* an office\n* a supermarket\nHowever, at exactly 10:23 AM, she screams in an extremely shrill voice (which is, like most character dialogue in the video save for the band's singers, inaudible and subtitled), and screams for exactly one whole minute.\nThis process, according to the video, takes place over the course of three days. At the end of the video, it is revealed that exactly 10:24, all the places featured in the video are abandoned, as if the individuals who beheld the girl in any of these environments, and eventually, the entire city's populace, had suddenly vanished or were abducted. This is exemplified by:\n* an inner-city public bus whose drivers and passengers have disappeared, but eventually runs onto the sidewalk.\n* a dropped coffee mug\n* a still-moving cart in the grocery store\nThe band itself is playing the song in a loft; they also disappear at the end of the video. The message of this song and video urges people to live life to the fullest, because at any moment it could be over.\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for \"Warning\"\n!Chart (2002)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
