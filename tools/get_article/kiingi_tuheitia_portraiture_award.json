The award was named for the Māori King, Tūheitia. It was launched in August 2020 and was first presented in 2021. In addition to showcasing emerging Māori artists, the award is intended to hold a role in recording and naming ancestors from various Māori hapū and iwi, and their stories.\nThe award is preceded by a competition, encouraging Māori artists to create portraits of their ancestors () in any visual medium. A panel of judges selects finalists from the competition entries and these works are shown in a three-month long exhibition, hosted by the New Zealand Portrait Gallery and timed to coincide with Matariki. Following the closure of the inaugural award competition exhibition in August 2021, the exhibition toured the country for two years. A second competition was presented in 2023.\n2021 competition\nThe inaugural competition in 2021 attracted 128 entries; 50 finalists were selected and exhibited in the award exhibition. The judging panel selected a first prize winner, a runner-up and awarded 13 Honourable Mentions. The judges were Sir Derek Lardelli, Kura Te Waru Rewiri and Lisa Reihana.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n!Artist\n!Work\n!Subject\n!Medium\n!Notes\n|-\n|First Prize\n|Bodie Friend\n|Nana Pat\n|Pat Kingi\n|Black and white photograph\n|\n|-\n|Runner-up\n|Te Haunui Tuna\n|Survival\n|Tamarau Waiari\n|Digital drawing and video\n|\n|}\n2023 competition\nThe 2023 competition had 96 entries and 43 finalists.

Judges commendations and the winners were announced on May 24 2023.\nOne of the entries, Heke Mai, by Robert Pritchard-Blunt was created using artificial intelligence (AI) and Photoshop and is a picture of his maternal great-great-grandmother, Rakapa Rakapa Tarapiipipi of Ngāti Hauā.\nThe winning entry by Stevei Houkāmau was partly inspired by time she spent on a Native American reservation in New Mexico and learning about blue corn seeds that had been with people for generations. The work is about her great-great-grandmother Hinemaurea and the wider family also. Hinemaurea was the daughter of Raramaitai and married to Te Aotaki, they had five children including Ruataupare, who was married to Tūwhakairiora (a Ngāti Porou chief).Hinemaurea was seen to have great mana and has two existing marae named after her, including our marae in Wharekahika, Hicks Bay.
