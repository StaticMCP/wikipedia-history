HAMEC also exhibits Holocaust-related art and artifacts during some of its school visits.\nHistory\nHAMEC was founded in 1961 by Yaakov Riz, a Holocaust survivor who lost 83 members of his family in concentration camps.\nThe museum was originally located in Riz' basement in Northeast Philadelphia but has grown into larger venues over time. Since 2020, it has occupied a floor of Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel in Elkins Park.\nReferences"
