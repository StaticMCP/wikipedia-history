The department managed the project, with City of Canning responsible for construction and maintenance.\nThe trail was officially opened on 17 April 2018 by Minister for Environment Stephen Dawson, Acting Local Government and Heritage Minister Bill Johnston, and City of Canning mayor Paul Ng. The annual Australian Sikh Heritage Day was held there on 2 March 2019, attended by local and federal members of parliament, mayors, and the Consul General of India in Perth.\nThe  trail also presents information related to the Whadjuk Noongar culture and Swan Canning Riverpark, and is part of the broader Swan Canning Riverpark Trails Project of interpretation facilities called River Journeys.\nSee also\n*Western Australian Heritage Trails Network\n*Man Mohan Singh (pilot)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n|display=title |format=dms}}"
