It was the sixth edition of what would come to be known as the Commonwealth Games, the second Games held in the United Kingdom, and the second held under the name British Empire and Commonwealth Games.\nThirty-five nations sent a total of 1,130 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including, for the first time, Singapore, Ghana, Kenya and the Isle of Man. 178,000 tickets were eventually sold during the Games.\nThe Cardiff Games introduced the Queen's Baton Relay, which has been conducted as a prelude to every Commonwealth Games ever since. England topped the medal table.\nVenues\nThe British Empire and Commonwealth Games, including the opening and closing ceremonies, were held at the Cardiff Arms Park.\nThe following venues were used during the Games.\nPostage stamp\n*Village - Royal Air Force St Athan\n*Aquatics - A new Wales Empire Pool was constructed for the event\n*Athletics - Cardiff Arms Park\n*Boxing - Sophia Gardens Pavilion\n*Cycling (track) - Maindy Stadium\n*Cycling (road) - Ogmore-by-Sea District Loop\n*Fencing - Cae'r Castell School\n*Lawn bowls - Sophia Gardens and Guest Keen Sports Club\n*Rowing - Llyn Padarn in Llanberis\n*Weightlifting - Memorial Hall in Barry\n*Wrestling - Sophia Gardens Pavilion\nFile:Cardiff Arms Park and Millennium Stadium.jpg|Cardiff Arms Park\nFile:Llyn Padarn - geograph.org.uk - 394265.jpg|Llyn Padarn\nParticipating teams\ncenter\n36 countries and territories were represented (and 1,100 athletes), being the largest number to date, with a significant number of teams competing for the first time at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.\nAt Cardiff Arms Park, an anti-apartheid crowd protested at the all-white South African team; games organisers responded that non-white South Africans were ineligible as their associations were not affiliated to the international federations. South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961 and next appeared at the Games in 1994.\nParticipating Commonwealth countries and territories:\n* Australia\n* Bahama Islands\n* Barbados\n* British Guiana\n* Canada\n*\n* Dominica\n*23px England\n* Fiji\n*23px Ghana\n*: first appearance\n*23px Hong Kong\n* India\n*: first appearance\n* Jamaica\n*: first appearance\n*23px Kenya\n* Malaya\n* Malta: first appearance\n*23px Mauritius: first appearance\n* New Zealand\n*23px Nigeria\n* North Borneo: first appearance\n*23px Northern Ireland\n* Northern Rhodesia\n* Pakistan\n*: first appearance\n*  Sarawak: first appearance\n*23px Scotland\n* Singapore: first appearance\n*  Sierra Leone: first appearance\n*23px South Africa\n* Southern Rhodesia\n*\n*23px Uganda\n* Wales (host)\nMedal table\n| host           = WAL\n| flag_template  =\n| event          =\n| team           =\n| gold_ENG = 29 | silver_ENG = 22 | bronze_ENG = 29\n| gold_AUS = 27 | silver_AUS = 22 | bronze_AUS = 17\n| gold_SAF = 13 | silver_SAF = 10 | bronze_SAF = 8 | name_SAF =\n| gold_SCO = 5 | silver_SCO = 5 | bronze_SCO = 3\n| gold_NZL = 4 | silver_NZL = 6 | bronze_NZL = 9\n| gold_JAM = 4 | silver_JAM = 2 | bronze_JAM = 1 | name_JAM =  Jamaica (JAM)\n| gold_PAK = 3 | silver_PAK = 5 | bronze_PAK = 2\n| gold_IND = 2 | silver_IND = 1 | bronze_IND = 0\n| gold_SIN = 2 | silver_SIN = 0 | bronze_SIN = 0   | name_SIN =\n| gold_CAN = 1 | silver_CAN = 10 | bronze_CAN = 16 | name_CAN =\n| gold_WAL = 1 | silver_WAL = 3 | bronze_WAL = 7 | host_WAL = yes  | name_WAL =\n| gold_NIR = 1 | silver_NIR = 1 | bronze_NIR = 3\n| gold_BAH = 1 | silver_BAH = 1 | bronze_BAH = 0 | name_BAH =  Bahama Islands (BAH)\n| gold_BAR = 1 | silver_BAR = 1 | bronze_BAR = 0 | name_BAR =  Barbados (BAR)\n| gold_MAL = 0 | silver_MAL = 2 | bronze_MAL = 0 | name_MAL =  (MAL)\n| gold_NGR = 0 | silver_NGR = 1 | bronze_NGR = 1 | name_NGR =\n| gold_BGU = 0 | silver_BGU = 1 | bronze_BGU = 0 | name_BGU =  British Guiana (BGU)\n| gold_UGA = 0 | silver_UGA = 1 | bronze_UGA = 0 | name_UGA =\n| gold_SRH = 0 | silver_SRH = 0 | bronze_SRH = 2 | name_SRH =  Southern Rhodesia (SRH)\n| gold_KEN = 0 | silver_KEN = 0 | bronze_KEN = 2 | name_KEN =\n| gold_TTO = 0 | silver_TTO = 0 | bronze_TTO = 2 | name_TTO =\n| gold_GHA = 0 | silver_GHA = 0 | bronze_GHA = 1\n| gold_IOM = 0 | silver_IOM = 0 | bronze_IOM = 1\n| gold_NRH = 0 | silver_NRH = 0 | bronze_NRH = 1 | name_NRH =  Northern Rhodesia (NRH)\n}}\nSports\n*\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.commonwealthsport.com/commonwealth-games/cardiff-1958 \"Cardiff 1958\"].
