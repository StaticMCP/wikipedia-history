They are raped and physically and psychologically harmed in brothels, hotels, businesses, homes, and other locations within these administrative divisions.]]\nSex trafficking in Mongolia is human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and slavery that occurs in the country. Mongolia is a source, transit and destination country for sexually trafficked persons.\nMongolian citizens, primarily women and girls, have been sex trafficked within Mongolia and to other countries in Asia and different continents. Foreign victims are sex trafficked into the country.  Children and persons in poverty\nare particularly vulnerable to sex trafficking. Victims are deceived, threatened, and or forced into prostitution and their passports and other documents are often taken. Beatings and druggings are common. They suffer from physical and psychological abuse  and are typically locked up or guarded. Victims tend to live in poor conditions and are forced to do unfree labour. A number contract sexually transmitted diseases from rapes without condoms. Victims are often traumatized and some commit suicide.\nMale and female traffickers are often members of or facilitated by crime organizations and gangs. Mongolian traffickers have operated outside of the country in China, Macau, South Korea, and elsewhere. Family members and friends are sometimes the perpetrators.\nThe extent of sex trafficking in Mongolia is difficult to know because of the lack of data, underground nature of sex trafficking crimes, and other factors. The rapid growth of mining and other industries in twenty-first century Mongolia has led to an increase in sex trafficking in the country. Sex trafficked victims have been sent to businesses supporting transportation links, including coal routes, with China. The government of Mongolia has been criticized  for not providing enough assistance to victims.\nChina–Mongolia border\nMongolian and Chinese women and girls are sex trafficked to and through the China–Mongolia border. At the border and in the Gobi Desert are global mining sector and other heavy industry operations with large workforces of isolated men. These sites, including the ones in Tavan Tolgoi coal deposits, have been a focal point for prostitution and sex trafficking.\nNon-governmental organizations\nThe Human Security Policy Studies Centre, headquartered in Ulaanbaatar, fights against sex trafficking in Mongolia.\nTalita Mongolia conducts anti-sex trafficking efforts in Mongolia.\nThe Mongolian Gender Equality Center provides rehabilitative assistance to sex trafficked victims.\nLantuun Dohio NGO fights against human trafficking and child abuse.\nReferences"
