The game was narrated by actor Michael Dorn of \"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nGameplay\nVikings: The Strategy of Ultimate Conquest casts players as ambitious Viking warriors in 9th-century Scandinavia seeking to conquer over 160 provinces across Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. The gameplay is a blend of strategy, adventure, and narrative choice. Players manage resources, negotiate trade deals with nearly 300 cities, and gather intelligence by charming tavern patrons. The journey unfolds across land and sea, combining tactical invasions with character-driven quests for ancient relics and artifacts. Combat plays a central role—ranging from skirmishes with bandits to large-scale village raids, complete with burning buildings and looting spoils. Decisions such as marriage and alliance-building shape the course of a warrior's lifetime, influencing both reputation and territorial gains. Each session offers a different strategic landscape, as provinces evolve in strength and resistance. With difficulty levels spanning from novice to saga legend, the game emphasizes replayability and the dynamic consequences of player choices.\nDevelopment\nThe game was developed by Random Games, a company founded in 1985.\n|rev2=Computer Gaming World\n|rev2Score=1/5\n|rev3=Power Play\n|rev3Score=32%\n|rev4=PC Player\n|rev4Score=1/5\n}}\nComputer Gaming World gave the game score of 1 out of 5 stating\" Undoubtedly, this game would have looked good 10 years ago.
