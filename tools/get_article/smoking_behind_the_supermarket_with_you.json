The series began as a webcomic published on Twitter in March 2022. The series then began serialization in Square Enix's Monthly Big Gangan magazine in August 2022. Square Enix has collected the series as  volumes, with seven published as of July 2025. An anime television series adaptation is set to premiere in 2026.\nThe manga won the 2022 Next Manga Award in the web category.\nStory\nSasaki, an overworked salaryman, finds a release of his daily tensions in the customer service of Yamada, a winsome, cheery supermarket cashier. One day he finds himself working late, and, finding Yamada already done with work for the day, goes for a smoke, he finds a mysterious woman, \"Tayama\", who invites him to the smoking area behind the store.\nCharacters\n;\n:}}\n:The male protagonist; he is a tired middle-aged (aged 45) businessman working in sales in what is often a demanding and trying job (which Tayama calls a \"black company\"), who is refreshed by going to Yamada's checkout to make his purchases because of her friendly customer service manner. He doesn't recognise that his favourite, Yamada, is the same as his new smoking friend Tayama.\n;\n:\n:The female protagonist; a 24-year-old employee of Super S, who started as a part-timer 8 years ago. As Yamada, she is demure and the perfect customer handler; her real self (which, when she introduces to Sasaki as \"Tayama\") is much more cool, leather-jacketed with several ear-piercings. She invites Sasaki to come to the smoking area behind the store, which he then does regularly. Bemused and slightly upset that Sasaki can't discern that Yamada and Tayama are the same person, and somewhat upset by his putting Yamada on a pedestal (cf. finding her short-sleeved work outfit cute) whilst treating \"Tayama\" with extreme respect and consideration (cf. worrying that her bare stomach will be cold and giving her his jacket just in case).\n;\n:The lady Manager of Super S, a supporter of Yamada (and what she observes of her relationship with Sasaki). Enjoys romance novels, and real-life approximations thereof.\n;Sasaki's boss\n:A bald man who repeatedly critiques and gives extra work to Sasaki as well as creates a harsh work environment for his employees.\n;\n:Another senior of Yamada's at Super S- addressed as \"Chief Maezawa\", in charge of the cashiers- who recounts the story of a ghost in the store's smoking area to Yamada. Good with \"lost\" kids that need to find their parents.\n;\n:A mild-mannered middle-aged assistant manager at Super S.\n;\n:Sasaki's sympathetic blond co-worker; father of Megumi.\nProduction\nJinushi was serializing Rokurei - Tenseishi Rinne Kuyakusho Dairokkanbu Joreika Katsudouki in Monthly Big Gangan. He received advice from his editor to draw a short manga as an exercise in creative writing, which led him to creating the series. Since Rokurei which was being serialized, was a supernatural story, the manga was drawn to be more realistic, and since the author had a background in customer service sales, the story was set in a supermarket.\nMedia\nManga\nWhen the first chapter was posted on Twitter, the tweet received more than 190,000 likes (as of June 2, 2022), creating a huge response.  As of June 25, 2022, the total number of likes for the series had surpassed 2.5 million.\nOn August 25, 2022, the serialization in the magazine began in Monthly Big Gangan. In this issue, it appeared on the cover and in the opening color. On the same day, the first volume of the book with newly written chapters was also released.\nAs a result of this, the title was changed from  to , and chapters 4 to 16 that were posted on Twitter were deleted, but it was announced it will still continue on Twitter without change.\nThe manga has been licensed by Square Enix's Manga UP! Global app and website. At Anime Expo 2023, Square Enix Manga & Books announced that they licensed the series for English publication, with the first volume being released on February 20, 2024.\nVolumes\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-8094-7\n| LicensedRelDate = February 20, 2024\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-6460-9286-4\n| ChapterListCol1 =\n* Smoke 1\n* Smoke 2\n* Smoke 3\n* Smoke 4\n* Smoke 5\n* Smoke 6\n* Smoke 7\n* Smoke 8\n| ChapterListCol2 =\n* Smoke 9\n* Smoke 10\n* Smoke 11\n* Smoke 12\n* Smoke 13\n* Smoke 14\n* Smoke 15\n* Smoke 16\n** Smoke 0\n}}\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-8362-7\n| LicensedRelDate = May 21, 2024\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-6460-9287-1\n| ChapterListCol1  =\n* Smoke 21\n** Smoke 021 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 021 Interlude 2\n* Smoke 17 (Short)\n* Smoke 18 (Short)\n* Smoke 19 (Short)\n* Smoke 20 (Short)\n| ChapterListCol2  =\n* Smoke 22\n** Smoke 022 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 022 Interlude 2\n* Smoke 23\n** Smoke 23 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 23 Interlude 2\n* Smoke 24\n** Winter, Behind the Bar, Not Quite with You\n}}\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-8694-9\n| ISBN_note       =  ()\n| LicensedRelDate = September 3, 2024\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-6460-9305-2\n| ChapterListCol1 =\n* Smoke 25\n** Smoke 25 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 25 Interlude 2\n* Smoke 26\n** Smoke 26 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 26 Interlude 2\n| ChapterListCol2 =\n* Bonus Smoke: Waiting for that Day\n* Smoke 27\n** Smoke 27 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 27 Interlude 2\n* Smoke 28\n}}\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-8709-0\n| ISBN_note       =  ()\n| LicensedRelDate = March 18, 2025\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-6460-9345-8\n|ChapterList=\n* Smoke 29\n** Smoke 29 Interlude 1\n** Smoke 29 Interlude 2\n** Smoke 29 Interlude 3\n* Smoke 30\n** Smoke 30 Interlude 1|ChapterListCol2=\n* Bonus Smoke: Passing to the Next Esper\n* Smoke 31\n** Smoke 31 Interlude 1\n* Smoke 32\n* Smoke 33\n}}\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-9314-5\n| ISBN_note       =\n| LicensedRelDate = August 12, 2025\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-6460-9393-9\n|ChapterList=\n* Smoke 34\n** Smoke 34 Interlude 1\n* Smoke 35\n** Smoke 35 Interlude 1\n* Smoke 36\n** Smoke 36 Interlude 1|ChapterListCol2=\n* Bonus Smoke\n* Smoke 37\n* Smoke 38\n}}\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-9542-2\n| ISBN_note       =  ()\n| LicensedRelDate = January 20, 2026\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-6460-9448-6\n|ChapterList=\n* Smoke 39\n* Smoke 40\n* Smoke 41\n|ChapterListCol2=\n* Bonus Smoke\n* Smoke 42\n* Smoke 43\n* Smoke 44\n}}\n| ISBN            = 978-4-7575-9975-8\n| ISBN_note       =\n| LicensedRelDate = —\n| LicensedISBN    =\n|ChapterList=\n* Smoke 45\n* Smoke 46\n* Smoke 47\n|ChapterListCol2=\n* Smoke 48\n* Smoke 49\n* Smoke 50\n}}\nUncollected chapters\nThese chapters have yet to be published in a  volume.\n* 51st Smoke\n* 52nd Smoke\n* 53rd Smoke\nAnime\nAn anime television series adaptation was announced on July 18, 2025.
