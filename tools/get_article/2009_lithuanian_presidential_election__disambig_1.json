A run-off would have been held on 7 June 2009, but was not necessary as Dalia Grybauskaitė was elected with 69% of the vote, with voter turnout just over the 50% threshold for the result to be validated. Grybauskaitė took office on 12 July as the country's first female president.\nThis was only the second time since the restoration of independence that a Lithuanian president was elected without the need for a runoff, the first being in 1993, when Algirdas Brazauskas was elected with 61% in the first round.\nCandidates\nThe Electoral Commission registered 14 candidates for the elections, whilst Vladimir Romanov's application was rejected. However, six candidates (Jonas Jankauskas, Vytautas Kundrotas, Algimantas Matulevičius, Algirdas Pilvelis, Vidmantas Sadauskas and Zigmas Vaišvila) failed to collect the 20,000 signatures required, and Seimas Speaker Arūnas Valinskas (National Resurrection Party) withdrew his candidacy.\nSeven candidates collected enough signatures to participate in the elections:\n*Dalia Grybauskaitė, incumbent European Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget, former Minister of Finance (2001–2004)\n*Valentinas Mazuronis (Order and Justice), member of the Seimas since 2004\n*Kazimiera Prunskienė, first Prime Minister of Lithuania (1990–1991) and former Minister of Agriculture (2004–2008)\n*, Brigadier General of Lithuanian Armed Forces and wrestler\n*Valdemar Tomaševski (Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania), member of the Seimas since 2000\n*Loreta Graužinienė (Labour Party), member of the Seimas since 2004\n*Algirdas Butkevičius (Social Democratic Party), former Minister of Finance (2004–2005) and former Minister of Transport and Communications (2006–2008)\nGrybauskaitė was supported by the Homeland Union and Liberal Movement.\nOpinion polls\nAccording to the opinion polls, Grybauskaitė was the undisputed leader in the race for the Presidency.\nResults\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.vrk.lt/2009-prezidento 2009 Lithuanian presidential elections] VRK"
