His professionalism and his passion for recording made others to call him as one of \"Vancouver's top indie-rock engineers\".\nHe owns and operates a studio in Victoria, British Columbia, called The Hive Creative Labs, which has established itself as a musical institution of Canada's west coast independent music scene, having hosted and recorded \"Black Mountain, Destroyer, Ladyhawk, Frog Eyes, Hot Hot Heat, and P:ano, along with virtually every other significant West coast indie act\". Colin has also recorded albums by Kathryn Calder, Sleepy Sun band, Yukon Blonde, The Cave Singers, Veda Hille, No Kids, Dan Mangan, Pretty Girls Make Graves, and many others.\nHe is also a founding member of the band Gigi. On 30 September 2013, the recording studio Hive Creative Labs which was a home for a lot of Vancouver acts closed its doors because of Producer Colin Stewart's relocation to Victoria.\nHe is married to singer-songwriter Kathryn Calder.\nSelected discography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
