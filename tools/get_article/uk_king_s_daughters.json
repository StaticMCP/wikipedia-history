The hospital, which is owned by the University of Kentucky, is a locally managed, not-for-profit 465-bed facility that offers \"cardiac, medical, surgical, pediatric, rehabilitative, psychiatric, cancer, neurological, pain care, wound care and home care\" services.\nHistory\nEarly history\nKing's Daughters' Hospital opened in 1897 as a three-room emergency hospital over the Poage, Elliott and Poage Drug Store on Winchester Avenue near 16th Street. In 1899, the hospital itself was founded by the What-so-ever Circle of the International Order of the King's Daughters and Sons and moved to a seven-room building at 18th Street and Greenup Avenue. Ten years later, the hospital moved again to a nine-room building between 20th and 21st Street along Winchester Avenue.\nIn 1915, the hospital purchased property at the northeast corner of 22nd Street and Lexington Avenue. Two years later in November, it opened a new 50-bed facility in a two-story brick structure. An expansion in 1930–31 added an east wing, which was expanded again in 1945 and 1953, all to the east.\nIn 1958, that building closed and a new administration building was completed across Lexington Avenue and the remainder of the hospital.\nDeveloping into a modern facility\nIn 1963, the hospital began to study plans for a specialized Coronary Care Unit. The hospital expanded in 1965 with a northern extension. In 1967, a 24-hour emergency department was established. One year later, the Coronary Care Unit opens with four private patient rooms and a ten-bed Intensive Care Unit.\nIn 1968, the hospital expanded upon the 1953 extension with a two-story structure; this was expanded upward with an additional two levels in 1984. With the extension, the hospital now stretched from 22nd Street to 23rd Street. One year after the hospital was expanded upon, the Ashland Medical Arts Building was completed in 1969 at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street.\nIn 1972, a new emergency department was completed. Six years later, the Cardiac Step Down Unit and Cardiac Rehabilitation opened, followed by the Echocardiology Department in 1981 and the Diabetes Clinic in the following year.\nThe hospital expanded northward again in 1984 to Montgomery Avenue. In 1986, a new 16-bed Intensive Care Unit was completed, followed by the opening of the Cardiac Catheterization Lab one year later. The Cardiac Lab was expanded in 1993 and again in 1994 with the addition of a second laboratory.\nIn 1985, the Tri-State Regional Cancer Center opened adjacent to the Medical Arts Building. In 1988, a new facade and lobby with atrium was completed along Lexington Avenue; the new lobby was constructed within the 1953 addition. During this year, the original 1917 hospital structure was demolished in favor of the Tri-State Diagnostics center.\nIn 1990, a four level parking structure was completed along Lexington Avenue. A medical library and health education center was completed in the lower level of the parking garage in 1992. Three years later, a new 22-bed emergency department was completed along 23rd Street. Three years later, a third Cardiac Lab and a 24-bed Cardiac Surgery Unit was opened.\nThe $32 million Center for Advanced Care, now known as the Parkview Patient Tower 1, was completed in November 2000. It features a 24-bed Intensive Care Unit, 3 Cardiac Cath Labs bringing the total to five, a Cardiac Cath Lab pre-op and recovery areas, three dedicated Cardiothoracic surgery operating suites, a nine-bed Cardiovascular Recovery Unit, and a rooftop helipad.

Three years later, Cardiac Alert Unit became a 10-bed Chest Pain Unit, expanding to 18-beds in 2005.\nCampus expansion\nMedical Plaza A, opened in 1998, and was originally constructed as a three-story building providing room for physician offices, a Wendy's fast-food restaurant, a National City Bank (now City National Bank) branch and a cafe. It was expanded in 2002 to five stories, and in 2003 the Outpatient Surgery Center opened on the building's third floor.\nIn 2000, a new five-story structure was completed along 22nd Street facing Central Park that provided new patient rooms, cardiothoracic surgery facilities, Intensive Care Unit and rooftop helipad.

Envisioned as a three-story $43.5 million facility, a rising demand in services relating to cardiac and heart care necessitated the expansion of the hospital while it was under construction.

The facility provides a variety of inpatient and outpatient services and is the location of KDMC's Portsmouth Urgent Care facility.\nKing's Daughters and the Greenup County Fiscal Court announced that the hospital would be purchasing the former Bellefonte Pavilion in Russell from the fiscal court. The facility, which originally housed Ashland Oil's petroleum division and includes the former Ashland Oil heliport, had been donated to the county by Bon Secours Mercy Health as part of the 2020 closing of Russell's Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital (OLBH). The hospital eventually moved approximately 300 non-clinical employees from the hospital campus and other locations in Ashland to the building, which was renamed '''King's Daughters Pavilion'''. This allowed expansion of clinical services on the hospital campus and resulted in the creation of approximately 150 additional jobs. Prior to the hospital fully occupying the building in spring 2021, KDMC moved their COVID-19 vaccination clinic from the hospital campus to the King's Daughters Pavilion in February 2020. This was due to the Pavilion's expansive space and large parking lot, which allows easier patient access compared to the main hospital campus in downtown Ashland as well as gave the hospital the ability to vaccinate more than 1,000 people a day. King's Daughters had previously absorbed many of OLBH's off-site facilities including many of OLBH's medical providers as well as  facilities such as the Vitality Center physical and occupational therapy facility on the former OLBH main campus. KDMC also hired a large number of OLBH nursing and support staff.\nIn February 2025, UK King's Daughters announced the purchase of the Bellefonte Centre building in Russell from private investors. This building, located next to King's\nDaughters Pavilion and originally housing Ashland Oil's corporate headquarters, was renamed '''King's Daughters Health Park''' and will house outpatient clinical facilities including provider offices, lab and imaging facilities and the hospital's sleep lab. At the same time, the hospital announced the construction of a $7 million medical facility in the city of Greenup. This building, which is expected to open in summer or autumn of 2026, will house an urgent care facility, imaging services and a family care center, with the providers at the current primary care office in Greenup moving to the new facility.\nUniversity of Kentucky ownership\nOn January 29, 2021, the hospital and the University of Kentucky announced a \"significant partnership\" between King's Daughters and UK HealthCare. As part of this agreement, a new governing board with equal representation from both organizations was formed. King's Daughters then-President and CEO Kristi Whitlatch remained in that role but will also become a member of UK HealthCare's management team. The partnership, which includes access to UK HealthCare's pediatric cardiology and pharmacy program as well as expanded access to the Markey Cancer Center and training opportunities within King's Daughters for University of Kentucky College of Medicine students, officially went into force on April 1, 2021. In October 2022, the hospital and university announced plans for the university to acquire King's Daughters outright. The acquisition was finalized on December 1, 2022, with King's Daughters becoming a part of the University of Kentucky that day.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.kingsdaughtershealth.com/ UK King's Daughters]"
