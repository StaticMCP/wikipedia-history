Playing his club cricket for Clontarf, Seymour made his debut in first-class cricket for Ireland against Scotland at Dublin in 1927. He made two further first-class appearances in 1928, against the touring West Indians at Dublin, and Scotland at Edinburgh. In the 1928 match against Scotland, he was no-balled for throwing, and did not play for Ireland again. Playing as a fast-medium bowler, he took four wickets in his three first-class matches, with best figures of 2/26. Outside of cricket, he worked for Gouldings' Fertilisers. He died at Dublin in December 1980.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
