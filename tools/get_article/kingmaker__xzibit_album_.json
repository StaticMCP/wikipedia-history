He called \"Play This at My Funeral\" his \"state of the union\", and said that the album isn't about his hierarchy, but rather ups and down throughout his career that \"made him successful.\" He announced that Kingmaker would release in early 2025. The month before the single released, he signed with Greenback Records, a new record label launched by Irish professional mixed martial artist and former UFC fighter Conor McGregor.\nOn October 25, 2024, Xzibit released the second single \"Been a Long Time Pt. 2,\" a sequel to \"Been a Long Time\" from his third studio album Restless. He would drop a third single, \"Everywhere I Go,\" produced by Dem Jointz, on November 27, 2024. He further continued in 2025 with the fourth single \"Shut Yo Mouth\" and fifth single \"For the Love,\" the latter being Xzibit's first collaboration with Ice Cube.\nTrack listing\n| extra2  = Dem Jointz\n| title3 = Been a Long Time Pt. 2\n| note3 = featuring Jenn Em\n| length3 = 3:12\n| writer3 =\n| extra3  = Dem Jointz\n| title4 = The Moment\n| note4 = featuring Busta Rhymes and JasonMartin\n| length4 = 3:07\n| writer4 =\n| extra4  =\n| title5 = Earth Is Over\n| length5 = 2:41\n| writer5 = Xzibit\n| extra5 = Big Duke\n| title6 = Leave Me Alone\n| note6 = featuring Dr. Dre and Ty Dolla Sign\n| length6 = 3:30\n| writer6 =\n| extra6  =\n| title7 = Belly of the Beast\n| note7 = featuring JasonMartin\n| length7 = 4:05\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = David Moss\n| title8 = History\n| length8 = 2:56\n| writer8 = Xzibit\n| extra8  = Justin Rhodes\n| title9 = Genesis\n| length9 = 2:52\n| writer9 = Xzibit\n| extra9 = Koach\n| title10 = Perfect Albini\n| note10 = featuring Stalone\n| length10 = 3:12\n| writer10 = Xzibit\n| extra10  = Dem Jointz\n| title11 = American Idols\n| note11 = featuring Symba\n| length11 = 3:07\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 = Sndtrck\n| title12 = Crash\n| note12 = featuring Royce da 5'9\" and K.A.A.N.\n| length12 = 3:11\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = Big Duke\n| title13 = For the Love\n| note13 = featuring Ice Cube and Lorine Cha\n| length13 = 3:32\n| writer13 =\n| extra13  = Big Duke\n| title14 = Shut Yo Mouth\n| note14 = featuring Compton AV and Butch Cassidy\n| length14 = 2:55\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = DJ Battlecat\n| title15 = Higher\n| note15 = featuring Redman and B-Real\n| length15 = 2:43\n| writer15 =\n| extra15  = Focus...\n| title16 = Success\n| length16 = 3:00\n| writer16 =\n| extra16  = will.i.am\n| title17 = Notified\n| note17 = featuring King Tee and Cold 187um\n| length17 = 3:02\n| writer17 =\n| extra17  = Beat Butcha\n| title18 = What U Like\n| note18 = featuring Guapdad 4000 and Daygo Fatts\n| length18 = 3:14\n| writer18 =\n| extra18  = DJ Khalil\n| title19 = End of the Day\n| note19 = featuring Tre Capital, Domo Genesis, and Adé Békoé\n| length19 = 2:51\n| writer19 =\n| extra19 = Big Duke\n| title20 = Kingmaker\n| length20 = 2:46\n| writer20 = Xzibit\n| extra20 = Sndtrck\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Chart (2025)\n!Peak\nposition\n|-\n|UK Album Downloads (OCC)\n|47\n|}\nReferences"
