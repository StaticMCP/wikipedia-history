It was discovered in 1990 by R.J. Lavery of Mount Stromlo Observatory. It is composed of very old stars and is very isolated from other galaxies. Its location on the opposite side of the Milky Way from other Local Group galaxies makes it an important object for study.\nProperties\n]]\nThe Tucana Dwarf is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of type dE5. It contains only old stars, formed in a single star formation era around the time the Milky Way's globular clusters formed. It is not experiencing any current star formation, unlike other isolated dwarf galaxies.\nThe Tucana Dwarf does not contain very much neutral hydrogen gas. It has a metallicity of -1.8, a significantly low number. There is no significant spread in metallicity throughout the galaxy. There does not seem to be any substructure to the stellar distribution in the galaxy.\nLocation\nThe Tucana Dwarf is located in the constellation Tucana. It is about  away, on the opposite side of the Milky Way galaxy to most of the other Local Group galaxies and is therefore important for understanding the kinematics and formation history of the Local Group, as well as the role of environment in determining how dwarf galaxies evolve. It is isolated from other galaxies, and located near the edge of the Local Group, around  from the barycentre of the Local Group—the second most remote of all member galaxies after the Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy.\nThe Tucana Dwarf galaxy is one of only two dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group  not located near the Milky Way or the Andromeda Galaxy. It is thought to have approached the Andromeda Galaxy about 11 billion years ago, which ejected the galaxy far away to its current position; such galaxies are called \"backsplash galaxies\".\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051116070034/http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v28n2/aas188/abs/S009003.html The Tucana Dwarf Galaxy: HST/WFPC2 Imaging of this Isolated Local Group Dwarf Spheroidal] (AAS)\n*"
