He is of Filipino descent. He moved to Kitchener, Ontario, Canada with his parents when he was 5. In 2021, he graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Mathematics, majoring in Mathematical Finance.\nSantos began a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at Toronto Metropolitan University in fall 2025.\nCareer\nPrior to competing in ''Canada's Drag Race, Kyne had a following on YouTube for drag enthusiasts with a series of tutorials on sewing and wig styling.\nKyne uses she/her pronouns when in drag, and he/him pronouns not in drag.\nAlthough Kyne was eliminated from Canada's Drag Race'' in the second episode, and got the \"villain edit\" because his self-confidence was perceived by some viewers as lapsing into cockiness, he subsequently became a popular figure on social media, attracting over 800,000 followers on TikTok with a popular series of math tutorials presented in drag. The math videos have included straightforward presentations on general mathematical concepts such as pi and googol, math riddles and memes, and in-depth analysis of the use of mathematics in the news, such as demonstrating the numerical flaws in bad reporting on issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic and race-based crime statistics.\nSantos has described his math tutorials as inspired by a desire to present math in a fun and entertaining way, and by a desire to break down barriers, including countering common stereotypes that LGBTQ people cannot succeed in maths and sciences, and presenting a counterexample to the widespread belief that people can be analytical or creative but not both.\nIn January 2021, Santos also shared his coming out story in a new video for the ongoing It Gets Better Project.\nIn 2023, Kyne was named as a part of the year's Forbes 30 Under 30 Local: Toronto list.\nReferences"
