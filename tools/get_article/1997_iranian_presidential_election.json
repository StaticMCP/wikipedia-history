The election was notable not only for the lopsided majority of the winner – 70% – but for the high turnout.  80% of those eligible to vote did so, compared to 50% in the previous presidential election.\nDuring the election, voting age was 15 and more than half of Iran's population was younger than 25.\nCandidates\nThe Council of Guardians blocked 234 candidates from running for the presidency because they lacked the religious and political qualifications. Only four candidates were permitted to run for office:\n* Mohammad Khatami, Former Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance\n* Mohammad Reyshahri, Former Minister of Intelligence and National Security\n* Reza Zavare'i, Member of Guardian Council\n* Ali Akbar Nategh-Nouri, Incumbent Speaker of the Parliament of Iran\nDisqualified candidates\n* Ebrahim Yazdi, secretary-general of Freedom Movement of Iran\n* Habibollah Payman, leader of Movement of Militant Muslims\n* Ezzatollah Sahabi, leading Nationalist-Religious figure\n* Azam Taleghani, former member of the Iranian parliament\nDeclined to run\n* Mir-Hossein Mousavi, former Prime Minister\nIssues\nThe candidates were asked about their opinion on the fatwa against Salman Rushdie. Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said that any \"a good Muslim\" would carry out the fatwa. Mohammad Khatami avoided the issue. Mohammad Khatami's supporters called Nateq-Nouri the \"Taliban\" of Iran.\nKhatami ran on a platform of political liberalization at home and détente abroad and expressed support for the easing Islamic regulations \"from women's dress to whether TV satellite dishes should be allowed.\"\nEndorsements\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
