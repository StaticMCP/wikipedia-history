They were a member of the North American Lacrosse League. During 2013 season the Kingfish were scheduled for a limited 6 game road schedule. Due to the Baltimore Bombers folding mid-season the Kingfish only played 4 games, and posted zero wins on the season.\nHistory\nThe franchise was announced as an expansion member of the North American Lacrosse League on July 26, 2012. The Kingfish would be one of two expansion teams for the 2013 season, the other was the Baltimore Bombers\nThe Kingfish originally announced they would play their 2013 home schedule at the Bradford R. Boss Arena, but on January 4, 2013 the Kingfish released a statement saying, in part, \"Due to an unforeseen logistical situation, the Rhode Island Kingfish will be opening the 2013 season on the road.\"  The rest of the NALL team also updated their schedules, with none of the teams schedules having an away game in Rhode Island.\nRoster\n{| align=left border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=#5CB3FF style=\"color:Red\"|2013 Rhode Island Kingfish\n|-\n|-\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Number\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Player's Name\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Position\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|College\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Height\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Weight\n|-\n|  || Steven Boyle ||  || Johns Hopkins || ||\n|-\n|  || Parker Brown ||  || Brown || ||\n|-\n|  || Gary Crowley ||  || Bryant ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Joe Evans ||  || Salisbury University ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Gareth Fabian ||  || Cazenovia ||  ||\n|-\n|  || JJ Gilbane ||  || Cornell ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Tim Harder ||  || Syracuse ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Dan Hettler ||  || Fairfield  ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Daniel Kelly ||  || Salem State ||  ||\n|-\n| || David Kemp ||  || Herkimer CC ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Brian Krol ||  || Cortland ||  ||\n|-\n|  || AJ Laffin ||  || St Johns-Fisher ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Ryan Licht ||  || Fairleigh Dickinson University || ||\n|-\n|  || Jameson Love ||  || Bryant || ||\n|-\n|  || Dan Maclssac ||  || AIC || ||\n|-\n|  || Michael Maggio ||  || Lasell || ||\n|-\n|  || Mike Nadler ||  || Bates || ||\n|-\n|  || Brandon Noble ||  || Georgian ||  ||\n|-\n| || Kyle Norchi ||  || Plattsburgh ||  ||\n|-\n| || James Schutt ||  || Monroe CC || ||\n|-\n|  || Matt Smalley ||  || Hobart || ||\n|-\n|  || Kyle Sminkey ||  || Vermont || ||\n|-\n|  || Zach Smith ||  || Sacred Heart || ||\n|-\n| || Rich Szymanski || || St. Lawrence ||  ||\n|-\n| || Zach Taylor || || New Hampshire ||  ||\n|-\n| || Matt Vozzolo || || New England ||  ||\n|-\n| || David Wood || || St Johns-Fisher ||  ||\n|-\n|}\nCurrent Season\n{| align=left border=4 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=#5CB3FF style=\"color:Red\"|2013 Rhode Island Kingfish Season\n|-\n|-\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Date & Time\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Away Team\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Score\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Home Team\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Score\n!align=\"center\" colspan=\"1\"|Game Notes\n|-\n| January 12 @ 7:00 PM|| Rhode Island || 14 || Kentucky Stickhorses || 17 ||\n|-\n| January 20 @ 3:00 PM|| Rhode Island || 8 || Baltimore Bombers || 12 ||\n|-\n| February 2 @ 7:00 PM|| Rhode Island || 7 || Boston Rockhoppers || 20 ||\n|-\n| February 9 @ 8:00 PM✝|| Rhode Island || N/A || Baltimore Bombers || N/A || CANCELED\n|-\n| February 23 @ 7:00 PM|| Rhode Island Kingfish|| 14 || Boston Rockhoppers || 15 || Postponed until March 9\n|-\n| March 16 @ 7:00 PM✝|| Rhode Island || N/A || Kentucky Stickhorses || N/A ||CANCELED\n|-\n|}\n✝ Games canceled due to Baltimore Bombers mid-season fold.\nSeason-by-Season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Reg.
