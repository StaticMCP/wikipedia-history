The aircraft is only supplied as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.\nDesign and development\nThe Sportster was designed by Jesse Anglin of Henderson, North Carolina. It was derived from his earlier design, the Warner Spacewalker II, to comply with the US light-sport aircraft rules. It features a cantilever low-wing, a single-seat or a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit which can be optionally enclosed under a bubble canopy, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.\nThe aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing, with its wooden wings covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its  span wing has an area of . The standard engine available is the  Continental O-200 four-stroke powerplant. The  Lycoming O-290 has also been used.\nAs of March 2017, the design does not appear on the Federal Aviation Administration's list of approved special light-sport aircraft.\nOperational history\nBy March 2017 five examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration, all in the experimental category.\nSpecifications (Sportster two-seater)\n|prime units?=imp\n|genhide=\n|crew=one\n|capacity=one passenger\n|length m=\n|length ft=21\n|length in=4\n|length note=\n|span m=\n|span ft=28\n|span in=6\n|span note=\n|height m=\n|height ft=5\n|height in=6\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=112.1\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=817\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=1320\n|gross weight note=\n|fuel capacity=standard: , optional\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Continental O-200\n|eng1 type=four cylinder, air-cooled, four stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=100\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=wooden\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=130\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=115\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=48\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=150\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=+6/-4\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=1000\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=11.8\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
