National archaeological parks must have previously been designated as Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level, and are considered to have high historical, cultural, and academic value. They include ancient settlements, cities and towns, palaces, temples and caves, engineering and manufacturing sites, and mausoleums and cemeteries. Many parks also have on-site museums.\nThe first 12 national archaeological parks were announced in 2010, and since then 24 more parks have been added to the list, bringing the total to 36. In addition, more than 60 sites have been designated as candidates for the national archaeological park status.\nRegulation\nOn 17 December 2009, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage issued the National Archaeological Park Administration Measures. According to the regulation, an archaeological site must meet five criteria before applying for national archaeological park status: it must be a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level; its provincial-level government has issued and implemented measures to protect the site; an archaeological work plan has been approved and commenced; has an archaeological park plan in compliance with the protection measures; has a specialized administration entity with corporate status.\nList of national archaeological parks\n23 archaeological sites applied for the national archaeological park designation in 2010. On 9 October 2010, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) announced the first batch of 12 parks whose applications were approved.\nIn December 2013, the SACH announced the second batch of 12 national archaeological parks. In December 2017, the third batch of 12 national archaeological parks was announced. In December 2022, the fourth batch of 19 national archaeological parks was announced, bringing the total to 55.\n, Beijing]]\n]]\n, Sichuan]]\n, the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han]]\n]]\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"vertical-align:center; text-align:center; background:#FFFFF;\"\n|-\n!National archaeological park\n!Province\n!Batch\n|-\n| Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) || Beijing || 1\n|-\n| Zhoukoudian (Peking Man site) || Beijing || 1\n|-\n| Ji'an Gaogouli (Goguryeo) || Jilin || 1\n|-\n| Hongshan || Jiangsu || 1\n|-\n| Liangzhu || Zhejiang || 1\n|-\n| Yinxu || Henan || 1\n|-\n| Luoyang of Sui–Tang Dynasties || Henan || 1\n|-\n| Sanxingdui || Sichuan || 1\n|-\n| Jinsha || Sichuan || 1\n|-\n| Han Yang Ling || Shaanxi || 1\n|-\n| Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor || Shaanxi || 1\n|-\n| Daming Palace || Shaanxi || 1\n|-\n| Niuheliang || Liaoning || 2\n|-\n| Zhongjing of Bohai || Jilin || 2\n|-\n| Shangjing of Bohai || Heilongjiang || 2\n|-\n| Yuyaochang (Jingdezhen Imperial Kiln) || Jiangxi || 2\n|-\n| Qufu, Capital of Lu || Shandong || 2\n|-\n| Nanwang Hub of the Grand Canal || Shandong || 2\n|-\n| Luoyang of Han–Wei Dynasties|| Henan || 2\n|-\n| Xiongjiazhong || Hubei || 2\n|-\n| Tongguan Kiln || Hunan || 2\n|-\n| Zengpiyan || Guangxi || 2\n|-\n| Diaoyucheng || Chongqing || 2\n|-\n| Beiting City || Xinjiang || 2\n|-\n| Zhongdu of Yuan || Hebei || 3\n|-\n| Dayao Longquan Kilns || Zhejiang || 3\n|-\n| Shanglin Lake Yue Kilns || Zhejiang || 3\n|-\n| Zhongdu of Ming || Anhui || 3\n|-\n| Wanshouyan || Fujian || 3\n|-\n| Chengziya || Shandong || 3\n|-\n| Jizhou Kiln || Jiangxi || 3\n|-\n| Zheng–Han City || Henan || 3\n|-\n| Panlongcheng || Hubei || 3\n|-\n| Chengtoushan || Hunan || 3\n|-\n| Weiyang Palace || Shaanxi || 3\n|-\n| Western Xia Mausoleums || Ningxia || 3\n|-\n|Nihewan\n|Hebei\n|4\n|-\n|Zhaowangcheng\n|Hebei\n|4\n|-\n|Yecheng\n|Hebei\n|4\n|-\n|Shangjing of Liao\n|Inner Mongolia\n|4\n|-\n|Anji Ancient City\n|Zhejiang\n|4\n|-\n|Lingjiatan\n|Anhui\n|4\n|-\n|Chengcun Han City\n|Fujian\n|4\n|-\n|Marquisate of Haihun\n|Jiangxi\n|4\n|-\n|Yangshao\n|Henan\n|4\n|-\n|Erlitou\n|Henan\n|4\n|-\n|Zhengzhou Shang City\n|Henan\n|4\n|-\n|Qujialing\n|Hubei\n|4\n|-\n|Longwan\n|Hubei\n|4\n|-\n|Tanheli\n|Hunan\n|4\n|-\n|Jingjiang Princes' Palace and Mausoleums\n|Guangxi\n|4\n|-\n|Qiong Kiln\n|Sichuan\n|4\n|-\n|Shimao\n|Shaanxi\n|4\n|-\n|Tongwancheng\n|Shaanxi\n|4\n|-\n|Qianling Mausoleum\n|Shaanxi\n|4\n|}\nCandidate parks\nIn addition to the approved parks, the SACH has also given a number of parks the status of \"candidate national archaeological parks\".
