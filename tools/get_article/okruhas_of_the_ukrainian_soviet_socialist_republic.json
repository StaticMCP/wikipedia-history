The system was intended as a transitional system between the Russian Imperial division of governorates and the modern equivalent of oblasts.\nAs a literal translation, the word okruha means vicinity or neighborhood (sharing a root with the words \"circle\" and \"around\", a close equivalent is the German term ). This level of subdivision is roughly equivalent to that of a county, parish, or borough. Okruhas were first established in 1918 when the Polissia Okruha and Taurida Okruha were created as temporary territories of the Ukrainian State of 1918.\nHistory\nFormation\nFirst okruhas, created just before 1918, were Polissia Okruha centered in Mozyr and Taurida Okruha centered in Berdiansk. Okruhas were first introduced on a widespread scale on April 12, 1923, at the 2nd session of the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine which accepted the declaration \"About the administrative-territorial division of Ukraine\". According to the declaration, the Ukrainian SSR was divided into 53 okruhas that included 706 raions, thus replacing the imperial division consisting of 102  (counties) that included 1989 volosts.\nReorganization of 1923–1926\n* September 25, 1923 Bohodukhiv Okruha changed name to Okhtyrka Okruha after transferring the okruha seat from Bohodukhiv to Okhtyrka\n* March 7, 1924 Moldavian Autonomous Oblast was created out of Balta Okruha and Odesa Okruha of Odesa Governorate and Tulchyn Okruha of Podolia Governorate centered in the city of Balta\n* June 6, 1924 Yuzivka Okruha changed name to Stalino Okruha after the okruha seat changed name from Yuzivka to Stalino\n* August 7, 1924 Lysavethrad Okruha changed name to Zinovievsk Okruha after the okruha seat changed name from Lysavethrad to Zinovievsk\n* August 12, 1924 Bakhmut Okruha changed name to Artemivsk Okruha after the okruha seat changed name from Bakhmut to Artemivsk\n* October 1, 1924 Tahanrih (Taganrog) Okruha and Shakhty Okruha were transferred to the Russian SFSR\n* October 12, 1924 Moldavian Autonomous Oblast was transformed into the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic with the Ukrainian SSR\n* October 28, 1924 Malyn Okruha was liquidated\n* November 26, 1924 Balta Okruha was liquidated.\n* June 3, 1925 the Ukrainian Central Executive Committee accepted the decision \"About liquidation of governorates and transition to the three-level system of administration\", according to which governorates were becoming liquidated on August 1, 1925, while June 15, 1925 eight (8) okruhas were to be liquidated as well.
