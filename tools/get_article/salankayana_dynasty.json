      "text": "# Salankayana dynasty\n\nThe Salankayana (IAST: Śālaṇkāyana) dynasty of ancient India ruled a part of Andhra region in India from 300 to 440 CE. Their territory was located between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers. Their capital was located at Vengi, modern Pedavegi near Eluru in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.\nSalankayana is a Brahmin Sage.\nTheir name is derived from their symbol and gotra name, which stood for Nandi (the bull of Shiva).\nThe Salankayanas succeeded the Andhra Ikshvaku dynasty and were vassals of the Pallava kings of southern India. During their time the script for Telugu began to clearly separate from that of the other South Indian and North Indian languages. Hastivarman, the first king, was one of the many kings who were defeated by Samudragupta, but were later released and paid him tribute.\nThe verse from the Allahabad stone pillar inscription of Samudragupta which mentions Hastivarma:\n* (Lines 19–20) Whose magnanimity blended with valour was caused by (his) first capturing, and thereafter showing the favour of releasing, all the kings of Dakshiṇāpatha such as Mahēndra of Kōsala, Vyāghrarāja of Mahākāntāra, Maṇṭarāja of Kurāḷa, Mahēndragiri of Pishṭapura, Svāmidatta of Kōṭṭūra, Damana of Ēraṇḍapalla, Vishṇugōpa of Kāñchī, Nīlarāja of Avamukta, Hastivarman of Vēṅgī, Ugrasēna of Pālakka, Kubēra of Dēvarāshṭra, and Dhanañjaya of Kusthalapura.\nIn the late 5th century, the Salankayanas were conquered by Madhava Varma II of the Vishnukundinas.\nInscriptions\nHastivarman dedicated land grants to Jayasarman as mentioned in his Urlam plates.\nList of kings\n#Devavarma\n#Hastiverma\n#Nandi Verma\n#Vijayadeva Verma\n#Vijayanandi Verma\nSee also\n*Telugu Brahmins\n*Telugu-Kannada script\n*Kadamba script\n*Bhattiprolu script\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*"
