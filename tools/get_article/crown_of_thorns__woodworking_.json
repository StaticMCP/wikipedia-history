      "text": "# Crown of Thorns (woodworking)\n\nThe Crown of Thorns (puzzle work) is a woodworking technique of tramp art using interlocking wooden pieces that are notched to intersect at right angles forming joints and self-supporting objects, objects that have a \"prickly\" and transparent quality.  Common examples include wreath-shaped picture frames that look similar to Jesus' \"crown of thorns\".\nLarger-scale crowns may use the principles of tensegrity structures, where the wooden sticks provide rigidity and separate cables in tension carry the forces that hold them together.\nSee also\n*Burr puzzle - similar structures meant as puzzles to assemble\n*sailor work\n*interlocking woodwork\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.littleshavers.com/Whimseys.html Whittled Whimseys website with information about making a crown-of-thorns wreaths.]"
