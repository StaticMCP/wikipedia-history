Constituting the Royal Stables (an institution employing hundreds of people at the time of Louis XIV's installation at Versailles), they were built in 1672.\nDeemed too small, they were quickly replaced in the 1680s by the Petite Écurie and the Grande Écurie of the Place d'Armes. They were then offered to the Queen and became the '''Queen's Stables'''.\nThey are now occupied by the Versailles Court of Appeal.\nThey were listed as a historic monument in 1978.\nSee also\n*\n* Petite Écurie\n* Grande Écurie\n* Galerie des Carrosses\nReferences"
