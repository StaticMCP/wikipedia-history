It is situated 3.5 miles due west of Mount Huethawali, within a meander of the Colorado River. It towers over  directly above the river, providing rafters a view of this landmark. Explorers Monument is topped by rock of the Pennsylvanian-Permian Supai Group which overlays cliff-forming Mississippian Redwall Limestone, which in turn overlays Cambrian Tonto Group. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Explorers Monument is located in a cold semi-arid climate zone.\nHistory\nExplorers Monument was originally named \"Marcos Monument\" by George Wharton James because it adjoins Marcos Terrace, which is named for Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan friar and explorer. Subsequently, the United States Geological Survey proposed and in 1908 officially adopted the name \"Explorers Monument\" to honor Grand Canyon explorers Joseph Christmas Ives, George Wheeler, Edward Beale, Almon Thompson, and John Newberry.\nSee also\n* Geology of the Grand Canyon area\n* History of the Grand Canyon area\nGallery\nFile:Explorers Mon AZ.jpg\nFile:The Grand Canyon from about 30,000 feet.jpg|Explorers Monument centered near bottom within meander.
