He is generally considered to be the last recognized king of the Gupta Empire. His reign lasted 10 years, from 540 to 550 CE. From the fragment of his clay sealing discovered at Nalanda during the excavations of 1927–28, it is revealed that he was the son of Kumaragupta III and the grandson of Narasimhagupta.\nThe last (the Damodarpur copper-plate inscription), in which he makes a land grant in the area of Kotivarsha (Bangarh in West Bengal) in 542/543 CE. This follows the occupation of most of northern and central India by the Aulikara ruler Yashodharman circa 532 CE.\nBiography\nAccording to a Nalanda seal,  Vishnugupta was son of Kumaragupta III, and grandson of Purugupta.\nFile:Nalanda clay seal of Vishnugupta.jpg|Nalanda clay seal of Vishnugupta. The seal states that Vishnugupta was son of Kumaragupta III, and grandson of Purugupta.\nFile:Damodarpur copper plate of Vishnugupta Year 224 = 542-543 CE.jpg|The Damodarpur copper plate of Vishnugupta Year 224 = 542-543 CE.\nHe later produced coins that were even more debased and heavier than before, bearing the title “Candraditya.” His seal was discovered at Nalanda, and a copper plate, the fifth Damodarpur plate dated to year 224 (which corresponds to 543 to 544 A.D.), may also originate from his reign. Although this copper plate does not include his name, it still grants him the full range of imperial honors. He is considered the last ruler of the imperial Gupta dynasty to use the customary imperial titles and to issue gold coinage. However, his realm was only a remnant of the once vast empire. After his rule, around 550 to 551 A.D, the Gupta dynasty completely disappeared from power, marking the end of 231 years of Gupta dominance over Magadha.\nSee also\n* Magadha\n* Later Gupta dynasty\nReferences"
