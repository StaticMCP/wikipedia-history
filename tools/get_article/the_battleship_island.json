The film reunites Hwang Jung-min with Ryoo Seung-wan, who directed the 2015 hit movie Veteran starring Hwang. Production cost about five times more than the average locally produced film due to the massive lifelike sets. While the island provided the inspiration for the plot, The Battleship Island was not filmed on location. The sets were built in Chuncheon and were designed to resemble the conditions of Hashima Island's community and mines during the 1940s.\nRelease\nThe Battleship Island was first promoted at the European Film Market in February 2017 and then at the Cannes Film Festival in May. As of June 2017, it has been sold to 113 countries, including North American countries as well as France, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Malaysia, Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand. On June 16, 2017, an official press conference was held at the National Museum of Korea to launch the film.\nThe film was invited to compete at 2017 Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia in Spain. The film was shown in the Orbita section for introducing most notable films of the year and honouring a title chosen by the jury composed of audiences. This is the sixth film by director Ryoo Seung-wan to be selected for a screening at this film festival.\nSpecial screenings\nOn July 25, 2017, a special pre-screening was held for foreign diplomats in South Korea.\nOn July 28, 2017, a special screening was held for UNESCO officials and diplomats in Paris at the headquarters of Metropolitan Filmexport. The aim was to raise awareness into the hidden history of Hashima Island and shed light on the harsh labour and living conditions imposed upon Koreans at the underground coal mining factory on the island during Japan's rule of Korea.\nBox office\nThe film was released on 26 July 2017 in South Korea.

In response, director Ryoo Seung-wan said \"the film is a fact-based fiction\" based on historical records as well as first hand testimony from survivors regarding their lack of payments, abusive treatment, and working conditions which lead to deaths of laborers from diseases, malnutrition, and accidents. The writer-director said the film was not made to stoke Korean nationalism or anti-Japanese sentiment but to show \"how war can make man a monster\".\nIn South Korea, there was criticism that the film reflected a '[pro-Japanese]' colonialist view of history () because it reduced war crimes to cinematic entertainment, and it emphasized the acts of betrayal committed by Koreans on behalf of the Japanese-colonial government.\nJapanese historical revisionism\nIn its application to UNESCO for World Heritage status for Hashima Island, Japan acknowledged that Korean and Chinese forced laborers were used there during World War II. The acknowledgement, which was only made after South Korea opposed the bid, stated \"large number[s] of Koreans and others [...] were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites [including Hashima island]\". However, once Hashima Island was approved as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2015, the Japanese reverted to whitewashing history. Two months later Fumio Kishida, then-Japanese Foreign Minister, contradicted the earlier acknowledgement that forced laborers were used at Hashima by saying that \"[forced to work under harsh conditions] by the Japanese government representative did not mean forced labor\". Although UNESCO's World Heritage Committee stipulated that a monitoring mechanism to measure the degree to which the victims of Hashima Island are remembered be a prerequisite for the successful bid, the island's official tourism website and tour program - operated by Nagasaki City - makes no mention of forced laborers and currently does not make any efforts to comply with UNESCO's requirement.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://gunhamdo2017.co.kr/ Official Website]\n*\n*\n*[http://movie.daum.net/moviedb/main?movieId=100359/The Battleship Island] at Daum\n*[http://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/basic.nhn?code=146506/The Battleship Island] at Naver Movies\n*[http://www.movist.com/movist3d/movie.asp?mid=48316/The Battleship Island] at Movist"
