The ceremony was hosted by broadcaster Bill Walker.\nWith the goal of broadening public awareness of the awards, the organizers moved the ceremony back into a theatre, with a section reserved for the general public. They also initiated the enormously popular Film Award Week which allowed the public to join the international jury in screening the nominated films. After reviewing 125 entries, the judges presented the international jury with 65 nominees. Cinepix Film Properties withdrew the films Love in a Four Letter World and ''Here and Now (L'Initiation) after an article in Time'' implied that the jury was unsympathetic to the films' sexual content. Jean Pierre Lefebvre threatened to withdraw the film Q-Bec My Love if the Ontario Censor Board did not withdraw its demand for the film's explicit sexuality to be edited; provincial cabinet minister James Auld intervened to dissuade the board from insisting on the cuts.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Film of the Year: Psychocratie (To See or Not to See) - National Film Board of Canada, Robert Verrall and Wolf Koenig producers, Břetislav Pojar director\n*Feature Film: 'Goin' Down the Road - Evdon Films, Donald Shebib producer and director\n*Film Under 30 Minutes: Blake - National Film Board of Canada, Douglas Jackson producer, Bill Mason director\n*Film Over 30 Minutes: A Matter of Fat' - National Film Board of Canada, Desmond Dew producer, William Weintraub director\n*Documentary Under 30 Minutes: KW+ - Onyx Films, Hydro-Québec, Aimée Danis director\n*Documentary Over 30 Minutes: The Nature of Things: Wild Africa - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, William Banting and John Livingston producers and directors\n*Animated: Psychocratie (To See or Not to See) - National Film Board of Canada, Robert Verrall and Wolf Koenig producers, Břetislav Pojar director\n*Arts and Experimental: Legend - National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, Rick Raxlen director\n*TV Drama: Not awarded\n*TV Information: A Little Fellow from Gambo - The Joey Smallwood Story - National Film Board of Canada, Julian Biggs producer and director\n*Travel and Recreation: 'The Sun Don't Shine on the Same Dawg's Back All the Time - Crawley Films, F.
