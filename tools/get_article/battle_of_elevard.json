The Byzantine army decisively defeated the Sasanian army and killed their commander.\nDuring the first invasion of Byzantium, after the capture of Dara, the army of the Persian commander Dzuan Veh moved into Byzantine Armenia. The Byzantine commander Germanus advanced to his location and the two armies met at Elevard (near Yerevan). There was a fierce battle, during which the Persian army was defeated and their commander died. Due to the battle, the Persian offensive was halted, and only one year later would the Sassanians be able to continue their invasion.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nNotes"
