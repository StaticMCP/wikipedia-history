Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nHistory\nThe award for Best Global Music Performance, reserved for international performers exhibiting \"non-European, indigenous traditions\", was first presented at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, held on January 31, 2022.

(In 2020, its name was changed to Best Global Music Album)\nBeginning with the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in 2024, a sister category, Best African Music Performance, was established to specifically honor the work of African artists.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=82%\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022\n| Arooj Aftab\n| \"Mohabbat\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023\n| Wouter Kellerman, Zakes Bantwini & Nomcebo Zikode\n| \"Bayethe\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2024\n| Béla Fleck, Edgar Meyer & Zakir Hussain featuring Rakesh Chaurasia\n| \"Pashto\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025\n| Sheila E. featuring Gloria Estefan & Mimy Succar\n| \"Bemba Colorá\"\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2026\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nArtists with multiple nominations\n;4 nominations\n* Arooj Aftab\n* Angélique Kidjo\n;3 nominations\n* Burna Boy\n* Anoushka Shankar\n;2 nominations\n* Rocky Dawuni\nSee also\n* Awards for world music\n* List of cultural and regional genres of music\n* List of Grammy Award categories\nReferences\n;General\n*  Note: User must select the \"World\" category as the genre under the search feature.\n;Specific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com/ Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
