During a king walk, the king may travel along its own side of the board (from  to , or vice versa) to reach a safer position. Alternatively, it may travel up the board, often involved in a  against the opposing king.\nActivating the king before the endgame is a highly unusual occurrence; before the endgame, the safety of the king is considered paramount, and players are recommended to keep it out of harm's way. In contrast, Wilhelm Steinitz, often known as the father of modern chess, was renowned for his maxim that \"the king is a fighting piece\". Dutch chess historian and author Tim Krabbé has documented over one hundred such games.\nBecause of the rarity of such tactics, those that reap rewards for the attacking player often have  bestowed upon them. Perhaps the most famous in recent history, where Nigel Short defeated Jan Timman in Tilburg in 1991, was voted as one of the hundred greatest chess games in a list compiled by master Graham Burgess, and grandmasters John Nunn and John Emms.\nExample games\n* Short vs. Timman, Tilburg 1991. Alekhine Defense: Modern, Alburt Variation (B04), . Short ties up Timman's pieces and his king can advance.\n* Alekhine vs. Yates, London 1922. Queen's Gambit Declined: Orthodox Defense, Main Line (D64), . Alekhine conjures up an attack in the endgame, and his king joins the fray.\nSee also\n* Chess tactics\n* King hunt &ndash; where the king is involuntarily chased up the board by the opponent and often checkmated\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1001225 \"His Majesty steps out\"] capanegra, Chessgames.com"
