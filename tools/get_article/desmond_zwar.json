He studied at Scotch College, Melbourne, graduating in 1949.\nHe worked for the Border Mail in Albury, New South Wales, and The Herald (now the Herald Sun) in Melbourne. He was a reporter, foreign correspondent, feature writer and acting features editor of the Daily Mail in London for 11 years. Having previously lived near Cairns in Queensland, he resided in Beechworth until his death in 2022.\nZwar was most famous for conducting an interview over several years with imprisoned Nazi leader Rudolf Hess.\nThat gained international attention because Zwar persuaded Hess to admit that he had been part of the planning team for the invasion of the Soviet Union. The imminent invasion was what had convinced Hess to try, at the last moment, to seek an alliance with Britain against Bolshevism by flying to Scotland in 1941.\nZwar's son, Adam Zwar, is an actor in Australia.\nDeath\nDesmond Zwar died on 27 April 2022, aged 90.\nBooks by Desmond Zwar\n* The Infamous of Nuremberg, Written For Col.Burton C Andrus, Published in 1969 By Coward-McCann, US, Leslie Frewin, UK; And in Several European Countries.\n* This Wonderful World of Golf, With Peter Thomson, Published in 1969 By Pelham Books, UK. .\n* The Loneliest Man in the World: the inside story of the 30-year imprisonment of Rudolf Hess.
