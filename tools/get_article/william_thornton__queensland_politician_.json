After doing his schooling in Dungannon he attended Trinity College, Dublin but left after a short time. Having a boyish passion for the sea, he found work as a Mercantile Marine with the East India Company, which disappointed his father, who had wanted him to become a solicitor.\nWhile working for the company he made a trip to Sydney and back on board a merchantman before the company's charter expired. Thornton returned to Ireland for a short time before once again setting out for Sydney. After working as a public servant for the New South Wales Government, he joined his cousin who was taking stock to South Australia with the journey taking four months. After returning to New South Wales, Thornton became a squatter  in the Wellington area.\nIn 1853 he returned to Ireland only to be back in Australia two years later. Back in Australia, Thornton resumed work as a public servant and was transferred to Moreton Bay as a Collector of Customs for the New South Wales Government. Upon Queensland's separation in 1859, he was Collector of Customs for the Queensland Government and worked in this role till 1882.\nPolitics\nThornton was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council on the 26 September 1866. He served for thirteen years before being forced to resign on the 8 September 1879 due to still being a public servant.\nThornton resigned as Collector of Customs in 1882 and was once again appointed to the Council. He served until his death on the 27 June 1884.\nPersonal life\nIn 1842, Thornton married Ellen Buttenshaw at Molong, New South Wales. Thornton died at Kangaroo Point in 1884 and was buried in South Brisbane Cemetery.\nReferences"
