Despite finishing with a 34–48 record the previous season, the Warriors received the third overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft, and selected shooting guard Penny Hardaway from the University of Memphis, but soon traded him to the Orlando Magic in exchange for power forward, and top draft pick Chris Webber from the University of Michigan; Webber was selected as the first overall pick in the draft by the Magic. During the off-season, the team signed free agent Avery Johnson.\nWithout All-Star guard Tim Hardaway and sixth man Šarūnas Marčiulionis, who both missed the entire regular season due to knee injuries, and with Chris Mullin missing the first 20 games of the season with a finger injury, the Warriors struggled losing three of their first four games, but soon recovered later holding a 27–20 record at the All-Star break. The team improved over the previous season as they posted an 8-game winning streak in April, and finished in third place in the Pacific Division with a solid 50–32 record, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and returning to the NBA playoffs after a one-year absence.\nSecond-year star Latrell Sprewell averaged 21.0 points, 4.7 assists and 2.2 steals per game, led the Warriors with 141 three-point field goals, and was named to the All-NBA First Team, and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team, while Webber averaged 17.5 points, 9.1 rebounds and 2.2. blocks per game, and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year, and was also named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team. In addition, Mullin played half of the regular season off the bench, averaging 16.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while Billy Owens provided the team with 15.0 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, and Johnson contributed 10.9 points and 5.3 assists per game. Meanwhile, Victor Alexander averaged 8.7 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, Chris Gatling provided with 8.2 points and 4.8 rebounds per game, Jeff Grayer contributed 6.8 points per game, and second-year guard Keith Jennings contributed 5.7 points and 2.9 assists per game.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Sprewell was selected for the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team; it was his first ever All-Star appearance. Meanwhile, Webber was selected for the inaugural NBA Rookie Game, as a member of the Phenoms team; Webber scored 18 points along with 10 rebounds, as the Phenoms defeated the Sensations team, 74–68.\nSprewell also finished in second place in Most Improved Player voting, and also finished tied in eleventh place in Most Valuable Player voting, while head coach Don Nelson finished tied in fifth place in Coach of the Year voting. However, in the Western Conference First Round of the 1994 NBA playoffs, the Warriors were swept by the Phoenix Suns in three straight games; this would be their final playoff appearance until 2007.\nFollowing the season, Marčiulionis and second-year forward Byron Houston were both traded to the Seattle SuperSonics, and Johnson re-signed as a free agent with his former team, the San Antonio Spurs.\nOffseason\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n!
