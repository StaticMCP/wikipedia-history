Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 3, 1797, two weeks before the beginning of the second year of the administration of Governor Gunning Bedford Sr. After his death on September 18, 1797, Daniel Rogers inherited the position.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Daniel Rogers, Sussex County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Stephen Lewis, Kent County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Archibald Alexander\n*John James\n*Alexander Porter Jr.\n|\n:Kent County\n*George Cummins\n*Isaac Davis\n*Joseph Miller\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Nathaniel Hayes\n*George Mitchell\n*Daniel Rogers\n|}\nHouse of Representatives\nRepresentatives were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Robert Armstrong\n*Joel Lewis\n*Robert Maxwell\n*Elias Naudain Sr.\n*Caesar Augustus Rodney\n*James Stroud\n*Nehemiah Tilton\n|\n:Kent County\n*Manlove Emerson\n*Stephen Lewis\n*William Morris\n*James Raymond\n*Nicholas Ridgely\n*William Sorden\n*William Warner\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Robert Burton\n*David Owens\n*Samuel Paynter\n*Thomas Sorden\n*Woodman Stockley\n*William H.
