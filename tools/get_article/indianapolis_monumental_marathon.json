The marathon was first held in 2008 and also includes a half marathon and 5K run. In 2015, it claimed to have become one of the 20 largest marathons in the U.S. Since 2016, it has been the only full fall marathon run in Indianapolis.\nHistory\nThe Monumental Marathon was established by Carlton Ray in 2008. Just over 1,100 runners completed the race's inaugural running, while almost 2,000 completed the race the following year. Nearly 3,000 runners completed the half marathon in 2009. Beginning in 2010, a 5k race was offered as well. In 2014, Runners World named the race as one of the nine best, new U.S. marathons.\nIn 2015, the Monumental Marathon purchased the Indianapolis Marathon and converted it into a half marathon the following year, operating it as the Indy Half Marathon at Fort Ben. Prior to the purchase, the Monumental Marathon was reported to be in the top 25 marathons in the United States.\nIn 2016, the CNO Financial Group became the primary sponsor of the Monumental Marathon, which became known officially as the CNO Financial Group Indianapolis Monumental Marathon.\nIn 2017, Jed Cornforth was appointed as executive director of the event, replacing the prior director, Blake Boldon, who left the event to direct the Drake Relays.\n.]]\nThe 2020 in-person edition of the race was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, with all registrants given the option of running the race virtually or transferring their entry to 2021. An e-mail address was provided for registrants to request a refund, without any additional details regarding a refund policy.\nCourse\nThe course for the Monumental Marathon begins and ends near the Indiana Statehouse in downtown Indianapolis. The Monumental Half Marathon is run concurrently with the full marathon. The two races follow identical routes for the first six or so miles, split, then re-converge for the last  of the course.\nWinners\nKey: Course record\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n!Year\n!Male\n!Time\n!Female\n!Time\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Rf.\n|-\n|2008\n|Richard Kandie\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:22:24\n|Zeddy Chepkoech\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:40:28\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Mathew Chesang\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:21:00\n|Molly Brown-Boulay\n|3:07:28\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Leornard Mucheru\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:17:58\n|Jackie Dikos\n|2:45:25\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Hillary Cheruiyot\n|2:22:20\n|Mandy Grantz\n|2:42:36\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Aleksey Alexandrova\n|2:18:44\n|Whitney Bevins-Lazzara\n|2:45:23\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|David Tuwei\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:16:40\n|Colleen Dereuck\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:39:22\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Michael Eaton\n|2:19:38\n|Alana Hadley\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:38:34\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Jesse Davis\n|2:17:59\n|Nicole Michmerhuizen\n|2:41:37\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Japhet Kipkoech\n|2:18:30\n|Andie Cozzarelli\n|2:38:47\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Japhet Kipkoech (2)\n|2:18:34\n|Laura Portis\n|2:41:35\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Aaron Fletcher\n|2:17:23\n|Laurie Knowles\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:37:50\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Nate Guthals\n|2:17:15\n|Dot McMahan\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:35:36\n|\n|-\n|2020\n| colspan=\"4\" |Event cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Ian Carter\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:16:24\n|Christina Murphy\n|2:37:57\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Jacob Heslington\n|2:18:56\n|Jennifer Pope\n|2:37:22\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|Lyle O'Brien\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:15:39\n|Rachel Hannah\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:35:12\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Austin Nolan\n|2:16:30\n|Lindsey Bradley\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:31:46\n|\n|-\n|2025\n|Joseph Whelan\n|bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\"|2:12:28\n|Amanda Mosborg\n|2:32:00\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Sports in Indianapolis\n* List of attractions and events in Indianapolis\n* List of marathon races in North America\nReferences"
