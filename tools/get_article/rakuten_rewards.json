Its revenue comes from affiliate network links. Members of the site click through affiliate links before shopping at a retailer's site.\nHistory\nRakuten Rewards was founded as Ebates in 1998 in Menlo Park, California, by two former deputy district attorneys, Alessandro Isolani and Paul Wasserman. Funded by the venture capital firm Foundation Capital, Ebates.com was launched on 3 May 1999, offering up to 25% cash back from about 40 online retailers.\nIn September 2014, Ebates was acquired by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten for US$1 billion. In 2019, the Ebates brand was phased out and replaced with Rakuten Rewards.\nAcquisitions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Date\n!Company\n!Business\n!Country\n!References\n|-\n|8 September 2011\n|FatWallet\n|Comparison shopping site\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|9 August 2012\n|BFAds\n|Coupons site\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|8 September 2012\n|AnyCoupons\n|Coupons site\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|22 June 2012\n|OneReceipt\n|Receipt digitization service\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|10/12/2012\n|PushPins\n|Coupons mobile site\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|25 June 2013sold 6 December 2017\n|Extrabux\n|Comparison shopping site\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|7 March 2016\n|Shopular\n|Product discovery mobile app\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|23 January 2017\n|Cartera Commerce\n|Rewards program provider\n|United States\n|\n|-\n|3 April 2017\n|ShopStyle (and Cosmic Cart)\n|Fashion discovery site\n|United States\n|\n|}\nServices/tools\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Description\n!References\n|-\n|Mobile app\n|Free application for Android and iOS allows users to shop and earn cash back on mobile devices.\n|\n|-\n|Hotels\n|Users can book hotels to earn cash back.\n|\n|-\n|Cash Back Button\n|Browser extension for Google Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari, Alerts users to cash-back possibilities on store sites and highlights offers in Google and Bing search results.\n|\n|-\n|Marketplace\n|Formerly located at Rakuten.com, the marketplace is an e-commerce site where users can buy goods from third-party sellers.\n|\n|-\n|In-Store Cash Back\n|Users can earn cash back in stores by adding a credit or debit card to their accounts and using that card to pay in stores.\n|\n|}\nLogos\nFile:Ebates Logo 2017.svg|2017\nFile:Ebates Logo 2018.svg|2018\nFile:Ebates Logo 2019.svg|2019 (US, before renaming)\nFile:Ebates.ca Logo 2019.svg|2019 (Canada, before renaming)\nFile:Rakuten Global Brand Logo.svg|2019 (US and Canada, after renaming)\nReferences"
