The Sámi in Finland were assimilated through a policy of individual equality without group rights, which led to declining participation in Sámi traditions and the gradual erosion of their culture. The history of the Sámi is deeply entangled with colonialism and imperialism, particularly since the 1970s. Finland has often adopted an exceptionalist narrative, distancing itself from colonial histories and avoiding inclusion in related discussions. However, Nordic countries are embedded in broader European colonial structures shaped by capitalism and exploitation. As a result, they have internalized a European \"superiority complex\" that continues to reproduce colonial ideologies.\nColonial economic systems racialized the Sámi to justify their subjugation. These systems created racial hierarchies that positioned certain groups as superior and others as inferior. The Sámi became subjects of this logic. In Finland, racial classification originally placed Finns themselves as inferior due to supposed Asian origins. Yet, despite this, Finns adopted similar racial hierarchies when relating to minority groups—particularly the Sámi. This contradiction reflects Finland’s complex colonial history. While Finland experienced subordination under Sweden and Russia, it also played an active role in colonizing Sámi lands—long before becoming an independent nation-state. Scholars describe this as “colonial complicity,” highlighting Finland’s dual role—not as a dominant imperial power, but not simply a victim of colonialism either.\nComparative Context: U.S. and Settler Colonialism\nThe Sámi experience in Finland shares structural parallels with settler colonial systems in other contexts, such as the United States. In both cases, Indigenous peoples have been subjected to land dispossession, cultural assimilation, and racial hierarchies designed to legitimize state control over territories. Scholars of settler colonialism, such as Patrick Wolfe, describe this structure as “a logic of elimination,” wherein Indigenous presence is treated as an obstacle to state sovereignty and capitalist development. Similar to Native American communities in the U.S., the Sámi have faced government policies that undermine collective land rights, restrict language use, and marginalize traditional lifeways. Indigenous resistance movements throughout settler colonial regimes are in line with contemporary Sámi attempts to reclaim cultural and political sovereignty, notably through art, legal reform, and transnational action.\nRacial Hierarchies and Colonial Complicity\nFinnish institutions exercised colonial power by constructing and reinforcing racial distinctions. Scientists continued this practice into the 1960s and 1970s by measuring Sámi physical features to legitimize racial hierarchies. Although the Nordic world once considered Finns racially inferior compared to Swedes or Norwegians, Finnish society still imposed racial classifications on the Sámi. This dual positioning—as once-racialized subjects and active racializers—illustrates the layered nature of Finnish colonialism. These racialized power structures continue to shape Finnish-Sámi relations today. The legacy of colonial classification and marginalization contributes to ongoing inequalities and impedes Sámi self-determination.\nPersistent Colonial Formations\nThe experience of Sámi communities in Finland can be situated within what scholars term imperial formations—an ongoing, uneven process of decimation, displacement, and relations of force that extend beyond traditional definitions of empire. Rather than a single historical event, colonial presence in Sápmi remains active and dynamic, continuously shaping access to power, resources, and cultural self-determination. These formations manifest through gradated sovereignty, in which certain groups—such as the Sámi—are subject to differential access to land rights, political voice, and state recognition.\nStatus of Sámi languages in Finland\nDespite the absence of official bans, the Sámi in Finland have faced persistent challenges in using their own language. In 1995, Finland amended its Constitution to recognize the Sámi as an Indigenous group and guarantee their right to preserve their language and culture.[https://nasco.int/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CNL2380_Nuorgam-NASCO-Indigenous-Perspectives-SS.pdf ] The Sámi Parliament, established in 1973, plays a key role in representing Sámi interests. Authorities must consult the Sámi Parliament on major issues that affect Sámi communities. The Parliament promotes Sámi language and culture and advocates for Indigenous rights, although it holds no legislative or executive power.\n[https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/the-sami-act-/id449701/ The Sámi Act], introduced in 1987, aimed to strengthen the use of Sámi in official settings by allowing its use in communication with public authorities. However, Finland continues to struggle with fully linking linguistic rights to the Sámi right to self-determination—a gap that raises serious human rights concerns. Scholars and human rights bodies have urged the Finnish government to take greater responsibility in protecting Sámi rights.\nHuman Rights, Environmental Threats, and Uneven Sovereignty\nFinland’s cultural policy framework has generated several human rights concerns, particularly regarding the Sámi. Cultural rights include freedom from discrimination and the ability to participate in cultural life. For the Sámi in Finland, these rights are still not fully developed. The UN Human Rights Committee has previously emphasized that the Sámi Parliament enables internal self-determination and has called on Finland to revise the Sámi Parliament Act. In 2025, the Ministry of Education and Culture acknowledged the need to base cultural policy on cultural rights and to support Sámi self-determination by reforming the Sámi Parliament Act. The law granting Sámi cultural autonomy excludes provisions for land ownership. In 2024, the UN human rights committee ruled that Finland violated Sámi rights by issuing mineral exploration permits without conducting impact assessments. Following this, legal efforts began to ensure Indigenous rights are formally recognized, granting Sámi people the right to self-determination and control over their traditional lands.\nThe Challenge of Implementing Sámi Cultural Protection in Environmental Law\nThe Mining Act explicitly prohibits weakening Sámi culture, aligning with Sámi fundamental and human rights. Finland has codified this prohibition in its mining, environmental, and water legislation. Still, implementation remains a major challenge. Competing land uses - including mining, forestry, and infrastructure projects - threaten traditional Sámi livelihoods. Climate change further exacerbates these pressures. As a result, Sámi cultural landscapes and traditional knowledge face erosion from structural changes in Finnish society.[https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003220640-7/prohibition-weaken-s%C3%A1mi-culture-international-law-finnish-environmental-legislation-leena-hein%C3%A4m%C3%A4ki The prohibition to weaken the Sámi culture in international law and Fi]\nRatification of ILO 169 - Indigenous and Tribal peoples convention\nFinland has not ratified [https://normlex.ilo.org/dyn/nrmlx_en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:55:0::NO::P55_TYPE,P55_LANG,P55_DOCUMENT,P55_NODE:REV,en,C169,/Document ILO Convention 169], which seeks to strengthen the rights of the Sámi people. Adopted in 1989, this convention aims to recognise their right to self-determination and support the preservation and development of their identities, languages, and religions. It highlights the unique contributions of Indigenous and tribal peoples to cultural diversity, as well as social and ecological harmony. The Sámi Council has urged Finland to ratify the convention, emphasizing that doing so would enhance efforts to revise legislation and fully guarantee the Sámi people's rights to their traditional lands in Finland.\nMetsähallitus (Park Service) and the State’s Role in Land Use\nApproximately 90% of the Sámi homeland in Finland is state-owned and managed by Metsähallitus the government agency responsible for forestry and land use. Over the decades, forestry operations have contributed to the erosion of Sámi culture and traditional livelihoods, particularly reindeer herding. The Reindeer Husbandry Act includes provisions that prohibit activities from significantly harming reindeer husbandry in designated areas, including the Sámi homeland. Under this legislation, Park Service is required to negotiate with the Sámi Parliament regarding land use decisions that may affect Sámi rights.\nHowever, the enforcement of impact assessments related to the prohibition on weakening Sámi culture has faced challenges. Neither mining authorities nor environmental protection agencies have developed a comprehensive system for cumulative impact assessment. The Sámi Parliament has expressed concerns that forestry activities continue to threaten the sustainability of both the environment and Sámi cultural practices.[https://lacris.ulapland.fi/ws/portalfiles/portal/36790144/The_prohibition_to_weaken_the_Sami_culture.pdf ]\nRacism and Structural Violence\nThe Sámi have a long history of experiencing racism and continue to face racial discrimination today. Historically, their existence has been challenged through racial research that sought to categorize or diminish their identity, as well as through efforts to suppress their language and cultural practices. The Sámi continue to encounter discrimination in various forms. Hate crimes targeting the Sámi have been reported, particularly online, where they face harassment and racist rhetoric. Additionally, acts of violence against their way of life have occurred, including the deliberate killing of reindeer - a vital part of Sámi culture and livelihood. These incidents reflect broader issues of prejudice and systemic discrimination that persist despite legal protections for Sámi rights.\nPostcolonial Frameworks\nThe historical and contemporary experiences of the Sámi people in Finland have been analyzed through postcolonial theoretical frameworks. Scholars have drawn parallels between the Sámi situation and broader critiques of colonialism, particularly in relation to state policies that promote national unity while limiting Indigenous self-determination and cultural autonomy. Frantz Fanon, in The Wretched of the Earth, critiques the enduring impact of European colonialism and cautions against adopting European models of modernity without critical reflection. Some scholars argue that Fanon's observations resonate with the Sámi context, where state-led nation-building efforts have emphasized formal equality while limiting group rights and suppressing cultural distinctiveness.\nFanon’s call to “stop following in Europe’s footsteps” has been compared to Sámi resistance to assimilationist policies and development frameworks grounded in Eurocentric perspectives. Within the Nordic context, critics have noted a reluctance by Finland to acknowledge its colonial involvement, despite its international reputation as a promoter of human rights.\nDecolonization efforts: Duodji\nDuodji, the traditional Sámi practice of craftsmanship and cultural expression, has become a significant medium for articulating Sámi identity in contemporary contexts. While historically associated with functional art and everyday tools, duodji also conveys Indigenous knowledge systems and cultural continuity. In recent years, Sámi artists and activists have used duodji and other creative practices to explore themes related to identity, cultural preservation, and political autonomy. Some scholars have described these artistic expressions as responses to colonial representations of Sámi culture and as critiques of institutional frameworks that have marginalized Indigenous perspectives. In parallel, counter-discourses have emerged in parts of northern Finland questioning Sámi identity and territorial claims, contributing to ongoing debates over recognition and sovereignty. The [https://www.saamicouncil.net/en/the-sami-duodji-certificate Sámi Duodji Association] (Sámi Duodji ry) plays a role in protecting the authenticity of duodji by certifying its production, aiming to safeguard it against cultural appropriation and misrepresentation.\nReferences"
