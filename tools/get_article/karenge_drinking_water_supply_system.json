The system supplies water to parts of the capital city of Kigali and the neighboring Rwamagana District.\nLocation\nThe water treatment and distribution facility is located in the lakeside community of Karenge, Rwamagana District, in the Eastern Province of Rwanda, on the shores of Lake Mugesera, approximately , by road, southeast of the city of Kigali, the national capital.\nOverview\nKDWSS was established in 1975 with processing capacity of  every day. In 1985, that capacity was increased to  daily. In 2008, daily output was increased to . As of October 2020, the system produced  of drinkable water every day, of which  (80 percent) was piped to Kigali and  (20 percent) was distributed within Rwamagana District.\nExpansion\nIn 2020 the government of Rwanda, through its subsidiary, Water and Sanitation Corporation (WASAC Limited), resolved to increase the processing capacity of this plant to  daily. The expansion involves:\n* Upgrading the raw water source\n* Construction of new raw water intake pumps\n* Upgrading the raw water intake pipes\n* Relocating the intake pumping station\n* Improving the capacity of the motors and pumps\n* Construction of new drinking water storage tanks\n* Expanding the drinking water transport and distribution network by laying  of new distribution pipes.\nConstruction and funding\nThe cost of expansion is budgeted at $164.3 million.
