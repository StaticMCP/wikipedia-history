Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 16,793 people.\nThe area is a stronghold for the Conservatives who have won at least half the seats at every election and held three of the ward's four seats between 2017 and 2022.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Ayr West was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former Ayr Doonfoot and Seafield, Ayr Fort and Ayr Rozelle wards as well as parts of the former Ayr Old Belmont ward, a small area from the former Ayr Craigie ward, an area in the west of the former Coylton and Minishant ward, the northern part of the former North Carrick and Maybole West and the southwestern part of the former Ayr Central ward. Despite its name, the ward centres on the southern portion of the town of Ayr which is situated on the Firth of Clyde coast in the northwest of the council area. It originally contained everything in the town south of the River Ayr, west of Carrick Road/Monument Road and south of the Rozelle Estate as well as an area north of the river around John Street. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's eastern boundary was amended west to run along the Glasgow South Western railway line.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Bill Grant(Conservative)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Mike Peddie(SNP)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Elaine Little(Labour/Independent/SNP)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Robin Reid(Conservative)\n|-\n!2008\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!February2012\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2012\n|Allan Dorans(SNP)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Kirsty Darwent(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Martin Dowey(Conservative)\n|Siobhian Brown(SNP)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Derek McCabe(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2|Lee Lyons(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|George Weir(SNP)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Bob Sheilds(Independent)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nReferences"
