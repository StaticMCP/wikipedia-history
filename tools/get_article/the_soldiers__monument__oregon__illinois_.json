It sits on the southeast side of the Old Ogle County Courthouse square.\nMonument\nDescription\nThe eyes are drawn to the centered white marble stairs which lead up to the main part of the monument. At the top of the stairs is the dominating feature of the installation. Taft's oversized Classical female figure stands with her arms outstretched, clutching a laurel wreath in each hand. Behind her is an exedra which was designed by the architects Pond and Pond. The exedra extends around the installation and to either side of the female sculpture are built-in benches. Above the benches are bronze plaques honoring veterans of the Civil War and the Spanish–American War; above the individual war plaques is bronze plating that reads, \"Ogle County Honors Her Sons.\" Flanking the dominant sculpture are two soldiers atop pedestals, one facing north and the other facing south. Tafts's soldiers were cut from marble obtained in the U.S. state of Georgia.\nThe Soldiers' Monument was constructed, on the approval of the Ogle County Board in 1916, for no more than $21,000. Today (2007), this example of the work of Lorado Taft is estimated to be worth over $1,000,000. sculpted the central female figure in bronze.]]\nInterpretation\nThe center female bronze figure, holding the laurel wreaths, represents America.
