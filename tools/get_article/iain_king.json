King was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours, for services to governance in Libya, Afghanistan and Kosovo.\nHe is a Scholar at the Modern War Institute, United States Military Academy at West Point, and a former Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and at Cambridge University.\nBiography\nAfter seven years work on the Northern Ireland peace process in the 1990s, Iain King held a senior political role in Kosovo’s UN Administration, and co-authored a book on the history of Kosovo and the difficulties of post-war state-building in the Balkans, called Peace at Any Price: How the World Failed Kosovo.\nHis 2008 book, How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong, starts with a history of moral philosophy and then develops a hybrid methodology for ethical decision-making. King's approach has been described as quasi-utilitarian, and credited with reconciling competing systems of ethics.\nSecrets of The Last Nazi, based on extensive research of the Nazi era, was King's debut novel, first published in 2015. A sequel followed in 2016.\nMaking Peace in War is about Afghanistan.\nKing has been featured as a foreign policy analyst on CNN and BBC, and has written for multiple outlets, many of them based in the US, including NBC, Defense One, Prospect, and National Interest.\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*King, Iain (2014).
