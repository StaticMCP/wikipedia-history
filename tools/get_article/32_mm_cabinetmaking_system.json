While not defined by any standardization body, it is in wide use globally, partly owing to IKEA using some of its elements in its furniture. Characteristic are the columns of  holes with centres at  intervals.\nSystem 32 enables reconfigurable placement and spacing of shelves, doors, drawers and hardware. Most significantly, it simplifies and harmonizes dimensions, production processes and products for fitting, machine and furniture manufacturers, enabling efficiency and cost reduction.\nProperties\nThe core features are:\n* Distance between hole centres in row:\n* Diameter of each hole:\n* Depth of each hole:\n* Shelf pin length:\n* Shelf pin flange diameter: about\n* Distance of first row from front edge:\nSystem 32 includes matching fittings, with which furniture sides may be secured to floors, walls, and adjacent cabinets. Other fittings are available for door bands, drawer guides, clothes racks, floor racks, and other features, and typically mount into one or more of the  holes otherwise used to support shelf brackets.\nAdvantages of the system include:\n* Distance from first hole to bottom side of cabinet equals the distance from last hole to top of cabinet. This simplifies setup of single row drilling machines\n* Distances between hole rows are multiples of . This facilitates assembly of drawer guides\n* Distance of rear hole row to rear edge may be . This obviates need to retool drilling machine\n* Distance of rear hole row to inner edge of back wall may be . This facilitates assembly of rear wall supports\nHistory\nAfter World War II, simplification and efficiency was pursued to help speed reconstruction of the vast number of buildings and property destroyed during the war. A spacing of  evolved because that was the closest multiple drill bits could be placed on a line boring machine due to the size of the gears then available.\nBesides the  system, there are other, although less frequently, used systems, such as system 25 and ip20.\nProprietary variants\nMultiple vendors sell products that may be used when applying system 32, including:\n* Blum's Process32 system\n* Bosch FSN 32\n* Festool Hole Guide System\n* Mafell DuoDoweler system\n* Rockler\n* True 32 system\n* Veritas 32 Cabinetmaking System\nSee also\n* Adjustable shelving\n* Euro container\n* Preferred metric sizes\n* Reusable packaging\n* Reverse logistics\nReferences\nGeneral references\n*\n*\n*\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://davelers.com/32mm/ Dave Lers 32mm Cabinetmaking]\n* [http://www.davelers.com/32mm/Basics/157.html Dave Lers 32mm System Basics]\n* [http://www.cabsystems.com/KISSII/KIIrivDe-mail.pdf KISS II system]\n* [http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base_images/ms/Process32_041204.pdf Blum Process 32] Universal Boring Pattern\n* [http://www.leevalley.com/us/html/05j0601ie.pdf Veritas 32 Cabinetmaking System]\n* [https://www.hettich.com/fileadmin/content/mediathek/TA_2011_02_en_CA.pdf Program Overview: System 32]"
