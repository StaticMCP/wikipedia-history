      "text": "# List of protests in the United Kingdom\n\nin 2008]]This is a list of protests and protest movements in the United Kingdom. Protest in the UK has concerned issues such as suffrage in the 19th and early 20th centuries, parliamentary reform from the Chartists to the present day, poverty, wages and working conditions, fuel prices, war, human rights, immigration (both for and against), fathers' rights, LGBTQ rights and climate change. In Northern Ireland, protest marches have been particularly contentious, including Bloody Sunday.\nAround April 2019 London's Metropolitan Police decided, as a matter of policy, to stop providing crowd estimates unless there were specific reasons to do so (criminal justice, national security). This policy appears to have been reversed in late 2023, with the media reporting official police estimates for crowds from October that year, as shown in the table.\nBy size\nEntries are sorted by the organisers’ estimate of attendance (descending).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" id=\"by attendance\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Protest\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Cause\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Organisers\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n! colspan=\"3\" | Attendance\n|-\n!
