He is known for his work in the development of mass arbitration and for litigating complex disputes against major corporations. Postman has been recognized by Law360, Chambers and Partners, the National Law Journal, and Lawdragon for his work on behalf of consumers and workers in large-scale litigation.\nEarly life and education\nPostman grew up on a farm in a small town in Vermont. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology, magna cum laude, from Brandeis University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he served as an articles editor of the Harvard Law Review.\nFollowing law school, Postman clerked for Judge William A. Fletcher of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and later for Justice David H. Souter of the Supreme Court of the United States. He spent time in China, where he met his wife.\nCareer\nEarly career\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Postman worked as a legislative aide to Massachusetts State Senator Steven A. Baddour. After completing his clerkships, he joined Jones Day in 2009 as an associate in the Issues and Appeals practice, where he worked on trial and appellate matters until 2014.\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce\nIn 2014, Postman became senior counsel for litigation at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Litigation Center, the litigation arm of the Chamber.

At the firm, he helped develop its arbitration practice, which represented consumers and workers subject to arbitration clauses. By filing large numbers of individual arbitration claims, the practice sought to hold corporate defendants to their contractual terms.

Norfolk Southern Railway Co. (2023), in which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of consent-by-registration statutes.\n* State of Texas v. Meta Platforms Inc.

The firm represents clients in motor vehicle accidents, trucking accidents, workplace injuries, workers’ compensation, medical malpractice, birth injury, wrongful death, product liability, and defective medical devices.\nSince its founding, Postman Law and its attorneys have recovered more than $3 billion for clients.\nNotable cases\n* Heckman v.
