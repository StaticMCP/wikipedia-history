The Council presided over the declaration of Georgia's independence from the Soviet Union in April 1991. The legislature split into rivaling factions and became defunct after a violent coup d'état ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in January 1992. A pro-Gamsakhurdia faction managed to convene for a few times in exile and again in Georgia during Gamsakhurdia's failed attempt to regain power later in 1993. The Supreme Council was succeeded – after a brief parliamentary vacuum filled by the rule of the post-coup Military Council and then the State Council – by the Parliament of Georgia elected in October 1992.\nThe Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia was preceded by the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (July 1938 – November 1990), which in its turn was a successor of the Congress of Soviets of Georgia (February 1922 – July 1938).\nIn September 2025, 32 former deputies convened a session in Tbilisi, where they claimed to had restored the Supreme Council. The conference claimed to then make Guram Isakadze their Chairman of the Supreme Council and former finance minister, Guram Absandze their acting prime minister.\nChairmen of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
