The episode has contestants dress as butch men and promote a perfume called Trade for the mini challenge, and give a makeover to a social media personality for the main challenge. Miles Heizer and Lizzo serve as guest judges, alongside regular panelists RuPaul, Michelle Visage, and Ross Mathews.\nEpisode\nThe six remaining queens are asked by RuPaul to appear in a commercial that promotes RuPaul's perfume for men, titled Trade. Each queen is to dress as butch men and deliver comedic improvisations, and Eureka wins.\nAs the winner of the mini challenge, Eureka is tasked by RuPaul to pair each contestant with six special guests for a make-over challenge. Aquaria gets paired with YouTube star Kingsley, Asia O'Hara and Raymond Braun, Eureka and Frankie Grande, Kameron Michaels and Anthony Padilla, Miz Cracker and Chester See, and Monét X Change with Tyler Oakley. Additionally, each pair took part in a home-made music video to RuPaul's song \"Charisma Uniqueness Nerve and Talent\".\nRuPaul introduces the runway category, \"Drag Family Resemblance\". On the main stage, Asia and Eureka, alongside their drag daughters America O'Hara and Eufreaka, received positive reviews for their performances and make-overs, but were declared safe. Miz Cracker and her drag daughter Miz Cookie were commended for their performances, make-over, and chemistry, and were deemed the winners of the challenge. The bottom queens of the week were Aquaria, Kameron and Monet, who were criticized for not having a make-over resemblance to their drag daughters Capricia Corn, Kelly Michaels, and Short Change. Aquaria is declared safe, while Kameron and Monet lip-synced to \"Good as Hell\" by Lizzo. Kameron wins the lip-sync and Monet is eliminated from the competition.\nReception\nIn their review, Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers of Vulture rated the episode three out of five stars.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
