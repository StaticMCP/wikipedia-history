The diocese forms part of the Province of Canterbury in England. It was created on 1 May 1905 from part of the ancient Diocese of Rochester that was served by a suffragan bishop of Southwark from 1891 to 1905. Before 1877, most of the area was part of the ancient Diocese of Winchester, with a small part near the southern end of the London Bridge being part of the ancient Diocese of London.\nThe cathedral parish is the 13th century, gothic Cathedral and Collegiate Church of St Saviour and St Mary Overie.\nGeographical extent\nThe diocese covers Greater London south of the River Thames (except for the London Borough of Bexley and the London Borough of Bromley) and east Surrey. Since the creation of the diocese's episcopal area scheme in 1991 (which before then had been operating informally for the previous five years), the diocese is divided into three episcopal areas, each of which is overseen by an area bishop and contains two archdeaconries:\n*Croydon Episcopal Area (overseen by the area Bishop of Croydon)\n**Archdeaconry of Croydon\n***includes deaneries of Croydon Addington, Croydon Central, Croydon North, Croydon South, and Sutton\n**Archdeaconry of Reigate\n***includes deaneries of Caterham, Godstone, and Reigate\n*Kingston Episcopal Area (overseen by the area Bishop of Kingston)\n**Archdeaconry of Lambeth\n***includes deaneries of Brixton, Clapham, Lambeth North, Lambeth South, Streatham, and Merton\n**Archdeaconry of Wandsworth\n***includes deaneries of Battersea, Kingston, Richmond and Barnes, Tooting, and Wandsworth\n*Woolwich Episcopal Area (overseen by the area Bishop of Woolwich)\n**Archdeaconry of Lewisham & Greenwich\n***includes deaneries of Charlton, Deptford, East Lewisham, Eltham and Mottingham, Plumstead, and West Lewisham\n**Archdeaconry of Southwark\n***includes deaneries of Bermondsey, Camberwell, Dulwich, and Southwark and Newington\nIn other ecclesiastical use, although having lost religious orders in the English Reformation, the diocese has the London home of the Archbishop of Canterbury and records centre of the Church of England in the diocese, Lambeth Palace.\nBishops\nAlongside the diocesan Bishop of Southwark (Christopher Chessun), the diocese has three area (suffragan) bishops: Rosemarie Mallett, area Bishop of Croydon; Martin Gainsborough, area Bishop of Kingston; and an area Bishop of Woolwich (vacant). Since 1994 the Bishop of Fulham (currently Jonathan Baker, since 2013) has provided 'alternative episcopal oversight' in the diocese (along with those of London and Rochester) to those parishes which reject the ordination of women to the priesthood. Baker is licensed as an honorary assistant bishop in Southwark diocese in order to facilitate his ministry there.\nSeveral other bishops are licensed as honorary assistant bishops in the diocese:\n*2004–present: Michael Doe, Preacher to Gray's Inn, former General Secretary of USPG and former Bishop suffragan of Swindon, lives in Woolwich.\n*2006–present: Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth, is an honorary professor of theology at King's College London, former Gresham Professor of Divinity and former Bishop of Oxford.\n*2009–present: David Atkinson, former Bishop suffragan of Thetford, lives in South Croydon.\n*2011–present: Alan Chesters, retired diocesan Bishop of Blackburn, lives in Lingfield, Surrey (he is also licensed in Sussex and in Europe).\n*2011–present: Peter Selby, a visiting professor at King's College London and retired Bishop of Worcester, Bishop to Prisons and suffragan (later area) Bishop of Kingston, lives in Sydenham.\n*2013–present: The Archbishop of Canterbury's chief of staff, Nigel Stock, Bishop at Lambeth, Bishop to the Forces and Bishop for the Falkland Islands, lives in Lambeth.\n*2014–present: Stephen Platten, Rector of St Michael Cornhill (Diocese of London) and retired Bishop of Wakefield (also in London and Newcastle dioceses).\n*2021–present: Rob Gillion, Vicar of Streatham Christ&nbsp;Church and Associate&nbsp;Bishop for the&nbsp;Arts (honorary assistant bishop), is a former Bishop of Riverina\nChurches\nOutside deanery structures\nCathedral of St Saviour & St Mary Overie,
