In the confusion of the Khitan uprising against the Zhou in May 696, Dae Jung-sang and the Baishan Mohe leader Geolsa Biu sought independence from Zhou. In spite of Empress Wu Zetian's appeasement policy, they fled eastward to the former land of Goguryeo.\nThe Zhou sent general Li Kaigu to give chase, and subsequently Geolsa Biu and Dae Jung-sang were killed. Dae Jo-yeong integrated the Goguryeo people under the two leaders and resisted the Tang's attack. He scored a victory over the Zhou at the Battle of Tianmenling, which enabled him to establish his own kingdom. Dae jo yeong claimed himself the King of Jin in 699 and put his capital at Dongmo Mountain, in the south of today's Jilin province.\nExternal links\n*  [https://archive.today/20130118135102/http://www.busanilbo.com/news2000/html/2007/0120/060020070120.1020162103.html 대조영과 이해고의 숙명을 건 천문령 전투, 부산일보]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926190143/https://oa.doria.fi/dspace/bitstream/10024/829/1/historic.pdf HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRE-DYNASTIC KHITAN]"
