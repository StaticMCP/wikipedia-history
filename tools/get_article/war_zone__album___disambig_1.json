It was released on February 23, 1999, through Duck Down/Priority Records. Recording sessions took place at D&D Studios in New York City. Production was entirely handled by Da Beatminerz, who also served as executive producers together with Drew \"Dru-Ha\" Friedman and member Buckshot. It features guest appearances from Busta Rhymes, Heather B., Louieville Sluggah, M.O.P., Q-Tip, Rock, Smif-N-Wessun and Teflon. The album peaked at number 35 on the Billboard 200 and number 9 on the Top R&B Albums. It was supported by two singles: \"Two Turntables & a Mic\" and \"Worldwind (This Is What It Sounds Like) (Remix)\".\nThe album was released almost six years after its influential debut Enta da Stage. The group began a lengthy legal battle with Nervous Records in 1995 over the licensing of their name, which finally settled soon before the release of War Zone. Though many of the albums released from the Boot Camp Clik family between 1997 and 1999 received mediocre reviews, War Zone garnered some strong acclaim and moderate sales. Member 5ft, who only appeared on three tracks on Enta da Stage, provides verses on six songs.\nTrack listing\n| length2 = 3:53\n| title3 = War Zone\n| writer3 =\n| length3 = 3:21\n| title4 = This Is What It Sounds Like (Worldwind)\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 4:39\n| title5 = Freestyle\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 3:36\n| title6 = Five\n| note6 = Interlude\n| writer6 = Reid\n| length6 = 1:13\n| title7 = For All Y'all\n| note7 = featuring Heather B.\n| writer7 =\n| length7 = 4:40\n| title8 = Come Get Some\n| note8 = featuring Louieville Sluggah\n| writer8 =\n| length8 = 5:00\n| title9 = Weight of the World\n| writer9 =\n| length9 = 3:29\n| title10 = Evil Dee Is on the Mix\n| writer10 = E.
