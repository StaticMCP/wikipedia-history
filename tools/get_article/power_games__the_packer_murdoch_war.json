Kerry Packer's War\n}}\nPower Games: The Packer–Murdoch War is an Australian drama-miniseries which screened on the Nine Network in 2013. The miniseries is set in the period 1960–75, when the Murdoch and Packer families collided as they battled for control of Australia's newspaper and television industries.\nPlot\nEpisode 1: The rivalry between the families dates back to a brawl in 1960, when Sir Frank Packer was trying to take over the Anglican Press, which owned a printing press that would help him take on the Murdoch-acquired Cumberland Press. When publisher Francis James refused to sell, Kerry Packer and some burly friends were sent down to help him change his mind. According to legend, they broke in and forcefully evicted the people still inside, cut the phone lines, changed the locks and barricaded the windows. Francis called upon Rupert Murdoch and boxer turned editor Frank Browne for help. Despite Packer having been an amateur boxer himself, he emerged with black eyes and a badly swollen face. The brawl made headlines in the Murdoch papers.\nFor the next year Murdoch competed with Packer and Fairfax in the suburban newspaper market, until they decided to carve out the territory between them, setting the scene for a lifelong rivalry between Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch.\nEpisode 2: Rupert starts \"The Australian\" newspaper and provides gentle editorial guidance.\nThere is a journalist strike with the shared newspapers, however when Frank refuses to negotiate with the union, Rupert realises that Frank is trying to bankrupt him. Rupert lies to Frank and tells him he is financially sound, so Frank ends the strike.\nRupert 'risks all' to buy \"News of the World\" in London. Later he does a similar deal to buy \"The Sun\". He makes it more competitive by taking the best ideas from other papers, and adding attractive girls to page 3. Later Rupert's wife is shocked to learn that the paper is displaying naked women. Rupert tells her he is not interested in what the 'establishment' think. Rupert's wife reminds him that he is 'the establishment'!\nRupert lends his Rolls-Royce to an editor in London while he is in Australia. The editor's wife is taken hostage after being mistaken for Rupert's wife. Frank gives Rupert advice, but the woman is killed. Rupert hires bodyguards for his family.\nRupert sacks his editor at \"The Australian\" for not following his instructions. Both Rupert and Frank appear to influence public opinion over their choice of prime ministers, yet Rupert has more success.\nFrank struggles to relinquish control of his empire to his sons. Kerry, the younger son demonstrates more interest and a better business mind than his older brother Clyde. Although the newspapers are losing money, Frank does not want to sell them to Rupert. However Kerry's main interest is with magazines and television, so when his father falls ill, he sells the newspapers to Rupert. Kerry tells Rupert that he has won the battle. Of course history shows that Kerry doesn't do too badly himself.\nRatings\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Episode\n! Date\n! Timeslot\n!
