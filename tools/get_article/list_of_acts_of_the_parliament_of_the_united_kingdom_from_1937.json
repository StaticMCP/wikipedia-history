For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n1 Edw. 8 & 1 Geo. 6\nContinuing the second session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 3 November 1936 until 22 October 1937.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 1 Ed. 8 & 1 Geo. 6, 1 Ed. 8 & 1 G. 6 or 1 E. 8 & 1 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  and sections one hundred and forty-eight and one hundred and forty-nine of the Government of Burma Act, 1935.|note4= }}\n-\n|  to provide for the adjustment of such grants between local authorities; and to amend section forty-five of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  applies; to repeal and reproduce with modifications and adaptations enactments relating to certain financial obligations of the Secretary of State in Council of India, and otherwise to amend the law in relation to certain of those obligations; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|  }}\n|  and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|  by extending the period of liability to be called out on permanent service thereunder.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  as amended by the British Shipping (Continuance of Subsidy) Act, 1936, and to provide for the payment of such subsidies and of the expenses of the Board of Trade under the said Part I, in respect of the year nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, out of moneys provided by Parliament.|note4= }}\n|  and to repeal section forty-five of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934, and the proviso to paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of section nine of the Rating and Valuation Act, 1925.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for the dispensing of medicines.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and to repeal, so far as relating to Scotland, section forty-five of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934.|note4= }}\n-\n|  and to provide for the combination of local authorities for certain purposes under the Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915.|note4= }}\n|  and to enable further assistance to be given to the areas specified in the First Schedule to that Act, and to certain other areas.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and section four of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  to educational organisers; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  or of President of the Railway Rates Tribunal, and with respect to the application to such persons of the Superannuation Acts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n-\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to extinguish the liability for the payment of such sums.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and 1936, and otherwise to amend the said Acts.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n-\n|  may be made at the full rate; to make further grants for land drainage; to promote the eradication of diseases of animals and poultry, and with that object to establish a national service of veterinary inspectors; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Greenock Burgh Extension, &c.|po1=Greenock Burgh Extension, &c.
