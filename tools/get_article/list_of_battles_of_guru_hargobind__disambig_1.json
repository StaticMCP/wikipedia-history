Following Guru Arjan's execution by Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, the Akal Sena came into being at the same time of the consecration of the Akal Bunga on the 15 June 1606. The Akal Sena became the army of the Sikhs and was headquartered in Amritsar. Guru Hargobind's army quickly grew in number and Sikhs began to call Guru Hargobind, \"true king\". A fort was created outside of Amritsar and Guru Hargobind had set up his own court in the Akal Takht. Guru Hargobind was eventually summoned to Delhi where he went hunting with Jahangir. Both of them grew close and went to Agra together. In 1609 he was imprisoned in Gawalior Fort by the emperor for reasons that are disputed. Guru Hargobind was eventually let go and had 52 Rajput Kings let go with him. Following his release Guru Hargobind maintained friendly relations with Jahangur while further strengthening the Akal Sena.\nBattles\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Battle\n! rowspan=\"2\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Year\n! colspan=\"2\" |Strength\n! colspan=\"2\" |Casualties\n! colspan=\"2\" |Combatants\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Result\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Sikhs\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Enemy\n!Sikhs\n!Enemy\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Sikhs\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Enemy\n|-\n|Battle of Rohilla\n|1621\n|500-700\n|4,000 - 15,000\n|Unknown\n|14,000\n|Akal Sena\n|Mughal Empire\n|Sikh Victory\n|-\n|Battle of Amritsar\n|1634\n|700\n|7,000\n|Unknown\n|7,000\n|Akal Sena\n|Mughal Empire\n|Sikh Victory\n|-\n|Battle of Lahira\n|1634\n|3,000 Sikh\n1,000 Kangra\n|35,100+\n|1,200 Sikh\n500 Kangra soldiers\n|35,100\n|Akal SenaKangra State\n|Mughal Empire\n|Sikh and Kangra Victory\n|-\n|Battle of Kartarpur\n|1635\n|1,800\n|52,000-100,000\n|700-1,000\n|50,000-96,000\n|Akal Sena\n|Mughal Empire\n|Sikh victory\n|-\n|Battle of Phagwara\n|1635\n|Unknown\n|Unknown\n|Unknown\n|Unknown\n|Akal Sena\n|Mughal Empire\n|Sikh Victory\n|-\n|Battle of Kiratpur\n|1638\n|23 (during the siege - later reinforced with larger army)\n|Unknown\n|Unknown\n|High\n|Akal Sena\n|\nRulers of Ropar\nPathans of Ropar\nGujjars of Nangal Gujjaran\nRanghars of Malakpur\n|Sikh Victory\n|}\nReferences"
