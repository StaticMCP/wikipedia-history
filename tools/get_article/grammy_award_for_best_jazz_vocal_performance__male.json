Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nPrior to 1981, the gender-neutral category of Best Jazz Vocal Performance existed. The first award specifically for male performances was presented to George Benson in 1981 for the song \"Moody's Mood\". The category remained unchanged until 1985, when it was combined with the award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female and presented in the genderless category. Gender-specific awards were once again presented from 1986 until 1991. In 1992, the two categories were combined and presented as the category Best Jazz Vocal Performance. This category was later renamed to Best Jazz Vocal Album beginning in 2001. While the gender-specific award has not been presented since the category merge in 1992, an official confirmation of its retirement has not been announced.\nBobby McFerrin holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of four consecutive wins from 1986 to 1989 (once along with Jon Hendricks). Mel Tormé and Harry Connick, Jr. each received the award twice. An American artist received the award each year it was presented. Tormé holds the record for the most nominations, with six. Mark Murphy and Joe Williams hold the record for the most nominations without a win, with a total of four each.\nRecipients\n1982 award winner Al Jarreau\nTwo-time award winner Mel Tormé\nTwo-time award winner Harry Connick, Jr.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Chronological list of award recipients and nominees along with all nominated works\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Performing artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Work\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1981\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1982\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1983\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1984\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1985\n| align=\"center\"|—\n| align=\"center\"|—\n| align=\"center\"|—\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1986\n|  and Jon Hendricks\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1987\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1988\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1989\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1990\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1991\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nEach year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nAward was combined with the Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female category and presented in a genderless category known as Best Jazz Vocal Performance.\nSee also\n* Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group\n* List of Grammy Award categories\nReferences\n;General\n*\n;Specific\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com/ Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
