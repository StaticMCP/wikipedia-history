Origins of the Tunjur state are not well known. It is known that the Tunjur kingdom replaced an earlier Daju kingdom, after the Tunjur people migrated from north to the Darfur region in the fifteenth century. Their migration represents a second known Berber migration to the region. The states possibly coexisted for some time, with Tunjur rule in the north and Daju rule in the south, before the Tunjur people managed to replace the earlier dynasty completely. The lands ruled by the Tunjur people are within contemporary Sudan, and their influence extended into Chad.\nCulture\nThe Tunjur were probably Arabized Berbers, and spoke the Arabic language. They claimed heritage from the tribe of Banu Hilal. However, they were initially entirely pagan after the migration had finished. No trace of their own language exists. All of the Tunjur oral tradition is attributed in an unusual manner to a single person called Shau Dorsid.\nSociety in Darfur changed drastically due to the influence of the Tunjur dynasty. Corvée labor was organized for the newly-organized state, long-range trade began, and Islam was partially adopted as a religion.\nTunjur architecture drew influence from Berber and Tora styles. There is a stone mosque, the first Muslim building in Darfur, possibly built around the year 1200, at the city of Uri which was the first capital of the kingdom. This may indicate that Islam was adopted as a court religion. The king however, probably, held a divine status. The city was built in Fur architecture.\nThe role of Islam in the region ruled over by the Tunjur kingdom, and earlier the Daju dynasty, remained insignificant until the late 16th century. No material remains for Islamization are known from the preceding Daju dynasty's period.\nTunjur dynasty\nBy the early 16th century the Tunjur kingdom ruled Darfur and Wadai. Capitals of the kingdom were in northern Darfur. The cities of Uri and Ain Farah are associated with the kingdom. Uri, the early capital, was at the meeting point of two major trade routes. It is certain that Egyptian merchants traded with the Tunjur people. Caravan routes and earlier river based routes through Nubia allowed long-distance trade. The kingdom exported slaves, gold, camels, rhinoceros horn, ivory, ostrich feathers, tamarind, gum arabic and natron. Trade was, according to Egyptian sources, under close royal control. Unlike in the newly-islamized and briefly dynastically related Wadai Empire, it is unclear if the Tunjur kingdom was a Muslim state. However, the rulers of the kingdom were Muslim.  Slavery was common in the region, and the Tunjur also engaged in enslavement of other peoples.\nEnd of the dynasty\nThe Tunjur kingdom was succeeded by the Sultanate of Darfur (Keira Sultanate). The Fur people and their Keira dynasty superseded the Tunjur around the 1650s. A story about a dynastic link between Keira and Tunjur dynasties involving Ahmad al-Maqur is known. Tunjur rule in Wadai ended when a local dynasty of Maba people revolted, expelled and replaced them. The Tunjur kingdom may have ceased to exist as early as in 1611 or 1635.\nA branch of the Tunjur dynasty in Wadai was also overthrown by an alliance of the Arabs and the Maba.\nEventually, the Tunjur people assimilated to a large decree into other peoples of the region.\nSee also\n*Alodia\n*History of Chad\n*History of Sudan\n*Tora (Darfur)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
