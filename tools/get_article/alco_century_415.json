The longer one contained the diesel engine, a  eight-cylinder turbocharged Alco 251-F, while the shorter contained auxiliaries.  The C415 could be ordered with three different cab heights; a low one for minimum clearances, a regular height one, and an extra-height one for maximum visibility.\nTrucks fitted were either Type B standard road trucks or ALCO Hi-Ad (high adhesion) Type B trucks.\nService history\nThe locomotive was not very popular; 26 were built between 1966 and 1968 for seven different owners. The locomotive may still be in use. According to the November 2011 issue of Railfan & Railroad magazine, the Burlington Junction Railway owned three C415s numbered 21, 701 and 702.\nOriginal owners\n*Hamersley Iron in Western Australia bought the prototype in May 1968, formerly lettered as ALCO 415.  The locomotive was equipped with a medium height cab and AAR Type B trucks.\n*Chehalis Western Railroad bought a single high cab unit with Hi-Ad trucks.\n*Columbia and Cowlitz Railway bought a single high cab unit with Hi-Ad trucks. (Both the Columbia and Cowlitz and the Chehalis Western are Weyerhaeuser properties)\n*Monongahela Connecting Railroad bought a single low cab unit with Hi-Ad trucks.\n*Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad bought ten medium cab units with AAR Type B trucks.\n*Southern Pacific Railroad bought ten high cab units with Type B road trucks.\n*Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway bought two medium cab units with Hi-Ad trucks; these were passed to the Burlington Northern Railroad, 4010-4011 after a merger between the two railroads. More units were on order when Alco ended locomotive production in 1969.\nPreservation\n*Southern Pacific Railroad 2406 is in Monterrey, Mexico, lettered as Fundidora Monterrey Steel 25.\n*Hamersley Iron 1000, formerly Alco Demonstrator 415 is at the Pilbara Railways Historical Society in Western Australia.\n*Monongahela Connecting Railroad 701 is at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.\n*Chehalis Western Railroad 684 is at Fife History Museum and Cultural Center in Fife, Washington.\n*Buffalo Southern Railroad 423, formerly Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad 423 is at the Buffalo Southern's Hamburg Shops in Hamburg, New York.\nSee also\n*List of ALCO diesel locomotives\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
