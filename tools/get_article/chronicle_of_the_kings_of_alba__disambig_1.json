W.F. Skene called it the Chronicle of the Kings of Scots, and some have called it the Older Scottish Chronicle, but Chronicle of the Kings of Alba is emerging as the standard scholarly name.\nThe sole surviving version of the text comes from the Poppleton Manuscript, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris. It is the fourth of seven consecutive Scottish documents in the manuscript, the first six of which were probably put together in the early thirteenth century by the man who wrote de Situ Albanie. The Chronicle is a vital source for the period it covers, and, despite some later Francization, is very much written in Hiberno-Latin, showing evidence of a scribe with some knowledge of contemporary Middle Irish orthography. The original text was without doubt written in Scotland, probably in the early eleventh century, shortly after the reign of Kenneth II, the last reign it relates.\nBibliography\n*Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\n**Anderson, Marjorie O.
