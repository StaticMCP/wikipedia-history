There was never much humour with the MJQ  but there is plenty of musical fun with Rollins. Yes, the CD is a mish-mash but if you don’t have the Rollins tracks they are well worth acquiring.  I am sure the Teddy Edwards’ groupies will be pleased with the final two tracks.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"Doxy\" (Sonny Rollins) – 7:58\n# \"Limehouse Blues\" (Philip Braham, Douglas Furber) – 6:32\n# \"I'll Follow My Secret Heart\" (Noël Coward) – 5:31\n# \"You Are Too Beautiful\" (Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart) – 6:07\n# \"Billie's Bounce\" (Charlie Parker) – 6:34\n# \"A Foggy Day\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) – 7:45\n*Recorded at the Music Inn, Lenox, MA, on August 31, 1958 (tracks 1-4), and at Falcon's Lair in Beverly Hills, CA in 1958 (tracks 5 & 6)\nPersonnel\n* Sonny Rollins (tracks 1-4), Teddy Edwards (tracks 5 & 6) – tenor saxophone\n* John Lewis (tracks 1 & 4), Joe Castro (tracks 5 & 6) – piano\n* Percy Heath (tracks 1-4), Leroy Vinnegar (tracks 5 & 6) – bass\n* Connie Kay (tracks 1-4), Billy Higgins (tracks 5 & 6) – drums\nReferences"
