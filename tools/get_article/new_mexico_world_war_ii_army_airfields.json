However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nSecond Air Force\n* Alamogordo AAF, Alamogordo\n: Now:  Holloman Air Force Base\n* Clovis AAF, Clovis\n: Now:  Cannon Air Force Base\n* Kirtland Field, Albuquerque\n: Now:  Kirtland Air Force Base\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Albuquerque Army Airfield, Albuquerque, New Mexico (merged into Kirtland Field in 1944)\nArmy Air Forces Training Command\n* Carlsbad AAF, Carlsbad\n: Now: Cavern City Air Terminal\n* Deming AAF, Deming (reassigned to Second Air Force in 1944)\n: Now: Deming Municipal Airport\n* Fort Sumner AAF, Fort Sumner\n: Now: Fort Sumner Municipal Airport\n* Hobbs AAF, Hobbs\n: Was: Hobbs Army Airfield (1942-1948)\n: Now: Hobbs Industrial Air Park\n* Roswell AAF, Roswell\n: Was: Walker Air Force Base (1947-1967)\n: Now: Roswell International Air Center (RIAC)\nReferences\n*\n* Thole, Lou (1999), Forgotten Fields of America : World War II Bases and Training, Then and Now - Vol. 2.
