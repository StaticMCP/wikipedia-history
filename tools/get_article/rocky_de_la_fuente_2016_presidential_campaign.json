De La Fuente had sought the Democratic Party's nomination during their presidential primaries. De La Fuente did not win any delegates to the 2016 Democratic National Convention, but he came in fourth by total votes received. De La Fuente founded the American Delta Party and ran as its presidential nominee with running mate Michael Steinberg. He was also the presidential nominee of the Reform Party, which had ballot access in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. He received 33,136 votes in the general election, placing him eighth in the popular vote.\nDemocratic primary campaign\nDe La Fuente filed his candidacy for President of the United States with the Federal Election Commission as a Democrat. He identified himself as a progressive Democrat. He said that he was inspired to run after becoming dissatisfied with the slate of candidates, especially Donald Trump, whom he accused of alienating large segments of the population. On immigration, De La Fuente supported a path to citizenship and was against the wall proposed by Donald Trump.\nDe La Fuente subsequently has said that the reason he opted to seek the Democratic nomination, rather than the Republican nomination, is that he hoped that the Democratic primary's smaller field of candidates would make it easier for him to stand out. The Republican party had 17 candidates, more than three times the number of major candidates who sought the Democratic nomination.\nBelow is a table of the results of primaries in which De La Fuente competed during the Democratic primaries. The total number of votes De La Fuente received can be found in the Votes column. The rank in which De La Fuente came among candidates/ballot options can be found in the Place column.\nat the venue of the Iowa Brown and Black Forum]]\n{| class=\"wikitable pable\"\n|+ Primaries and Caucus Results\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" 20pt; | Date\n! scope=\"col\" 20pt; | Contest\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort- type=\"number\" 20pt; | Votes\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort- type=\"number\" 20pt; |Percent\n! scope=\"col\" 25pt; | Place\n! scope=\"col\" 20pt; | Sources\n|-\n| Feb 9 ||New Hampshire primary ||96 ||0.04% ||8th of 28 ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" | March 1 ||Alabama primary ||818 ||0.20% ||4th ||\n|-\n|American Samoan caucus ||14 ||5.91% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Arkansas primary ||1,684 ||0.76% ||6th ||\n|-\n|Massachusetts primary ||1,545 ||0.13% ||4th ||\n|-\n|Minnesota caucus ||53 ||0.03% ||4th ||\n|-\n|Oklahoma primary ||2,485 ||0.74% ||7th ||\n|-\n|Texas primary ||8,429 ||0.59% ||3rd of 8 ||\n|-\n| March 1–8 ||Democrats Abroad primary ||6 ||0.02% ||4th ||\n|-\n| March 2 ||Vermont primary ||94 ||0.06% ||4th ||\n|-\n| March 5 ||Louisiana primary ||1,341 ||0.43% ||8th of 10 ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | March 8 ||Michigan primary ||870 ||0.07% ||4th ||\n|-\n|Mississippi primary ||481 ||0.21% ||5th ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | March 15 ||Illinois primary ||1,802 ||0.09% ||6th ||\n|-\n|Missouri primary ||345 ||0.05% ||6th of 9 ||\n|-\n|North Carolina primary ||3,376 ||0.30% ||4th ||\n|-\n|Ohio primary ||9,402 ||0.76% ||3rd ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | March 22 ||Arizona primary ||2,797 ||0.60% ||4th of 6 ||\n|-\n|Idaho caucus ||4 ||0.02% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Utah caucus ||22 ||0.03% ||3rd ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | March 26 ||Alaskan caucus ||1 ||0.01% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Hawaiian caucus ||12 ||0.04% ||3rd ||\n|-\n| April 5 ||Wisconsin primary ||18 ||0.00% ||4th ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | April 26 ||Connecticut primary ||960 ||0.29% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Delaware primary ||1,024 ||1.09% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Maryland primary ||3,582 ||0.39% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Pennsylvania primary ||14,439 ||0.86% ||3rd ||\n|-\n|Rhode Island primary ||145 ||0.12% ||4th ||\n|-\n| May 10 ||West Virginia primary ||1010 ||0.40% ||6th ||\n|-\n| May 17 ||Kentucky primary ||1,594 ||0.35% ||4th\n||\n|-\n| June 5 || Puerto Rico caucus ||391 ||0.44% ||3rd ||\n|-\n| June 7 ||California primary ||8,453 ||0.16% ||5th of 7 ||\n|-\n| June 14 ||D.C. primary ||213 ||0.22% ||3rd ||\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Total ||67,457 ||0.22% ||3rd of 33||\n|}\n:A.

He was nominated as the party's presidential nominee. His running mate was Michael Steinberg of Florida. On August 8, 2016, De La Fuente was named as the presidential nominee of the Reform Party.\nAmerican Delta Party held its national convention on September 1, 2016, in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, and nominated Rocky De La Fuente to run in the United States presidential election representing his party. De La Fuente chose Michael Steinberg as his running mate.\nQualifications\nDe La Fuente gained ballot access to 147 electoral votes in 20 states (Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming). He qualified as a write-in candidate in Arizona, California, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, Washington, and West Virginia.\nDebates and forums\nDuring his campaign for Democratic nomination, De La Fuente was not invited to any of the Democratic Party forums and debates. De La Fuente also did not qualify for any of the presidential debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. De La Fuente, however, was invited to and participated in the 2016 Free & Equal Elections debate.\nAfter coming in fourth and winning no delegates in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries and after founding the American Delta Party as a vehicle to run for president of the United States with his running mate Michael Steinberg and as he lacked ballot access to the larger states, on October 25, 2016, he participated in a debate hosted by the Free & Equal Elections Foundation and debated against the Constitution Party candidate Darrell Castle and the Party for Socialism and Liberation candidate Gloria LaRiva.\nPolls\nDe La Fuente's general election campaign was included in very few polls.\nNevada - Five-way race\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Poll source\n!Date administered\n!

He failed to win any electoral votes. In the popular vote De La Fuente placed eighth overall, behind the Democratic Party's Hillary Clinton, Republican Party's Donald Trump, Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson, Green Party's Jill Stein, independent Evan McMullin, Constitution Party's Darrell Castle, and Party for Socialism and Liberation's Gloria La Riva.\nDe La Fuente received more votes than any Reform Party presidential nominee since Ralph Nader's 2004 campaign.\nRecount effort\nOn November 30 (in response to Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein's efforts to request recounts in Wisconsin and several other states which Donald Trump won) De La Fuente requested a partial-recount in Nevada (a state which Hillary Clinton won). He considered this effort to be a \"counterbalance\" at Stein's efforts. De La Fuente paid the $14,000 that was required for him to request for a recount to be held in a sample from 5% of state-precincts. Nevada's partial-recount was completed December 8, finding no significant discrepancies.\nCampaign finances\nDetailed below are the financial statements filled with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) of Rocky 2016 LLC as of  November 28, 2016.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Receipts\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Financial Source\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Amount (USD)\n|-\n|Federal Funds ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Itemized Individual Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$13,156\n|-\n||Unitemized Individual Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$3,887\n|- style=\"background:#DFDFDF\"\n|Total Individual Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$17,043\n|-\n|Party Committees Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Other Committees Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Candidate Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|- style=\"background:#DFDFDF\"\n|Total Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$17,043\n|-\n|Transfers from Authorized Committees ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Candidate Loans ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$7,855,009\n|-\n|Other Loans ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|- style=\"background:#DFDFDF\"\n|Total Loans ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$7,855,009\n|-\n|Offsets to Operating Expenditures ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Fundraising Offsets ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Legal and Accounting Offsets ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|- style=\"background:#DFDFDF\"\n|Total Offsets ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Other Receipts ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|- style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"\n|Total Receipts ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$7,855,009\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Disbursements\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Disbursements\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Amount (USD)\n|-\n|Operating Expenditures ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$4,337,137\n|-\n|Transfers To Authorized Committees ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n||Fundraising ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$3,146,674\n|-\n|Exempt Legal and Accounting ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$385,982\n|-\n|Candidate Loan Repayments ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Other Loan Repayments ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Individual Contribution Refunds ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Political Party Contribution Refunds ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Other Committee Contribution Refunds ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Other Disbursements ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|- style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"\n|Total Disbursements ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$7,869,794\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Cash Summary\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |Amount (USD)\n|-\n|Beginning Cash On Hand ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|-\n|Current Cash On Hand ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$2,257\n|-\n|Net Contributions ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$17,043\n|-\n|Net Operating Expenditures ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$4,339,360\n|-\n|Debts/Loans Owed By Campaign ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$7,855,009\n|-\n|Debts/Loans Owed To Campaign ||style=\"text-align:right;\" |$0\n|}\nEndorsements\nActivists\n* Deez Nuts\n* Brian Moore\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161009040202/https://www.rocky2016.com/ Rocky 2016 campaign website]\n*\n*[https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article57037938.html Columnist Dave Barry on meeting De La Fuente]\n*"
