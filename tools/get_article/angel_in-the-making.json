It stars Tony Hung and Eliza Sam as the main leads, with Pal Sinn, Alice Chan and Elaine Yiu as the major supporting cast. The drama was broadcast on Hong Kong's Jade and HD Jade channels from November 30 till December 27, 2015 every Monday through Sunday during its 9:30-10:30 pm timeslot with a total of 25 episodes.\nSynopsis\nIntern nurses must endure the difficult task they are faced with when they are under the supervision of the male nurse from hell.\nIt has always been cheerful and caring Halley Kei's (Eliza Sam) dream to become a nurse. Ever since she was young, she has played pretend nurse, tending and caring sick patients. However, her first day as an intern nurse goes wrong in every possible way. First she is almost late and then she is put in charge of an unruly patient, who is a small-time triad boss. Her patient becomes paranoid that someone is trying to kill him, gets high on cocaine in the hospital bathroom, and then tries to escape from the hospital while almost dying all in one day. Luckily, her patient is stopped and saved by the new nurse mentor Ray Yeung (Tony Hung).\nRay Yeung lives a strange isolated life. Still traumatized by the death of his parents and older brother in front of him when he was young, he doesn't like to socialize with people and is nicknamed \"Death Ray\" by all his colleagues because he is extremely hated by his co-workers and of his stern blunt personality. Even with his unlikable personality, he is still highly respected by the hospital's chief of staff because of his excellent work ethics and is invited to work at the hospital as the new intern nurses mentor.\nRay immediately singles out Halley on their first day because of the way she handled her patient and tells her she will surely fail her internship. Feeling they did no wrong and not taking Ray's criticism kindly, all the new intern nurses band together to have Ray remove as their mentor since they feel Ray is setting them up to fail. The Chief of staff, however, sides with Ray and tell the intern nurses that Ray is just pushing them to their full potential. What the intern nurses don't know is Ray is actually a very dedicated nurse who want the new intern nurses to take their training seriously and defends them when the doctors tries to blame them for mistakes.\nWhen Ray helps Halley with a patient that is having marital issues, she starts to see the good in him. As Halley discovers Ray's good side, others still think he has evil intent, especially senior doctor Kennedy Tong (Pal Sinn) who suspects Ray killed his younger half-brother to steal his fortune. With the help of colleague Defea Cha (Alice Chan) and Arthur's ex-girlfriend Sylvia To (Elaine Yiu), Kennedy fights Ray in court to have the will which his brother left everything to Ray voided. However, Ray is not fazed by Kennedy's actions and decide to play mind games with Kennedy. During the day of the court hearing, it is revealed that Kennedy's half-brother had a secret life style and everything Ray had done was planned by Kennedy's half-brother to get Kennedy to put his pride aside and desire to fight for his fortune since Kennedy held a grudge against their late father for leaving his mother.\nHalley's good feelings for Ray continues to grow when he saves her life from one of her father's obsessively deranged student who is in love with her father and thinks Halley is the reason that her father is rejecting her advances. She tries to kill Halley, but accidentally stabs Ray who is trying to restrain her. Ray almost dies from his injuries but thinking back to the car accident that took his family brings him back to life. Feeling responsible, Halley takes care of Ray and helps him recover. During this time, Ray gives Halley the ultimate test by having her nurse the mother who abandoned her. Her mother not only needs her care but also her kidney. The relationship between mother and daughter is tense as Halley finds out why her mother was never and does not want to be a part of her life. With Ray's urging of Halley to see her mother, she finds out the reason why her mother must have her kidney and agrees to donate one to her. After the ordeal, Halley gets what she always wished for, a relationship with and knowing her mother.\nJust as everything is looking up for Halley, Ray finds himself in a dark place when he finds the culprit behind the cause of his family's death, Dr. Lung, a respected senior doctor that heads the Accident and emergency unit at the same hospital Ray works at. Mad with revenge on his mind, he starts to hallucinate his deceased family talking to him and find ways to bring Dr. Lung to justice. After gaining evidence, he has Kennedy keep it safe for him when he is being pursued by Dr. Lung's henchmen but soon finds out Kennedy is not to be trusted. In order to gain in his career, Kennedy betrays Ray by sabotaging all evidence against Dr. Lung. Not knowing whom to trust anymore, Ray spirals further into paranoia. However Halley knowing the pain Ray is going through consoles him and keeps him company, but since he doesn't trust her either he uses her friends to blackmail her into helping him kidnap Dr. Lung's grandson. Ray wakes up in the hospital realizing all that happened during his revenge scheme was just part of his delusion. Finally admitting how severe his illness is he agrees to seek treatment abroad and Dr. Lung racked with guilt decides to turn himself in.\nHalley passes her final exam after her third retake test and is happy to be a full-fledged nurse. However she is a bit sad as Ray is not there. With Ray gone abroad for over a year to treat his illness Halley realizes she not only misses him but also had fallen in love with him. When Ray returns he plays a trick on Halley by avoiding her and having her find him. Halley eventually finds Ray at the beach with clues of his favorite food, papaya scattered all over the sea line. Ray eventually comes out from hiding and charmingly shows his returned feelings for Halley when he attempts to kiss her. The two end with a sweet embrace in the ocean.\nCast\nMain cast\n*Tony Hung as \"Death\" Ray Yeung (楊志明; Yeung Chi-ming) - male age 35\n**Marcus Lo as child Yeung Chi-ming (童年楊志明)\n:He survived a car accident that killed his entire family when he was a child, which left him traumatized.
