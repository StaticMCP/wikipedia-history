It features three songs by each artist, remixed by the other artist. \"Stiched\" was originally recorded for 16 Volt's second album Skin. \"Dreams of Light\" and \"Motorskill\" were both originally recorded for their first album Wisdom. All three songs by the Hate Dept. (\"Defensive\", \"Start Digging\" and \"Drive:a\") came from their debut album meat.your.maker.\nReception\nBlack Monday criticized the misdirection of the remixes and said \"I'd have to say that this release is a bit disappointing, but the\ntracks that are good are real nice to have.\"\nTrack listing\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
