District of Columbia voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nVice President Hubert Humphrey won Washington, D.C. by an overwhelming margin, receiving over 80% of the vote.\nThis was the second presidential election in which the District of Columbia had the right to vote in presidential elections, as well as the only place where George Wallace did not have his name on the ballot. This remains the only presidential election in which the Republican nominee received a higher percentage of the vote in DC than at least one state in that same election as Nixon performed 5% better in Washington, D.C. than he did in both Mississippi and Alabama.\nCampaign\nGeorge Wallace announced his intention to run under the American Independent Party at a press conference in Washington, D.C. on February 8, 1968. Another event that happened also in the District was President Lyndon B. Johnson announcing from the Oval Office in the White House that he would not run for a second term on March 31.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in the District of Columbia\nNotes\nReferences"
