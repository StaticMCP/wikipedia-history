The Carlists were besieging Bilbao and controlled the water and land routes towards the city.  The battle of Luchana took place in the district belonging to the parish of Deusto and the municipality of Erandio, on the banks of the Asúa River, which empties into the Nervión at the spot known as Luchana.  The Carlists were defeated and the siege of Bilbao was lifted.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of luchana\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Luchana"
