This kingdom is also known as the ''Pogana'a Suwawa or Pohala'a Suwawa.\nBased on historical records, the Suwawa Kingdom is also known as Tiyombu, the ancestor or eldest of all the kingdoms in the Gorontalo region. This kingdom was formed in the 6th century, or around 500s AD.\nEtymology\nAccording to several sources, the name \"Suwawa\" comes from the word tuwawa in Suwawa language or the word tuwawa'a in Gorontalo language. These two words mean tuwawu or one which is taken from the word towawa'a'' which means 'one body'.\nThe meaning of the word ''towawa'a is diverse to this day but has harmony. Some interpret it as a social unity based on the genealogy, territoriality, and culture of the Suwawa people. This means that the Suwawa people is a unified community that is emotionally integrated based on family, regional, and cultural factors.\nHistory\nOrigin\nThe history of the founded of Suwawa in Gorontalo, can be traced from various community stories that have been passed down from generation to generation. In general, various community stories and existing historical records confirm that the Gorontalo region was once just mountains towering in the middle of the ocean.\nThere were three mountains at that time which were said to be the first areas inhabited by humans, so they were also called Huidu Totolu or Goenong Tellu'' () and finally developed and became the current name of Gorontalo. The three mountains are Mount Tilongkabila, Mount Gambuta, and Mount Malenggalila. From folklore, it is also said that the name Gorontalo comes from the word Goenong Tellu, which also means three mountains, was given by migrants from neighboring islands who stopped in the area.\nIt is said that the three names of the mountains are the names of the first people who settled in the Gorontalo. Mount Tilongkabila comes from the name of the first human there, namely Tilongkabila, who was female. Meanwhile, on Mount Gambuta, there was the first human being, a male, named Mooduliyo. Likewise, Mount Malenggalila represents the first man who lived there. According to ancient historical records in Suwawa, these three humans are also associated with the story of the Nuh (Noah) and his followers who survived the flash flood disaster.\nMooduliyo and Tilongkabila meet in a highland valley between the three mountains. The valley is very wide and bright, so that finally the place was given the name Bangio Plateau (Bangio is the name of a place from the Suwawa language). The two of them then married and had descendants who would later become the ancestors of the civilization of the Suwawa people in particular and the Gorontalo people in general.\nKingdom establishment\nOne of the famous descendants of Mooduliyo and Tilongkabila's marriage was Princess Peedaa (Pi'i Da'a). Princess Peedaa is known to be wise and wise, she is said to be the originator of the birth of two groups of people who are famous among the Gorontalo people.\nThe two community groups are:\n* Pidodotiya\n* Witohiya\nThe two groups that were formed then multiplied and formed the early Suwawa people or the forerunners of the Gorontalo people in the 4th century. As it developed, these two groups negotiated and agreed to form Suwawa Kingdom in 500s AD.\nThe first leader of the Suwawa Kingdom was a woman with the title of Olongia with the name Ayudugiya. In historical records, Ayudugiya or Queen Ayudugiya ruled from 500s AD to 579 AD.\nConversion to Islam\nThe first king of Suwawa who convert to Islam was Mooduto. Mooduto is recorded as having converted to Islam when he ruled the Suwawa Kingdom in the 15th century.\nCapital city\nWith the appointment of Ayudugiya as the first great queen, this marked the beginning of the Suwawa Kingdom. The territory and capital of the kingdom were determined to be in the Bangio Plateau and the Leda-Leda building was built as the royal palace.\nBangio itself is a highland area which is present called Pinogu and is part of the Suwawa District, Bone Bolango Regency.\nList of rulers\nThe following is a list of rulers of who held the title olongia or its equivalent, king or raja.\n*Ayudugiya ( 500–579)\n*Ige ( 1350–1380)\n*Dulanoali ( 1380–1390)\n*Luadu ( 1390–1400)\n*Buruali ( 1400–1410)\n*Aidugia ( 1410–1420)\n*Purubulawan ( 1420–1430)\n*Ohito ( 1430–1450)\n*Maindoa ( 1450–1470)\n*Mooduto I ( 1470–1500)\n*Biini I ( 1500–1510)\n*Bomboluawo ( 1510–1530)\n*Tilagunde ( 1530–1550)\n*Gulimbala ( 1550)\n*Dagutanga ( 1550–1570)\n*Mooduto II ( 1570–1590)\n*Mooluado ( 1590–1600)\n*Aibugia ( 1600–1610)\n*Dulandimo ( 1610–1620)\n*Pongoliu ( 1620–1640)\n*Gulanguma ( 1640–1650)\n*Bouwa ( 1650–1660)\n*Gintaelangi ( 1660–1680)\n*Biini II ( 1680–1700)\n*Bobigi ( 1700–1706)\n*Tilombe ( 1706–1720)\n*Pulubulawan ( 1720–1730)\n*Bumbulo (1730–1746)\n*Mooduto III (1752–1772)\n*Walango (1772–1798)\n*Mogolaingo (1798–1816)\n*Tanggango ( 1816–1820)\n*Pulumodoiong ( 1820–1830)\n*Humungo (1830–1839)\n*Sapjatidien Iskandar Muhammad Wartabone Illahu (1839–1858)\n*Abdul al-Latif Muhammad Tengaho (1858–1870)\n*Interregnum (1870–1902)\n*Ahmad Adam (1902–1907)\n*Dżahari Wartabone (regent; 1907–1925)\n*Jahja Udopu Camaru ( 1925–1930)\n*Ismail Pongoliu Usman ( 1930–unknown)\nSee also\n* Gorontalo Sultanate\n* Kingdom of Bolaang Mongondow\n* Suwawa people\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
