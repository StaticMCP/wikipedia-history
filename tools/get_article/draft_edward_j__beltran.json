This framework integrates biometric data, behavioral science, and leadership development to enhance workplace performance. He serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Fierce, Inc., a global leadership development firm recognized for its communication and coaching methodologies. Beltran is also the author of Fierce Resilience, a USA Today and Barnes & Noble best-selling book exploring the relationship between stress, performance, and leadership. He also routinely hosts the podcast The Pulse Experience: Exploring the Intersection of Technology, Leadership and Coaching\", which explores how cutting-edge technologies and human leadership practices converge to drive wellbeing, resilience and effective organizational performance.\nCareer\nBeltran studied accounting and computer information systems at Arizona State University and started his career in public accounting. Early on, he interned with Warren Buffett, an experience he has cited as shaping the way he thought about business and long-term leadership. After several years in accounting, he moved into the startup world, where the pace and hands-on learning pushed him to pursue an MBA at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Over the next decade, he worked in finance and operations roles at companies including Agilent Technologies, Avnet, and PwC, and later helped grow an ambulatory surgery center startup as its CFO.\nHe joined Fierce, Inc. in 2017 as CFO and became CEO in 2020. Since taking the role, Beltran has directed the company’s shift from a traditional training provider to a technology-supported performance platform, putting an emphasis on tools that help people tackle real-time workplace conversations. He has guided the development of digital learning systems, AI-based conversation support, and short, scenario-driven simulations. Beltran is also a member of the Fast Company Executive Board , reflecting his broader involvement in leadership and workplace innovation.\nAcross his work at Fierce, Beltran has focused on how clearer communication can reduce confusion and stress at work and help organizations avoid the kind of problems that arise when issues go unaddressed. He has also partnered with specialists in diversity, equity, and inclusion to develop realistic practice scenarios on topics such as microaggressions and everyday workplace conflict. Beltran holds an active CPA license and additional certificates in entrepreneurship from Wharton and Harvard.\nEthical Biometric Intelligence\nBeltran is credited with the development of Ethical Biometric Intelligence™, a framework combining biometric data with communication coaching to improve stress management and organizational performance. The framework was validated by a Korn Ferry Institute study demonstrating a 40% immediate reduction in stress after a 90-minute session, along with sustained improvements in stress, burnout, and resilience.\nPublications\n* Fierce Resilience: Combatting Workplace Stress One Conversation at a Time\nRecognition and Awards\n* USA Today Best-Seller List \"Fierce Resilience\" [https://www.usatoday.com/booklist/books/fierce-resilience-combatting-workplace-stress-one-conversation-at-a-time/9781523007141]\n* Goody Business Book Award  [https://goodybusinessbookawards.com/2024-awards-problem-solving/ Goody Business Book Awards – 2024 Problem Solving]\n* Finalist, 2024 American Book Fest [https://www.americanbookfest.com/2024bbafullresults.html American Book Fest – 2024 Book Awards Full Results]\n* Training Industry Top 20 Leadership Training Company (Fierce, Inc.)[https://trainingindustry.com/top-training-companies/leadership/top-leadership-training-companies/ Top Leadership Training Companies]\n* Two Gold Stevie Awards in the categories of ‘HR & Employee Experience’ and ‘Innovation of the Year – Business Service Industries’.
