A Democrat, he was most notable for his two terms in the New York State Assembly from 1883 to 1884 and his term as mayor of Albany from 1888 to 1890.\nEarly life\nEdward Augustin Maher was born in Albany, New York, on May 20, 1848, the son of Thomas Maher and Julia (Pendergast) Maher. He was educated at Albany's Christian Brothers Academy and was an 1867 graduate of the Albany Normal School (now the State University of New York at Albany). Maher pursued a business and banking career, and became manager of the Albany Electric Illuminating Company and president of Albany's South End Bank.\nPolitical career\nMaher was active in politics and government as a Democrat and served in a variety of elected and appointed positions. From 1876 to 1883 he represented Albany's Fourth Ward on the Albany County Board of Supervisors, and in 1879 he was chosen to serve as the board's president. From 1878 to 1880, he was a clerk of the New York Supreme Court, and from 1878 to 1881 he was deputy county clerk of Albany County.\nIn 1882, he was elected to the New York State Assembly, and he was reelected in 1883. From 1888 to 1890, Maher served as mayor of Albany.\nLater life\nIn 1892, Maher moved to New York City, where he served as president of the Union Railway, a venture that combined several streetcar franchises into one company. When the Union Railway became part of the Third Avenue Railway in 1896, Maher was appointed to serve as Third Avenue's vice president. In 1917, Maher succeeded to the presidency of the Third Avenue line, and he retired in 1918.\nDeath and burial\nMaher died at his Manhattan home on September 13, 1920. He was buried in the old section of Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx.\nFamily\nIn 1869, Maher married Jane \"Jennie\" S. Tiernan of Albany.
