Trained under Third Air Force in the southeast United States, also used for antisubmarine patrols over the Atlantic southeast coast and then Gulf of Mexico.\nDeployed to Southern California in early 1943 to the Desert Warfare Center, trained in light bombing while supporting Army maneuvers in the Mojave Desert until October.\nRe-equipped with North American A-36 Apache dive bombers and deployed to New Guinea as part of Fifth Air Force.  In the Southwest Pacific the squadron attacked Japanese strong points and tactical positions and targets of opportunity in support of general Douglas MacArthur's campaign along the north coast of New Guinea; then advancing into the Netherlands East Indies and Philippines as part of the Island Hopping campaign.  It was re-equipped with Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, and later with Douglas A-20 Havocs.   Engaged in heavy fighting on Leyte, Mindoro and Luzon in the Philippines during 1944–1945.\nThe squadron moved to Okinawa in mid-August and after the Atomic Bomb missions had been flown; remained on Okinawa until December until returning to the United States with most personnel demobilizing. It was inactivated as a paper unit on 6 January 1946.\nThe squadron was reactivated as a Boeing B-29 Superfortress unit in the reserves in 1947, but lack of funding and personnel led to rapid inactivation.\nTransferred to Tactical Air Command in the mid-1950s and activated first with North American F-86 Sabres, then North American F-100 Super Sabres in 1958.   Inactivated in 1959 when its parent 312th Tactical Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing.   Personnel and equipment of the squadron were transferred to the 524th Tactical Fighter Squadron.\nReactivated in 1977 as a General Dynamics F-111A Aardvark training squadron; inactivated 1979.  Reactivated in 1981 as an EF-111A Raven electronic warfare aircraft; inactivated 1982.  Reactivated in 2004 flying Naval Grumman EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft.  It was inactivated in 2010, being replaced by the 390th Electronic Combat Squadron.\nThe squadron was redesignated the 388th Electronic Warfare Squadron and activated in May 2024 at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 388th Bombardment Squadron (Light) on 28 January 1942\n: Activated on 15 March 1942\n: Redesignated 388th Bombardment Squadron (Dive) on 27 July 1942\n: Redesignated 388th Bombardment Squadron (Light) on 6 December 1943\n: Redesignated 388th Bombardment Squadron, Light c. 28 March 1944\n: Redesignated 388th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy on 19 July 1945\n: Inactivated on 4 January 1946\n* Redesignated 388th Bombardment Squadron, Very Heavy on 14 July 1947\n: Activated in the reserve on 30 July 1947\n: Inactivated on 27 June 1949\n* Redesignated 388th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 29 July 1954\n: Activated on 1 October 1954\n: Redesignated 388th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 July 1958\n: Inactivated on 18 February 1959\n* Redesignated 388th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron on 7 February 1977\n: Activated on 1 July 1977\n: Inactivated on 30 September 1979\n* Redesignated 388th Electronic Combat Squadron on 29 January 1981\n: Activated on 1 July 1981\n: Inactivated on 15 December 1982\n: Activated on 15 December 2004\n: Inactivated on 27 September 2010\n* Redesignated 388th Electronic Warfare Squadron\n: Activated 2 May 2024\nAssignments\n* 312th Bombardment Group, 15 March 1942 – 4 January 1946\n* Tenth Air Force, 30 July 1947\n* 312th Bombardment Group, 13 August 1947 – 27 June 1949\n* 312th Fighter-Bomber Group, 1 October 1954\n* 312th Fighter-Bomber Wing (later 312th Tactical Fighter Wing), 8 October 1957 – 18 February 1959 (attached to Air Task Force 13 (Provisional), 4 September–3 December 1958)\n* 366th Tactical Fighter Wing, 1 July 1977 – 30 September 1979\n* 366th Tactical Fighter Wing, 1 July 1981 – 15 December 1982\n* 366th Operations Group, 15 December 2004 – 27 September 2010\n* 850th Spectrum Warfare Group, 2 May 2024 – present\nStations\n* Bowman Field, Kentucky, 15 March 1942\n* Will Rogers Airport, Oklahoma, 12 June 1942\n* Hunter Field, Georgia, 18 August 1942\n* DeRidder Army Air Base, Louisiana, 18 February 1943\n* Rice Army Airfield, California, 13 April 1943\n* Salinas Army Air Base, California, 13 August – 24 October 1943\n* Jackson Airfield (7 Mile Drome), Port Moresby, New Guinea, 30 November 1943\n* Gusap Airfield, New Guinea,3 January 1944\n* Nadzab Airfield Complex, New Guinea, 11 June 1944\n* Hollandia Airfield Complex, Netherlands East Indies, 4 July 1944\n* Tanauan Airfield, Leyte, Philippines Commonwealth, 19 November 1944\n* McGuire Field, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, Philippines, 27 January 1945\n* Mangaldan Airfield, Luzon, Philippines, c. 11 February 1945\n* Floridablanca Airfield, Luzon, Philippines, 20 April 1945\n* Yontan Airfield, Okinawa, c. 12 August – 13 December 1945\n* Fort Lawton, Washington, 1–4 January 1946\n* Ellington Field (later Ellington Air Force Base), Texas, 30 July 1947 – 27 June 1949\n* Clovis Air Force Base (later Cannon Air Force Base), New Mexico, 1 October 1954 – 18 February 1959 (deployed to Chia Yi AB, Formosa, 4 September-3 December 1958)\n* Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, 1 July 1977 – 30 September 1979; 1 July 1981 – 15 December 1982\n* Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, Washington, 15 December 2004 – 27 September 2010\n* Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, 2 May 2024 – present\nAircraft\n* Vultee A-31 Vengeance, 1942–1943\n* Douglas A-24 Banshee, 1942–1943\n* North American A-36 Apache, 1943\n* Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, 1943–1944\n* Douglas A-20 Havoc, 1944–1945\n* North American F-86 Sabre, 1955–1956\n* North American F-100 Super Sabre, 1956–1959.\n* General Dynamics F-111A Aardvark, 1977–1979.\n* General Dynamics EF-111A Raven, 1981–1982.\n* Grumman EA-6B Prowler, 2004–2010\nReferences\nNotes\n; Explanatory notes\n; Citations\nBibliography\n*  (subscription required for web access)\n*\n*\n*"
