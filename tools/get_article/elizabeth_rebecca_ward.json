      "text": "# Elizabeth Rebecca Ward\n\nElizabeth Rebecca Ward (2 December 1880 – 16 April 1978) was a prolific English writer of popular verse, religious works, and works for children, writing under the pen-name Fay Inchfawn. Her works were serialised in women's magazines, and she was sometimes known as \"The Poet Laureate of the Home\".\nEarly life and family\nElizabeth Rebecca Ward was born Elizabeth Rebecca Daniels at Portishead, Somerset, on 2 December 1880. She married Atkinson Ward (1882 – October 1965) in 1911 in the Long Ashton district of Somerset. They moved to Bradford-on-Avon in Wiltshire and in 1913 had a daughter, Mary Arundell Ward (died 1983), who was known as \"Bunty\" in Ward's books. In 1927, the family moved to Innisfree, a Victorian villa at Freshford, Somerset, where she lived for the rest of her life.\nCareer\nWriting as Fay Inchfawn, Ward was a prolific author of books of popular verse during the years between the two World Wars. Her works were serialised in women's magazines and she was sometimes known as \"The Poet Laureate of the Home\". She also wrote books for children, some with her husband who used the pseudonym Philip Inchfawn, and numerous religious works.\nHer Salute to the village (Lutterworth, 1943) was a first-hand account of the effects of the Second World War on a middle-class provincial family, with locations and people disguised using pseudonyms. Although not identified in the book, the village is presumed to be Freshford. The book describes the influx of refugees from the bombing of nearby Bath in 1942 during the \"Baedeker raids\", economic and  resources shortages, the blackout, fire-watching, and the building of pill-boxes and barricades in the fields so that enemy gliders could not land. It was illustrated with line drawings by Alfred Bestall who also drew Rupert Bear for The Daily Express. The book was republished in 2010 by Folly Books with a new biographical introduction by Nick McCamley.\nHer memoirs were published by Lutterworth Press in 1963 as Those remembered days: A personal recording. This was followed by Something more to say: A personal recording in 1965 and Not the final word: Or, a joyful tribute in 1969.\nDeath\nElixabeth Ward died on 16 April 1978 at the age of 97 and is buried at St Mary's church, Limpley Stoke. A celebration of her life was held at St Mary's on what would have been her 100th birthday, which was written up for This England magazine.\nSelected publications\n* A book of remembrance.
