Based on the terms of the treaty, Charles especially acquired the English claimed county of Ponthieu. On the Burgundian side the accord was discussed by Charles, mainly assisted by his long-time favorite Guillaume de Bische and his councillor Ferry de Clugny ; on the French side it was negotiated by the king Louis himself and the Cardinal de la Balue.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060812033213/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/cely/cely1.html Richard III Society - The Cely Papers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060816052031/http://www.r3.org/bookcase/de_commynes/decom_3.html Philippe de Commynes Memoirs]\n\n---\n\n## Treaty of Peronne (1468)\n\n#REDIRECT Treaty of Péronne (1468)"
