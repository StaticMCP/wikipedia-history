Since foam-firing blasters are relatively safe and cheap, Nerf wars can include participants and battlefields otherwise unsuitable for airsoft and paintball, such as children.\nBackground\nA Nerf war is usually played by young children with connection to schooling. The activity is used for entertainment.\nNerf Internet community (NIC) wars\nMany wars across the United States are organized and promoted through the forums of enthusiast sites. The members of these forums are collectively known as the Nerf Internet Community (NIC).\nThe NIC holds large annual wars on both the East coast and West Coast of the United States and certain locations even have bi-annual or monthly wars. All around Australia there are wars as well, and a yearly event called Reign of Foam. Some colleges and youth groups have active clubs and associations that host Nerf wars regularly.\nSee also\n*Team deathmatch\n*Humans vs. Zombies\nReferences\nFurther sources\n*Sock It to Me: Competitive Knitters Get Deadly Serious; Based on 'Assassin' Game, This Contest Has Players On Pins and Needles.
