They had a 3.5-inch diameter and a non-explosive warhead, since they were used as an aircraft-launched anti-submarine warfare (ASW) rocket and worked by puncturing the hull. It was accurate enough for use against surface ships and land targets, but these missions required an explosive warhead. A five-inch anti-aircraft shell was attached to the 3.5-inch rocket motor, creating the five-inch FFAR, which entered service in December 1943.  Performance was limited because of the increased weight, limiting speed to 780&nbsp;km/h (485&nbsp;mph).  The high-velocity aircraft rocket, or HVAR, was developed to fix this flaw.\nThe FFAR was used by the Douglas SBD Dauntless (dive bomber), the Grumman TBF Avenger (torpedo bomber) and the Vought F4U Corsair (carrier based fighter).\nSee also\n* 2.75 inch FFAR\n* 3.5-Inch Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket\n* List of rockets\n*RP-3\n* Zuni rocket\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\nsv:Forward Firing Aircraft Rocket"
