Filming is scheduled to begin in mid-2026 at Pinewood Studios in England.\nAvengers: Secret Wars is scheduled to be released on December 17, 2027, as the final film of Phase Six of the MCU.\nCast\n* Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm / Invisible Woman: A member of the Fantastic Four and Reed Richards's wife who can generate force fields and turn invisible\n* Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Captain America: An Avenger and former pararescueman who was trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially-designed wing pack\n* Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm / The Thing: Richards's best friend, a former astronaut, and a member of the Fantastic Four encased in a layer of orange rock, granting him superhuman strength and durability\n* Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm / Human Torch: Sue's younger brother and a member of the Fantastic Four who can control fire and fly\n* Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic: A highly intelligent scientist and the leader of the Fantastic Four who can stretch any part of his body to great lengths\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom\n* Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange: A neurosurgeon who became a Master of the Mystic Arts following a career-ending car accident\n* Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter\n* Sadie Sink\nProduction\nProduction of Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars}}\nAfter directing the films Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), Anthony and Joe Russo expressed interest in directing a Secret Wars film based on the 1984–85 comic book crossover event written by Jim Shooter and the 2015–16 comic book storyline written by Jonathan Hickman. Both follow various Marvel characters who converge on the planet Battleworld. Infinity War and Endgame writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely said they would return to write such a film if the Russo brothers were directing it. At San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) in July 2022, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige announced the films Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. They were set to conclude \"The Multiverse Saga\", which covers Phases Four, Five, and Six of the MCU. The Kang Dynasty was inspired by a 2001–02 comic book storyline written by Kurt Busiek in which Kang the Conqueror travels through time to enslave humanity. Jonathan Majors was cast as Kang for several Phase Four projects, and was confirmed to be starring in both new Avengers films. Destin Daniel Cretton was hired to direct The Kang Dynasty, with Jeff Loveness writing the script, and Michael Waldron set to write Secret Wars.\nFollowing Majors's arrest in March 2023 and subsequent assault allegations, reports and speculation emerged about his future in the MCU. Loveness was no longer involved in the film by the start of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike in May, reportedly because he was closely associated with the Kang storyline and Marvel was \"moving away\" from that. In June, the release dates for The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars were pushed back to May 1, 2026, and May 7, 2027, respectively, in part due to the scripts not being ready before the strike. Cretton stepped down as director of The Kang Dynasty in November 2023, partially due to schedule delays, and Waldron was set to rewrite the film. The next month, Majors was fired by Disney and Marvel Studios after he was found guilty of harassment and reckless assault in the third degree. The studio had started referring to The Kang Dynasty internally as Avengers 5 by then. By February 2024, both Avengers 5 and Secret Wars were being rewritten to minimize Kang's role or remove him entirely following Majors's firing.\nBy May 2024, Marvel Studios had approached Robert Downey Jr.—who starred as Tony Stark / Iron Man in \"The Infinity Saga\", covering the MCU's Phases One, Two, and Three—about returning to the MCU to take on the new character of Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom. Downey said he would only return if the Russo brothers also returned as directors. After McFeely approached the Russos with an idea for the films that excited them, they entered early talks to direct both Avengers 5 and Secret Wars by mid-July. At SDCC at the end of the month, the Russos were confirmed to be directing the two films. They revealed that Avengers 5 was now titled Avengers: Doomsday, and both films would feature Downey as Doctor Doom. The Russos were producing the films through their production company AGBO, and McFeely had joined as writer for both films, working with Waldron. In May 2025, Disney delayed the release date to December 17, 2027, to allow more time for production to be completed.\nThe Russo brothers said Doomsday and Secret Wars were being produced together in a similar way to Infinity War and Endgame, but they would not be filmed back-to-back like those films were. Principal photography for Secret Wars is scheduled to begin in mid-2026 at Pinewood Studios, around a year after filming for Doomsday is completed, and last for around six months. Jeffrey Ford is editing the film, after working on previous MCU media.\nMusic\nIn April 2024, Alan Silvestri indicated that he could be composing the music for an upcoming MCU project after previously doing so for Infinity War, Endgame, and other MCU films. That July, he was confirmed to be returning as the composer for both Doomsday and Secret Wars.\nRelease\nAvengers: Secret Wars is scheduled to be released in the United States on December 17, 2027. The film is expected to be released in IMAX. It was originally scheduled for release on November 7, 2025, but was delayed to May 1, 2026, and then to May 7, 2027, in part due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, followed by another delay to the December 2027 release to allow more time for production to be completed. It will be the conclusion of Phase Six of the MCU.\n}}\nExternal links\n*  at Marvel.com\n*\n}}"
