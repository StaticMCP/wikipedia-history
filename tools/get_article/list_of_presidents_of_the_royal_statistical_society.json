The time-period between elections has varied in the past.\nThe president oversees the running of the Society and chairs its council meetings. He or she also gives a presidential address at some point in their tenure, which is published in the longest running journal of the society, Series A, setting out personal views on the future of discipline and the role of the society. In recent years, almost all presidents have been nominated following many years' service to the Society, although some have been nominated to mark their eminence in society generally, such as Harold Wilson.\nNominations for president are received by the society's Nominating Committee.\nThe committee recommends at least one fellow to Council who, at a meeting, agree a preferred candidate or candidates. If only one preferred candidate is selected, the Fellowship are given four weeks to offer an alternate candidate.\nThere has only been one contested election in the Society's history, in 1977.  Many fellows objected to the nomination by the Council of Campbell Adamson because he was not a statistician, was said to have made derogatory comments about statisticians, and principally because in the previous year he had been defeated in an election to the Council of the Society, and fellows felt that he was being foisted upon the Society by the current 'establishment' in an essentially undemocratic fashion.  Henry Wynn was nominated by several fellows (including Adrian Smith, himself later president, and Philip Dawid) and won the election.\nDespite women being elected fellows from 1858, only five have been president of the society. Three of these have been in the 21st century although the proportion remains biased to men with nine male presidents since 2001.\nIn 2010, Bernard Silverman stepped down very early in his presidential term. This was due to being appointed as chief scientific advisor to the Home Office which presented a conflict of interest as the society sometimes issues expert statements on statistical matters in public life. In 2022 then president-elect David Firth withdrew on health grounds, prompting a further election in which the immediate past-president, Andrew Garrett, was elected. The current president is Prof Sir John Aston.\nIn 2025, Enkhbilguun Enkhsaikhan was elected president, winning by 78 percent against Prof Sir John Aston.\nHonorary presidents\nThree Princes of Wales have been an honorary president:\n* 1872 - 1901 Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII)\n* 1902 - 1910 George, Prince of Wales (later George V)\n* 1921 - 1936 Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII)\nList of presidents\n19th century\n20th century\n21st century\n*2001–2003 Peter Green\n*2003–2005 Andrew P.
