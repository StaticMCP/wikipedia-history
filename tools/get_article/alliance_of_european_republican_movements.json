It was established in Stockholm in June 2010, after the wedding of Swedish Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling. The aim of the AERM is to provide a network for cross-party republican movements in all the countries of Europe that have a monarch as their head of state, in order to share information, resources and ideas and provide mutual assistance. Each member organisation will retain their autonomous national campaigns however, in recognition of their particular political and constitutional circumstances.\nThere are currently twelve extant monarchies in Europe. AERM has member organisations in six of these: Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It formerly had a presence in Belgium but the Belgian republican movement is no longer represented in AERM.\nThe AERM protested against the wedding of British Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011 in London, and planned to meet each year thereafter.\nThe AERM protested during the Coronation of King Charles. A video report on its Twitter channel about the arrest of protest organisers gathered millions of views and the interest of international media.\nMember organisations\n*: Republik nu (formerly DRGB or Den Republikanske Grundlovsbevægelse or The Republican Constitutional Movement), launched in 2010.\n*: Republiek.
