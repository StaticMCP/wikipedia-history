      "text": "# Mary Queen of Scots (unmade film)\n\nMary Queen of Scots is an unmade feature film from Alexander Mackendrick. It was almost made in the late 1960s but filming did not proceed. The script has been much acclaimed and has been the subject of academic appraisal as well as being adapted for radio.\nIt has been called Mackendrick's \"lost masterwork\".\nBackground\nAlexander Mackendrick developed the project for many years. He wrote a version of the script in 1961. Jay Presson Allen also worked on the script.\nIn May 1968 Universal announced they would finance.\nThe film focused on the last fifteen months of Mary's life in Scotland. \"I see her as the career girl of her time - a girl of real political intelligence and shrewdness,\" said Mackendrick. He said the film would be made in the style of a Western, saying Scotland of Mary's time was similarly lawless.\nIn 1969 Universal announced that Mia Farrow would play Mary Queen of Scots with filming to start in spring. Sandy Lieberson was the executive.\nHowever the film was cancelled in April 1969. Universal instead financed a Hal B. Wallis produced version of the story, Mary Queen of Scots. The experience prompted Mackendrick to retire from filmmaking.\nThe project developed a cult reputation and is one of the best known unfilmed scripts in British cinema. The script was adapted as a radio drama by the BBC in 2018.\nReferences"
