It was released on April 10, 2001, through Good Life Recordings. The release features the video for the title track \"Warmness on the Soul\" as an enhanced CD bonus. It is the band's first release to feature guitarist Synyster Gates, who joined the band in February 2001. All of the songs were later included on Avenged Sevenfold's debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, except for the heavy metal version of \"To End the Rapture\", which was featured on the album's re-release.\nSome of the band members' stage names are slightly different compared to their current ones. M. Shadows is simply credited as \"Shadows\", while Synyster Gates is credited as \"Synyster Gaytes\".\nMeaning\nWarmness on the Soul\" is about M. Shadows' girlfriend (now wife), Valary. In an interview, Shadows said about the sound, \"(We) wanted something really soft to break up the album. A lot of older metal bands did this and we liked the idea, so we just said fuck it and went with it.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video consists of scenes of the band performing, playing near the beach with Zacky Vengeance on lead guitar. The video centers around a woman (M. Shadows' wife) who is looking for the band members, who are wandering through city streets as she searches for them. Then the band walks onto a stage and performs the rest of the song.\nReception\nThe song was ranked at number 20 on Louder Sound's ranking of the best Avenged Sevenfold songs, and number 18 on Kerrang's.\nTrack listing\nAll songs are written by M.
