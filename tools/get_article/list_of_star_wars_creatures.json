      "text": "# List of Star Wars creatures\n\n}}\nThe universe of Star Wars, a space opera media franchise, features a broad variety of different alien creatures. These aliens can be sentient or non-sentient, serving as species for characters, setting pieces, plot devices, and background elements. The diversity of alien species in Star Wars is considered to be a strong point of the franchise. The creatures are designed to be believable, recognizable, and often endearing—in this way, many creatures from Star Wars have become well known in popular culture.\nThe types of creatures in this list are listed by category and then in alphabetical order.\nHumans and humanoid sentient species\nHumans\nHumans are a species in the fictional Star Wars universe. They are the most numerous and dominant species, with apparently millions of major and minor colonies galaxywide. Humans are native to many different worlds and are characterized by multidimensional complex personalities, that are both individual and unique. They are the only race accepted as pure by Emperor Palpatine.\nBy the time the hyperdrive was invented, humans were already present on a few scattered worlds throughout the galaxy; according to the New Essential Chronology, the humans of Coruscant managed to send out a number of 'sleeper ships' between the fall of the Rakatan Infinite Empire and the invention of the hyperdrive. Star Wars humans are mostly biologically identical to real-life humans.\nThe presence of ordinary humans in the story is important dramatically and the first movie establishes their vulnerability and weakness. Luke Skywalker's introduction early in the first movie was rewritten to establish this.\nIn the Star Wars mythology, the human homeworld, according to the New Essential Chronology, is generally believed to be Coruscant. However, there is actually no real consensus on the issue; according to releases from the official Starwars.com site, the ancient human home world has simply been lost to history.\nStar Wars humans live on many different worlds throughout the galaxy, with many populations living together with several other species—something which is most common either on the cosmopolitan worlds at the core, or on the frontier at the Outer Rim of the galaxy, such as on Tatooine.\n*Mandalorians: Mandalorians are a culture of humans using armors from Mandalore. They are descended from the Taung, a gray-skinned humanoid race native to Coruscant. The Taung are forced from Coruscant by the rising human population. The warring race name their new planet \"Mandalore\", after their leader, Mandalore the First. After the extinction of the Taung, the Mandalorian culture lives on and comprises various species from around the galaxy. \"The Mandalorian\", a newer show, follows one of them.\nHumanoid sentient species\nThe following is a list of Star Wars humanoid sentient species from the Star Wars franchise.\n* List of Star Wars species (A–E)\n** Dathomirians: The Zabrak, also known as Iridonians (when referring to the Zabrak who came from Iridonia), were a carnivorous humanoid species native to Iridonia, a planet located in the Mid Rim known for its inhospitable terrain and fierce predatory life. They were a race known for having a fierce sense of self-determination and an equally dominant need for independence. Zabrak resembled Humans to some degree, but had a number of significant physical characteristics that set them apart from baseline Humanity. The most striking of these were a series of vestigial horns that crowned the heads of both males and females. These horns grew at puberty in varying patterns and signified that the time of their rite of passage was drawing near, both Darth Maul and his brother Savage  were Zabraks.\n** Duros (or \"Durosians\") are humanoids from planet Duro, with large, ovular heads, red eyes and blue skin.  They were supposedly the first to discover and utilize hyperspace, resulting in the development of hyperdrives and other related technological advancements.  They are proud of their heritage and many take up the mantle of spacefarer.  Some have made a name for themselves, such as Cad Bane, a notorious Duros bounty hunter.  Others prefer a simpler life, and can be found in Mos Eisley quite often.\n** Ewok: The Ewok is a small, sentient furry creature who lives in trees on the forest moon of Endor.\n* List of Star Wars species (F–J)\n** Jawa: Jawa are creatures that inhabit Tatooine. They wear hoods over their heads to cover their identities from outsiders. They roam the land in sandcrawlers, dealing in droids and spare parts for space ships.\n** Geonosian: Geonosians are sentient, winged insectoid creatures native to Geonosis.\n** Gungans: Gungans are sentient amphibious creatures native to the swamps of Naboo.  Gungans first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. Jar Jar Binks, a main character, is a Gungan, and despite his lack of intelligence, he becomes a representative in the galactic senate in place of Padme Amadala.\n** Ithorians: Ithorians are a hammer-headed humanoid species. They have appeared in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Star Wars: Bounty Hunter.\n** Hutts: Hutts are portly, grotesque, slug-like creatures native to Nal Hutta.

Some famous Hutts, such as Jabba the Hutt, are crime lords.\n* List of Star Wars species (K–O)\n** Kaminoans Kaminoans are tall, blueish gray humanoids with long slender necks and small bulb-ish heads. Native to the planet Kamino, they were instrumental in building and maintaining the clone army used by Republic forces.\n** Neimoidian:Neimoidians are large-eyed, amphibian and reptilian-like sapient bipeds native to the planet of Neimoidia. Many Neimoidians are wealthy businessmen. Despite their commonly menacing attitudes, however, Neimoidians are generally dishonest and easily frightened, preferring to lie even to their leaders, whether it be for profit or for self-safety.\n** Noghri: Noghri are short, bipedal, sapient beings native to Honoghr.  The Galactic Empire usually employed them as assassins. Later, Leia Organa Solo was able to prove how they were duped into service, and they swore allegiance to her and her family.  They often worked as guards for the New Republic.\n* List of Star Wars species (P–T)\n** Togruta: Togruta are species from the planet Shili. They are a humanoid race distinguished by their three, and rarely 4, lekku (similar to those of Twi'leks, and more commonly called 'head tails'), which are striped to help them blend in with their natural surroundings. Togruta possess a form of passive echolocation by means of their hollow montrals, which allows them to sense space and the proximity and movement of physical objects around them. Togruta work well in large groups, and individualism is seen as abnormal within their culture. Jedi Shaak Ti and Anakin Skywalker's former Padawan Ahsoka Tano are togrutan.\n** Tusken Raiders: Tusken Raiders, also known as Sand People, are vicious humanoid creatures native to Tatooine. \"Tuskens\" are almost always wrapped completely in clothing, concealing their identity.

Their culture strongly suggests male rule and has been that way since Nola Tarkona founded the Diversity Alliance in the Young Jedi Knights series of books. These creatures have two \"head-tails\" called lekku'' that extend from the back of their head. The muscles in these tails can be used to relate the mood of their owner. Most of twi'lek economy is based on slave trade. Female slaves were sold as dancers, assistants, and into other lowly jobs until Nola took over Ryloth. After her takeover most of the economy was based on Ryll spice, which grows native in the caves of Ryloth. Known twi'lek include Jedi master Aayla Secura; Mission and Griff Vao from the game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic; and Oola, a slave dancer in Jabba the Hutt's Palace on Tatooine.\n* List of Star Wars species (U–Z)\n** Wookiee: Wookiees are large, hairy, ape-like creatures, native to Kashyyyk; they slightly resemble the modern day depictions of Sasquatch.

Their strong jaws have a horny exterior beak that is able to crush thick bones. They have a long tail that acts as a counterbalance during sprints, and helps to regulate their internal temperature. They range in weights between 25 and 40 kilograms (though the males are often larger than females). Anoobas have unregulated appetites, and they will gorge until they can no longer move. They are social animals and hunt in packs of 10 to 12, within the pack there are 2 dominant adults, an alpha male, and an alpha female.

Herds of bantha inhabit the desert wastes of Tatooine in the outer Rim, as well as grasslands and plains of other worlds throughout the Star Wars galaxy. They are very sociable animals, have long sticky tongues to catch prey, and are notorious for their smell. Since bantha are found in such a large number of agricultural systems, it is believed that early space settlers transported the species to new worlds. Although largely domesticated, on some planets wild herds can still be found. There are several known varieties of banthas in existence, including the common bantha (Bantha majorus), the smaller, shy dwarf bantha, and the rangier, slender dune bantha. One specific subtype of bantha is the Kashyyyk grayclimber, which differs in that the grayclimber has massive cranial bone plates in place of horns; it has also adapted to climbing through the evolution of articulated toes that can grip wroshyr trees. Banthas can be seen in video games and the movie Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. They can also be found in The Mandalorian \"Chapter 9: The Marshal\". Also Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. They were commonly used on Tatooine by the Tusken Raiders. The Tusken Raiders form symbiotic bonds with banthas. When the Tusken Raiders reach the age of seven, a bantha of the same gender is ceremoniously given to the youngling, as its partner in life. When Tusken Raiders marry, the couple's banthas mate. When the Tusken Raiders have offspring, the banthas often produce an offspring of the same gender at the same time. Upon the death of a bantha or a Tusken Raider, the species left behind will often commit suicide.\nBarri\nBarri are enigmatic spacefaring creatures that can hitch rides on asteroids and derelict spacecraft for thousands of years in space.

They are native to the planet Ahch-To, where Jedi Master Luke Skywalker made his exile in the years following the victory over the Galactic Empire. They are introduced in The Last Jedi and are known for how \"insanely cute\" they are, serving as comic relief. The creatures, who dwell on the cliffs of the island where Skywalker lives in exile, could build nests and fly. Male porgs are known to be slightly bigger in size than females; baby porgs are called porglets. A flock of porgs is known as a murder. During The Last Jedi, one porg finds its way aboard the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca; they serve as a foil for the Wookiee. A porg also appears in The Rise of Skywalker when Rey travels to Ahch-To.\nThe introduction of the porgs was somewhat controversial, with some critics claiming the creatures were introduced to cater to children and boost merchandise sales. However, the production team has stated that the porgs were created to account for the puffins in the background of outdoor shots set on Ahch-To. Puffins are native to the Skellig Islands, which served as the filming location of Ahch-To, and local conservation laws prevented the filmmakers from taking actions that would keep the puffins out of frame. They either had to remove the puffins from the shots with digital editing or disguise them as something else to maintain continuity. Disguising the puffins proved technically easier and cheaper than removing them, which led to the development of the porgs. The porgs' voices were created through a mixture of sounds from turkeys, chickens, and doves.\nPylat bird\nPylat birds are beautiful white and black cockatiels that inhabit Neimoidia and are a symbol of their owner's wealth.\nWoodoo\nWoodoos are carnivorous ground dwelling birds native to Tatooine.\nBlase Tree Goat\nThe Blase Tree Goat, as called by the natives who live on Endor, is known across the galaxy as a Choreamnos.

It eats anything foolish enough to come near, which it traps by spitting a gluey fluid that becomes silk and entwines it.\nTauntaun\nTaunton|Tonton (disambiguation)|Ton-Taun}}\nTauntauns are 2.5&nbsp;m (8.2&nbsp;ft) tall bipedal snow reptiles, indigenous to the ice planet Hoth. Tauntauns superficially resemble a robust kangaroo, but are covered with white fur and have downturned horns, four nostrils, and a foul body odor. They graze on lichen, moss and fungi found in ice grottoes as a food source, as well as scavenging on frozen flesh or small rodents; their own meat is unfit for human consumption. They are used as mounts by the Rebel Alliance during their occupation of Echo Base. The tauntaun's thick layers of fat and fur provide adequate protection from the cold during the daytime, but it cannot survive exposure to the cold of night. Due to oil excreted from their skin, tauntauns give off a very unpleasant odor. They are the primary prey of the wampa.\nThe species was designed for The Empire Strikes Back (1980) by Ralph McQuarrie, Joe Johnston, and Phil Tippett. It was conceived early on as being more dinosaur-like, similar to the blurrg. Mechanical costumes were considered for shots featuring live-action actors, but were found to be unpractical. Instead, the creatures were primarily created via stop motion animation (including motion control) under Phil Tippett. Their animation was significant because of the use of go motion (making their motion more consistent with live action). A specimen is featured prominently on the film's theatrical poster. A mounted tauntaun head appears in Return of the Jedi (1983) next to Jabba the Hutt's favorite trophy, the frozen Han Solo.\nTerecon\nPredators on the planet Essowyn, terecons are reptiles, who attack by burrowing into the ground and leaping spectacularly upon their unsuspecting prey. They can grow up to 1&nbsp;m (3.3&nbsp;ft) tall and 8&nbsp;m (26.2&nbsp;ft) long.\nTerentatek\nA creature mentioned in the video game Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, presumably created by the Sith to kill Jedi. On the Jedi Academy on Dantooine, a Twi'lek Jedi teaches Revan about an event called 'The Great Hunt' where numerous Jedi were sent out to kill the creatures. In the game Terentateks are encountered in the Kashyyyk Shadow lands (it is referred to as 'the ritual beast'), in Naga Sadow's tomb on Korriban and the Shyrack Cave on Korriban. Terentateks feed on force adepts, and are found where the dark side thrives. Slow but powerful, Terentateks use their large claws to strike foes. Many Jedi have fallen to the dark side on their quest to rid the galaxy of these abominations.\nTesfli piercer\nTesfli piercers are tiny flying insects, who inhabit the dense swamps of the planet Gorsh and live in swarms. Although their bites are not lethal, they sometimes carry dangerous \"rotting disease\" that simulates gangrene.\nThernbee\nThernbees are fearsome beasts with psychic abilities, that live on Almania. They are hairy and have giant teeth and large claws, similar to a wolf or lion. They are generally quite playful creatures and are often kept as pets, though are also used as watchdogs. They possess numbing saliva.\nThevaxan marauder\nAn enormous reptilian predator on the planet Gorsh, the Thevaxan marauder can always be heard approaching its prey, being a loud, dimwitted and clumsy beast. It can grow up to 20&nbsp;m (65.6&nbsp;ft) long and 8&nbsp;m (26.2&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder.\nThranta\nThrantas are a group of flying animals found on Alderaan, Bespin, and Coruscant. While there are multiple breeds varying in size and functions (some for personal travel, others for massive air ferries), most thrantas serve the purpose of aerial transport. The predominant physical feature of these creatures are their manta ray-like figure.\nTorton\nTortons are red and green turtle-like creatures with long legs. They originated on Naboo's moon of Rori.\nTolibs\nTolibs are large swamp birds that live on the planet Mimban.\nTra'cor\nThe \"Tra'cor\" is an amphibious relative of the rancor. Like the rancor, it possessed a hostile temper, but is smaller than the rancor and almost completely water bound. The tra'cor will feed on moss and grasses growing underwater, but will also eat meat whenever it presents itself. These water creatures wait to ambush creatures that come to the water to have a drink. It is found on the planet Socorro and will also walk on land.\nTreppok\nTreppoks are enormous fish that grow up to 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) long on the ocean planet of Baralou. They are the herd animals of the sentient species Krikthasi.\nTunnel snake\nTunnel snakes are poisonous snakes found in jungle regions of planets, such as Kashyyyk and Wayland.\nTuskcat\nTuskcats are tiger-like animals that live on Naboo and possibly other planets, such as Orto Plutonia. They had very long saber-tooth fangs, hence their name, and are also called \"Nabooan Tusked Panthers\" or Nabooan tusk-cat.\nTusken Raider\nU\nUbeba\nUbebas are simians, native to the planet Cholganna.\nUgja\nUgja are solitary creatures, native to the planet Cholganna.\nUgnaught\nUgnaughts are small, humanoid creatures that are seen commonly on Bespin.

They are native to the planet Utapau. Their toes allow them to climb almost vertically. They seem to have the head of a bird and a body of a gecko, and their call is a short warble-type sound. A female one named Boga is ridden by Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith.\nVeermok\nVeermoks are guard creatures found on Naboo and Mimban. They resemble lanky, upright, and formidable gorillas. They are useful as guards because they are nearly immune to blaster fire. The Systech Weapons Corporation developed two extremely powerful blasters, the Systech Static Blaster and the Systech Electric Blaster, to counter, to counter its ferociousness.\nVelker\nVelker are star fighter shaped creatures found on the planet Bespin.\nVexis\nVexis are serpent-like creatures found on planet Pasaana that dwell primarily in caves existing without eyesight and detect prey by electromagnetic activity.\nVoorpak\nVoorpaks are small carnivores that look like balls of fur standing on stick-like legs. They are kept as pets. They can be found on Naboo.\nVornskr\nVornskrs are ferret-like creatures that lived in the planet Myrkr. It possesses the unusual ability to hunt using the Force. They are wild, aggressive and vicious beasts. The voxyn race created by the Yuuzhan Vong to hunt and kill Jedi were a hybrid of the vornskr and the Yuuzhan Vong fero\nVulptex\nVulptices are fox-like animals, native to the mineral planet Crait. They live in caves under Crait's salt crust in groups called skulks.

The most well known Wookiee in Star Wars is Chewbacca, first appering in Star Wars: A New Hope. In Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith an army of Wookiees fight against the Clone Troopers.\nWampa\nWampas are a horned, clawed, white-furred, carnivorous species of snow monsters native to the frozen world of Hoth. They are a semi-sentient race of predators standing over 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) in height, subsisting in the cold climate by hunting tauntauns—their primary prey. Wampas are usually solitary creatures, but are known to occasionally hunt in packs. Their white fur allows wampas to blend-in with Hoth's blinding blizzards, enabling them to catch their prey completely unaware. Once they have made their kill, wampas drag the carcasses back to their icy lair, where they suspend them from the ceiling until ready to eat them. Due to the extreme temperatures of Hoth and the cold-blooded nature of the wampa, the creatures are difficult to track on radar. A similar species is believed to inhabit the planet Gall, in the Outer Rim.\nThe wampa made its first appearance in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), as a predator that attacks Luke and eats his tauntaun. Several other wampa sequences were planned for The Empire Strikes Back, but were ultimately cut. The wampa also made an appearance in the Family Guy special \"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\" (2009), being depicted as Cookie Monster from Sesame Street.\nTatooine Howler\nThe Tatooine Howler, also commonly referred to as the Desert Wampa, is a native species of Tatooine that resembles the Wampas of the planet Hoth, despite having no genetic relation. They are intelligent and solitary creatures, hunting for prey on their own.\nWandrella\nWandrellas are  long worms, found in the muddy plains of the jungle-covered planet Mimban. The wandrella's thoughts are primitive, and it often charges at its prey, using its armored belly to quickly move forward. This large beast has phosphorescent skin, streaked with brown, and has a cluster of several eyes on one end.\nWoolamander\nA woolamander is an ape-like animal native to Yavin IV.  It has a blue furred body, a long, multi-colored tail, a prominent belly, and a multi-colored face. Its chief enemy is the syntaril.\nWolf\nGarral\nGarrals are wolf-like creatures that live in the forests of Wayland and Cholganna.\nLoth-wolf\nThe Loth-wolf is a near-legendary, Force-sensitive large canid native to Lothal, known since prehistoric times on that world by its inhabitants. A white-furred one occasionally assisted Ezra Bridger on Lothal in the Star Wars Rebels TV series.\nWorm\nBlenjeel Sand Worm\nGigantic carnivorous caterpillar-like creatures with round mouths filled with sharp teeth, inhabit the planet Blenjeel.  The worms are blind, but can detect motion. They appear in the game Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. They are likely a reference to the sandworms from Dune.\nConduit worm\nThe conduit worm is a long worm that lives in the electrical wiring channels of underground Coruscant and thrives on the electrical currents sent through them. They may also be attracted to the electric activity in brains, if they do not find a stronger electrical power source to feed on. As such, many a person has awoken on Coruscant to find one of the worm's feelers creeping into their ears. The worms can end up on starships, causing power outages, and are treated as vermin.\nGlim worm\nGlim worms are tunneling 1&nbsp;m (3.3&nbsp;ft) long predators, found on many planets. They are covered by sharp, flexible scales that move to propel the worms through sand or soil at speeds up to 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph). They are also hunted for their skin for use as clothing, and their slime for use as adhesive.\nSpace slug\nSpace slugs, also called exogorths or giant asteroid worms, are silicon-based gastropods capable of surviving in near-vacuum conditions. Space slugs generally make their habitats in asteroids, where they spend the majority of their lives. Many space slugs have been found in Hoth's asteroid field, some reaching thousands of meters (feet) in length, up to a recorded maximum around , although most are much smaller at around . They feed by absorbing an asteroid's minerals through their roots. Smaller space slugs also devour mynocks (in large space slugs, consumed mynocks are not digested and instead become parasites within the space slug). Large space slugs may also consume starships and have been known to eat sections of Imperial Star Destroyers that flew too close. The burrow of a space slug is called a \"caysh\". They first appeared in The Empire Strikes Back (1980).\nWorrt\nWorrts are frog-like creatures native to Tatooine. They feed on mostly insects and rodents and catch prey by sitting stationary in the sand and using their long tongues to catch and wrap around passing animals. Jabba the Hutt kept a number of worrts for pest control. One is briefly seen in Return of the Jedi outside Jabba's palace. It catches an animal with its tongue, swallows it, and burps. They are sometimes confused with frog-dogs.\nWraid\nWraids are large, lizard-like creatures that live and are hunted for their armored head plates on the desert planet of Tatooine. There is also a subspecies on Korriban.\nWyrwulves\nWyrwulves are six-legged, dog-like animals that were in fact the children of the Codru-Ji race. When a wyrwulf reaches puberty, it encases itself in a cocoon, from which a Codru-Ji adult emerges several weeks later. They can be found on Munto Codru.\nY\nYeltz\nYeltz is an amphibious species that resides in the artificial outpost planets of the Lupania ring. No one but Yaddle has seen the creature, and thus it is still regarded as a legend. They are thought to possess the ability to turn transparent under water. When submerged, they are fearsome predators, but when on-land, they are shy and tamable.\nYeomet\nYeomets are trash-eating quadrupeds that live on artificial habitats, like space stations or large capital ships. They are able to eat almost any form of matter, thanks to a special digestive enzyme triggered by strong electromagnetic radiation. They carry disease.\nYorik coral\nYorik coral was the primary shipbuilding material of the Yuuzhan Vong. It was grown on-planet in the shape of a ship. Later, symbiotic creatures were implanted or grown within it to form the ship's functions. The completed yorik ship had a nervous system that controlled and coordinated the various functions, and a circulatory system that sustained them.\nYsalamiri\nYsalamiri are furry salamander-like creatures that live on Myrkr. They have the unique property of repelling the Force, rendering all Force powers within their sphere of influence void; for this reason, they are prominently used by Grand Admiral Thrawn in his campaigns against the New Republic. The supposed reason for the Force bubble is that it acts as a way to hide from the other unique carnivores of Myrkr that use the Force to hunt down prey, such as the vornskr. The term \"bubble\" is particularly apt because, like water bubbles underwater, multiple ysalamiri's bubbles reinforce each other instead of overlapping. Because of this, large sections of Myrkr are completely removed from the Force.\nZ\nZakkeg\nZakkegs are large beasts that reside on Dxun. They are relatively solitary creatures, with thick hides, and covered in spikes and horns. Along with their tough hide for defense, they are also immune to most Force powers. Zakkeg are tough, and are a good challenge for Mandalorians.\nZillo Beast\nThe Zillo Beast is a lengthy creature sporting the unique feature of five limbs, the fifth protruding from behind its shoulder blades. It first appeared in the second season of the popular Cartoon Network series The Clone Wars, toward the end of the season. It was the dominant predator on Malastare before the Dugs wiped them out using various methods, including drilling for fuel that poisons them. Though they were rendered extinct, rumors spread of a surviving Zillo that would bring about their apocalypse. While the Republic engaged in a battle against droids on the planet, they tested a new weapon (a type of E.M.P) over the hollow ground concealing the last Zillo Beast in its cave. Destroying the droids and accidentally opening up the ground leading below, the Dugs immediately wanted to kill the five-story high creature, the last of its kind. Seeing its armor was resistant to most projectiles, including lightsabres, the Republic tricked the Dugs into thinking that the beast perished and instead transported it to Coruscant for study. Before study was over, Palpatine ordered the beast to be killed anyway, but the Zillo Beast broke from its prison to hunt Palpatine down in the nearby Senate building. Because of this and the danger it posed to the citizens of Coruscant, the beast was, shortly after escaping, killed using a toxin gas converted from Malastare fuel. At the end of the episode, Palpatine informs doctor Sionver Boll he wants the beast cloned.\nReferences\nSources\nExternal links\n* [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Essential_Guide_to_Alien_Species The Essential Guide to Alien Species] on Wookieepedia"
