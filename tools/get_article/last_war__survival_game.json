The game sets in a post-apocalyptic zombie setting, featuring base building, hero recruitment, and resource management.\nThe game has achieved over $2 billion in lifetime revenue by February 2025 and become one of the top five highest-grossing mobile games of 2024. However, the game was also controversial for its refund policy.\nDevelopment\nLast War: Survival Game was originally developed by First Fun HK LTD., a company founded in June 2020 by Xie Xianlin, who previously served as the founding CTO of Elex Technology.\nElex Technology was a Tencent-backed game developer that achieved success with Clash of Kings before being acquired for $433 million in 2014. Development and publishing responsibilities were later transferred to FUNFLY PTE. LTD., a Singapore-based company incorporated in February 2024.\nThe development team also developed Top War: Battle Game, which generated approximately $1.1 billion in lifetime revenue. Tencent maintains an investment stake of approximately 10.71% in the original development company, Beijing Yuanqu Entertainment Co., Ltd.\nCommercial performance\nLast War: Survival Game started with $287,000 in revenue during its August 2023 launch month but experienced explosive growth throughout 2024. The game's monthly revenue increased from $30 million in January 2024 to $138 million by December 2024, representing a 360% growth rate.\nMarketing strategy\nLast War: Survival Game partnered with actor Antony Starr for a major Q4 2024 campaign that directly addressed the \"misleading ads\" controversy with the tagline \"It's called Last War. It's going viral because the developers made a real game based off the fake game in the ads.\" The campaign generated over 12.5 million downloads and propelled the game to #1 most downloaded in the US.\nReferences"
