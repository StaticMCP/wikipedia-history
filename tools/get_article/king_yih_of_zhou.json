Estimated dates of his reign are 899–892 BC or 899–873 BC.\nKing Yi's reign is poorly documented. The first year of his reign is confirmed by a solar eclipse on April 21, 899. He was succeeded to the throne by his uncle King Xiao, who was in turn succeeded by King Yi's son King Yí, who was \"restored by the many lords\". He is said to have moved from the capital to a locality called Huaili. This hints that he was removed from power by his uncle, but the matter is uncertain. Yi's grandson was King Li of Zhou.\nFamily\nQueens:\n* Wang Bo Jiang, of the Jiang clan (), the mother of Crown Prince Xie and a daughter\nSons:\n* Crown Prince Xie (; d. 878 BC), ruled as King Yí of Zhou from 885 to 878 BC\nSee also\n* Family tree of Chinese monarchs (ancient)\nSources"
