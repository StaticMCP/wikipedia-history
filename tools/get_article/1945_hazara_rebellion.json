Its causes laid in the introduction of a new tax imposed only on the Hazaras. It began in November 1945, when Hazara Rebels under Ibrahim Khan, also known as \"Bačča-Gāw-sawār\" (Son of the bull rider) revolted against the local administration of Shahristan. After a siege lasting for about a week, the district, as well as arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the rebels.\nThere are two different accounts as to how the rebellion ended: According to Encyclopædia Iranica, the Afghan government sent a force to pacify the region and subsequently withdrew the tax. According to Niamatullah Ibrahimi, it ended in spring 1946, when Mohammed Zahir Shah sent a delegation to the rebels, offering to lift the tax if the rebels laid down their arms, which was accepted.\nReferences"
