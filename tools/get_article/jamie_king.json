His work directing concert tours for pop stars has grossed over $2 billion as of 2011.\nEarly career\nKing started his career in entertainment as a dancer. He appeared on the Cher video for \"Love And Understanding\" and went on tour with Michael Jackson on his Dangerous World Tour in 1992. Afterwards he worked as a director and choreographer in Prince's Glam Slam West nightclub in Los Angeles. While there, King created a new show every week using songs that Prince was unable to commercially release due to legal obligations to Warner Bros. Records. It was during this time that King learned staging. After seeing a performance by Prince at the American Music Awards of 1995 (that King directed and choreographed), Madonna called King to talk about the two of them working together. The first time they worked together was when he choreographed her 1995 music video \"Human Nature\".\nFitness ventures\nIn 2004, King teamed up with Nike to create the Nike Rockstar Workout for use in Crunch Fitness gyms across the United States. In 2007, he released his Rock Your Body fitness DVD which sold 100,000 copies.\nCirque du Soleil, Super Bowl, and ''Q'Viva\nIn 2011 King wrote and directed a touring show by Cirque du Soleil dedicated to Michael Jackson called Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour''. In 2012, he co-created the boy band IM5 with Perez Hilton and Simon Fuller and directed Madonna's Super Bowl XLVI halftime performance. This performance marked the third time he appeared at Super Bowl for work. His first appearance was in 1993 as a dancer in Michael Jackson's performance at Super Bowl XXVII. He returned in 1996 as a choreographer for Diana Ross' performance at Super Bowl XXX.\nAlso in 2012, he produced the Latin-themed entertainment show ''Q'Viva! The Chosen'' with Simon Fuller, Marc Anthony, and Jennifer Lopez. The show was King's first experience working in television rather than stage; however, the singers, instrumentalists, and dancers scouted from the show did give a one-time sold-out performance at the Mandalay Bay Events Center which King also directed. King was the producer for Madonna's 2012 MDNA Tour which marked the first time since Madonna's 2001 Drowned World Tour that he had not been her tour's creative director.\nIn 2013, King directed another Cirque Du Soleil Michael Jackson-themed show called Michael Jackson: One. Unlike the touring show Immortal, Michael Jackson: One is a resident stage show housed at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Later in the year, King was the creative director for the third season of The X Factor.\nIn 2014, King directed Bruno Mars' Super Bowl XLVIII halftime performance which marked the fourth time he had appeared at Super Bowl for work.\nTours\nKing was the director for the following tours/productions:\n* 1996: Take Me Higher: A Celebration of 30 years of the Super Bowl halftime show - Diana Ross\n* 1997: Soft & Gentle 'No Sweat' Tour – Louise Redknapp\n* 1999-2000: Livin' la Vida Loca Tour – Ricky Martin\n* 2000-2001: Oops!...
