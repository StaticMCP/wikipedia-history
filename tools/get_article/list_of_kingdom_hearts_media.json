      "text": "# List of Kingdom Hearts media\n\nKingdom Hearts is a series of action role-playing games developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square). It is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix and Disney Interactive Studios, combining characters and elements from Square Enix's Final Fantasy series and multiple Disney franchises. Currently the series includes seven video games released on various platforms, a manga series, a novel series, video game soundtracks released on audio CDs, and a collectible card game.\nThe video games provide the canonical story of the series. The manga series is adapted by Shiro Amano and the novels are written by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The stories follow the events that take place in the video games with differences to account for the loss of interactivity that a video game provides. The manga and novel series are both divided up into three series based on each of the three main video games. Each series is further broken up into multiple volumes. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square's Monthly Shonen Gangan, but has since been released worldwide. The manga was released in the United States by Tokyopop near the end of 2005, but was discontinued in 2008.\nGames\nVideo games\nEach game in the series has been critically and commercially successful, though each title has seen different levels of success. As of December 2006, the Kingdom Hearts series has shipped over 10 million copies worldwide, with 2.0 million copies in PAL regions, 3.0 million copies in Japan, and 5.6 million copies in North America. The main games in the series were released in chronological order, with each new game following the  events of the previous. The exception is the V CAST mobile game, which was developed independently of Square Enix's games. Three new titles in the series were announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Coded and Mobile were only released for Japan. Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory is the latest game of the series, being released worldwide on November 11, 2020.\n| release2=September 17, 2002\n| release3=November 15, 2002\n| notes=*Released on the PlayStation 2\n*Developed by Square Enix\n*North American and PAL release featured additional content that was not in the original Japanese version.\n*An international version was released exclusively in Japan  as Kingdom Hearts Final Mix on December 26, 2002.
