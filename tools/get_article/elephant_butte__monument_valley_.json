Precipitation runoff from this butte's slopes drains into Gypsum Creek which is a tributary of the San Juan River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises  above the surrounding terrain in 0.25&nbsp;mile (0.4&nbsp;km). The nearest higher neighbor is Three Sisters,  to the southwest. The landform's toponym has been officially adopted by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, and the descriptive name refers to the resemblance of an elephant's profile viewed from a south perspective.\nGeology\nElephant Butte is a butte composed of three principal strata. The bottom layer is slope-forming Organ Rock Shale, the next stratum is cliff-forming De Chelly Sandstone, and the upper layer is Moenkopi Formation. The rock ranges in age from Permian at the bottom to Early Triassic at the top. The buttes and mesas of Monument Valley are the result of the Organ Rock Shale being more easily eroded than the overlaying sandstone.\nClimate\nSpring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Elephant Butte. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a semi-arid climate zone with cold winters and hot summers. Summers average 54 days above  annually, and highs rarely exceed . Summer nights are comfortably cool, and temperatures drop quickly after sunset. Winters are cold, but daytime highs are usually above freezing. Winter temperatures below  are uncommon, though possible. This desert climate receives less than  of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.\nSee also\n* List of appearances of Monument Valley in the media\nGallery\nFile:Monument Valley Elephant Butte.jpg|Northwest aspect\nFile:North Window Viewpoint.jpg|Looking north through Monument Valley's North Window Viewpoint.South aspect of Elephant Butte to the left.\nFile:Elephant Butte in Monument Valley.jpg|East aspect\nFile:Road to the Valley, Spearhead Mesa, Elephant Butte and Camel Butte (46733088621).jpg|Spearhead Mesa (left), Elephant Butte (center), Camel Butte (right)\nFile:Monument Valley 4.JPG|Southwest aspect\nFile:Merrick and Elephant Butte.jpg|Merrick Butte (left) and Elephant Butte (right)\nFile:Elephant Butte.jpg|WSW aspect\nFile:Monument Valley panorama (33447523091).jpg|Elephant Butte (right) viewed from John Ford Point\nFile:North Window Overlook.jpg|Southeast aspect of Elephant Butte viewed from North Window Overlook\nFile:West-southwest aspect Elephant Butte.jpg|West-southwest aspect Elephant Butte\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather forecast: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-5294054/United%20States/Arizona/Navajo%20County/Elephant%20Butte Elephant Butte]"
