Princess Kitana, Kintaro, General Reiko, and Jade lead the Emperor's first wave invasion force of Outworld warriors and Netherrealm demons, laying siege against the Wu Shi monastery, but are repelled by Kung Lao and Special Forces cybernetically enhanced Jackson Briggs and NYPD officer Kurtis Stryker. At the onset of their assault, Kitana and the Outworld commanders are confronted by movie star Johnny Cage and Jax's partner Sonya Blade.\nWhen Johnny and Sonya are soon joined by Liu Kang and Raiden as negotiations fail, Shao Kahn appears himself, petitioning Raiden to participate in a final Mortal Kombat tournament to permanently decide Earthrealm's fate. The thunder god agrees, and he and Shao Kahn venture to the realm of the Elder Gods to propose this ultimate contest.\nMeanwhile, Scorpion reawakens back in the Netherrealm. He is confronted by the enraged Elder God Shinnok over the death of his favored servant Quan Chi. The Netherrealm lord engineers Scorpion's entrance into Earthrealm to utilize the key embedded in his body to find the final piece of his puzzle, anonymously hiring the Lin Kuei clan in tracking him down to claim his prize. Back in Earthrealm, Lin Kuei members Kuai Liang and Smoke are summoned by the grandmaster to participate in said request. But are horrified to witness missing peers they would questioned the whereabouts of prior to their urged presence having undergone cybernetic biomodifications as a means to strengthen the clan, with the juniors expected to do the same. Liang and Smoke rebel, with Liang being the only one to flee successfully. Liang then adopts his deceased brother's codename, Sub-Zero.\nBack at the Wu Shi Temple, Raiden returns to his troops after arranging to hold and participate in the tournament while relinquishing his immortality. Once the Earthrealm warriors head for Outworld, Scorpion makes his presence known to Raiden. He mentions the key to Shinnok's prison has bonded to his soul and came to Raiden for advice about its purpose. Raiden informs him that it is a key to untold power known as the Kamidogu, a supreme magical relic from a bygone era that could doom all the realms.\nAt the start of the tournament, Cage is defeated by Kytinn warrior D'Vorah; Sonya defeats D'Vorah and Li Mei; Liu Kang defeats Jade; Stryker defeats Baraka; Jax defeats Kintaro by ripping his arms out of their sockets.\nBack on Earth, Scorpion is being pursued by Cyrax and Sektor in a dockside shipping yard. The trio is soon interrupted by Sub-Zero, but even he is outmatched by their superior enhancements and the arrival of the cybernetic Smoke. With their enemies overwhelmed, the three cyber Lin Kuei apprehend their Hellspawn prey and make off to the Temple of Elements. At their destination, they force Hanzo to open their designated portal. As they prepare to eliminate him upon accessing its gateway, they are interrupted again by a vengeful Sub-Zero. Scorpion fails to console Kuai Liang over mistakenly murdering his brother but agrees to a temporary alliance against Sub-Zero's clan. Despite their efforts, the Lin Kuei retrieve the Kamidogu, leaving the pair for dead when the mountain crumbles on top of them.\nAs the second half of the final tournament is underway, Lao and Stryker are killed by Shao Kahn and Shang Tsung, respectively. Raiden is then defeated by Kitana in a match. Instead of killing Raiden, Kitana rebels against her stepfather and attacks Shao Kahn, only to be beaten into submission. Liu Kang defeats Shang Tsung regardless of a setback and spares him.\nIn the Netherrealm, the Lin Kuei realize too late that their employer was Shinnok as they learn of his plan to revive the One Being and bring an end to all of creation. Subsequently, they are betrayed and killed for their services.\nDuring the tournament's final stage, Raiden dies while losing his battle against Shao Kahn, enraging Liu Kang to defeat the emperor and win the tournament. Liu Kang then frees Kitana and the two share a romantic moment. However, celebrations are cut short as Shinnok finally succeeds in resurrecting the One Being and fusing himself. With the aid of the Elder Gods, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Liu Kang engage in a fight and kill Shinnok while Johnny, Jax, Kitana, and Sonya protect civilians from Kahn's remaining army.\nIn the aftermath, Liu Kang absorbs the One Being's power and reverts the realms into their original state, including Edenia.

Mitchell Saltzman of IGN rated the film a five out of ten, calling it \"a swing and a whiff\" in that it \"feels all over the place, attempting to tell too many stories at once and not doing any of them justice.\" Luke Y. Thompson of SuperHeroHype called the plot \"wildly inconsistent\" and that it \"mostly serves as the thinnest of devices to get to the next fight.\" Den of Geek called the film \"a narrative mess ... an incredibly busy movie that has too much going on to the point that there are two completely separate storylines happening at the same time that only briefly connect but ultimately converge in a bonkers and completely tacked on finale.\" However, Tanner Dedmon of ComicBook.com wrote that the film \"wastes no time getting to the action\" and \"doubles down on things like x-rayed blows and key catchphrases that honor the source material and give characters their big moments without being too distracting.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
