The coupled DGLAP QCD+QED evolution equations are solved in x-space by means of higher order interpolations and Runge-Kutta techniques, and allow the exploration of different options for the treatment of subleading terms.\nMain features\nSee also\n*NNPDF\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://apfel.hepforge.org/ APFEL website]\n\n---\n\n## APFEL (Software)\n\n#REDIRECT APFEL (software)\n}}"
