Two of these tablets have been found. The inscription was a warning to pagan visitors to the temple not to proceed further. Both Greek and Latin inscriptions on the temple's balustrade served as warnings to pagan visitors not to proceed under penalty of death.\nA complete tablet was discovered in 1871 by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, in the ad-Dawadariya school just outside the al-Atim Gate to the Temple Mount, and published by the Palestine Exploration Fund. Following the discovery of the inscription, it was taken by the Ottoman authorities, and it is currently in the Istanbul Archaeology Museums. A partial fragment of a less well made version of the inscription was found in 1936 by J. H. Iliffe during the excavation of a new road outside Jerusalem's Lions' Gate; it is held in the Israel Museum.\nInscription\nTwo tablets have been found, one complete, and the other a partial fragment with missing sections, but with letters showing signs of the red paint that had originally highlighted the text. It was described by the Palestine Exploration Fund in 1872 as being \"very nearly in the words of Josephus\".\nThe inscription uses three terms referring to temple architecture:\n* To hieron (Το ἱερόν), \"holy place\", the sacred area, to which the forecourt led\n* Peribolou (περίβολος), a wall encompassing the holy terrace within the outer court\n* Tryphaktou (τρύφακτος), a stone barrier across the outer court\nTranslation\nThe tablet bears the following inscription in Koine Greek:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Some scholars believed it referred to all gentiles, regardless of ritual purity status or religion. Others argue that it referred to unconverted Gentiles since Herod wrote the inscription. Herod himself was a converted Idumean (or Edomite) and was unlikely to exclude himself or his descendants.\nForgeries\nin Rome.]]\nSeveral forgeries were promptly prepared following the 1871 discovery. Clermont-Ganneau was shown a similar artifact at the Monastery of St Saviour, which was later shown to be a forgery created by Martin Boulos.\nSee also\n*Acts 21:27–29\nReferences\nExternal references\n*\n*\n*\n* Millard, Alan, Discoveries from the Time of Jesus.
