Edward Hay-Drummond (1758–1829) and Elizabeth de Vismes (d. 1790). From his parent's marriage, he had one sister, Henrietta Auriol Hay-Drummond, married Morgan Watkins in 1831. After his mother died in 1790, his father married Amelia Emily Auriol. From that marriage, he had a younger half-sister, Amelia Auriol Hay-Drummond, who eloped with his father's curate, George Wilkins.\nHis paternal grandparents were Archbishop Robert Hay Drummond and the former Henrietta Auriol. His uncle was Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull.

He fought in the Peninsular War and was present at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\nOn leaving the army, Drummond-Hay pursued his interest in antiquities and history, including undertaking a translation of Frederika Freygang and Wilhelm von Freygang's Letters from the Caucasus and Georgia. In August 1823, he moved to Edinburgh upon being appointed Lyon Clerk and Keeper of the Records, the role having been secured through the influence of his cousin, Thomas Hay-Drummond, 11th Earl of Kinnoull.
