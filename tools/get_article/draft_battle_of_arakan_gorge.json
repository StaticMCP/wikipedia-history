Some Red Army soldiers launched a frontal attack on the heights and captured the ridge, suffering losses. The shelling was temporarily halted, and the Bolsheviks sent an influential resident, Arkas, to Arakani to negotiate peace. Two days passed, but the ambassador did not return. The shelling began again  .\nDuring the shelling, some Red Army soldiers took a detour to Arakani via the southwest side. A detachment with two machine guns crossed the summit and disappeared from sight. However, their journey was short-lived. They were ambushed, and a chaotic exchange of fire ensued at the enemy, whom the detachment could not see. The mountain rebels struck the cornered Red Army soldiers with well-aimed shots. Those who survived began to flee in panic  .\nOn October 22, the highlanders launched a counteroffensive. The main attack was directed at the right flank. Meanwhile, panic was still raging among the Bolsheviks and was only growing  .\nThe Red Army soldiers were driven into the valley. Reinforcements of 100 soldiers from Temir-Khan-Shura broke through to him  .\nOn October 30, at dawn, mountain detachments attacked from the slope. The attack was unexpected. Panic and retreat began again. The Red Army soldiers were surrounded, and almost the entire detachment was destroyed\nReferences"
