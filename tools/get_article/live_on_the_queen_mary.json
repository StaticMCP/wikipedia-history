He was allegedly upset about its release, as he claimed not to know that his performance was recorded.\nThe album is a favorite of Hugh Laurie, who, in tribute, filmed a special, Live on the Queen Mary, to promote his album ''Didn't It Rain.\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Tom Wilson. It was recorded during a 1975 party aboard the RMS Queen Mary, hosted by Paul McCartney to mark the end of the recording sessions for Venus and Mars''. \"Stagger Lee\" is a version of the Lloyd Price song. \"I'm Movin' On\" is a cover of the Hank Snow tune. \"Cry to Me\" is a version of the song made famous by Solomon Burke. \"Gone So Long\" and \"Mess Around\" are performed as instrumentals. The liner notes are by John Broven, taken from his book Walking to New Orleans.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = Robert Christgau\n|rev2score = A−\n|rev3 = The Minneapolis Star\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = MusicHound Blues: The Essential Album Guide\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = Omaha World-Herald\n|rev5score =\n|rev6 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n|rev6score =\n|rev7 = The Virgin Encyclopedia of R&B and Soul\n|rev7score =\n}}\nThe Globe and Mail wrote that Professor Longhair \"gives an outstanding piano performance (about the only sound that comes through clearly) and a vocal show which hints that on a better day he could tear the joint down.\" In a subsequent article, the paper opined that Professor Longhair's piano playing is \"originality tantamount to the first time Lester Young or Charlie Parker did the first funny thing on the saxophone.\" The Liverpool Daily Post noted Professor Longhair's \"curious squeaky voice\" and \"rough-edged city blues.\" The Morning Call labeled Live on the Queen Mary \"a minor classic.\"\nNewsday praised his \"unique syncopation and earthy vocals.\" The Daily Breeze called Professor Longhair \"unquestionably one of the greatest talents ever to play a piano.\" Robert Christgau praised the uncredited backing musicians.
