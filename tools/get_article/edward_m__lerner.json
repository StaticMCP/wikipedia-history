Lerner (born 1949) is an American author of science fiction, techno-thrillers, and popular science.\nAs of 2023 he has twenty-five published books: thirteen solo novels (three in his InterstellarNet universe), six collections, five novels co-authored with Larry Niven in the Known Space universe, and one popular-science book. The majority of Lerner's shorter works were originally published in Analog, The Grantville Gazette, and (until it ceased publication) Jim Baen's Universe.\nHis 2001 short story \"Grandpa?\" was made into a short film, The Grandfather Paradox, and shown at the 2006 Balticon Science Fiction convention where it won the Best Film Award.  It was also a semi-finalist at the 2006 Science Fiction Short Film Festival.\nBiography\nFor over thirty years Edward M. Lerner worked in the aerospace and information technology industries while writing science fiction part-time. He held positions at numerous companies such as Bell Labs, Hughes Aircraft, Honeywell, and Northrop Grumman.  In February 2004, after receiving a book deal for Moonstruck, he decided to write science fiction full-time.\nRecognition\nLerner's novel InterstellarNet: Enigma won the inaugural (2015) Canopus Award for long-form fiction (i.e., novels) \"honoring excellence in interstellar writing.\" He also won the annual \"Anlab\" (Analog Readers Poll) for nonfiction in 2013, for \"Faster Than a Speeding Photon: The Why, Where, and (Perhaps the) How of Faster-Than-Light Technology\" and for short story in 2018, for \"Paradise Regained\",\" among his many Anlab nominations. His fiction has also been nominated for Locus, Prometheus, and Hugo awards.\nBibliography\nNovels\n* Probe, 1991, .\n* Moonstruck, 2005, .\n* ''Fools' Experiments, 2008, .\n* Small Miracles, 2009, .\n* Energized, 2012, .\n* Dark Secret, 2016, .\n* The Company Man, 2019,  (novelization of four stories previously published in the Grantville Gazette).\n* Déjà Doomed, 2021, .\n* On the Shoals of Space-Time, 2023,\n* Life and Death on Mars, 2023,\n;Fleet of Worlds series (with Larry Niven)\n* Fleet of Worlds, 2007, .\n* Juggler of Worlds, 2008, .\n* Destroyer of Worlds, 2009, .\n* Betrayer of Worlds, 2010, .\n* Fate of Worlds, 2012, .\n;InterstellarNet series\n* InterstellarNet: Origins, 2010, .\n* InterstellarNet: New Order, 2010, .\n* InterstellarNet: Enigma, 2015, .\nShort fiction\n;Collections\n* Creative Destruction, published 2006, Wildside Press, .\n* Countdown to Armageddon / A Stranger in Paradise, published 2010, Wildside Press, .\n* Frontiers of Space, Time, and Thought: Essays and Stories on The Big Questions, published 2012, FoxAcre Press, .\n* Muses & Musings: A Science Fiction Collection, published 2019, Phoenix Pick, .\n* The Sherlock Chronicles & The Paradise Quartet, published 2021, Eric Flint Ring of Fire Press, .\n* The Best of Edward M.
