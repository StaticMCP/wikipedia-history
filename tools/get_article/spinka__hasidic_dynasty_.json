The group originated in a town called Szaplonca (), in Máramaros County, Kingdom of Hungary (today Săpânţa, Romania).\nSpinka rebbes\nThe first Spinka Rebbe was Rabbi Yosef Meir Weiss, author of Imrei Yosef. He was succeeded by his son, Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac Weiss, author of Chakal Yitzchak. The Chakal Yitzchak was murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Another son, Naftali Weiss, the Bilker Rebbe, is a prominent subject in the Auschwitz Album of rare photographs taken at the death camp.\nAfter World War II, the group was divided among many Rebbes, descendants of the Imrei Yosef. Spinka Rebbes can be found in Williamsburg, Borough Park, Flatbush, Kiryas Joel, Monsey, N.Y., Bnei Brak, London, Antwerp, throughout Israel, and Europe. All are offshoots of the original dynasty. Several Spinka Rebbes live in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn alone (Toldos Tzvi, Beis Yitxchok, and Beis Shmuel Tzvi communities), and Israeli branches are found in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak.\nAmong the surnames of the Spinka Rebbes are Weiss (or Weisz), Kahana, and Horowitz.\nLineage of Spinka rebbes\n*Rabbi Yosef Meir Weiss, (1838–1909 (ו' אייר תרס\"ט)) – Author of Imrei Yosef\n**Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac Weiss, (1875–1944) – Author of Chakal Yitzchak, son of the Imrei Yosef\n***Rabbi Yisrael Chaim Weiss, (d. 1944) – son of the Chakal Yitzchak\n****Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Weiss, (1916–1988) – Spinka Rebbe in Boro Park and Bnei Brak Author of Siach Yaakov – son of Rabbi Yisrael Chaim\n*****Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Weiss – Spinka Rebbe – son of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef\n*****Rabbi Yisrael Chaim Weiss – Spinka Donalow Rebbe of  Bnei Brak – son of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef\n*****Rabbi Meir Eleazer Weiss – Spinka 18th Ave Rebbe of Boro Park has synagogue also in Jerusalem – son of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef\nLineage of  Spinka Rebbes (Horowitz branch)\n*Rabbi Yosef Meir Weiss – (1838–1909 (ו' אייר תרס\"ט)) – Author of Imrei Yosef\n**Rabbi Yitzchak Isaac Weiss – (1875–1944) – Author of Chakal Yitzchak, son of the Imrei Yosef\n***Rabbi Avraham Abish Horowitz of Kruly, son-in-law of the Chakal Yitzchak\n****Rabbi Shmuel Tzvi Horowitz – Spinka Rebbe of Williamsburg – affectionately known as \"Reb Hershele Spinker\", son of Rabbi Abish of Kruly\n*****Rabbi Yissachar Dov Berish Horowitz, (d. 2007 (י\"ט תשרי תשס\"ח)- Spinka Rebbe in Williamsburg – Beis Shmuel Tzvi Synagogue – the eldest son of Reb Hershele Spinker\n******Rabbi Yosef Meir Horowitz – Spinka Rebbe in Williamsbug – Beis Shmuel Tzvi Synagogue – eldest son of Reb Berish Spinker.\n******Rabbi Moshe Yaakov Horowitz – Spinka Rebbe in Airmont – Oholei Tzvi Synagogue – son Of Reb Berish Spinker.\n******Rabbi Ahron Dovid Horowitz – Zabiltover Rebbe in Williamsburg – son Of Reb Berish Spinker.\n*****Rabbi Abraham Abish Horowitz Shlit\"a – (A.K.A.
