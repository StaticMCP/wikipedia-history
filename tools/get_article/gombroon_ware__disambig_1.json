It was made from crushed quartz, white clay, and frit, which when fired becomes glassy. Early mentions of Gombroon ware occur in John Fryer's New Account of East-India and Persia (1672-1681), Martin Lister's Journey to Paris (1699), and Horace Walpole's description of his Strawberry Hill collection.\nReferences\n* \"Notes on the Manufacture of Porcelain at Chelsea\", by Augustus W.
