The Royal Household (singular) supports the Sovereign. Other members of the royal family who undertake public duties have separate households; they vary considerably in size, from the medium-sized household that supports the Prince and Princess of Wales to those supporting junior working royals (with just a handful of members).\nIn addition to the royal officials and support staff, the sovereign's own household incorporates representatives of other estates of the realm, including the government, the military, and the church. Government whips, defence chiefs, clergy, scientists, musicians, poets, and artists hold honorary positions within the Royal Household. In this way, the Royal Household may be seen as having a symbolic, as well as a practical, function: exemplifying the monarchy's close relationship with other parts of the constitution and of national life.\nThe offices of the Royal Household are some of the oldest administrative entities in the UK, from which over time the other principal offices of State emerged: for example, HM Treasury was, in its pre-conquest origins, a strong-box kept for safety in the king's bedchamber, where it was overseen by one of the chamberlains (whose role would later evolve into the office of Lord High Treasurer). Parts of the Royal Household continued to play a central role in the government of the country up until the 1530s, and the four Great Officers of the Household routinely had a seat in the Cabinet until the mid-18th century.\nTerminology\nThe term 'Househoulde' first appears in English in 1382, and it began to be used for the king and his entourage shortly afterwards (). Prior to this date Latin terms were used (e.g.  (12th century) or  (13th century)); Latin terms continued to be used, alongside English ones, until the 1550s. The word 'court' (as in royal court) first appears in the 12th century, but, together with the word 'courtier', only came into common use in this context in the late 1470s, foreshadowing the more lavish and public displays of courtly life that characterised the Tudor period.\nThe terminology of 'Hall' and 'Chamber' appears from an early date; in time they came to refer not only to significant and sizeable rooms in the royal palaces but also to the principal administrative divisions of the Royal Household (overseen respectively by a steward and a chamberlain); the equivalent 'outdoor' office was the Stables (overseen by a marshal). Over time lesser rooms (such as the Wardrobe and the Bedchamber) likewise became metonyms for departments of the Household which, in their time, wielded significant powers.\nIn the 15th century, however, the two principal divisions (overseen by the Lord Steward and Lord Chamberlain) had come to be referred to as the Household and Chamber respectively, (rather than the Hall and Chamber); this usage only began to recede following the formation of the Lord Steward's Department and the Lord Chamberlain's Department in the late 18th century.\nHistory\nIn the medieval period, there was little, if any, distinction made between the public and private capacities of the monarch: \"The land, the people, the law-courts, the army were as much the King's own personal possessions as were his various demesne manors or the furniture of his palaces\". Thus, under the Norman kings of England, the Curia Regis ('King's Court') was engaged in every aspect of the management of State affairs - financial, administrative, legislative, judicial, diplomatic - as well as in providing for the day-to-day needs of the monarch and his entourage.\nIn the twelfth century, the Curia Regis began to disintegrate. Key departments to separate themselves from the Curia Regis were the Exchequer (substantially independent by the end of the twelfth century) and the Chancery (which gained independence more gradually through the thirteenth and early fourteenth century). The Exchequer and Chancery soon became (respectively) the principal accounting and administrative offices of The Crown, overseen by two high officials: the Treasurer and the Chancellor (respectively). Both these officials predated the establishment of their departments: within the Court, the Chancellor had kept the King's official seal since before the Norman conquest; while the office of Treasurer dated from the reign of William I, when the (previously mobile) Treasury found a more permanent home (together with its attendant chamberlain) in Winchester Castle. Their offices also had a judicial character, as seen in the parallel (and inseparable) development of the Court of Exchequer and the Court of Chancery; other courts of law continued to emerge from the Curia Regis in the thirteenth century: first the Common Bench and later the King's Bench.\nReferences to the King's Household, as a distinctive aspect of Court, served initially to differentiate the body of courtiers which continued to serve the immediate needs of the monarch, and to travel with him, as distinct from those more closely identified with what became departments of State with a settled existence 'out of Court'.\nAnglo-Saxon period (871–1066)\nThe royal household has roots in the  that provided military support to early Anglo-Saxon kings. Household members included noble thegns, who were expected to commit a portion of their time and resources to royal service as a condition of their social status and in return for certain privileges. In addition to thegns, the household would have included clergy and a large staff of domestic servants. The daily life of the king's household was focused around the  or hall; the other main spaces were the chapel (staffed by clerks) and the  or chamber: a more private space, where the king slept and where his clothes, jewels and important documents were kept.\nThe highest-ranking officers were:\n*  () in charge of food provisions; later referred to as seneschals.\n*  (),  () and  () who between them supervised the royal chamber/bedchamber (Latin: /) and wardrobe (); later referred to as chamberlains (Latin: , ).\n*  (Latin: ) in charge of drink provisions; later referred to as butlers.\nTypically, each office had three holders who served on a rotating basis.\nKing Eadred bequeathed eighty gold coins each to his dish-thegns, raiment-thegns and butlers upon his death in AD 995. His household also included  (stewards), attached to the hall, to whom he bequeathed thirty gold coins each.\nAnother high officer was the  (also known, from the tenth century, as the marshal), who was in charge of the king's horses, the royal stables and household travel. When the country was on a war footing, the royal stables took on a military character and function, and the horse-thegn's role adapted to it accordingly.\nCnut the Great () introduced two new offices to the household: staller and housecarl. The stallers were close to the king and very wealthy. There were as many as eight stallers in post at any one time, and there is uncertainty as to their precise duties; they had a supervisory role, and thus 'staller' may have been a generic term for any of chief officials of the king's household. The housecarls were professional soldiers who, among other things, functioned as royal bodyguards (whereas the Saxon kings had been guarded by their thegns).\nThe household included several priests, who also probably had noble backgrounds, and service in the royal chapel could be a stepping stone towards becoming a bishop.  Priests in the household not only performed religious duties but also acted as royal secretaries: writing letters, charters, and other official documents. By the reign of Edward the Confessor (), the chapel's writing office had custody of the great seal, used to authenticate writs; during his reign the office of chancellor first makes an appearance within the English court.\nEven though it travelled constantly with the king as an itinerant court, the royal household was the centre of the Anglo-Saxon government. Initially, household officers performed domestic tasks (such as overseeing food, clothing, royal stables, or travel). As the king's administrative and judicial responsibilities expanded, public duties were delegated to the household officers, making them state officers as well.\nOn the continent of Europe, the Merovingian and Carolingian royal households had similar offices, and there is evidence that these influenced their English counterpart. However, there was no English equivalent to the powerful office of  (Latin for 'mayor of the palace'), and English kings maintained ultimate authority over their households.\nAnglo-Norman period (1066–1154)\nAfter the Norman conquest the ducal household of Normandy (with seneschal, cup-bearer, chamberlain and constable) appears to have been replicated in England and merged into the English court. The Anglo-Norman French term 'seneschal' came to be translated as 'steward' in English.\nConstitutio Domus Regis\nThe , dating from the end of the reign of King Henry I (), provides the earliest surviving account of the household. The senior figures (according to their remuneration) were:\n* the chancellor (Latin: )\n* the seneschals (or stewards) (Latin: )\n* the master butler (Latin: )\n* the master chamberlain (Latin: )\n* the treasurer (Latin: )\n* the constables (Latin: )\nThe above six office-holders were paid five shillings per day; the chancellor received this invariably, but the others' pay was reduced on days when they ate in hall at the king's expense.\nThe office of chancellor was still comparatively new, but it appears from his remuneration that he held a degree of seniority within the household. The chancellor was a senior churchman and head of the Chapel; he also had custody of the great seal, used to validate documents issued in the king's name. Working under him were the master of the writing office (), the chaplain keeper () of the chapel and relics, and several clerks. The clerks (who were clerics) drafted official documents and also served in the chapel, which saw to the king's spiritual needs: there they said mass, heard confessions, and kept custody of the royal relics. The chancellor's department (the chancery) was named after the screen (Latin ) which separated the clerks from the main body of the hall.\nThe seneschals (or stewards) and the butler between them provided food and drink for the king's hall. They oversaw various subsidiary officers who, although they received a lower wage, were far from being menial servants, as evidenced by the example of one Roger, who served as larderer to Henry I and was afterwards appointed Bishop of Hereford.\nThe chamber saw to the king's personal needs and was the main financial office of the government. It had two divisions: the royal bedchamber (Latin: ) and the chamber of the court (Latin: ). The latter chamber handled the finances; albeit by this time the treasurer is named alongside the master chamberlain, serving as head of an emerging new department (namely the Exchequer). Under the master chamberlain were lesser chamberlains and others, who undertook various practical duties.\nThe constables oversaw the outdoor staff and the  (Latin for military household). The outdoor staff included huntsmen, houndsmen, and foresters. The military household were knights who received wages and formed the backbone of the army. Historian C. W. Hollister likened it to \"something between a royal bodyguard[...] and a small standing army.\"\nAlso listed is the master marshal (). It is known from later references () that the master marshal was responsible for preserving order within the verge of the king's court; similarly, at time of war he had charge of military discipline. He also had financial duties: keeping a tally of certain household expenditures, and in wartime functioning as paymaster of the military. Assisting the master marshal were four other marshals.\nPlantagenet period (1154–1485)\nThe formation of the Exchequer marked the beginning of the separation of government functions from the king's Court. As the treasurer had emerged alongside the chamberlain, taking over some of the latter's financial responsibilities, so another official emerged at this time: the chief justiciar, who took on some of the historic duties of the seneschal or steward. The justiciar quickly became a person of great importance in the realm (his role being analogous to that of the king's chief minister when the monarch was in the country, and akin to a regent when he was not). He had his headquarters in the Exchequer, however, and is not generally considered an officer of the household.\nEvolution of Great Officers of State and of the Household\nThere had been a tendency in Normandy for the highest Court appointments to become hereditary offices, held under terms of grand serjeanty, and in the 12th century this began to happen likewise in England. Thus by the end of the reign of Henry II (), the office of steward (later termed Lord High Steward) was attached to the Earls of Leicester, that of chamberlain (Lord Great Chamberlain) to the Earls of Oxford, that of butler (Chief Butler of England) to the family of William de Albini (later Earls of Arundel), that of constable (Lord High Constable) to the Earls of Hereford and that of marshal (later Earl Marshal) to the family of John FitzGilbert (later passing by marriage to the Earls of Norfolk).\nAs part of this process, the above-mentioned great officers of state ceased to attend court except on State or special occasions. Their domestic duties therefore had to be undertaken by others. They seem at first to have been shared among several officers bearing the same or similar titles (the 1135 Constitutio lists multiple senior and subsidiary officials with the titles of steward, chamberlain, butler, constable and marshal). In due course, the domestic responsibilities of the steward and chamberlain devolved upon two senior officers 'of the Household': the Lord Steward of the Household and Lord Chamberlain of the Household. The Lord High Constable and Earl Marshal retained their military authority until a comparatively late period. As regards the latter's domestic duties, a 'Marshal of the Household' (later known as the Knight Marshal) maintained discipline within the Verge from the 13th century, while a 'Marshal of the Exchequer' took care of the marshal's erstwhile financial duties.\nNeither the chancellor (later Lord High Chancellor) nor the treasurer (Lord High Treasurer) became hereditary offices, as they were more clearly engaged in the government of the realm (which required them to be present); they were also ecclesiastics, which precluded the possibility of legitimate heirs. Although not hereditary, these high offices were routinely offered for sale or rent, until reforms were enacted in the 13th century.\nBrief flourishing of the Wardrobe\nThe emergence of autonomous departments of State from within the Court had a lasting effect on the shape of the medieval Royal Household, because something was needed to fill the gap that they left (the monarch still required a financial and administrative office). At first the Chamber filled this role; but those who sought to limit monarchical power at this time took great care to maintain the authority of the Exchequer and Chancery over any potential rival office developing within the Household. Thus, while some parts of the Royal Household had a relatively settled continuity of existence through this period (including the extensive 'below-stairs' establishment overseen by the Lord Steward), the Chamber came under sustained political pressure: particularly during the reign of King John, it was subject to various restrictions on its activity and autonomy. For this reason the effectiveness of the Chamber as the King's de facto administrative and financial office waned, and in its place, a new department came to the fore: the Wardrobe.\nNamed after an annexe to the Chamber in which clothes, armour and other valuables were stored, the Wardrobe grew under Henry III and Edward I until it rivalled the Exchequer in its spending and bypassed the Chancery in its issuing of writs. Its senior officials became close confidants to the King: the Keeper of the Wardrobe and the Controller of the Wardrobe. The former went on to subsume the office (and title) of Treasurer of the Chamber; the latter had custody of the King's Privy Seal, which (unlike the Great Seal, which was kept by the Chancellor in the Chancery) always travelled with the monarch, including overseas.\nIt was at times of war that the Wardrobe came into its own as an effective means not only of communication but also of fundraising for the Sovereign. This was not without risk, however, and on occasion the Wardrobe found itself having to be bailed out by the Exchequer. Under a weaker king, Edward II, the Exchequer reasserted its authority; the Ordinances of 1311 severely curtailed its independence, with the result that the Wardrobe was eventually subsumed back entirely into the Household and placed under the authority of the Lord Steward. Its senior officers (the Treasurer, Controller and Cofferer of the Wardrobe) were re-designated 'of the Household'; together with the Lord Steward, they later constituted the Board of Green Cloth (which oversaw the Household accounts).\nThe office of Cofferer of the Household was suppressed in 1782; but those of Treasurer of the Household and Comptroller of the Household continue to be held as sinecure positions by members of HM Government.\nThe Chamber's authority reasserted\nThe demise of the Wardrobe led to the re-emergence of the Chamber (and Chamberlain) as an office (and person) of influence. While the Wardrobe held sway, the Chamber had continued to operate at a domestic level: providing the place (and entourage) for the king to sleep, eat his meals and meet with visitors. The Chamber was scarcely mentioned in the 1311 Ordinances (the Barons not wishing to legislate over the monarch's domestic arrangements), so it now found itself well-placed to take back authority over financial and administrative matters on behalf of the King. Funding was provided out of certain estates forfeited to the Crown (including those of the Knights Templar).\nBy 1389 a vice-chamberlain was in place as deputy to the Lord Chamberlain. The Chamber continued to retain its long-established personnel: Yeomen, Valets, Esquires and Knights of the Chamber; the yeomen and valets undertook more menial tasks (making the beds and stoking the fires), while the Esquires fulfilled particular tasks in direct relation to the King (e.g. as his carver or cup-bearer) and some of them were designated Gentleman Ushers of the Court. Guard duties were performed by the Serjeants at Arms.\nWherever administrative or financial skills were required, clerks were employed - a word which in this period signified clergy. At their head, during this period of growth in the mid-fourteenth century, was the Receiver. The Privy Seal, now removed from the influence of the Wardrobe, was given its own dedicated Lord Keeper, who initially operated within the structure of the Chamber.\nBefore long, however, moves were again made to limit the Household as a direct agency of kingly power. The Keeper of the Privy Seal, together with his office of clerks, was removed from the sphere of the Court and followed the Exchequer and the Chancery to Westminster, where, like them, it took on the guise of a department of State. In place of the Privy Seal, a new seal (later known as the signet) began to be used by the King, administered by a clerk in his Household who later came to be called the King's Secretary (precursor of the present-day Secretaries of State).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Domestic household expenses in the 13th-14th centuries\n!King\n!Year(s)\n!Cost\n!Inflation adjusted\n|-\n|Henry III\n|1236–37\n|£4,000\n|£}} today\n|-\n|Edward I\n|N/A\n|£7,000–£14,000 per year\n|£}}–£}} today\n|-\n|Edward II\n|1324–25\n|£4,500\n|£}} today\n|-\n|Edward III\n|N/A\n|£10,000–£12,000 per year\n|£}}–£}} today\n|-\n|Edward III\n|after 1340\n|£20,000 per year\n|£}} today\n|}\nGreat Hall and Great Chamber\nDown to the reign of King Edward II, the Great Hall (the largest room in the palace) had been the centre of courtly life: a place of political meetings, public ceremonies and courtly social gatherings. Under his successor Edward III, however, the focus of activity moved to a more private room behind the dais of the Hall: the Great Chamber. While the king continued to use the Hall on special occasions, for ceremonies, feasts and entertainments, the main focus of Court life shifted to the Chamber, where (when in residence) the king and his closest advisers were usually to be found.\nNevertheless, the Hall still remained in regular daily use as the place where the majority of the household ate their meals. (Meals were provided as part of their remuneration and they were expected to sit down together to eat; but only a select few took their meals in the Chamber with the king.)\nOver time the Great Chamber came to be divided into a suite of rooms; for example, in the Tower of London, Henry III's Great Chamber was converted by King Edward IV into an audience chamber, privy chamber and bedchamber. Another small adjoining room, the privy closet, functioned as a small private chapel.\nThe Stables\nIn the early 1300s the royal studs, stables and horses were under the office of the marshalsea, overseen at that time by the keeper of the wardrobe (the master marshal, or Earl Marshal as he was now called, having long since ceased to have a direct relationship with the Stables). Overseeing care and management of the horses from day to day were two officials called harbingers: one responsible for the royal palfreys and destriers, the other for pack and cart horses (which provided transport for the itinerant royal court). The former (also known as 'keeper of the king's great horses') had three serjeant-marshals working under him, the first being responsible for 'the stable of the king', the second for great horses kept (in various places) outside the household, the third for the royal studs (located at a dozen sites around the kingdom). In the 1360s, however, the network of studs and of horses 'outside the household' was disestablished and their associated serjeant-marshal posts were abolished. By the mid-1390s, the responsibilities of the remaining serjeant-marshal had been amalgamated with those of the keeper of the king's great horses under a new title: Master of the Horse.\nThe Black Book of the Household\nIn the  (the  of Edward IV, written between 1467 and 1477), the domain of the Hall is termed the  () and that of the Chamber the  (). The  was overseen by the Steward, the  by the Chamberlain.\nAlso within the domain of the Steward was the Board of Green Cloth, here called the  (). This functioned both as the Household's counting house and as its judgement seat: \"for at the green-cloth is always represented the King's power touching matters of this Household\". The green cloth itself was a tablecloth, charged with the arms of the Board: on a field of green a key crossed with a rod of silver, \"signifying that this office may close, open or punish other offices\".}}\n* Kings of Arms, Heralds and Pursuivants\n* 4 Serjeants-at-Arms\n* 13 Minstrels and a Waite\n* 4 Messengers\nThe Chapel:\n* A Dean of Chapel\n* 26 Chaplains and Clerks of the Chapel\n* 2 Yeomen of the Chapel\n* 8 Children of the Chapel (and a Master to teach them)\n* The Clerk of the Closet and Serjeant of the Vestry.\nOther offices:\n* The Jewel House (under the Keeper of the King's Jewels)\n* The Wardrobe of Robes (under a yeoman)\n* The Wardrobe of Beds (under a yeoman)\n|-\n|Offices concerned with the provision of food, drinks and other items (each overseen by a Serjeant):\n*Office of the Bakehouse\n*Office of the Pantry\n*Office of the Cellar\n*Office of the Confectionary\n*Office of the Chandlery\n*Office of the Ewery and Napery\nOverseen by a Chief Master Clerk:\n*Office of the Great Spicery\nOverseen by a Chief Butler\n*Office of the Butler of England\n|-\n|'Domus Compotis, Consilii et Judicii (Board of Green Cloth)'\n* Steward of the Household\n* Treasurer of the Household\n* Comptroller of the Household\n* Cofferer of the Household\n* Two Clerks of the Green Cloth\n* A Clerk of Controlment\nOffice of the Counting House (staffed by a Serjeant Usher)\n|}\nThe Liber Niger appears to be unfinished: a number of 'below stairs' departments are omitted (including the kitchen, larder, boiling-house and several others) and other offices, though referred to in passing, are missing from the main listing (such as the stables, almonry and woodyard).\nThe Tudor period (1485-1603)\nUnder Henry VII the Chamber was equipped once again to serve as a powerful and efficient financial office, to be funded by income from the Crown lands (bypassing the Exchequer). In 1487, Henry revived the office of Treasurer of the Chamber in order to secure and manage this income. These arrangements were maintained for a time, until the departments of State were reformed under Thomas Cromwell, beginning in the 1530s.\nGrowing influence of the Privy Chamber\nIn 1495 King Henry VII effected an administrative separation between the Chamber (which, under the Chamberlain, continued to retain its public and ceremonial character and functions) and the Privy Chamber (which, under the Groom of the Stool, was separated off as a more private and intimate space). Under Henry VII the Privy Chamber was staffed by relatively humble servants who took care of the king's more personal requirements and bodily needs; but under his successor, King Henry VIII, it began to be filled with close companions of high birth and influence.\nHenry had come to the throne accompanied by an influential group of young noblemen, who were nicknamed 'the king's minions'. When Francis I of France despatched a delegation to England in 1518, to sign a peace treaty drawn up by Cardinal Wolsey, it included some of that monarch's most trusted courtiers who bore the title  ('Gentlemen of the Chamber'). So when Henry sent a group of his 'minions' as part of a reciprocal delegation to Paris later that same year, he gave them a parallel title: Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber. In this role, the Gentlemen came to control access to the king's private rooms (and thus to the king himself). This created difficulties for the more established courtiers. Powerful individuals on the outside (such as Thomas Wolsey and Anne Boleyn) did their best to infiltrate the chamber and its entourage.\nBefore long the Privy Chamber became a \"fully fledged third department of the Royal Household\", eclipsing both Chamber and Household in its prestige and in power. By the end of the 1530s it was functioning as a fully autonomous financial and administrative office with its own paid staff. The six Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber were akin to the king's chief ministers: they had oversight of the Privy Purse and administered the royal sign-manual.\nThe Chief Gentleman of the Privy Chamber was the Groom of the Stool, who thus became one of the most powerful officials in the household: he  acted as a royal gatekeeper, allowing or denying other officials access to the privy lodgings (and thus to the monarch). In addition to the Gentlemen, the Privy Chamber had its own select staff, who operated under the Groom of the Stool (rather than the Lord Chamberlain): two Gentlemen Ushers of the Privy Chamber kept the doors, and oversaw the serving of meals and other practical arrangements; they were assisted by four Grooms of the Privy Chamber. The king's barber and a page were also in attendance daily.\nOn festivals and great days of celebration the king would still be seen in the Great Hall or Chamber, and he granted audiences in the latter (which, for clarity, came to be known as the Presence Chamber); but otherwise, once he was within the palace, the king was seldom to be seen outside the Privy Chamber.\nWhile under Henry VIII the Privy Chamber served both as an administrative office and as a circle of royal companionship, under both Mary I and Elizabeth I (whose intimate servants were necessarily women) these functions were separated. Mary maintained a full complement of Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, but alongside them appointed Ladies and Gentlewomen of the Privy Chamber. Elizabeth did likewise, appointing Kat Ashley to serve as Chief Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber (which became more clearly a personal rather than an administrative space, though it remained a sphere of influence).\nThe Stuart Household\nThe Bedchamber\nWhen King James VI of Scotland inherited the throne of England as James I, he retained much of the structure (and personnel) of the Elizabethan English court (with the Ladies and Gentlewomen being transferred to his consort's Household). Within this structure, however, he created the office of Gentleman of the Bedchamber to which he appointed members of his Scottish entourage. It immediately took the place of the Privy Chamber as the locus of the King's closest confidants; the First Gentleman of the Bedchamber, Sir Thomas Erskine, was additionally appointed Groom of the Stool in 1604 (an office which had been in abeyance during the reign of Elizabeth I). The Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber were retained, but their salary was taken away; they were, though, provided with board and lodging when on duty).\nAfter the Restoration, Charles II reconstituted the Royal Household without seeking to reduce its size (which had previously grown large and expensive). From as early as 1662 efforts were made to reduce the number of extraneous offices in the household (a process which would continue for decades afterwards). Sale of offices was prevalent at this time, and several were held as lucrative sinecures. Chamberlayne's Present State of England of 1669 said of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber at this time that they 'consist usually of the prime nobility of England'. As regards their duties, they are 'each one in his turn to wait a week in every quarter in the king's bedchamber, there to lie by the king on a pallet bed all night and in the absence of the groom of the stole to supply his place'. It is also noted that they are required to serve at the king's table when he eats in private, 'for then the cup bearers, carvers and sewers do not wait'.\nIn the reign of Queen Anne, Ladies of the Bedchamber replaced the Gentlemen, and Bedchamber women replaced the Grooms of the Bedchamber; a pattern which was repeated in later centuries when a queen regnant acceded to the throne. In subsequent Queens' reigns the office of Groom of the Stole likewise went into abeyance, but under Anne it was given to two duchesses in succession, who also served as Mistress of the Robes. (The latter title remained attached to the head of the female Household of a Queen (regnant or consort) up until the reign of Charles III).\nModern day\nIn its main outlines the existing organisation of the royal household is essentially the same as it was under the Tudors or the Plantagenets. It is divided into three principal departments, at the head of which are the lord steward, the lord chamberlain and the master of the horse, and the respective provinces of which may be generally described as \"below stairs\", \"above stairs\" and \"out of doors\". The duties of these officials, and the various officers under their charge are dealt with in the articles under those headings. When the reigning sovereign is a queen, the royal household is in some other respects rather differently arranged from that of a king and a queen consort.\nUnder a king and a queen consort, a separate establishment \"above stairs\" and \"out of doors\" works for the queen consort. She has a Lord Chamberlain's department of her own, and all the ladies of the court from the Mistress of the Robes to the Maids of Honour are in her service. At the commencement of the reign of Queen Victoria, the two establishments were combined, and considerably reduced. On the accession of Edward VII, the civil list was again reconstituted; while the household of the king and his consort became larger than during the previous reign, redundant or unnecessary offices were merged or abolished.\nThe household of Elizabeth II included 1,200 employees. This was roughly the same size as Charles II's household but larger than Victoria's, whose staff numbered 921.\nThe King and Queen\nStart of the new reign\nAppointing a new monarch's household can take some time; in 1952 the full list of appointments to the new Queen's household was not published until almost six months after her accession to the throne.\nIn 2022, walking in the state procession for the state funeral of Elizabeth II, the new King was followed by his Private Secretary, Principal Private Secretary, Master of the Household and two Equerries; however, since the King's new household had yet to be appointed they were gazetted, not as 'His Majesty's Household', but as the 'Household of the former Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall'.\nOn 13 September, five days after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, 100 staff who had been working for King Charles III while he was Prince of Wales were notified of potential redundancies. This reflects the uncertain situation of members of the Royal Households at the start of each new reign: in the days following the death of King James I in 1625, the Countess of Bedford remarked that \"[w]hat the King's resolution is yet for his own and his father's servants, he hath not declared (farther than the white staves, which are to remain as they were); but for the green cloth and other inferior officers both of the household and chamber, it is thought that he will employ his own and dismiss his father's, because he hath caused the latter all to be removed to Denmark House to attend the body, and lodged the former about himself at Whitehall\".\nAs consort of the British sovereign, Queen Camilla has a household of her own. Traditionally, queens consort have appointed their own Lord Chamberlain and various ladies-in-waiting as part of their household. There was likewise a Household of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. This tradition was scrapped in accordance with the King's view of having a slimmed-down monarchy, and instead of ladies-in-waiting, Queen Camilla is served by \"Queen's companions\", a group of six ladies who occupy the new occasional and informal position and who are not involved in tasks such as replying to letters or developing schedules. The Queen's companions are the Marchioness of Lansdowne, Jane von Westenholz,  The Hon. Lady Brooke, Sarah Troughton, Lady Sarah Keswick and Baroness Chisholm. Major Ollie Plunket serves as the Queen's equerry. Queen Elizabeth II's ladies-in-waiting were given new roles as \"ladies of the household\".\nPresent arrangements\n, the household is configured largely according to the arrangements inherited from Elizabeth II. The role of Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales continues as King's Harpist, and is currently held by Mared Pugh Evans.\nGreat Officers\nThe Great Officers of the Household are, in order of seniority, the Lord Steward, the Lord Chamberlain and the Master of the Horse. Only the Lord Chamberlain fulfils an executive function, while the other two continue to have a ceremonial role, and are seen particularly on State occasions.\nLord Chamberlain\nThe Royal Household is coordinated by the part-time Lord Chamberlain (The Lord Benyon).\nHeads of departments\nThe Private Secretary to the Sovereign (the Rt Hon. Sir Clive Alderton  since 2022), manages the Private Secretary's Office, and controls the Press Office, the Royal Archives, and the Defence Services Secretary's Office, serves as principal advisor to the Sovereign and serves as the principal channel of communication between the Sovereign and their governments. Besides these, he also manages the Sovereign's official programme and correspondence.\nThe Keeper of the Privy Purse has responsibility for the Sovereign's personal finances and those to do with semi-private concerns, along with, as Treasurer to the King oversight of the civil list. The two positions are held together and, since 2025, they have both been held by James Chalmers.\nThe Master of the Household, since 2013, has been Vice Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt  and has overall responsibility for the domestic workings of the Household.\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Office, led by its Comptroller current Lt-Colonel Michael Vernon, is responsible for official royal occasions.\nThe Royal Collection Department is overseen by its Director who since February 2018 is Tim Knox.\nOther units\nThe Royal Almonry, Ecclesiastical Household, and Medical Household are functionally separate. For accounting purposes they are the responsibility of the Keeper of the Privy Purse and Treasurer to the King.\nThe Crown Equerry has day-to-day operation of the Royal Mews, and is part of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. The other equerries have a different role: attending and assisting the King in his official duties from day to day. (Historically, they too were part of the mews, but today they are entirely separate.)\nThe Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood is also under the Lord Chamberlain's Office, as is the office of the Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps.\nThe College of Arms has been a branch of the Royal Household since its incorporation in 1484 by King Richard III it was directly appointed by the Sovereign on the recommendation of Earl Marshal. The college is a corporation of thirteen royal heralds, overseen by the Earl Marshal, a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk. The college is self-supporting and receives no funds from the Crown. The college holds jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to heraldry, genealogy, and pedigrees in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and in some Commonwealth realms.\nCertain independent and honorific posts include Master of the King's Music, Piper to the Sovereign, Poet Laureate, and Astronomer Royal. The King's Bargemaster, the Keeper of the Jewel House, the Serjeants-at-Arms, and the Warden and Marker of the Swans, perform less celebrated functions.\nThe offices of Treasurer of the Household, Comptroller of the Household, and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household are held by senior government whips in the House of Commons. In the House of Lords, the Government Chief Whip is usually appointed Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms and the Deputy Chief Whip as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, with junior whips appointed as lords-in-waiting and baronesses-in-waiting. Occasionally these officers are called upon to undertake Household duties, especially the Vice-Chamberlain, who is responsible for writing regular parliamentary reports for the King.\nIf the monarch is female she has ladies-in-waiting (formally styled either ladies of the bedchamber or women of the bedchamber), some of whom are in personal attendance on a daily basis. They are overseen by the Mistress of the Robes, who traditionally was head of the female household. If the monarch is male these roles are instead attached to the Household of the Queen consort.\nThe Household includes a number of honorary military appointments: the aides-de-camp to the King (who are usually very high-ranking officers of the three armed services), the two Gold Sticks and the Vice Admiral and Rear Admiral of the United Kingdom. In addition, the two corps of royal bodyguards (the Gentlemen at Arms and the Yeomen of the Guard) are part of the Household.\nGentlemen ushers are unpaid members of the Royal Household, often retired military officers, who provide occasional assistance as marshals at royal events. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is an important official in the Houses of Parliament; but technically he too is a member of the Royal Household (and acts as the King's messenger at the State Opening).\nThe royal residences (see list of British royal residences) in current use are cared for and maintained by the Royal Household Property Section directly from the grant-in-aid provided by Parliament, whereas Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House are privately owned and maintained. The unoccupied royal residences (including the Tower of London) are run by the Historic Royal Palaces Agency, which is self-funding.\nThe Scottish Royal Household\nThe Royal Household in Scotland includes offices of personal, honorary and state appointments. Many appointments are vacant having fallen into abeyance; been abolished or returned to The Crown; merged with other positions both before and after the Union of the Crown with England; or due to lack of a clear office holder.\nThe Great Officers of the Royal Household (not to be confused with the Great Officers of State of Scotland which are political and judicial appointments, or the Great Officers of the Crown of Scotland though some officers are shared) are:\n* Lord High Constable – Merlin Hay, 24th Earl of Erroll\n* Master of the Household – Torquhil Campbell, 13th Duke of Argyll\n* Keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse – Alexander Douglas-Hamilton, 16th Duke of Hamilton\n* Armour-Bearer and Squire of His Majesty's Body – traditionally held by the Setons of Touch\n* Bearer of the Royal Banner – Alexander Scrymgeour, 12th Earl of Dundee\n* Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland – Ian Maitland, 18th Earl of Lauderdale\n* Lord Justice General of Scotland – Paul Cullen, Lord Pentland\n* Great Steward of Scotland – Prince William, Duke of Rothesay\nEcclesiastical officers of the Ecclesiastical Household of Scotland:\n*Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland – Lady Elish Angiolini\n*Bishop of the Chapel Royal – (Vacant since the ruination of the Chapel Royal and disestablishment of the (Episcopal) Church of Scotland )\n* Royal Almoner – vacant\n*Dean of the Chapel Royal – David Fergusson\n*Dean of the Thistle, an officer of the Order of the Thistle – David Fergusson\n* 2 Chaplains:\n**The minister at Crathie Kirk\n**The minister at Canongate Kirk\n*10 Church of Scotland Honorary Chaplains to the King\nOfficers of Administration and Legal Officers:\n*Lord High Chamberlain – vacant\n*Treasurer of Scotland – vacant\n*Comptroller of Scotland – vacant\n*Great Marischal of Scotland – vacant\n*Knight Marischal – vacant\n*Justiciar of Scotia – vacant\n*Justiciar of Lothian – vacant\n*Justiciar of Galloway – vacant\n*King's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer – John Logue\n*Gentleman Usher of the White Rod – The Rt Rev.

In January 2009, a separate Household of Prince William and Prince Harry was established (formally \"The Household of His Royal Highness Prince William of Wales and His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales\"), headed by Lowther-Pinkerton. Following their marriages, the Household also additionally served their wives. The Household's offices are currently based in Kensington Palace, having formerly been based in St James's Palace. The Household, as of 2011, had the equivalent of 7.8 full-time staff.\nIt was announced in June 2011 that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would temporarily move their official London residence to an apartment in Kensington Palace, a move that was completed in August of that year. The Duke and Duchess' primary residence continued to be the island of Anglesey in Wales, where the Duke served as an RAF search and rescue pilot. The couple previously shared an apartment at Clarence House with Prince Harry, which he retained. On 6 November 2011, it was announced that the Duke, Duchess and Prince Harry, along with Elizabeth II and the Prince of Wales (later King Charles) had approved a plan that would have the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge permanently move to a larger apartment in Kensington Palace in 2013, after it is renovated. This apartment was previously occupied by the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon and her husband Antony Armstrong-Jones, Earl of Snowdon after their marriage in 1960. The apartment was retained by Princess Margaret after her divorce in 1978 and was her London residence until her death in 2002. Prince Harry then moved his official residence from Clarence House to the apartment vacated by the Cambridges. In addition, once the move was complete, their official household was also moved to Kensington Palace from St James's Palace, although the household remained shared. Until the moves were complete, their Household remained based at St James's Palace and continued to be shared.\nIt was later announced in early May 2013 that the royal couple's private secretary, James Lowther-Pinkerton, intended to leave his post as private secretary for the private sector, and his position was split with each member of the household receiving a private secretary. In September 2013, Miguel Head became Private Secretary to the Duke of Cambridge and Rebecca Deacon assumed the role of Private Secretary to the Duchess of Cambridge. Ed Perkins left his post as communication secretary at the household in 2014. On 21 November 2014, the palace announced his replacement as Jason Knauf. As of 2025, the Household had 66 people and is led by Ian Patrick, the Private Secretary to The Prince of Wales.\nList of Household staff\n;Private Secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry\n* 2005–2013: Major James Lowther-Pinkerton LVO MBE Irish Guards (Retd.)

It was based at Buckingham Palace, and was headed by his Private Secretary—the Treasurer (part-time 1970–1976) was formerly the senior officer. An equerry (a major or equivalent from any of the three armed services), and three temporary equerries (usually a captain from the Royal Marines, a captain from the Grenadier Guards, and a captain from the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) were part of the household.\nTreasurers\n*1952–1959: Lt Gen.

At the time of their 2009 annual review the Office of the Prince of Wales had the full-time equivalent of 121 staff. The head of the Household was the Principal Private Secretary, Clive Alderton. Senior officials included the Deputy Private Secretary, a senior diplomat seconded from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office to advise The Prince on Foreign and Commonwealth affairs, Scott Furssedonn-Wood; Master of the Household, Earl of Rosslyn; the Treasurer, Andrew Wright; Communications Secretary, Julian Payne; and the Equerry, Commander Iain Kearsley RN.\nIn 2000, the Prince revived a tradition of having an official harpist, a role last seen under Queen Victoria. The first holder of the office was Catrin Finch, followed in 2004 by Jemima Phillips, and in 2007 by Claire Jones. Following Prince Charles's accession to the throne in 2022, the role has been referred to as King's Harpist.\nThe Prince of Wales' Office was principally based at Clarence House, London, but also occupied rooms in the rest of St James's Palace. There were also offices for official staff at Highgrove House and Birkhall House, the Prince's private residences.\nMost of the expenses incurred in operating the office came from the Prince's private appanage, the Duchy of Cornwall.

From 1971, Prince Andrew (then aged 11 years), had the assistance of one of the Queen's equerries when required. The first was Sqn Ldr Peter Beer, who served until he was replaced by Maj. George Broke Royal Artillery in 1974, and Lt Cdr Robert Guy RN in 1977.\nIt was only with the appointment in 1980 of Sqn Ldr Adam Wise, that the Prince could be said to have acquired the assistance of his own staff – although he was still shared with the Queen and Prince Edward. In 1983, Wise was promoted to wing commander and appointed Private Secretary to Princes Andrew and Edward, severing his link with The Royal Household. He left the Duke of York's service in 1987, when Lt Col. Sean O'Dwyer was appointed – also jointly with Prince Edward.\nThe Duke of York was assisted by a private secretary, deputy private secretary, assistant private secretary and equerry. There were an office assistant, and a handful of personal staff including cook and butler. The Duke of York's office was based at Buckingham Palace, and the Duke has a residence at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, into which he moved during 2004, from Sunninghill Park, Ascot.\nIn December 2022, it was reported that as a non-working member of the royal family he would no longer have an office at Buckingham Palace.\nPrivate Secretaries to the Duke of York\n*1983–1987: Wg Cdr Adam Wise LVO MBE\n*1987–1990: Lt Col.
