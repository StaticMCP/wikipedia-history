The unit arrived in Korea in August 1950. It was composed of 1,468 troops, and was the fifth largest force under the United Nations Command. The PEFTOK took part in the Battle of Miudong (which was hailed as the first battle won by Filipino soldiers in a foreign soil), Battle of Yultong and the Battle of Hill Eerie. The unit operated alongside the United States 1st Cavalry Division, 3rd Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, and 45th Infantry Division.\nUnits/Battalions/Regiments\n2nd Battalion Combat Team (BCT)\n2nd BCT served in April–May 1954.PEFTOK The \"Black Lion\" unit was an experienced combat force in the anti-Huk campaign which arrived in South Korea to extend peacekeeping and reconstruction work. Reynaldo Mendoza, who succeeded Col. Antonio de Veyra as battalion commander of the 2nd BCT, received the Ulchi Distinguished Military Service Medal and Korean War Hero Medal for his service and leadership during the expedition.\n10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT)\n10th BCT Tank Co Motorized (\"The Fighting Filipinos\") led by Lt. Col. Mariano Azurin, later reliefed and led by his 2IC Lt. Col. Dionisio S. Ojeda  received the U.S. Gallantry Award for the April 22–23, Battle of Yultong, where it suffered 10 Killed in action (KIA), 14 Missing in action (MIA), 26 Wounded in action (WIA), and 5 additional KIA in rescue efforts for UN.  The Tank Company of the 10th BCT was at the frontline, under the command of Captain Conrado Yap.\n, September 1950]]\nIn the Battle of Miudong which happened in November 1950, at early dawn at the outskirts of Miudong, First Sergeant Maximo P Young and his men were ordered by the US 3rd Infantry Division to secure the area known as Syngue. At around 7:30 a.m. on November 11, 1950, together with other Filipino soldiers of the 10th Battalion Combat Team, they reconnoitered with armored tanks in tow, an area believed to be occupied by enemy forces. As they approached the bend, at around 9:30 a.m. following an explosion which destroyed the army truck up front, a volley of small arms fire met them and a number of Filipino soldiers got hit. FSgt Young was inside the third tank and the personnel of the first and second tanks seemed to have been stunned. FSgt Young assessed and reconnoitered the immediate surroundings via the tank's periscope, then maneuvered to get to the top of the tank and grabbed the machine gun atop the tank's turret. He successfully operated the machine gun as he fired relentlessly at the direction of the enemies. With continuous machine gun fire, FSgt Young repulsed the advancing enemy forces and avoided costly loss of lives among their ranks. This battle was recorded in Korean history as the Battle of Miudong/Syngue and was hailed as the first battle won by Filipinos in foreign soil. FSgt Young was awarded by the Philippine government with the Gold Cross Medal for this heroic feat. On July 27, 2016; FSgt Young who rose to become a Major in the Philippine Army was awarded by the Prime Minister of South Korea, Hwang Kyo-Ahn, the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit.\nIn the Battle of Yuldong, the biggest battle that the Filipino soldiers fought in the Korean War, Captain Yap was given the authority to withdraw because they were severely outnumbered. Captain Yap's problem was that one of the platoons under his command was being destroyed and he wouldn't leave his men behind. Instead, he counter-attacked and recovered the dead and rescued his wounded men. Unfortunately, he lost his life in the process. He was awarded the Medal of Valor by the Philippines, the Distinguished Service Cross by the U.S. and the Taegeuk Order of Military Merit by South Korea, making him the only Filipino hero decorated by three countries with the most prestigious medal that they could possibly give.
