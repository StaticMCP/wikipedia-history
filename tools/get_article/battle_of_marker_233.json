However, this cut off the French troops from their water supply, which led to a deterioration in relations between France and Tunisia. These tensions escalated further in July 1961 during the Bizerte crisis. As a result, French forces advanced to the gates of Garet al Hamel with the aim of retaking marker 233.\nBattle\nTunisian forces, commanded by Abdallah el Abbab, successfully defended marker 233. During the fighting, they reportedly killed more than 60 French soldiers, shot down a plane, and destroyed six vehicles.\nAftermath\nThree days later, a ceasefire was issued by the Security Council, and Tunisian forces were called upon to withdraw from marker 233. However, French forces took advantage of the ceasefire to re-establish their presence in the surrounding area.\nReferences"
