The Swedes attacked the Danish redoubt and successfully captured both Danish commanders and crushed the popular resistance in Jutland as a consequence of the battle.\nBackground\nIn October, during the ongoing Siege of Fredriksodde, Carl Gustaf Wrangel was forced to conserve his supplies. He therefore sent three cavalry regiments, amounting to some 500–700 horse under Generalmajor Böddeker, towards northern Jutland, in order to both subjugate it and to gather food and fodder for the Swedish horses.\nBattle\nOn 3 October, the cavalry under Böddeker encountered a Danish redoubt at Nabe in Agger defended by 150 Danish cavalry and around 1,500–2,000 peasant levies, respectively under the Lieutenant Colonels Niels Lykke and Friedrich Ziegler. At the time, Lykke was off visiting relatives, and Ziegler was drunk and possibly also away from the redoubt, while the peasants were unenthusiastic about battle. As a consequence, some 600 peasants deserted immediately before the Swedish attack.\nThis reduced the Danish strength to, at most, around 150 cavalry and 900 peasants. In the ensuing short but intense battle, the Swedes under Böddeker killed many peasants and soon also managed to capture both Lykke and Ziegler, along with the rest. Many of the peasants fled north, closely pursued by the Swedes who ruthlessly killed anyone they caught up with.\nThe exact number of dead is unknown, with some figures stating 80 cavalry and 200 peasants dead, although contemporary church records indicate no more than around 60 killed. Other sources claim 800 peasants were killed in the fighting.\nBöddeker believed that the peasants needed to be taught a lesson. However, the captured peasants were quickly released to return home, carrying with them a strict warning to lay down their weapons and instead go back to their labor.\nAftermath\nAs a consequence of the battle, all popular resistance against the Swedes that still remained in Jutland was shattered, and the Jutland peasants henceforth took no active part in the war.\nLegacy\nOn the 300th anniversary of the battle, a memorial stone was erected at the battlefield. It was placed in a location where the fleeing Danes and pursuing Swedes must have passed.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
