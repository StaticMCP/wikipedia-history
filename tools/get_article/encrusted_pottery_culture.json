It emerged from the Kisapostag culture, which was preceded by the Somogyvár-Vinkovci culture. The Encrusted Pottery culture expanded eastwards and southwards along the Danube into parts of Croatia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria in response to migrations from the northwest by the Tumulus culture, resulting in the emergence of groups such as Dubovác–Žuto Brdo in Serbia and Gârla Mare–Cârna in Romania, which are considered to be southern manifestations of the Encrusted Pottery culture. The culture was named after its distinctive pottery decorated with incised designs inlaid with white lime, and  southern groups are notable for the production of figurines or idols decorated in the same style. Stylistic similarities have also been noted between Encrusted Pottery artefacts and artefacts from Mycenaean Greece.\nGenetic profile\nFour Y-DNA testings from the Balatonkeresztúr mass grave burial dated to the Encrusted Pottery Culture can be assigned to I2a-M223>>L1229 which is I2a2a1b (group I2a-M223 was\npresent in Megalithic cultures from the British Isles to today's Czechia), while two males' Y-DNA could be assigned to the R1b-Z2103 clade, which appears in contemporaneous populations such as in Bell Beaker period samples from Hungary or a Vucedol culture associated individual from Croatia (in whichever case the most ancient samples come from the Pontic steppes). The ancestry composition of the eight individuals buried was ~29% hunter-gatherer, ~46% European farmer, ~25% western steppe herder. Some individuals had up to ~47% Mesolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry, despite this component being thought to be highly diluted by the time of the Early Bronze Age.\nGallery\nFile:Bronzedagger.png|Bronze dagger, Hungary, c. 1800 BC\nFile:Romania, possibly Cirna, Middle Bronze Age - Large Bowl - 1993.229 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|Large ceramic bowl, Romania\nFile:Bird-shaped ceramic vessel, Museum of Oltenia I 55837.jpg|Bird-shaped ceramic vessel\nFile:Vršac museum artefacts 003, Vatin culture (Bronze Age).jpg|Pottery, Serbia\nFile:Carna figurine lb mnir.jpg|Ceramic figurine or idol, Romania\nFile:Figurina iz groba, bronzano doba, Stubarlija, Mošorin.tif|Figurine from Stubarlija, Serbia\nFile:Kličevac Idol, Serbia.jpg|Kličevac Idol, Serbia\nFile:Bronze Age Europe Bronze Ornaments (28471753250).jpg|alt=Gold lock-rings and other ornaments from Pécs, Hungary.|Gold lock-rings and bracelets from Pécs, Hungary.\nFile:Bronze Age applied art and craft 2nd millenium BC (National Museum of Serbia).jpg|Decorated ceramic disc, Serbia\nFile:Sombor museum artefacts 018 (Bronze Age).jpg|Pottery, Serbia\nFile:Dupljaja.jpg|Chariot model 1 from Dupljaja, Serbia\nFile:Chariot from Dupljaja, Serbia, c.1300 BC (Bronze Age).jpg|Chariot model 1, side view\nFile:Dupljaja Chariot 2.png|Chariot model 2 from Dupljaja, Serbia\nFile:Dupljaja Chariot 2a.png|Chariot model 2, reverse view\nSee also\n* Ottomány culture\n* Unetice culture\n* Wietenberg culture\n* Monteoru culture\n* Tei culture\n* Vatya culture\n* Nordic Bronze Age\n* Srubnaya culture\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://isaw.nyu.edu/exhibitions/ritual-and-memory/objects/figurine-dalj 'Figurine', Encrusted Pottery culture, 1700–1400 BCE, Institute for the study of the Ancient World]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303683679_Notes_on_Sun_Cult_and_Burials_in_the_Romanian_Middle_and_Late_Bronze_Age_ca_2000-1200_BC Notes on Sun Cult and Burials in the Romanian Middle and Late Bronze Age (ca 2000-1200 BC)]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342992406_Bronze_Age_anthropomorphic_and_zoomorphic_representations_in_Hungary_In_TRANS_LACUM_PELSONEM_PRAHISTORISCHE_FORSCHUNGEN_IN_SUDWESTUNGARN_5500-500_v_Chr_PREHISTORIC_RESEARCH_IN_SOUTH-WESTERN_HUNGARY_55 Bronze Age anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representations in Hungary]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303541668_Reconfiguring_anatomy_ceramics_cremation_and_cosmology_in_the_Late_Bronze_Age_in_the_Lower_Danube ceramics, cremation and cosmology in the Late Bronze Age in the Lower Danube]"
