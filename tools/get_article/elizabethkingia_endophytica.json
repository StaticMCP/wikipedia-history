A comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate showed 99.1, 97.8, and 97.4% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the type strains of Elizabethkingia anophelis, Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and Elizabethkingia miricola, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that the strain is representative of a new species.\nReferences"
