A Liberal, he was Canada's longest-serving prime minister, with three separate terms as prime minister (1921–1926, 1926–1930 and 1935–1948), for a total of 21 years and 154 days.  He defeated Prime Ministers Arthur Meighen and R.B. Bennett at different times, and was succeeded by Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent in 1948.\nKing was elected to the House of Commons of Canada twelve times (1908, 1909, 1919, 1921, 1922, 1926 (twice), 1930, 1935, 1940, and 1945).\nHe was elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1919, by the first leadership convention for a federal party in Canada.\nSummary\nKing was the longest-serving Prime Minister, in office for a total of 21 years, 154 days.  He led the Liberal Party of Canada in seven consecutive general elections, winning six times (1921, 1925, 1926, 1935, 1940, 1945) and losing once (1930).  He won minority governments three times (1925, 1926 1945) and majority governments three times (1921, 1935, and 1940). He is in a three-way tie with Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier for the number of general elections he contested as leader of a party.\nHis unbroken term in office from October 23, 1935 to November 14, 1948 (just over thirteen years) is the second-longest unbroken term, coming after Laurier's unbroken term in office of over fifteen years (July 11, 1896 to October 6, 1911) and just ahead of Macdonald's longest unbroken term of just under thirteen years (October 17, 1878 to June 6, 1891).\nKing was the third of four prime ministers to serve non-consecutive terms, the others being Macdonald, Meighen, and Pierre Trudeau.\nKing was the fourth of five prime ministers from Ontario, the others being Sir John A. Macdonald, Alexander Mackenzie, Sir Mackenzie Bowell, and Lester Pearson.\nKing stood for election to the House of Commons of Canada sixteen times, in ten general elections and six by-elections. He was elected twelve times and defeated four times. Three of the by-elections were ministerial by-elections, triggered by King entering the federal Cabinet, once as Minister of Labour (1909) and twice as prime minister (1922, 1926).  Two of the by-elections were in response to his defeats in his own constituency in general elections, which compelled him to seek election to a safe seat to re-enter the Commons.  One by-election was after his election as leader of the Liberal Party, where he stood for election in a vacant seat to enter the House of Commons as quickly as possible.\nKing was a member of the House of Commons for five different constituencies, from three different provinces (Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan), a more diverse electoral record than any other prime minister.  He served in the House of Commons for a total of 32 years and 7 days.\nFederal general elections, 1921 to 1945\nKing led the Liberal Party in seven general elections, winning six (three majority governments and three minority governments) and was defeated once.\nFederal election, 1921\nThe 1921 election resulted in the a razor-thin majority government for King.  King was able to maintain his government for four years, with the support of the Progressives in the Commons.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Canadian federal election, 1921 – parties, leaders, seats won and popular vote\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!Leaders!!Seats won!!Popular vote\n|-\n|W.

King was also defeated in his own seat of York North, Ontario and had to seek election in a safe seat, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. However, he was forced to resign over a federal procurement scandal less than a year into office, leading to his replacement as prime minister by Arthur Meighen, leader of the Liberal-Conservatives.  These events triggered a constitutional crisis, the King–Byng Affair, and the general election of 1926.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Canadian federal election, 1925 – parties, leaders, seats won and popular vote\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!Leaders!!Seats won!!Popular vote\n|-\n|Liberal-Conservative||Arthur Meighen1||align=center|115||align=center|46.1%\n|-\n|W.

King's resignation triggered a constitutional crisis, the King–Byng Affair.  King and the Liberals won the greatest number of seats in the election, but were short of a majority.  King formed a minority government with support from some Progressives, particularly the Liberal-Progressives.  His minority government lasted for four years.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Canadian federal election, 1926 – parties, leaders, seats won and popular vote\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!Leaders!!Seats won!!Popular vote\n|-\n|W.

Although the custom at the time was that the other parties would not contest a by-election to allow a party leader to obtain a seat, the defeated Conservative candidate from the general election, future prime minister John Diefenbaker, encouraged David Burgess to contest the seat as an independent.\n1926 Federal election: Prince Albert\nThis is the only case where two future prime ministers faced each other as candidates for the same riding.\n1926 Federal ministerial by-election:  Prince Albert\nDue to a federal procurement scandal, King had resigned as prime minister in mid-1926 and been replaced by Arthur Meighen, who shortly afterwards called the 1926 general election.
