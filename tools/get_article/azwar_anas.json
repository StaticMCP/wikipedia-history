A member of the Golkar political party, he served in a number of positions during President Suharto's New Order regime. During his career in government, he served as the coordinating minister for people's welfare, minister of transportation, and governor of the province of West Sumatra.\nBorn in Padang, in what was then the West Sumatra Residency, he graduated from the Bandung Institute of Technology in 1959, and attended Syracuse University that same year. He then joined the military, and underwent military training at the Reserve Officers School in Bogor. After graduating he was appointed by President Sukarno as a first lieutenant. During his time in the military, he became the director of Semen Padang.\nIn 1977, he was elected as the governor of West Sumatra, following the end of Harun Zain's term. He served as governor for two terms, from 1977 until 1987. As governor, he was known for his religiosity and was popular among many West Sumatrans. After leaving the office of governor, he continued to serve in government. In 1988, he was appointed minister of transportation and later he was appointed the General Chair of the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) in 1991. Two years later, Azwar was appointed coordinating minister for people's welfare, before eventually leaving government in 1998.\nDeath\nAzwar Anas died of respiratory illness in the CICU of Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, Central Jakarta, on March 5 2023, at 11.42 WIB at the age of 91 years after undergoing treatment for two months.
