It follows the adventures of a troupe of travelling musicians in the 1910s. It was released in France as Mariquita, La Belle de Tabarin.\nSoledad Miranda had a very small uncredited role in this film, the first time she appeared in a Franco film. She would later go on to star in 6 of Franco's thrillers in 1970, before her death in a tragic automobile accident. This was the first time Franco worked for producer Marius Lesouer as well, who would go on to produce many of Franco's later films, including his 1961 opus The Awful Dr. Orloff.\nPartial cast\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*"
