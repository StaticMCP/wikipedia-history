REAL saw this as damage and betrayal of the foundations of the republic. The REAL Movement was founded on Facebook in 2009.\nIlgar Mammadov, who wanted to run in the 2013 presidential election, attended rallies in Ismayilli. Ilgar Mammadov was sentenced to seven years in prison for violating public order.\nCongresses\nFirst Constituent Assembly\nThe first attempt to hold the founding congress was made on 29 October 2017. Information on this was announced on 24 January 2014. However, the Baku City Executive Power rejected REAL's request to allocate a place for the congress.\nThe Constituent Assembly Initiative Group again appealed to the authorities to provide a venue for the convention on 4, 5, 11, 12, 18, 19, 25 and 26 November or the first week of December. However, the executive power also rejected this appeal.\nElection results\nNational Assembly elections\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!Election\n! Leader\n! Votes\n! %\n!
