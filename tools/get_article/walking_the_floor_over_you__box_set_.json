It is an eight-CD box set and was released in 1996. It contains 208 songs, many of them are previously unissued on LP or CD. The set includes extensive liner notes, session notes and photographs.\nThe collection covers Tubb's recordings from 1936 until early 1947. It ranges from Tubb accompanied only by his guitar to the developing of the roots of honkey tonk music.\nReception\n}}\nIn his Allmusic review, Bruce Eder describes Disc Two as \"...where honky tonk comes into the world fully formed, with a comparatively loud, jaunty backup and Tubb's vocals acquiring the smooth, deep, emotive quality that characterized his peak performance. This disc is Ernest Tubb lean and mean, creating a popular music genre as he goes along.\"\nPersonnel\n*Ernest Tubb – vocals, guitar\n*Jerry Byrd – steel guitar\n*Bill Drake – guitar\n*Jack Drake – bass\n*Wayne Fleming – steel guitar\n*Ray \"Kemo\" Head – steel guitar\n*Herbert M.
