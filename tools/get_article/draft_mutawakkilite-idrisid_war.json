The conflicts reshaped power in southern Arabia and culminated in the decline of Idrisi influence.\nBackground\nThe Idrisi Emirate, founded by Muhammad ibn Ali al-Idrisi in 1906, emerged from Ottoman withdrawal and gained British backing to counter Ottoman and Saudi expansion.\nImam Yahya sought to unify Yemen historically from Asir to Dhofar and resist foreign encroachment.\nCourse of the war\nDespite British military support, the Idrisis never secured a battlefield victory. Ameen Rihani states that “the Idrisis and their British allies did not win a single battle against the Mutawakkilites.”\nImam Yahya's forces advanced into Asir, besieging Aden’s walls and reaching Ṣabiyā.\nThe British seized al-Hudaydah and handed it to the Idrisis to reinforce them. This provoked Imam Yahya, who retook the port and clashed with British forces.\nThe fragmented Idrisi leadership offered a political union under Imam Yahya, but he refused, citing their Moroccan origin and labeling them non-Arab intruders to be expelled.\nOutcome\nImam Yahya achieved a decisive victory. The Idrisi Emirate lost autonomy and later came under Saudi control. British attempts to project power via the Idrisis failed.\nLegacy\nThese wars ended the Idrisis as a regional force and underscored the limits of British influence in the Arabian hinterland.\nReferences\n* Anne K.
