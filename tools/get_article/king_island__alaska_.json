It is about  south of Wales, Alaska. Although it has been used in the past as a winter home by the Iñupiat, it is currently uninhabited.\nEtymology\nThe Iñupiaq name for island is Ugiuvak, which roughly translates to \"a place for winter\". Its inhabitants called themselves Ugiuvaŋmiut, meaning residents of Ugiuvak. The island was given the English name \"King Island\" by Captain James Cook, the first European to sight the island, in 1778 for Lt. James King, a member of his party.\nHistory\nThe island was once the winter home of the Ugiuvaŋmiut, a group of Inupiat who lived there during the long winter. While on the island, they hunted seals and walruses. In the summer, they would journey via kayak to the mainland, near the location of present-day Nome. Residents hunted caribou and salmon and gathered berries and vegetables. Due to the limited daylight during the winter, the days were spent dancing in the \"Qagri\", or men's communal house. As an example, the month of December is known to the Uġiuvaŋmiut as Sauyatugvik or \"the time of drumming\".\nThe population of the island, while numbering in the hundreds beforehand, was crippled in the late 19th century by Russian and American whalers in the Bering Sea. In particular, the mass killing of walruses by whalers destroyed the food supply of the island and led to the death of over 200 Ugiuvaŋmiut in 1890. The whaling industry in Alaska declined soon after the Whaling disaster of 1871.\nAfter the establishment of Nome in the early 20th century, the islanders began to sell walrus ivory carvings to residents of Nome and travelers during the summer. In 1929, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) established a school and a Catholic church on the island. By 1937 the island was home to 190 residents.\nRie Muñoz, a teacher at the BIA, arrived on King Island in 1951 and lived there for several years with her husband Juan.\nPopulation decline\nDuring WWII, many men from the island were drafted; many were killed during the war. Outbreaks of tuberculosis killed other residents, while others relocated to the mainland for access to healthcare.\nIn 1959, the BIA closed the island's school due to a suspected rockslide danger, forcibly relocating children to go to school on the Alaskan mainland. Families were effectively forced to move to the mainland with their children, and by 1966, all King Island residents had moved to mainland Alaska year-round.\nAlthough the King Islanders have moved off the island, they have kept a distinct cultural identity. Some King Islanders still return to the island to gather subsistence foods, such as walrus and seal.\nRecent history\nThe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act established the King Island Native Corporation in 1990, with title to all of King Island and parts of Cape Woolley and Woolley Lagoon.\nIn 2003, Oregon State University professor Deanna Kingston, herself a descendant of the Ugiuvaŋmiut, received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to compare scientific and geographical knowledge with the islanders' traditional ecological knowledge. Using this research, she created an interactive website documenting the biological and cultural geography of the island.\nIn 2005 and 2006, the NSF funded a research project which brought a few King Island natives back to the island. Some participants had not been back to the island in 50 years.\nGeography\nKing Island is located about  offshore, south of the village of Wales, Alaska and 85 miles northwest of Nome. The island is about  wide with steep slopes on all sides. It is part of the Bering Sea unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.\nDemographics\n}}\nKing Island first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated native eskimo village of \"Ookivagamute.\" In 1890, it returned as Ukivok. It next appeared in 1910 as King Island and would continue to report until 1960, with the exception of 1950 when no figure was reported. It next reported as Ukivok again, classified as a native village (ANVSA) in 1980 and 1990, but with no residents.\nGallery\nFile:King Island 3 2010-09-08.jpg|King Island\nFile:King Island 2 2010-09-08.jpg|King Island: Rock formations that resemble ruins, on the saddle of the island\nFile:KingIslandBoatsUSGSric00644.jpg|King Island residents in kayaks, about 1892.

Though born in Nome, Alaska, in 1950, he is the grandson of Chief Suuqiina of Okvok Island (now King Island). His mother was a full-blood Inuit.
