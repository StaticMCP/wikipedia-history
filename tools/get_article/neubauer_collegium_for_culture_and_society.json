It was founded with a gift of $26.5-million  from Joseph Neubauer, former CEO and chairman of Aramark Corporation, and  Jeanette Lerman-Neubauer, founder of the  Philadelphia marketing and communications firm, J.P. Lerman & Company.  A second major gift came from Emmanuel Roman, CEO of PIMCO and a University of Chicago graduate in whose honor the head of the Collegium is named the Roman Family Director. Gallery exhibitions at the Neubauer Collegium, along with other projects addressing themes such as the environment and media, are supported by the Brenda Mulmed Shapiro Fund.\nThe inaugural cohort of 18 faculty research projects were announced in March 2013 and represented faculty from 17 departments, as well as the Chicago Booth School of Business, the Divinity School, the Law School, the Pritzker School of Medicine, and the Oriental Institute. The center launched its tenth cohort of new research projects on July 1, 2022, bringing the total number of faculty-led research projects at the center to 117.\nCampus\nThe collegium occupies an historic 16,000 sq. ft. Collegiate Gothic style building erected in 1933 as the home of the Meadville Lombard Theological School, adjacent to the campus of the University of Chicago in Hyde Park which was purchased by the University in 2011 and was renovated by Kliment Halsband Architects.\nLeadership\nDavid Nirenberg served as the inaugural faculty director of the Neubauer Collegium from 2012 to 2014. Jonathan Lear, the John U. Nef Distinguished Service Professor at the Committee on Social Thought and in the Department of Philosophy, was named Roman Family Director of the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society in October, 2014. Lear stepped down in June 2022, and Tara Zahra, Homer J. Livingston Professor of East European History and the College, has served as Roman Family Director since July 2022.\nAn advisory board comprising faculty from across the University works closely with the director.
