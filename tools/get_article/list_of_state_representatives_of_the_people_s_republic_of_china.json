The state representative is often, but not always, also the top leader of China. Under the current constitution, which does not officially define any office as the head of state, the state representative is the president of the People's Republic of China. The role was created in 1954 when the first constitution consolidated the system of government in the People's Republic of China. At the time, the title was translated into English as State Chairman. The position was abolished between 1975 and 1982 with the functions of state representative being performed by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The presidency was revived under the fourth constitution in 1982.\nList of state representatives\n; Generations of leadership\n||||}}\nCentral People's Government (1949–1954)\n;Chairman of the Central People's Government\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n! colspan=\"2\" width=5%|Portrait\n! width=30% colspan=\"2\"|Name(Lifespan)\n! colspan=\"2\" width=30%|Term of office\n! width=30%|\n! width=30%|Paramount leader\n|- bgcolor=#EEEEEE\n! rowspan =\"2\" ; style=\"background-color: #FFB6B6\" width=20|–\n| rowspan =\"2\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" ; rowspan =\"2\" ; align=\"center\"| Mao Zedong毛泽东(1893–1976)\n| width=10%|1 October 1949\n| width=10%|27 September 1954\n| Zhu DeLiu ShaoqiSoong Ching-lingLi JishenZhang LanGao Gang\n| Himself\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\"| Mao also held more powerful offices as Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him the Paramount leader of China.\n|}\nThe 1st Constitution (1954–1975)\n;Chairman of the People's Republic of China\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|+\n!

Under Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial developmental growth with continued reforms, oversaw the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom and Macau from Portugal, and improved its relations with the outside world while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the government. Jiang was criticized for being too concerned about his personal image at home, and too conciliatory towards Russia and the United States abroad.\n|- bgcolor=#EEEEEE\n!rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: #CCFFCC\" |6\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| Hu Jintao胡锦涛(born 1942)Tibet At-large (until 2008)Jiangsu At-large (from 2008)\n| width=10%|15 March 2003\n| width=10%|15 March 2008\n| X —\n| Zeng Qinghong\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Himself\n|- bgcolor=#EEEEEE\n| width=10%|15 March 2008\n| width=10%|14 March 2013\n| XI —\n| Xi Jinping\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"| Hu, long having been anointed by Deng as Jiang's successor, took over the presidency in 2003, and also held the offices of General Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Central Military Commission.
