Al Ghuwariyah was a municipality of Qatar until 2004, when it was merged with Al Khor Municipality.\nIt has been populated mostly by members of the Na'im tribe since the early 1920s.\nEtymology\nTwo suggestions have been put forth for the origin of Al Ghuwariyah's name. The first states that it is derived from alghar, the Arabic term for the laurel family of plants. This is considered unlikely as this family of plants is not found in Qatar. The more plausible explanation is that the name derives from the Arabic word ghar, which translates to \"cave\". This is lent credence by the presence of two prominent caves nearby.\nHistory\nAn entry for Al Ghuwariyah can be found in J. G. Lorimer's 1908 Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. He describes it as a nomadic camping ground  south-west of Al Huwaila and mentions a nearby masonry well, 8 fathoms deep, that yields good water.\nBased on field work carried out by anthropologist Henry Field in the 1950s, the main tribe in the area of Al Ghuwariyah were the Al Jafali tribe. Starting in 1960, the government made a concerted effort to settle the country's nomadic tribes, relocating members of the Na'im tribe here as it sat on the boundary of their tribal territory.\nAfter Qatar started to receive substantial profits from its oil extraction activities in the 1960s and 1970s, the government launched several housing projects for its citizens. As part of this initiative, 55 houses were built in Al Ghuwariyah by 1976. In 1986, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs opened a municipal office in Al Ghuwariyah.\nAccording to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, there were about 65 total households within the town limits in 2014.\nAdministration\nAl Ghuwariyah Municipality\nAl Ghuwariyah was a municipality until 2004, when it was merged with Al Khor. It did not administer over any other census-designated cities or towns except for itself.\nIn 2004 census, out of a population of 2,159, the number of Muslims amounted to 1,666, Christians amounted to 52.\n;Registered live births\nThe following table is a breakdown of registered live births by nationality and sex for Al Ghuwariyah.
