The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honor non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 35th Academy Awards, thirteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. South Korea submitted a film for the first time. The five nominated films came from Brazil, France, Greece, Italy and Mexico.\nFrance won for the fifth time with Sundays and Cybèle by Serge Bourguignon, which was also nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Scoring of Music—Adaptation or Treatment in the subsequent ceremony (36th Academy Awards).\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
