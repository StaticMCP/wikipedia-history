It allows the user to create projects that that can not be acheived or as good as in turbowarp.\nInterface & Extensions\nThe interface of turbowarp is very simular to scratch's. It included blocks, a stage where everything takes place, a paint editor, a sound editor, and more. A difference of scratch's though is the extensions. Scratch's is limited to Music, Pen, Video Sensing, Text to Speech, Translate, Makey Makey, micro:bit, Lego mindstorm EV3, lego boost, lego education WeDo 2.0, and Go direct force and Acceleration. While Turbowarp has no limitations, it contains a large library of extensions, but if you want any more, you could either program it in javascript or try to find it on the web.\nDocumentation & Links\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Documentation (not all, just the most important ones)\n!Link & Name\n!Description\n|-\n|[https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/extensions/introduction Extension creation]\n|A introduction to creating your own\n|-\n|[https://docs.turbowarp.org/how How turbowarp runs faster than scratch]\n|Shows how turbowarp runs faster than scratch\n|-\n|[https://docs.turbowarp.org/custom-fps Custom FPS]\n|talks about customising how some scripts are run\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Links (not all, just the most important ones)\n!Name & Link\n!Description\n|-\n|[https://turbowarp.org/ Site]\n|The place you get shown when you go to https://turbowarp.org/\n|-\n|[https://desktop.turbowarp.org/ Desktop]\n|A place to download turbowarp for Linux, Windows, and MacOS users\n|-\n|[https://turbowarp.org/addons addons]\n|A page where you can customize your expirience.
