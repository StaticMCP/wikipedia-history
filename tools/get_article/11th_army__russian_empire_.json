The unit fought on the Southwestern Front during the entire war.  Its attempt to seize the Austrian-held fortress of Przemyśl in October 1914 failed, in part due to a lack of heavy artillery, and led to a siege that lasted until March 1915.\nCommanders\n* 21 October 1914 – 4 April 1915 — General of Infantry Andrey Selivanov\n* 4 April 1915 – 19 October 1915 — General of Infantry Dmitry Shcherbachev\n* 19 October 1915 – 25 October 1916 — General of Infantry Vladimir Viktorovich Sakharov\n* 25 October 1916 – 20 December 1916 — General of Infantry Vladislav Klembovsky\n* 20 December 1916 – 4 April 1917 — General of Infantry Dimitri Bałanin\n* 15 April 1917 – 21 May 1917 — Lieutenant-General Aleksei Gutor\n* 25 May 1917 – 4 June 1917 — General of Infantry Ivan Fiedotov\n* 4 June 1917 – 9 July 1917 — General of Cavalry Ivan Erdélyi\n* 29 April 1917 – 9 September 1917 — General of Infantry Pyotr Baluyev\n* 19 September 1917 – 29 August 1917 — Lieutenant-General Fiodor Rerberg\n* 1 September 1917 – 1 December 1917 — Lieutenant-General Mikhail Promtov\nSee also\n* List of Russian armies in World War I\n* List of Imperial Russian Army formations and units\nReferences"
