It was based on the humanistic school of Roman law, and it was in turn the basis for the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, drafted in 1530 and ratified in 1532.\nIn 1507, Schwarzenberg was a leader of the knights of Franconia.\nFrom 1522 to 1524, he was a member of the Reichsregiment (Imperial regiment), a body formed for the government of the Holy Roman Empire, and in the absence of Charles V even the governor of the Empire.\nHe composed moral and satirical poems and works regarding the Reformation.\nHe also did translations, mainly of Cicero.\nHe was an early adherent and friend of Martin Luther.\nSee also\n* House of Schwarzenberg\nReferences\n;Attribution\n*\n; Endnotes:\n*see W.
