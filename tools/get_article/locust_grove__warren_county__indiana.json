A 1913 history describes the town's population as \"less than a hundred\", but all that remains at the site is the Locust Grove Church, Locust Grove Cemetery and a few homes.\nGeography\nLocust Grove is located at the intersection of County Roads 850 N and 600 W.  It sits in open farmland on a low, broad hill.\nReferences\n* Clifton, Thomas A. (editor) (1913), Past and Present of Fountain and Warren Counties, Indiana, Indianapolis: B. F. Bowen & Co."
