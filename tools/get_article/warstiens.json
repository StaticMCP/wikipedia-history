It had a population of around 35 in January 2017.\nHistory\nThe village was first mentioned in 1477 as Wer-steens, and means \"parcel of land of Steene (person)\". In 1840, Warstiens was home to 27 people. In 1882, a new Dutch Reformed church was constructed in the village. The bell from 1252 of the old church is nowadays on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The church is used for service twice a month.\nBefore 2014, Warstiens was part of Boarnsterhim municipality and before 1984 it belonged to Idaarderadeel.\nGallery\nFile:Het cenrtum van Warstiens.JPG|Village centre\nFile:Bankje-Le lit des coquillages..JPG|Bench Le lit des coquillages (The seashell bed)\nFile:Haven fan Warstiens.jpg|Canal view\nFile:Warstiens haventje.JPG|The harbour of Warstiens\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
