The other ministers were appointed by the emperor directly. For the validity of the norms and decrees issued by the emperor, the signatures of the prime minister and of the ministers of the portfolios related to the matter of such are necessary; Government acts that lack ministerial endorsement in a constitutional system are null.\nFormer holders of the title\n; Parties\nFirst Empire\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n!# !!
