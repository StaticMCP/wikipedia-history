Its capacity was sufficient to feed the whole nearby city of Arles.]]\n, Roman Asia. The 3rd century mill is the earliest known machine to incorporate a crank and connecting rod mechanism.]]\nThis list of ancient watermills presents an overview of water-powered grain-mills and industrial mills in classical antiquity, including the Hellenistic period through the Roman period up until circa 500 AD.\nThe water wheel and watermill are the earliest instances of machines harnessing natural forces to replace human muscular labour (apart from the sail). As such, it holds a special place in the history of technology and also in economic studies where it is associated with growth.\nThe invention of the watermill is a question open to scholarly discussion, but is generally agreed to have occurred in the ancient Near East, either before or during the Hellenistic period. In the subsequent Roman period, the use of water-power was diversified and different types of watermills were introduced. These include all three variants of the vertical water wheel as well as the horizontal water wheel. Apart from its main use in grinding flour, water-power was also applied to pounding grain, crushing ore, sawing stones and possibly fulling and bellows for iron furnaces.\nAn increased research interest has greatly improved our knowledge of Roman watermill sites in recent years. Numerous archaeological finds in the western half of the empire now complement the surviving documentary material from the eastern provinces; they demonstrate that the breakthrough of watermill technology occurred as early as the 1st century AD and was not delayed until the onset of the Middle Ages as previously thought. The data shows a wide spread of grain-mills over most parts of the empire, with industrial mills also being in evidence in both halves. Although the prevalence of grain-mills naturally meant that watermilling remained primarily a rural phenomenon, it began gaining importance in urban environments during late antiquity.\nThe data below spans the period until circa 500 AD. The vast majority are dated to Roman times.\nEarliest evidence\nBelow the earliest ancient evidence for different types of watermills and the use of water-power for various industrial processes. This list is continued for the early Middle Ages here.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"25%\" | Date\n! width=\"40%\" | Water-powered mill types\n! width=\"25%\" | Reference (or find spot)\n! width=\"10%\" | Modern country\n|-\n|Possibly before c. 350 BC\n|Possible horizontal-wheeled corn mill\n|Persian Empire (hypothesized place of invention)\n|Iran, Iraq, Turkey\n|-\n|Possibly first half of 3rd century BC\n|Horizontal-wheeled mill\n|Byzantium (hypothesized place of invention)\n|Turkey\n|-\n|Possibly c. 240 BC\n|Vertical-wheeled mill\n|Alexandria (hypothesized place of invention)\n|Egypt\n|-\n|Before 71 BC?\n|Grain-mill (\"watermill\")\n|Strabon, XII, 3, 30 C 556\n|Turkey\n|-\n|40/10 BC\n|Undershot wheel mill\n|Vitruvius, X, 5.2\n|Unspecified\n|-\n|40/10 BC\n|Possible kneading machine\n|Vitruvius, X, 5.2\n|Unspecified\n|-\n|20 BC/10 AD\n|Overshot wheel mill\n|Antipater of Thessalonica, IX, 418.4–6\n|Unspecified\n|-\n|c. 20 AD\n|Trip hammer\n|Huan Tan, Xin Lun\n|China\n|-\n|73/4 AD\n|Possible fulling mill\n|Antioch\n|Syria\n|-\n|2nd century AD\n|Multiple mill complex\n|Barbegal mill\n|France\n|-\n|Late 2nd century AD\n|Breastshot wheel mill\n|Les Martres-de-Veyre\n|France\n|-\n|Second half of 3rd century AD\n|Sawmill; crank and connecting rod system with gear train\n|Hierapolis sarcophagus\n|Turkey\n|-\n|Late 3rd or early 4th century AD\n|Turbine mill\n|Chemtou and Testour\n|Tunisia\n|-\n|Late 3rd or early 4th century AD\n|Possible tanning mill\n|Saepinum\n|Italy\n|-\n|?\n|Possible furnace\n|Marseille\n|France\n|-\n|}\nImage:Undershot water wheel schematic.svg|Undershot water wheel\nImage:Breastshot water wheel schematic.svg|Breastshot water wheel\nImage:Overshot water wheel schematic.svg|Overshot water wheel\nWritten sources\nIn the following, literary, epigraphical and documentary sources referring to watermills and other water-driven machines are listed.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! width=\"20%\" | Reference\n! width=\"10%\" | Location\n! width=\"25%\" | Date\n! width=\"15%\" | Type of evidence\n! width=\"30%\" | Comments on\n|-\n|Ammianus Marcellinus, 18.8.11\n|Amida\n|359 AD\n|History\n|Multiple mill complex\n|-\n|Antipater of Thessalonica, IX, 418.4–6\n|Unspecified\n|20 BC/10 AD\n|Poem\n|Earliest reference to overshot wheel mill\n|-\n|Ausonius, Mosella, 362–364\n|Ruwer river\n|c. 370 AD\n|Poem\n|Water-powered marble saws and grain-mills\n|-\n|Beroea\n|Macedonia\n|2nd century AD\n|Decree\n|Tax revenue from watermills\n|-\n|Cedrenus, Historiarum compendium, p.&nbsp;295 [516]\n|India\n|c. 325 AD\n|History\n|\n|-\n|CG-CI, pp.&nbsp;86–90, no. 41\n|Corinth\n|6th century AD\n|\n|\n|-\n|CIL, III, 5866\n|Günzburg\n|1st/3rd century AD\n|Epigraphy\n|Miller’s guild\n|-\n|CIL, III, 14969, 2\n|Promona\n|1st/4th century AD\n|Epigraphy\n|\n|-\n|CIL, VI, 1711\n|\n|c. 480 AD\n|Epigraphy\n|\n|-\n|Codex Justinianus, XI, 43, 10, 3\n|Constantinople\n|474/491 AD\n|Legal code\n|\n|-\n|Codex Theodosianus, XIV, 15.4\n|\n|398 AD\n|Legal code\n|\n|-\n|Diocletian, XV, 54\n|\n|301 AD\n|Price edict\n|\n|-\n|Euchromius, VII, pp.&nbsp;138–9, no. 169\n|Sardis\n|4th to 5th/6th century AD\n|Epigraphy\n|Watermill engineer\n|-\n|Gregory of Nyssa, In Ecclesiasten, III, 656A Migne\n|\n|c. 370/390 AD\n|Theology\n|Water-powered marble saws?\n|-\n|Huan Tan, Xin Lun\n|China\n|c. 20 AD\n|Treatise\n|Trip hammer\n|-\n|John Cassian, Conlationes Patrum, I, 18\n|\n|426 AD?\n|Theology\n|\n|-\n|Letter\n|Egypt\n|5th century AD\n|\n|Possible watermill\n|-\n|Libanius, Or. 4.29\n|Antioch\n|380s AD\n|Rhetoric\n|Tax on watermills\n|-\n|MAMA, VII, p.&nbsp;70, no. 305, lines 29–32\n|Orcistus\n|c. 329 AD\n|Epigraphy\n|Town privilege\n|-\n|Mar.
