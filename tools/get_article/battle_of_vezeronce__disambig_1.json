After a previous incursion by the brothers in 523, Burgundian king Sigismund had been captured and executed, on the orders of Chlodomer, and was succeeded by his brother, Godomar. Chlodomer wanted to seize with his brothers what remained of the Burgundian Kingdom, and resumed his campaign in the spring of 524.\nBattle\nThe two armies clashed near the modern village of Vézeronce, in an area of a vast plain. In Gregory of Tours's account of the battle, the Frankish troops of King Chlodomer quickly took the advantage and repelled the Burgundians led by Godomar. However, believing he was joining a group of Frankish warriors, Chlodomer threw himself into the midst of enemy soldiers and was slain. His head was stuck on a pike and displayed by the Burgundians to their enemies. Godomar won the battle, however, his kingdom was lost to the Merovingians within a decade.\nA helmet was found in the peat marsh of Saint-Didier, to the north of the battle site in 1871, and is conserved in the Musée dauphinois, Grenoble. The helmet is of Byzantine craftsmanship, and was likely that of a Frankish chieftain.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
