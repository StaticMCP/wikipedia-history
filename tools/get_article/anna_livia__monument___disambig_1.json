It was formerly located on O'Connell Street.\nBackground\nDesigned by the sculptor Éamonn O'Doherty, the monument was commissioned by businessman Michael Smurfit, in memory of his father, for the Dublin Millennium celebrations in 1988.\nThe monument is a personification of the River Liffey (Abhainn na Life in Irish) which runs through the city. Anna Livia Plurabelle is the name of a character in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake who also embodies the river. In the monument's original location, the river was represented as a young woman sitting on a slope with water flowing past her. Dubliners nicknamed it the \"Floozie in the Jacuzzi\", a nickname that was encouraged by the sculptor.\nThe monument was removed from its site on O'Connell Street in 2001 to make room for the Spire of Dublin. In late February 2011, partly reworked and refurbished, the statue was relocated to Croppies Memorial Park next to the Liffey, near Heuston station.\nGallery\nFile:Anna Livia Plurabelle.jpg|Anna Livia in its earlier O'Connell Street location\nFile:Anna Livia Plurabelle, Better Known As The Floozy In The Jacuzzi ( Croppies Memorial Park) - panoramio (1).jpg|Closeup of Anna Livia\nReferences"
