Opened for service on  (two days after a ceremonial inauguration), it gradually replaced the Hull tramway network.\nBy the standards of the various now-defunct trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, the Hull system was a medium-sized one, with a total of 7 routes, and a maximum fleet of 100 trolleybuses.  It was closed on .\nHull's distinctively liveried trolleybuses played a role in the Philip Larkin poem, Here, which is set in Hull.  None have survived.\nSee also\n*Transport in Kingston upon Hull\n*List of trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
