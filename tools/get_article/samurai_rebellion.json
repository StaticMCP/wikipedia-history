The film is based on a short story of the same name by Yasuhiko Takiguchi. Its screenplay was written by Shinobu Hashimoto.\nFilm historian Donald Richie suggests an approximate translation for its original Japanese title: Rebellion: Receive the Wife.\nPlot\nIn 1725, during the Edo period of Japan, Isaburo Sasahara (Toshiro Mifune) is a vassal of the daimyo of the Aizu clan, Masakata Matsudaira. Isaburo is one of the most skilled swordsmen in the land, whose main rival is his good friend Tatewaki Asano (Tatsuya Nakadai). One day, one of the daimyo's advisors orders Isaburo's elder son Yogoro (Go Kato) to marry the daimyo's ex-concubine, Ichi (Yoko Tsukasa), even though she is the mother to one of the daimyo's sons. With much trepidation, the family agrees. Ichi and Yogoro fall in love, marry, and give birth to a daughter, Tomi.\nHowever, the daimyo's primary heir dies, and he orders Ichi to rejoin his household to care for their son and heir. The family refuses, but Ichi is coerced to return by Isaburo's younger son, as otherwise her husband and father-in-law will be ordered to commit seppuku for their insolence and insubordination. Isaburo counters that he will comply only if the heads of the daimyo and his two primary advisors are brought to him first. Isaburo sends his younger son and wife away and dismisses his household servants.\nThe daimyo's steward, accompanied by a platoon of 20 samurai, brings Ichi to the Sasahara house and tries to force her at spearpoint to renounce her marriage to Yogoro and join the daimyo's household. The daimyo also offers to commute Isaburo and Yogoro's sentences to life confinement in a shrine outside his castle. Instead of abandoning her husband and rejoining the daimyo, she throws herself onto a spear. Yogoro goes to her side and is killed with her in his arms. Enraged, Isaburo kills the steward's entire party, leaving the steward for last as he attempts to flee.\nBurying the dead couple, Isaburo now decides to take his case to the shogun in Edo accompanied by Tomi. Tatewaki, who is guarding the gate, cannot permit Isaburo to pass, and a climactic duel between the friends follows. Isaburo is the victor, but assassins hidden nearby cut Isaburo down with musket fire. As Isaburo dies, Tomi's wet nurse comforts the baby.\nCast\n, Masaki Kobayashi, Toshiro Mifune, Tomoyuki Tanaka.
