The HVO warned the ARBiH from Vitez to withdraw and remove the barricades, but the ARBiH of course refused. And on October 20, the battle for Vitez and the surrounding villages begins.\nBattle\nOctober 20 in the morning the HVO attacked the Ahmići barricade. The houses were set on fire, the minaret of the mosque was hit. The attack lasted all morning until the ARBiH soldiers manning the barricade ran out of ammunition and the checkpoint was then removed. The HVO took over Vitez police station and expelled the Bosnian Muslim police officers. Next day there were fights in the city with ARBiH slowly losing control of the city. Then on 22 October a general cease-fire for the Vitez municipality was signed. Croats took almost full control of the city. Muslim civilians and ARBiH soldiers left the city.\nReferences"
