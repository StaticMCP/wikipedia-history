Formed by the confluence of Contact and Takayofo creeks along the southwest border of Katmai National Park and Preserve, it flows west-northwest to meet the larger river about  east of the village of Egegik.\nA relatively straight and braided river, it descends from an elevation of about  to sea level. Being quite shallow, it is not navigable beyond its lower reaches. Although game fish on the river include king, chum, and silver salmon, the main species are rainbow trout, Arctic grayling, and char.\nSee also\n*List of Alaska rivers\nReferences"
