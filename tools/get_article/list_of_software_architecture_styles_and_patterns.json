Software architecture patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than software design patterns, solving broader system-level challenges. While these patterns typically affect system-level concerns, the distinction between architectural patterns and architectural styles can sometimes be blurry. Examples include Circuit Breaker.\nSoftware Architecture Style refers to a high-level structural organization that defines the overall system organization, specifying how components are organized, how they interact, and the constraints on those interactions. Architecture styles typically include a vocabulary of component and connector types, as well as semantic models for interpreting the system's properties. These styles represent the most coarse-grained level of system organization. Examples include Layered Architecture, Microservices, and Event-Driven Architecture.\nList of software architecture styles\n* Event-driven architecture\n* Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters)\n* Layered architecture\n* Microkernel architecture\n* Pipes and Filters architecture\n* Microservices\n* (Modular) monolithic\n* Service-oriented architecture\n* \"Service-based architecture\"\n* Space-based architecture\nList of software architecture patterns\n* Inbox and outbox pattern\n* \"Queue-Based Load Leveling\", also known as the \"Storage First Pattern\", is an architectural pattern in which a queue acts as a buffer between an invoker service (such as an API Gateway) and the destination (e.g., compute resources).\n* \"Backends for frontends\" pattern\n* \"Public versus Published Interfaces\"\n* Asynchronous messaging\n* Batch request (also known as Request Bundle pattern)\n* Blackboard (design pattern)\n* Circuit Breaker\n* Client–server model\n* Competing Consumers pattern\n* Model–view–controller\n* Claim-Check pattern\n* Peer-to-peer\n* Publish–subscribe pattern\n* Rate limiting\n* Request–response\n* Retry pattern\n* Rule-based\n* Saga pattern\n* Strangler fig pattern\n* Throttling\nSee also\n* :Category: Software design patterns\n* Software design pattern\n* Software architecture\nReferences"
