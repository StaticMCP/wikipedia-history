Former Kansas senator Bob Dole won the 1996 Republican nomination for President of the United States, and chose former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp as his running mate. Dole chose Kemp as his running mate in order to solidify support among the conservative wing of the Republican Party, despite the mutual personal distaste the two candidates had for each other. The Dole–Kemp ticket ultimately lost to the Clinton–Gore ticket in the general election.\nShortlist\nFile:Campbell, Carroll (cropped2).jpg|\nFile:John Engler 2008 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Jack Kemp official portrait.jpg|\nFile:Connie Mack III (3x4 crop).jpg|\nFile:John McCain.jpg|\nOther potential candidates\nMembers of Congress\nFile:Kay Bailey Hutchison, official photo.jpg|\nFile:Kasich 00.gif|\nFile:Dick Lugar official photo.jpg|\nFile:Senator John Ashcroft3 (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Pete Domenici (cropped).jpg|\nFile:C.C.
