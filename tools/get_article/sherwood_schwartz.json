He worked on radio shows in the 1940s, but he now is best known for creating the 1960s television series ''Gilligan's Island on CBS and  The Brady Bunch on ABC. On March 7, 2008, Schwartz, at the time still active in his 90s, was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That same year, Schwartz was also inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.\nEarly life\nSchwartz was born in Passaic, New Jersey, to a Jewish family. His parents were Herman and Rose Schwartz. He was a younger brother of writer Al Schwartz (1910–1988). His younger brother, Elroy Schwartz (1923–2013), a comedy writer, became a principal screenwriter for Gilligan's Island and other series. Sherwood Schwartz is the uncle of Douglas Schwartz (who created the Baywatch'' TV series), Bruce Schwartz and Judithe Randall.\nCareer\nSchwartz had hoped to become a doctor, but found that he was unable to be admitted to medical school at that time, due to a quota limiting the number of Jewish students.\nHe went on to write for Ozzie Nelson's The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and other radio shows. Schwartz served in the United States Army for over four years. While serving, he was a writer on the Armed Forces Radio Network before he got his break in television. From 1956 to 1962, Schwartz was head writer for The Red Skelton Show, for which he won an Emmy Award in 1961. He went on to create and produce ''Gilligan's Island and The Brady Bunch. He wrote the theme song for three of his shows: Gilligan's Island (co-wrote), It's About Time, and The Brady Bunch.\nSyndication turned his two major successes into TV institutions with cultural relevance. He made them icons and as a result became a television icon himself.\nTV appearances\nDuring the late 1990s and the 2000s, he made many appearances on TV talking about his series, on shows such as the CBS Evening News, 20/20, TV Land's Top Ten'' and A&E's Biography. He also took part in a \"Creators\" marathon on Nick at Nite in the late 1990s. He was also a guest at the 2004 TV Land Awards.\nIn 1988, Schwartz appeared on The Late Show with Ross Shafer for a ''Gilligan's Island reunion, along with all seven castaways from Gilligan's Island. This was the last time they were all together on television.  He also appeared as himself in a 1995 episode of Roseanne'' titled \"Sherwood Schwartz, A Loving Tribute\", which also featured the four surviving \"Gilligan's Island\" cast members.\nPersonal life\nOn December 21, 1941, Sherwood Schwartz married Mildred Seidman, and together they had four children: Donald Schwartz, who became an ophthalmologist; Lloyd J. Schwartz, who worked with his father in show business as a writer and producer in his own right; Ross Schwartz, an attorney and screenwriter whose credits include Bottle Shock; and Hope Juber, a writer and producer. His granddaughter is singer-songwriter Ilsey Juber, the daughter of Hope and guitarist Laurence Juber, the former lead guitarist for the band Wings.\nSherwood Schwartz's play, Rockers, a comedy-drama, had a production at Theatre West in honor of his 90th birthday.\nDeath\nOn July 12, 2011, Sherwood Schwartz died of natural causes in his sleep.\nPortrayals\nSchwartz was portrayed by Aaron Lustig in the TV movie ''Surviving Gilligan's Island and by Michael Tucker in Growing Up Brady.\nFilmography\nSchwartz produced a number of radio and TV shows during his career.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
