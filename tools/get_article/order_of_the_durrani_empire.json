At the time there were not enough decorations prepared but on the day those who were not on duty were presented before the king. The result was that there are numerous variations in the stars and medals as many were subsequently made in India and Europe, particularly in the number of pearls on the order.\nThere were three classes to the order as to emulate the three classes of the Order of the Bath. The first and second classes had both a star and a medal while the third consisted of a medal only. The medal of all three classes had the red/green ribbon of the Ghuznee Medal.\n1st Class\nMedal: A gold Maltese cross with eight points terminating in a gold bead on two crossed swords. In the centre is a green flower on a blue enamel ground with the words \"durr-i-durran\" in Persian script, meaning \"pearl of the age\", the name attributed to the Durrani dynasty.  The enamel centre is encircled by pearls.\nStar: A silver star with a smaller Maltese cross in gold overlaid in the same style as the medal with the addition of a diamond on each arm of the gold cross. There are 17 pearls circling the enamel work.\n2nd Class\nMedal: As the 1st class but with 20 pearls encircling the centre.\nStar:  A silver star shaped like a Maltese cross with the gold medal overlaid as above but with 18 pearls.\n3rd Class\nMedal: As the 1st class but with 14 pearls encircling the centre.\nRecipients\nThis is not an exhaustive list\n1st Class\n#Lieut.
