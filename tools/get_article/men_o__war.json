Eager to socialize, the sailors extend an invitation for refreshments, only to realize their financial constraints - sufficient funds for only three beverages. A protracted exchange ensues as Ollie endeavors to convey this dilemma to Stan, who struggles to comprehend the necessity for sacrifice.\nUpon finally procuring three sodas, their plans are thwarted when the price exceeds their initial estimation. Ollie retaliates against Stan's earlier indiscretion by leaving him to settle the bill. However, Stan's luck takes a fortuitous turn when he wins a jackpot on a slot machine using a solitary coin.\nFlush with unexpected wealth, the sailors rent a rowboat for a tranquil excursion with the ladies. Their idyllic outing soon descends into chaos as they become embroiled in a tumultuous altercation with other boaters on the lake, resulting in capsized vessels and a mass exodus of drenched individuals seeking refuge in Stan and Ollie's overcrowded boat, ultimately leading to its submersion.\nCast\nProduction notes\n''Men O' War'' was written and filmed in May 1929. Most of the film was shot at Hollenbeck Park in Los Angeles, while the soda fountain scene was shot at the Hal Roach studio. The song \"Runnin' Wild\" was featured over the opening credits for this film as well as They Go Boom.\nThe difficulties of filming on location during the early sound era were present during the making of ''Men O' War''. Offscreen laughing from passersby present in Hollenbeck Park during filming can be heard, and the sound quality itself suffers from echoing and background noise.\nThis was James Finlayson's first sound film, and the one in which his trademark exclamation of \"D'oh!\" appeared (acknowledged by Dan Castellaneta as the progenitor for Homer Simpson's similar expression of disbelief or outrage).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
