With Oldham, he finished second in the Second Division in 1909–10 and then second in the First Division in 1914–15.\nCareer\nMatthews played for local sides Oldbury St. John's and Langley St. Michael's before joining Burslem Port Vale as an amateur in May 1906. Preferred to Arthur Box, he played 26 Second Division and four FA Cup games in the 1906–07 season. He was released from the Athletic Ground at the end of the 1906–07 season when the club suffered a financial crisis. He moved on to Burton United, who themselves resigned from the Football League at the end of the 1906–07 season. He signed with Oldham Athletic. The \"Latics\" finished third in the Second Division in 1907–08, and then finished sixth in 1908–09 before securing promotion with a second-place finish in 1909–10. Oldham then posted a seventh-place finish in the First Division in 1910–11, before finishing 18th in 1911–12, ninth in 1912–13, fourth in 1913–14, and second in 1914–15 – one point behind champions Everton. He returned to Boundary Park after the conclusion of World War I, as the club finished 17th in 1919–20, 19th in 1920–21 and 1921–22, before being relegated in last place in 1922–23. Athletic finished seventh in the Second Division in 1923–24, 18th in 1924–25, and then seventh again in 1925–26. He returned to Port Vale a remarkable 19 years after his release, in October 1926, and played 21 league games in the 1926–27 campaign ahead of rivals Tom Fern, George Holdcroft, and Alex Binnie. However, he was seriously injured from a kick to the back by South Shields winger Alex Trotter in a 3–3 draw on 5 February. He then lost his first-team place to Alf Bennett and made 16 league and cup appearances in the 1927–28 season. He was given a free transfer away from the Old Recreation Ground in May 1928 and despite being in his 40s managed to go on play for Halifax Town. The \"Shaymen\" finished 13th in Third Division North, before dropping into the re-election zone in 1929–30. He later played for Chester and Oswestry Town.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Burslem Port Vale\n|1906–07\n|Second Division\n|26||0||4||0||30||4\n|-\n|rowspan=\"15\"|Oldham Athletic\n|1908–09\n|Second Division\n|36||0||2||0||38||0\n|-\n|1909–10\n|Second Division\n|37||0||1||0||38||0\n|-\n|1910–11\n|First Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|1911–12\n|First Division\n|35||0||4||0||39||0\n|-\n|1912–13\n|First Division\n|37||0||6||0||43||0\n|-\n|1913–14\n|First Division\n|31||0||0||0||31||0\n|-\n|1914–15\n|First Division\n|36||0||5||0||41||0\n|-\n|1919–20\n|First Division\n|18||0||1||0||19||0\n|-\n|1920–21\n|First Division\n|26||0||0||0||26||0\n|-\n|1921–22\n|First Division\n|6||0||0||0||6||0\n|-\n|1922–23\n|First Division\n|33||0||1||0||34||0\n|-\n|1923–24\n|Second Division\n|40||0||2||0||42||0\n|-\n|1924–25\n|Second Division\n|7||0||0||0||7||0\n|-\n|1925–26\n|Second Division\n|2||0||1||0||3||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!344!!0!!23!!0!!367!!0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Port Vale\n|1926–27\n|Second Division\n|21||0||4||0||25||0\n|-\n|1927–28\n|Second Division\n|14||0||2||0||16||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!35!!0!!6!!0!!41!!0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Halifax Town\n|1928–29\n|Third Division North\n|33||0||1||0||34||0\n|-\n|1929–30\n|Third Division North\n|7||0||0||0||7||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!40!!0!!1!!0!!41!!0\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!445!!0!!34!!0!!479!!0\n|}\nHonours\nOldham Athletic\n*Football League Second Division second-place promotion: 1909–10\nReferences"
