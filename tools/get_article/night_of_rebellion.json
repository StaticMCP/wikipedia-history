The track features loads of dinosaur and bird noises in the background. In New Zealand, the single \"Underneath the Colors\" was released with the same B-side containing \"Night of Rebellion\".\nReception\nJohn Teerds of The Age stated that \"Night of Rebellion\" is a \"pacey song with a good chorus and leads into a side with the emphasis on rockier numbers\" while Jon O'Brien of Classic Pop called it a \"rockabilly toe-tapper.\"\nTrack listing\n7\" single track listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
