The Warjih more commonly state they originate from Harar and set themselves apart from another Muslim trader group called Tegri or Warjih Tegri in the region whom they detest. Warjih are credited for transmitting Semitic influences into Shewa from their departure point in the Harari plateau. The Warjih were among the first people in the Horn of Africa to become Muslim, having accepted Islam by the eighth century. Alongside another ancient Muslim group to their west, the Gebel, who would eventually procreate the Argobba people. Warjih were under the Sultanate of Shewa in the ninth century. The Warjih in the following centuries participated in many battles against Christian Abyssinia. They sided with the Ifat in the Middle Ages, and Adal Sultanate during the Ethiopian-Adal War. It was this time of military conflict that opened the door for the northern expansion of Oromos, and thus began the assimilation of conquered populations, such as the Warjih. Many Warjih people still keep their ethnic identity even after the expansions in their hometown of Daleti in Shewa\nDemographics\nThe Warjih historically populated an area in south-eastern Ethiopia within what is now Oromia Region. Today, they are found primarily in their modern hometown of Daleti and in numerous pastoral communities scattered throughout the regions of Shewa and Wollo. Some have settled in major cities within these former provinces, most prominently in Addis Ababa and Kemise. Due to their longstanding livelihoods as merchants, members of the Warjih community can be found transiently in cities all across Ethiopia\nAccording to the 2007 Ethiopian census carried out by the Central Statistical Agency, the Warjih population numbered 13,232 individuals.\nLanguage\nThe Warjih today primarily speak Amharic or  Oromo as their mother tongue, although this order of primacy may be vice versa depending on where a person lives.\nPolitics\nPrior to the 2010 Ethiopian general election, the current Ethiopian regime approved the creation of the Tigri Worgi Nationality Democratic Organization, which represents a minority of the tribe.\nNotable Warjih\n* Ali Abdo, former mayor of Addis Ababa\nSee also\n* Wargar, clan once inhabiting Adal\nNotes\nReferences\n* Grover Hudson, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/northeast_african_studies/v006/6.3hudson.html \"Linguistic Analysis of the 1994 Ethiopian Census\"], Northeast African Studies, Volume 6, Number 3, 1999 (New Series), pp.&nbsp;89 – 107.\n* Pankhurst, Richard K.P.
