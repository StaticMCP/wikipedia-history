The site was enlarged after the Armistice with the concentration of battlefield graves.\nThe cemetery contains special memorials to soldiers buried in the Valley Cottages Cemetery in Zillebeke, which was destroyed in fighting and the graves and bodies lost. These headstones carry (unless replaced by a personalised family message) the inscription at the foot of the stone \"Their Glory Shall Not Be Blotted Out\" – a line devised by Rudyard Kipling.\nThere is also a special memorial to a single officer from Transport Farm Annexe cemetery, which was concentrated into Perth (China Wall) Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, whose grave was not found.\nThe cemetery was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens who was also responsible for the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London and the Thiepval Memorial on the Somme, France.\nNotable graves\nThe cemetery contains the graves of some 2,463 soldiers. Amongst these is the grave of Second Lieutenant Frederick Youens who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery, having picked up an enemy grenade with the intention of throwing it away from his position when it detonated in his hand. He died from his wounds later that day, 7 July 1917.\nGallery\nImage:Railway Dugouts Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery 3 Redvers.jpg|Railway Dugouts Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery\nImage:Canadian_Corps_-_Canadian_war_graves.jpg|Wartime appearance of Canadian graves in what would become Railway Dugouts Burial Ground Transport Farm, 1916.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.ww1cemeteries.com/ww1cemeteries/railwaydugoutsburialgroundtransportfarm.htm ww1cemeteries.com]"
