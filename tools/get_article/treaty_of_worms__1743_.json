She also engaged to maintain 30,000 men in Italy, to be commanded by Savoy-Sardinia.\nGreat Britain agreed to pay the sum of £300,000 for the ceding of Finale, and to furnish an annual subsidy of £200,000, on the condition that Savoy-Sardinia should employ 45,000 men. In addition to this fiscal arrangement, Britain agreed to send a fleet into the Mediterranean.\nUnder a separate, secret convention, agreed contemporaneously with the Treaty, but which was neither formally ratified nor publicly acknowledged, it was stipulated that Britain would pay Maria Theresa an annual subsidy of £300,000, for as long \"as the necessity of her affairs should require.\"\nThe terms of the Treaty of Worms relative to the ceding of the marquisate of Finale to Savoy-Sardinia were particularly unjust to the Genoese, since the territory had been guaranteed to them by the fourth article of the Quadruple Alliance of 2 August 1718 between Britain, France, Austria, and the Netherlands.\nCriticism\nThe Treaty of Worms was presented to the Commons on 9 January 1744, and was considered in the entire house on 1 February 1744.\nWilliam Pitt\nWilliam Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, speaking in the House of Commons on 1 December 1743 roundly condemned the Treaty in the following statement which occurred during the course of an address of thanks he was giving after the Battle of Dettingen:\nThomas Carlyle\nThomas Carlyle had this to say on the terms of the treaty:\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences"
