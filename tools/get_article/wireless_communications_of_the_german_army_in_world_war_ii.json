      "text": "# Wireless Communications of the German Army in World War II\n\nDuring World War II, the German Army relied on a diverse array of communications to maintain contact with its mobile forces and in particular with its armoured forces. Most of this equipment received the generic prefix FuG for Funkgerät, meaning \"radio device\". Occasionally the shorted Fu designation were used and there were exceptions to both these systems. Number ranges were not unique across the services so sometimes different equipment used by different services had the same FuG prefix. This article is a list and a description of the radio equipment.\nArmoured force communications\nFug 1: Also known as Torn.E.b And Pack Receiver b. A Medium-wave receiver it operated in the 0,1 to 7,095&nbsp;kHz frequency range. Repackaged for use in several other receivers and transceivers.\nFuG 2: A high-band HF/low-band VHF receiver. Also known a USW receiver c1. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,300&nbsp;kHz (27 MHz - 33.3&nbsp;MHz) range (same frequency range used by modern 27MHz CB radio systems) The FuG 2 was never used on its own but as an additional receiver in command tanks and relay devices. It was usually installed in section leader and company commanders' vehicles, to allow them to listen on one frequency while transmitting and receiving on another. As it operated on the same band as the FuG 5 it allowed them, for example, to listen to the regimental command net while talking to the subordinate units at the same time. Matching the transmitters that operated in this frequency range, this receiver provided for 50&nbsp;kHz channel steps in the 27.000&nbsp;MHz to 33.300&nbsp;MHz range for a total of 125 available channels.\nFuG 3: A low-band VHF receiver. It operated in the 42–47.8&nbsp;MHz range. Repackaged as FuG 3 neu for use with motorcycle troops.\nFuG 4: A medium-wave receiver used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000&nbsp;kHz frequency range. It was used with the same antenna as the Fug 8. It was usually used for communication with a Fug 8 in the same installation. (Fug 8 + Fug 4)\nFuG 5: A high-band HF/low-band VHF transceiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,300&nbsp;kHz (27-33.3&nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 10 Watts. This equipment provided for 125 radio channels at 50&nbsp;kHz channel spacing. It was usually used with a two-metre antenna. Was present in almost all German tanks and some other vehicles. Was the standard kit for tank-to-tank communication within platoons and companies. Range was approx 2–3&nbsp;km when using AM voice and 3–4&nbsp;km when using CW Reworked to produce the FuG 5 (Luft) variant which was used for air-to-ground communication until replaced with the FuG 7.\nFuG 6: A high-band HF/low-band VHF transceiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,300&nbsp;kHz (27-33.3&nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 20 Watts. It was usually used with a two-metre antenna. It was used by armoured observation posts. These were usually early-model tanks with some of their armament removed and replaced by equipment for artillery observers. It was used by the observers to communicate with the armoured unit leaders via their Fug 5 radios. Main advantage over the FuG 5 was greater range. Range was approx 4–6&nbsp;km when using AM voice and 6–8&nbsp;km when using CW. Comparable to the American SCR-508 tank radio, which covered a similar frequency range (20-27.9&nbsp;MHz) at 25 watts and the SCR-608 artillery variant (which operated in the 27-38.9&nbsp;MHz frequency band) The major difference between German Army tank sets and US Army tank and artillery sets was the American use of FM for the high-HF/low-VHF bands.\nFuG 7: A VHF transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 42,000 to 48,300&nbsp;kHz (42-48.3&nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 20 Watts. It was usually used with a 1.4 metre antenna. It was matched with  the Luftwaffe transceiver Fug 17 in ground support operations. It was used for CAS operations, though these became rare after late 1944 with the result that many command tanks with this equipment fitted were converted to other roles. Ground-to-air range 60&nbsp;km AM voice to 80&nbsp;km CW.\nFuG 8: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000&nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 30 Watts. It was used with various antenna ranging from  1.8 to 9-metre antenna. It was used for communication back to the regimental command post. Range 25&nbsp;km AM voice to 140&nbsp;km CW using the nine-metre antenna, the station had to be stopped to use this antenna.\nFuG 9: A transceiver, operated in the 0.1 - 7.1&nbsp;MHz (100&nbsp;kHz - 7100&nbsp;kHz) range.\nFuG 10: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000&nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 30 Watts. It was used with a frame antenna on various reconnaissance units. Range 10&nbsp;km AM voice to 40&nbsp;km CW.\nFuG 11: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000&nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 100 Watts. Used at the regimental command post. Range 70&nbsp;km AM voice to 200&nbsp;km CW.\nFuG 12: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000&nbsp;kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 80 Watts. It was used with a two-metre antenna. Reconnaissance units later in the war.\nFuG 13: A Fug 6 with two receivers rather than one.\nFuG 14: Multi-radio setup consisting of several separate radios.\nFuG 15: A HF receiver. It operated in the 23,000 to 24,950&nbsp;kHz (23-24.95&nbsp;MHz) frequency range. It was matched with transceiver Fug 16 for use with Sturmartillerie (self-propelled artillery).\nFuG 16: A HF transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in the command vehicles of Sturmartillerie units. It operated in the 23,000 to 24,950&nbsp;kHz (23-24.95&nbsp;MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 10 Watts. It was usually used with a two-metre antenna. Range 2&nbsp;km AM voice to 4&nbsp;km CW.\nFuG 17: Designation for a Torn Fu H transceiver.\nFug 18: Group of high HF band - low VHF / mid band VHF radios covering 25 MHz - 77.1 MHz\nFug 19: A HF transceiver operating in the range 3 - 7.5 MHz.

It operated in the 32-38&nbsp;MHz frequency range. Single-unit \"walkie-talkie\" system. Used by artillery forward observers.\nUHF Communication Link Equipment\nFrom 1936 the German forces started deploying a range of communication links using UHF frequencies to form a point-to-point mesh communication network.\nDuring the war this was extended to cover the majority of the occupied areas or Europe and North Africa. Both the army and the air force made use of the same equipment. The units of the T series were \"backpack\"-style mobile equipment. The K series were truck mobile units using a range of masts up to approximately 11 m tall. The G series were still mobile but were intended to form more of a backbone for communications and were intended to remain in place for longer periods than the K. They again used a series of masts up to 50 m high. Depending on the set a range of communication facilities were available consisting of voice and/or teletype and Hellscriber. Range was line-or-sight so the ranges reported here were assuming the antenna could \"see\" one another.\nDMG 2 T: Pack unit, operating on the 475 - 525&nbsp;MHz band, single channel voice or 800 character-per-second teletype. Range up to 50&nbsp;km. Tripod mast or 11 m mast. Transmission power 0.15 watt. Power battery.\nDMG 3 K: Truck-mounted. Operating on the 475 - 525&nbsp;MHz band, two channels.
