Notable amongst those sent to India were the colossal bronze statue by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm (1879) for Bombay's Esplanade which became known as the Kala Ghoda (Black Horse).  The figure originally stood on a 16&nbsp;ft. plinth with relief panels celebrating the Prince's first visit to Bombay.  The total cost of the work was £12,500.  On August 15, 1965, the statue was moved to the Zoological Gardens in Mumbai without its plinth and reliefs. Others such as Francis Derwent Wood's bronze statue was commissioned for Patiala.  The confident standing figure wears the costume of the Field Marshall consisting of an open overcoat, thigh-high riding boots, embroidered jacket with medals along with a Field-Marshal's hat and a short staff.\nOne of the most magnificent statues to Edward VII was completed by Sir Thomas Brock RA for Delhi.  Despite Brock going to work immediately, the statue was not shipped to Delhi until 1919 when it was erected in King Edward Park (Netaji Subhash Park).  The figure stands 14&nbsp;ft. tall and weights 5 tonnes, the king riding his favorite, Kildare.  Once again the king is portrayed in his Field Marshall's uniform, braids and honours across his chest.  The statue was taken down in 1967 and in 1968 Canadian authorities negotiated for it to be moved to Queen's Park in Toronto for a payment of £10,000 where it currently stands. Other extant statues of Edward VII in India is the Cubbon Park Statue by Leonard Jennings and a bronze equestrian statue at Victoria Memorial by Bertram Mackennal.\nThe King Edward VII Memorial by Albert Toft is located in Centenary Square, Birmingham.
