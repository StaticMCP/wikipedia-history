He served as Chief Justice of Bengal from 1833–43.\nEarly life\nRyan was the second son of William Ryan. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1814 and while at Cambridge, he became friends with John Herschel, Charles Babbage, and George Peacock. Ryan took his MA in 1817 and was called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in the same year. It was Herschel's sharing of his scientific interests and enthusiasms that encouraged Ryan to join the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820.\nHe practised on the Oxford Circuit and published a volume of law reports jointly with William Oldnall Russell titled  Crown cases reserved for consideration; and decided by the Twelve judges of England, from the year 1799 to the year 1824 before being appointed a puisne judge in the Calcutta supreme court in Bengal, then an English colony (see: Company Rule in India, 1757–1857: Justice system), an appointment which carried the customary knighthood.\nHowever, he would complete another book, this time with William Moody, titled ''Reports of cases determined at Nisi Prius, in the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas: and on the Oxford and Western circuits from the sittings after Michaelmas term, 4 Geo. IV. 1823 to the sittings after Trinity term, 7 Geo. IV. 1826, inclusive'' before he left for India.\nIndia\nRyan arrived in India in 1827 and soon established something of a salon. Victor Jacquemont was a visitor in 1829. Ryan was a keen patron of science, presiding over agricultural and horticultural societies, and a supporter of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.\nSecretary to the Board of Control Thomas Babington Macaulay had drafted a criminal code for India and Ryan's support won him Macaulay's affection. Governor-General Lord William Bentinck was also well-disposed and when William Oldnall Russell, his old law-report collaborator, died in 1833, Ryan was appointed Chief Justice of Bengal in his stead.\nHe took sides with Macaulay and Charles Trevelyan in their campaign that education in India should be improved by the widespread teaching of English to give the population access to the educational and instructional materials of the English-speaking world. From 1835, the three served together on the general committee of public education until Macaulay and Trevelyan left for England in 1838 when Ryan took over as president of the committee.\nEngland\nRyan resigned as Chief Justice and returned to England in January 1843 with the intention of acting as assessor to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on appeals from the Indian courts. Consequently, he was sworn a Privy Councillor.\nIn 1850, Ryan was appointed a permanent member of the Judicial Committee, serving until 1865.\nIn 1845, Ryan was appointed to the Royal Commission on the Criminal Law 1845, a royal commission to complete the unfinished report of the Royal Commission on the Criminal Law 1833, to consider amendments and consolidations of the criminal law and to prepare a bill for that purpose.\nIn 1846, Ryan was appointed Railway Commissioner.\nIn 1850, Trevelyan campaigned along with Charles Hay Cameron for the opening of the Indian Civil Service to the native population and championed the appointment of Soorjo Coomar Goodeve Chuckerbutty to the Bengal medical service.\nIn 1851, Ryan was appointed Assistant Controller of the Exchequer, serving until 1862.\nCivil Service Commission\nThe Northcote–Trevelyan Report in 1854 had characterised the British Civil Service as riddled with cronyism and hampered by the inefficiencies of patronage. The report had recommended access to the higher ranks of the service by open competition and public examination. Ryan became the inaugural First Civil Service Commissioner in 1855 with the task of implementing the reforms, and immediately faced the establishment backlash. However, Ryan was both intelligent and tactful and managed to supervise the trialling, evaluation and gradual introduction of universal tests by 1870. The commission also supervised exams for admission to the Indian Civil Service and the British Army.\nFamily\nOn 13 December 1814, Ryan married Louisa Whitmore (1789–1866) the daughter of William Whitmore and Frances Barbara Lyster. His friend, Charles Babbage, married her sister, Georgiana (1792–1827), in the same year, making the men brothers-in-law.
