It was founded with the aim of providing support and conditions for the continuous development of scientific research and development activities in the Republic of Serbia, necessary for the progress of a knowledge-based society.\nActivities are implemented through scientific, technological and development programs to achieve the strategic goals of the scientific and technological development of the Republic of Serbia.\nAs part of the Fund's program, projects are financed through public calls. The projects ensure a high scientific level and innovative results, competitiveness at the international level and relevance in relation to the challenges of society.\nThe Law on the Fund for Science of the Republic of Serbia was adopted in December 2018, and the Fund began its work in March 2019.\nAbout Science Fund\nEstablishment of the Science Fund\nThe Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia was established by the Government of the Republic of Serbia with the aim of establishing a mechanism for project financing of science and scientific research. This decision is in line with the commitment of the Republic of Serbia to advance the development of science and improve the quality of scientific research in accordance with the highest international standards.\nThe Science Fund began operating on March 12, 2019, with the aim of providing financial resources and creating conditions for the implementation of scientific research projects in all scientific fields, through competitive and transparent procedures.\nThe work of the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia is monitored by the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Technological Development, and it is based on the Law on Science and Research, the Law on the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, the Statute of the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, as well as acts of the Science Fund that are more closely defining procedures within which the Science Fund carries out its activities. The Science Fund supports projects with sustainable goals, clear concepts and systematic and well-designed work methodologies. High scientific excellence, quality and innovative ideas represent the basic values of all projects supported by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia.\nEvaluation procedure\nWithin the Programs of the Science Fund, projects are funded through public bidding. The projects aim to provide high-level research impact, innovative results, competitiveness at the international level, and relevance to society in general.\nThe entire procedure of project evaluation and selection is based on three criteria - excellence, impact and implementation. The goal of the procedures is to ensure the selection of the best and highest quality project proposals, the implementation of which will bring results of importance and impact on the entire society.\nProject Evaluation is carried out in two levels. The received project proposals are checked and evaluated through a procedure consisting of administrative verification and two levels of evaluation. The proposal that has passed the administrative check is sent to the first stage of the evaluation procedure.\nFirst stage of evaluation - Each Proposal is evaluated by peer reviewers, foreign internationally acclaimed experts, which are assessed by the three criteria: excellence, impact, and implementation of the Project Proposal. The proposals are ranked after the first stage of evaluation. Proposals that have passed the first stage of evaluation and whose individual budgets in total do not exceed the double budget provided by the Program funding are being proceeded to the second stage of evaluation.\nSecond stage of evaluation - The members of the Program Board are foreign experts with an internationally recognized professional career. The Program Board performs evaluation of all proposals that qualify for the second stage of evaluation. Based on the final evaluation, the Program Board forms the ranking list of Project Proposals that have passed both levels of evaluation and will be funded within the available funds of the Program. The final ranking list needs to be accepted by the Scientific Council and adopted by the Managing Board of the Science Fund.\nTransparency of the Expert Selection - The Call for Expression of Interest for Peer Reviewers is permanently open. The Call for the Program Board members is specially designed and published for every program. All calls comprise inclusion, exclusion, and assessment criteria, as well as detailed Terms of Reference which are published on the website, social networks, and advertised on professional networks and platforms for researchers.\nPublishing the Results - The Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia publishes all results on its website, showing the final ranking list with all project proposals which are approved for funding, project partners, final scores, and approved budgets.\nBodies of the Science Fund\nThe bodies of the Science Fund are: Director, Supervisory Board, Management Board, and Scientific Council of the Fund.\nThe Director is appointed and dismissed by the Government on the proposal of the Board of Directors, with the prior approval of the Minister.
