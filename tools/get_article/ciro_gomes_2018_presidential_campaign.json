At the Democratic Labour Party (PDT) convention on 20 July, Gomes was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate. His running mate, Kátia Abreu, former Minister of Agriculture in Dilma Rousseff's government, was confirmed as his running mate on 5 August, on the last day of political parties conventions. Ciro Gomes' party formed the coalition Sovereign Brazil with AVANTE.\nCiro had previously been a candidate for the presidency in 1998 and 2002 as the candidate of the Popular Socialist Party (PPS), losing both times. Seen as a prospective frontrunner in 2010, Ciro ended up forgoing a bid.\nGomes finished third in the first round, receiving around 12.47% of the vote. He signaled his opposition to then-frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro for the run-off, although he did not formally endorse Bolsonaro's opponent Fernando Haddad.\nPresidential ticket\nFor the position of Vice President, Ciro chose former Minister of Agriculture and Senator from Tocantins Kátia Abreu as his running mate. Abreu was previously a member of the centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement party, but was expelled due to her opposition to the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, thus leading to her joining the PDT. Despite her opposition to Dilma's impeachment, many on the left criticized the choice of Abreu for Vice President due to her history as an ally of agribusiness interests.\nCampaign platform\nIn the realm of economic policy, Ciro ran in support of a financial transaction tax on large-scale financial transactions and increased state funding for education and healthcare services. On social policy, Ciro ran in support of creating a national secretariat specifically to protect LGBT rights in Brazil.\nElection result\nPresidential elections\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Election year\n! rowspan=2|Candidate\n! rowspan=2|Running mate\n! colspan=2|First round\n! rowspan=2|Second round\n|-\n! # of overall votes\n! % of overall vote\n|-\n! 2018\n| Ciro Gomes\n| Kátia Abreu\n| 13.344.353\n| 12.47%\n| Did not qualify\n|}\nPost-election analysis\nFollowing Haddad's loss to Bolsonaro, some on the political left indicated that they wished that Ciro faced Bolsonaro in the second round instead of Haddad. This is because Haddad's loss was largely attributed to anti-PT sentiment following Operation Car Wash, which would not have affected Ciro. Governor Rui Costa of Bahia, a PT member, stated that the PT should have supported Ciro instead of Haddad for this reason.\nAlexandre Frota, a conservative politician formerly affiliated with Bolsonaro's PSL, apologized in 2019 for past verbal assaults on Ciro, stating that in retrospect Ciro was correct about his criticisms of Bolsonaro. Ciro would later accept his apology.\nParty representation\n* Democratic Labour Party\n* Avante\nEndorsements\n* Singer-songwriter Caetano Veloso\n* Actress and ex-wife Patricia Pillar\n* Singer Alcione Nazareth\n* Actor Chay Suede\n* Musician Tico Santa Cruz\n* Musician Wesley Safadão\n* Actor Marcos Veras\n* Actress Mika Lins\n*Governor of Ceará Camilo Santana, a member of the Workers' Party (PT)\n* YouTuber PC Siqueira\n*Actor Caco Ciocler\n*Blogger, television presenter, and actress Titi Müller\n*Actor Nicolas Prattes\n*Actor Vladimir Brichta\n*Actress Mariana Xavier\n*Olympic swimmer Joanna Maranhão\n*Actor, comedian and poet Gregório Duvivier\nSee also\n* 2018 Brazilian general election\n* 2002 Brazilian general election\n* 1994 Brazilian general election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cirogomes.com.br Official campaign website]"
