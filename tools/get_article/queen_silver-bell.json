      "text": "# Queen Silver-Bell\n\nQueen Silver-Bell is the first in a series of four children's books by Frances Hodgson Burnett with illustrations by Harrison Cady.\nIn the first book the queen of the fairies, Queen Silver-Bell, loses her \"temper\" (which most people do not know is really a fairy) and becomes known from then on as Queen Crosspatch. She knows that she will never find her temper again until she has done something that would make people–-particularly children–-believe in fairies as they used to \"once upon a time\", so she decides to get a \"respectable\" person to write the stories down as she tells them. The subsequent stories in the series all have the subtitle \"As Told By Queen Crosspatch.\"\nThe first book, Queen Silver-Bell, also contains the story \"How Winnie Hatched The Little Rooks.\"\nBooks in the series\n*Queen Silver-Bell (November, 1906)\n*Racketty-Packetty House (1906)\n*The Cozy Lion (October, 1907)\n*The Spring Cleaning (October, 1908)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
