As the 2007–08 season progressed, rankings were updated weekly. There were a total of 34 voters in the USA Today poll and 50 voters in the USCHO.com poll. Each first place vote in the USA Today poll is worth 15 points in the rankings while a first place vote in the USCHO.com poll is worth 20 points with every subsequent vote worth 1 fewer point in either poll.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px;\" |\n|
