He was killed in action on 25 April 1915 while landing on W Beach in Cape Helles, Gallipoli, Turkey.\nStubbs was one of the six members of the regiment elected for the award by the survivors.  These were hailed in the press as 'six VC's before breakfast', and the commander of the Allied troops at Gallipoli, General Ian Hamilton ordered that the beach be renamed 'Lancashire Landing'.\nThe other five of the '6 VCs before breakfast' were awarded to Cuthbert Bromley, John Elisha Grimshaw, William Kenealy, Alfred Joseph Richards and Richard Raymond Willis.\nCitation\n}}\nHe is commemorated on the Helles Memorial. His Victoria Cross was purchased at auction on 18 April 2024 by an unnamed buyer and is displayed at the Fusilier Museum in Bury, Lancashire.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
