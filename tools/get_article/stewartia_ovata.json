It is a member of the Theaceae, the tea family.\nAlthough not endangered, the plant does have a limited range and is uncommon throughout its range. Mountain camellia grows in the understory of predominantly hardwood forests and tends to be found near streams, usually at elevations below .\nDescription\nStewartia ovata is a deciduous flowering shrub or small tree growing to 5 meters (16 2/3 feet) tall, with smooth, flaking grayish-orange bark. The leaves are oval with an acute apex,  long and  broad, and turn orange, red, or gold when the tree becomes dormant in the fall. The flowers are camellia-like,  in diameter, with five white petals and numerous white, yellow or purple stamens; they appear in early to mid-summer.\n;Varieties\nThere are two varieties:\n*Stewartia ovata var. ovata — flowers 6–8&nbsp;cm diameter, stamens white to yellow.\n*Stewartia ovata var. grandiflora (W.J.Bean) Weatherby — flowers up to 12&nbsp;cm diameter, stamens purple.\nReferences\n* [http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?sourceTemplate=tabular_report.wmt&loadTemplate=species_RptComprehensive.wmt&selectedReport=RptComprehensive.wmt&summaryView=tabular_report.wmt&elKey=148162&paging=home&save=true&startIndex=1&nextStartIndex=1&reset=false&offPageSelectedElKey=148162&offPageSelectedElType=species&offPageYesNo=true&post_processes=&radiobutton=radiobutton&selectedIndexes=148162.html NatureServe profile: Stewartia ovata]\n* [http://www.treetrail.net/stewartia_ovata.html TreeTrail: Stewartia ovata—Mountain Camellia profile]\nExternal links"
