The aim is to promote awareness about the diversity of humanity's cultural heritage, its vulnerability, and the efforts required for its protection and conservation.\nFor 2023, the theme \"Heritage Changes\" was chosen.\nConvention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\nThe Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage defines a monument as:\nInternational Year of the Monument\nThe International Year of the Monument was a commemorative date created by UNESCO in 1964. The implementation of the date was to give a better global coverage in the perception of the monument as a building or historical site of exemplary character, for its significance in the life trajectory of a society and its people. There are monuments built especially to celebrate or reminisce about an episode, moment or character of our history, created by architects, sculptors, and artists, often commissioned by world leaders or organizations. Others are remnants of the past that survived the time and are consecrated by society as collective symbols, and as references of the memory of a people.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
