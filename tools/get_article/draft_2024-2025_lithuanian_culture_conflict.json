The protests began after the formation of a governing coalition that included the nationalist party Dawn of Nemunas (Nemuno aušra). Tensions increased in September 2025 when the party was granted control of the Ministry of Culture, leading to nationwide demonstrations by artists, cultural institutions, and students.\nBackground\nNemuno aušra emerged in the early 2020s as a nationalist and populist political movement emphasizing regional identity and cultural conservatism. Commentators have described it as a right-wing or far-right party.\nIn the 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP) won the largest number of seats but did not secure a majority. After unsuccessful talks with centrist and liberal parties, the LSDP formed a coalition with Nemuno aušra and the Democratic Party \"For Lithuania\", led by former Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis. Under the coalition agreement, Nemuno aušra received the ministries of Justice, Agriculture, and Environment.\nPublic opposition began shortly after the coalition was announced. Protesters criticized the inclusion of Nemuno aušra, arguing that it contradicted the LSDP's pre-election pledge not to cooperate with extremist groups.\nEarly protests\nOn 12 December 2024, coinciding with the new government's inauguration, demonstrators gathered in Vilnius for an event called \"Ten Minutes of Silence\", opposing the coalition's composition. A second protest was organized later that month under the same theme.\nSeptember–October 2025 escalation\nIn September 2025, the government confirmed that the Ministry of Culture would be assigned to Nemuno aušra nominee Ignotas Adomavičius. The appointment was criticized by cultural organizations, which questioned the nominee's experience and independence. Demonstrations were held in major cities, including Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai, and Panevėžys.\nDuring the protests, orchestras and choirs performed M. K. Čiurlionis' Jūra (\"The Sea\") as a symbolic act of unity. Institutions such as the MO Museum in Vilnius displayed protest symbols, while Nemuno aušra representatives criticized the actions as politically motivated.\nStudents from art schools, including the M. K. Čiurlionis School of Art, organized sit-ins to express solidarity. Nemuno aušra leader Remigijus Žemaitaitis responded by calling protesters \"hysterical\", a statement widely covered in national media.\nBy early October, Ignotas Adomavičius withdrew his candidacy following public pressure. Demonstrations continued, calling for the removal of Nemuno aušra from the Ministry of Culture. On 5 October 2025, coordinated public performances of Čiurlionis' Jūra took place in more than twenty Lithuanian cities. A petition requesting the party's exclusion from the government reportedly collected over 80,000 signatures.\nRole of the President\nPresident Gitanas Nausėda publicly expressed concern over the coalition formation. In November 2024 he stated that he would not approve ministerial candidates from Nemuno aušra because of previous antisemitic remarks by its leadership. Nausėda later allowed the government to take office with concessions, including the appointment of non-partisan ministers to several posts.\nIn January 2025, Nausėda stated that Nemuno aušra's participation in government endangered the coalition's stability and Lithuania's international reputation. During the 2025 cultural protests, he confirmed the culture minister's nomination \"with reservations\", prompting further criticism from demonstrators.\nGovernment response\nPrime Minister Inga Ruginienė and coalition representatives defended the inclusion of Nemuno aušra as necessary for securing a parliamentary majority. Party spokespeople stated that the appointment process for ministries followed standard coalition procedures and denied allegations of extremism. Several local branches of Nemuno aušra described the cultural protests as partisan and unrepresentative of the broader public.\nPolitical developments\nOn 31 July 2025, Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas resigned amid corruption investigations and growing political pressure. His resignation intensified debate about the coalition's future and the role of Nemuno aušra within the government.\nAs of October 2025, demonstrations and cultural strikes continue in several cities, with participants calling for non-partisan oversight of cultural institutions.\nSee also\n* Politics of Lithuania\n* 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election\n* Protests in Lithuania\nReferences\n:Category:2024 in Lithuania\n:Category:2025 in Lithuania\n:Category:Protests in Lithuania\n:Category:Political history of Lithuania"
