      "text": "# Kentwood (Reading ward)\n\nKentwood is an electoral ward of the Borough of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It consists of the northern part of the suburb of Tilehurst, in the west of Reading, south of the River Thames. The ward is bordered by Caversham Heights and Battle wards to the east, and Norcot and Tilehurst wards to the south. To the west the ward is bordered by the reduced civil parish of Tilehurst in the district of West Berkshire which is the remainder of the larger ancient parish, before the expansion of the Borough of Reading.  The ward has schools and churches bearing a Tilehurst, rather than Reading name.\nAs with all wards, it elects three councillors to Reading Borough Council. Elections since 2004 are held by thirds, with elections in three years out of four.\nThese Councillors are currently, in order of election: Raj Singh (Conservative), Mark Keeping (Labour) and Glenn Dennis (Labour). Singh and Dennis have represented the ward for at least 13 and 10 years respectively.\nReferences"
