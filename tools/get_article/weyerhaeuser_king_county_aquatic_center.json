Over 200 world records have been set at the center.\nThe center is open to the public for open swim, pool exercise, family swim, lessons and lap swim.\nHistory\nOn April 18, 1990 the facility opened for general use. It was constructed to host the 1990 Goodwill Games, which were held in Seattle.\nLand for the center's development was donated by the Weyerhauser corporation and the facility was named after the company and its Chairman, George Weyerhaeuser. The Seattle Goodwill Games Committee provided $5 million and King County issued an $8.8 million bond to fund the facility.\nOperations\nFacilities\nSwimming, synchronized swimming, diving and water polo are accommodated by the technical features of the center. It is one of only a few of its kind in the United States.\nCenter facilities include:\n* 9–10.5 feet deep Olympic-sized competition and training pool (competition natatorium)\n* 25 x 17 yard, 17 feet deep diving well equipped for platform and springboard diving (competition natatorium)\n* 25 x 15 yard recreational pool with pirate cove features and theme (recreation pool)\n* Banquet hall seating for 245 people banquet-style and 400 people theater-style (banquet hall)\nFor the COVID-19 pandemic, the center started serving as a COVID-19 testing site open to the public in October 2020.\nThe center has an annual economic impact of $7.5 million USD.\nClosures\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic the center temporarily closed for several months, from March to September 2020, to accommodate best practices and prevent the spread of COVID-19. In November 2021, non-essential personnel and spectators were officially allowed back in to attend sporting events.\nFrom August 1 to mid-September 2022 and for the summer of 2023, the center is temporarily closed to use by the public for facility upgrades following its turning 30 years of age.\nEvents held at the center\nAs well as the Goodwill Games for which the center was constructed, each year the facility hosts high profile events. These have included Olympic Team Trials in diving, NCAA championships, PAC-12 conference championships, USA Swimming senior events and Speedo Junior Nationals. One way the center serves the community that funded its construction, the residents of King County, as well as Washington state residents at large, is through hosting events such as high school state swimming and diving championships.\nRecognition\nIn December 2015 Swimming World published a feature on King County Aquatic Center, highlighting eleven reasons it found the center to be \"awesome\" including playing a pivotal role in the swimming careers of notable Olympians Nathan Adrian (the only swimmer to make the list from Washington State), Michael Phelps, Missy Franklin, Cullen Jones, Simone Manuel, and Haley Anderson.\nGallery\nSome of the venue facilities include the following.\nFile:King County Aquatic Center main entrance - 23 November 2022.jpg|Main entrance and COVID-19 test site signage\nFile:King County Aquatic Center bleacher area - 23 November 2022.jpg|Bleacher seating in the competition natatorium\nFile:King County Aquatic Center competition pool and timing system - 23 November 2022.jpg|Competition pool with timing system\nFile:King County Aquatic Center diving tower and well - 23 November 2022.jpg|Diving well and tower\nFile:King County Aquatic Center media booth - 3 March 2023.jpg|Media booth\nSee also\n*Swimming at the Goodwill Games\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.kingcounty.gov/services/parks-recreation/parks/activities-rentals/aquatics.aspx Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatic Center official website]"
