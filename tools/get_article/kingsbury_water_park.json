It is owned and managed by Warwickshire County Council. It has fifteen lakes situated in over  of country park. It is renowned for its birdlife, and is popular with birdwatchers. It is bordered on the western edge by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal.\nHistory\nThe area which is now Kingsbury Water Park was previously the site of gravel extraction pits that were operated by the Midland Gravel Company. The lakes were created from the craters left behind after the gravel had been taken out. The Water Park was opened on 24 May 1975 with two lakes and 123 acres. It has been expanded over the years and as of 2011 has fifteen lakes in an area covering over 600 acres. The Park welcomed 50,000 visitors in its first year, a number which had expanded to 350,000 in 2007. The Water Park was briefly closed to the public in June 2007 after the area was hit by the worst flooding since the 1930s. At the time it was estimated the floods had caused tens of thousands of pounds' worth of damage. The Park was opened again once the flooding had subsided.\nFeatures\nThroughout the park are a number of bridleways, marked cycle routes and footpaths. There is a cycle hire centre and a variety of opportunities available for water sports, including water skiing, jetskis, power boats, sailing and model boat racing.\nThere is also a 7¼\" gauge ridable miniature railway known as Echills Wood Railway. It is run by enthusiasts, who eventually hope to provide a 2&nbsp;km loop, running a selection of steam, diesel and electric trains.\nIn November 2011 a new bird hide was erected by Warwickshire County Council allowing birdwatchers to observe birds in their natural habitat. A previous bird hide had been burnt down in December 2010.\nTwelve of the lakes provide the opportunity for angling, offering a variety of coarse angling.\nEvents\nEvery Saturday at 9am, the park hosts a free 5-kilometre run, organised by Parkrun. The first Kingsbury Water Parkrun was held on 20 July 2013, with 143 runners. The biggest attendance was 792 runners on 1 January 2019 for the New Year's Day Parkrun.\nChildren's facilities\nBroomey Croft Children's Farm is home to many animals and a play park and is suitable for children of all ages. Situated around the park are a number of play areas, picnic areas and cafés. The park is also home to a bicycle hire centre and has a well established visitor centre and shop.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/kingsburywaterpark County Council page]"
