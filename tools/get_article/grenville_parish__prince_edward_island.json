Prime Minister Grenville was also honoured with the naming of Grenville Bay in the parish, which has since been renamed New London Bay.\nThe communities of Granville (North Granville) and South Granville are derived from this name as well.  They adopted the present spelling when Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville gained prominence as the British Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1868–1870.\nReferences"
