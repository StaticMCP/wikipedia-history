It went on general release on November 16, 2012.\nReception\nThe film received an 88% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  John Anderson of Variety said the film was \"like a John Hughes comedy with nicotine stains.\" He went on to say \" it could become one of those films by which an age group defines itself.\"  Mark Olsen of The Los Angeles Times said the film was \"a surprisingly sweet story about a pair of Rhode Island Catholic schoolboys, played with knockabout charm by Alex Maizus and Dylan Hartigan.\" He criticized the film for \"its impulse toward honesty over overstatement\" which he said, \"robs the film of true dramatic tension.\"  Drew McWeeny of Hitfix wrote \"'Funeral Kings' is confident and controlled and, with an unabashed vulgarity underscoring everything, about as pure a piece of movie memory as I can name.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
