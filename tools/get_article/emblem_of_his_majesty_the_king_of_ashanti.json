The porcupine is the designated national animal of the Asante . The national emblem was created by Asantehene Nana Osei Kofi Tutu I (r. 1695–1717).\nEmblem description\nThe Asante national emblem is a red porcupine (or in Asante: Kotoko) on a gold background that symbolizes gold which has been a source of Asante  wealth. The porcupine has been the designated national animal of the Asante since 1701 right through to the 21st century and stems from the Asante proverb:\"The porcupine fights from all angles\" and the readiness of the Asante nation to wage war on its enemies with the motto \"Kum apem a, apem beba\" (Kill a thousand, a thousand will rise) in reference to the porcupine's quills as symbols of Asante warriors, is still quoted.\nSee also\n*Political systems of the Asante Empire\nReferences"
