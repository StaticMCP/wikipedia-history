He played college football at Auburn University.\nEarly life\nEdwards was born on December 14, 1939, in Abbeville, Alabama, to Warren and Millie Edwards. Edwards attended Abbeville High School. He was a two-way tackle and contributed to the team having a 9–1 record, while outscoring their opponents 281–19 in 1957. He received All-state honors as a senior. He also played basketball.\nCollege career\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Auburn University, and was on the team from 1959 to 1961, playing in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). He was a two-way player who was used as an offensive end and defensive end. As a junior, he posted 6 receptions (tied for second on the team with future NFL player Jimmy Burson) for 74 yards and no touchdowns.\nAs a senior, he led the team with 25 receptions for 372 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was named to the All-SEC team. He played for the South team in the 1962 Senior Bowl, where his future NFL coach Tom Landry coached the opposing team (North).\nIn 1988, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\nProfessional career\nEdwards was not drafted by any NFL team, and was selected by the Denver Broncos in the 25th round (194th overall) of the 1962 AFL draft; but chose to sign with the NFL's Dallas Cowboys as a free agent in 1962. As a rookie, he started out as an offensive end on the taxi squad and was later converted to outside linebacker. He was not activated for any of the 14 games.\nIn 1963, he gained 25&nbsp;lbs (from 205 to 230) and started 6 games, while replacing the injured Lee Roy Jordan and Harold Hays. In 1964, he began the season as the starter at strongside linebacker, until Chuck Howley passed him on the depth chart in the fourth game.\nIn 1965, he was named the starter at strongside linebacker. Landry created the 4–3 defense, and Edwards was the first \"Sara\" or strong side linebacker in the NFL.  Edwards would end up forming with Howley and Jordan, one of the best linebacking corps in NFL history as part of the 'Doomsday Defense'.\nIn 1967, he had 3 interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown against the Baltimore Colts Johnny Unitas.\nReferred to as \"Fuzzy\" by his teammates, Edwards' strength made him a difficult player to deal with against the run and he was also known to rarely make mistakes that could hurt the defense. He thrived against opposing tight ends, so much so, that then Oakland Raiders linebackers coach John Madden, instructed his linebackers to study Edwards' technique in stopping the run while jamming the tight end.\nIn 1970, Edwards intercepted two passes against the Cleveland Browns, sealing a 6–2 win, that was key for the team to not only make the playoffs, but also advanced Dallas' first Super Bowl against the Baltimore Colts.\nOn July 1, 1976, he announced his retirement and was replaced with Bob Breunig. Although overshadowed by Howley and Jordan, he was a key component in the Cowboys' defensive dominance during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cowboys defensive assistant coach Ernie Stautner said \"The best thing you can say about Edwards is that he's a pro. He plays while he's hurt and he still does an outstanding job. That's what a pro is\".\nEdwards missed only one game in his 14 NFL seasons, while playing in 181 regular season games, starting 164 of those games. He recorded 30 turnovers, that included 13 interceptions and 17 fumbles recoveries (tied for second in franchise history). He also played in 18 playoff games. He helped the Cowboys win three NFC Championships and one Super Bowl. He played in Super Bowls V, VI and X. Super Bowl X was his last game.\nPersonal life\nEdwards was a talented painter whose work was displayed in several shows. On December 6, 2016, Edwards died in his sleep the day he was scheduled to undergo tests for a heart condition at a Waco hospital. Edwards' son, Chris, planned on burying both of his parents' ashes together. However, his house was robbed on March 20, 2017, and his mother Gail's ashes were taken by the burglar.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ashof.org/inductees/dave-edwards/ Alabama Sports Hall of Fame Profile]"
