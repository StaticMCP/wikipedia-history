In present day, Grace Gardner attends Wallace University and plans to join Kappa Kappa Tau to honor her mother, who was once a member. Dean Cathy Munsch attempts to shut down KKT, threatening to revoke the charter, due to president Chanel Oberlin's rude behavior and suspected assault on her predecessor, Melanie Dorkus. Kappa is forced to accept anyone who wishes to join; this lowers Chanel's popularity and her boyfriend, Chad Radwell, ends their relationship. Ms. Bean, Kappa's housemaid, is killed via deep fryer; her body is hidden in the house's storage freezer. Grace joins forces with Pete Martinez, an investigative reporter, to take down Chanel and restore KKT's reputation. Ms. Bean's body disappears and Chanel realizes something strange is going on.

Meanwhile, Grace and Pete develop a relationship, and Grace finds a secret room where the leaders of Kappa hide their greatest secrets, and learns that in 1995 a pledge bled to death due to the sisters' neglect after giving birth to a child, which then disappeared, and that Munsch supposedly covered up the incident. Grace finds the Red Devil costume in Pete's closet and becomes convinced he's both the killer and the child of the pledge that died 20 years prior. The Red Devil fatally stabs Denise's partner Shondell, slashes the throat of Boone, and leaves a threatening message to the Kappa sisters. Later at the campus morgue, the Red Devil rendezvous with Boone, who faked his death.\n| LineColor       = 893843\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 1AYD03\n| Viewers         = 3.46\n|ShortSummary    = Keen to boost her dwindling popularity, Chanel gives Hester a makeover and inducts her into the sorority as Chanel #6.

The trio visit Chanel #2's parents in Bel Air, who divulge that Chanel #2, whose name is Sonya, was dating Chad. Denise is convinced that there are two Red Devils, Zayday being one of them, while Grace believes Chad is responsible. The Red Devil is goaded into fighting The Dickie Dollar Scholars, who are convinced that Boone's 'suicide' was actually murder. However, confronted by two chainsaw-wielding Red Devils, the scholars are outplayed, resulting in Caulfield losing both his arms. Dean Munsch and Gigi decide to move into the Kappa house temporarily to protect the girls.

Grace and Pete speak to the sole survivor of the 'bathtub incident' of 1995, Mandy Greenwell. She tells them that after the baby's mother died, Dean Munsch took care of the situation, enlisting Mandy and her friends to bury the corpse, and taking the baby to an unknown location.

From the acting to the costuming to the writing, everything about this concept and execution works.

They commented that the show pummels \"the viewer into submission with sheer, rictus-grinning relentlessness\" and praised it for being \"shiny, gory and whip-smart.\"\nRobert Rorke of The New York Post panned the series, later putting it on his list of 10 worst TV shows of 2015 and criticized Roberts' performance, saying that she \"can't act\".\nRatings\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Episode\n! scope=\"col\" | Air date\n! scope=\"col\" | Rating/share(18–49)\n! scope=\"col\" | Viewers(millions)\n! scope=\"col\" | DVR(18–49)\n! scope=\"col\" | DVR viewers(millions)\n! scope=\"col\" | Total(18–49)\n! scope=\"col\" | Total viewers(millions)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 1\n| \"Pilot\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1.7/5\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4.04\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1.4\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3.02\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3.1\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 7.06\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 2\n| \"Hell Week\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 3\n| \"Chainsaw\"\n|\n| 1.4/5\n| 3.46\n| 1.3\n| 2.51\n| 2.7\n| 5.98\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 4\n| \"Haunted House\"\n|\n| 1.2/4\n| 2.97\n| 0.9\n| 1.93\n| 2.1\n| 4.89\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 5\n| \"Pumpkin Patch\"\n|\n| 1.0/3\n| 2.39\n| 0.8\n| 1.77\n| 1.8\n| 4.16\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 6\n| \"Seven Minutes in Hell\"\n|\n| 1.0/3\n| 2.59\n| 0.7\n| 1.57\n| 1.7\n| 4.16\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 7\n| \"Beware of Young Girls\"\n|\n| 1.0/3\n| 2.44\n| 0.8\n| 1.67\n| 1.8\n| 4.11\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 8\n| \"Mommie Dearest\"\n|\n| 0.9/3\n| 2.51\n| 0.8\n| 1.67\n| 1.7\n| 4.18\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 9\n| \"Ghost Stories\"\n|\n| 0.9/3\n| 2.37\n| 0.8\n| 1.69\n| 1.7\n| 4.06\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 10\n| \"Thanksgiving\"\n|\n| 0.8/3\n| 1.98\n| 1.0\n| 1.97\n| 1.8\n| 3.95\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 11\n| \"Black Friday\"\n|\n| 0.9/3\n| 2.40\n| 0.8\n| 1.57\n| 1.7\n| 3.96\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 12\n| \"Dorkus\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 0.9/3\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2.53\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 0.7\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1.39\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1.6\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3.92\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | 13\n| \"The Final Girl(s)\"\n|}\nHome media\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#893843;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |  Scream Queens – The Complete First Season\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"\n|  style=\"width:400px;\" colspan=\"2\"| Set Details\n|  style=\"width:400px; \" colspan=\"2\"| Special Features\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| colspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:left; width:400px;\"|\n* 13 Episodes\n* 4 Disc Set\n* English 5.1 Dolby Digital\n* Subtitles: English SDH, Spanish, French\n* Runtime: 570 Minutes\n| colspan=\"3\"  style=\"text-align:left; width:400px;\"|\n* Rush Kappa\n* Between 2 Queens\n* Style Queens\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Release Dates\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Region 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Region 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Region 4\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
