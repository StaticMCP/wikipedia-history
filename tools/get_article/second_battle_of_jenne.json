It was the last major battle in the Franco-Tukulor Wars. The French won a decisive victory, forcing Ahmadu Tall to flee to the Sokoto Caliphate in what is now Nigeria. The already waning Tukulor Empire fell apart as a result.\nSee also\n*First Battle of Jenné\n*Tukulor Empire\n*History of Mali\nReferences\nSources\n*\n\n---\n\n## Second Battle of Jenne\n\n#REDIRECT Second Battle of Jenné"
