The paper was purchased in 1899 by W.W. Robertson, who also purchased the competing weekly newspaper, the Yakima Daily Republic. In 1968, the Herald & Republic combined to an all-day newspaper called the Yakima Herald-Republic.\nHarte-Hanks bought the Herald-Republic in 1972 from the Robertson family. Harte-Hanks sold the paper to an affiliate of MediaNews Group in 1986. It is now part of The Seattle Times Company, which purchased the paper in 1991.\nThe newspaper was printed in Yakima until 2021, when The Seattle Times Company announced it would sell the Herald-Republics headquarters and printing plant. The newspaper will instead be printed in Walla Walla by the Walla Walla Union-Bulletin.\nReferences"
