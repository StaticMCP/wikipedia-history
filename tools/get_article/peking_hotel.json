It is located in the city center at the intersection of the Garden Ring and Tverskaya Street. Designed by Soviet architect Dmitry Chechulin, the hotel was originally intended to commemorate Sino-Soviet friendship, but by the time it was completed, the relationship between two nations had gone cold.\nPeking Hotel, which is owned by Sistema, is located at Bol'shaya Sadovaya Ulitsa, 5 in Moscow. Oleg Kuznetsov () was the hotel administrator from 2002 to 2016.\nIn 2011, it was announced that the hotel would be renovated as a luxury hotel and would reopen in 2017, managed by Fairmont Hotels as the Fairmont Pekin Moscow. The renovation and rebranding never happened, however.\nIn 2020, reconstruction took place: the sculptures decorating the facade of the building, the panels, and the spire were restored.\nSee also\n* Moscow RestaurantSoviet restaurant built in Beijing as part of the same project\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://hotelpeking.ru/ Peking Hotel official website]"
