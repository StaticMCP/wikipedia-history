Please refer to the specific articles or sources for updated information, where available. Furthermore, in most surveys only the important countries in the respective fields have been surveyed, thus the ranks might not be out of the whole world and all the countries. It should also be noted that the rankings are based on surveys by numerous entities with different benchmarks and standards, thus caution is needed in their interpretation of final results specially in the case of subjective field matters, as some of these rankings maybe based on speculative, biased, subjective or politicized evaluations. Finally, it is always important to consider trend when making comparisons, since single point data may be exceptional in nature (e.g. Iran's 2008 drought and wheat production).\nSee also\n*Lists by country\n*Lists of countries and territories\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nationmaster.com/country/ir-iran NationMaster.com] - International rankings of Iran (including time series)\n* [http://www.nourlaw.com/legal-guide-to-iranian-market/ Nourlaw.com - Legal Guide to Iranian Market] - 2017"
