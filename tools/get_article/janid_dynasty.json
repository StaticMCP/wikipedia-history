They succeeded to the Shaybanids, and ruled the Khanate of Bukhara from 1599 to 1785.\nHistory\nIn 1598, Abdullah Khan II from the Shaybanid dynasty, who had rule the Khanate of Bukhara since 1583, died.\nAfter his death, the throne passed to his only son Abd al-Mumin, but he was soon killed by rebels. As the son of Abd al-Mumin was only two years old, the first cousin of Abdullah Khan II, Pir Muhammad II, was chosen as new Khan. This appointment was contested by several other rulers, like Tauekel Khan of the Kazakhs, Kasim Sultan and Baqi Muhammad, whose mother was Abdullah Khan's sister and whose father a prince from Astrakhan named Jani Muhammed Beg.\nBaqi Muhammad was victorious and Pir Muhammad II was killed in battle. With his death, the Shaybanid dynasty ended, and Baqi Muhammad became the first Khan of the Janid or Ashtarkhanid dynasty.\nThe name Janid, comes from his father Jani Muhammed Beg. He was the son of Prince Yar Muhammed, who was a member of the Tuqay-Timurid who had ruled the Astrakhan Khanate, until they were chased by the Russians in 1555.\n, built between 1619 and 1636 by Governor of Samarkand Yalangtoʻsh Bakhodir, Khanate of Bukhara]]\n, also built by Yalangtoʻsh Bakhodir, between 1646 and 1660. Samarqand Registan.]]\nThe Janid dynasty ruled the Bukhara Khanate from 1599 to 1785.\nIn 1740, Bukhara was conquered by Persia, but Abu al-Fayz Khan remained on the throne.\nThe real power was in the hands of Ataliq Muhammad Rahim, who even had the Khan killed in 1747.\nThe successors of the Khan were all puppets in the hands of their Ataliqs.This situation ended when the new Ataliq Shah Murad deposed Khan Abu'l Ghazi, pronounced himself Emir of Bukhara and created his own Manghud dynasty.\nRulers\n*Baqi Muhammad Khan (1599–1605)\n*Vali Muhammad Khan (1605–1611)\n*Imam Quli Khan (1611–1642)\n*Nadr Muhammad Khan (1642–1645)\n*Abd al-Aziz Khan (1645–1680)\n*Subhan Quli Khan (1680–1702)\n*Ubaidullah Khan (1702–1711)\n*Abu al-Fayz Khan (1711–1747)\n*Muhammad Abd al-Mumin (1747–1748, nominal)\n*Muhammad Ubaidullah II (1748–1753, nominal)\n*Abu'l Ghazi (1758–1785, nominal)\nGenealogy\n{|- valign=top\n| colspan=100% style=\"text-align:left\" |\nMongol Empire   Golden Horde   Blue Horde (Debatable)   Great Horde   Astrakhan Khanate   Bukhara Khanate\n|}\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#408080\n}}\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#D8A403\n}}\n|A02=Qutluq-Beg\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#283CC1\n}}\n|A02=Shadi Beg\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#D8A403\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#D8A403\n}}\n|A02=Timur\n|A03=Ghiyath ad-Din II\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#D8A403\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#D8A403\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#D8A403\n}}\n|A03=Mustafa II\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#D8A403\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#D8A403\n}}\n|#5561D9}}\n|A02=Ahmad\n|A03=Chuwaq\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#B3A504\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#B3A504\n}}\n|A02=Abdul-Karim\n|A03=Murtada  |#B3A504}}\n|A04=Shaykh-Ahmad\n|A05=Sayyid-Ahmad III\n|A06=Mangishlaq\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#B3A504\n|boxstyle_ A04 =border-color:#B3A504\n|boxstyle_ A05 =border-color:#B3A504\n}}\n|A02=Aq Kubek\n|A03=Berdi-Beg\n|A04=Shaykh-Haydar\n|A05=Qasim II\n|A06=Yar-Muhammad\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A04 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A05 =border-color:#5561D9\n}}\n|A02=Darwish-Ali\n|A03=Jani-Muhammad\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#5561D9\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#FF822E\n}}\n|#FF822E}}\n|A03=Wali-Muhammad\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#FF822E\n}}\n|A02=Nadir-Muhammad\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#FF822E\n}}\n|A03=Subhan-Quli\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#FF822E\n}}\n|A03='''Abu'l-Fayd\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#FF822E\n}}\n|A02=Abu'l-Mu'min\n|A03=Ubaydullah III\n|A04=Yulduz Begim\n|A05=Muhammad-Rahim'''\n|boxstyle_ A01 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A02 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A03 =border-color:#FF822E\n|boxstyle_ A05 =border-color:#FF822E\n}}\nReferences\nSources\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=fteHuo3yyAYC&q=Four+Types+of+Loyalty+in+Early+Modern+Central+Asia: Thomas Welsford: Four Types of Loyalty in Early Modern Central Asia: The Tuqay-Timurid Takeover of Greater M War Al-Nahr, 1598-1605]"
