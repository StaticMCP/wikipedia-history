Under new head coach Brad Childress, the team finished with a 6–10 record; however, they led the league in rushing defense, surrendering only 985 rushing yards; they are one of only two franchises in NFL history to allow fewer than 1,000 rushing yards in a 16-game season (the other was the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens in 2000).\nOffseason\nOn January 6, 2006, the Vikings hired Brad Childress to take over from Mike Tice as head coach, making them the first team to hire a new head coach during the 2006 offseason. Childress previously held the quarterbacks coach position with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2002, and was the offensive coordinator from 2002 to 2005; he was also offensive coordinator for the Wisconsin Badgers from 1993 to 1999 under Barry Alvarez.\n2006 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"| 2006 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1\n! 17\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Chad Greenway\n| Linebacker\n| Iowa\n| 5 years\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 2\n! 48\n| Cedric Griffin\n| Cornerback\n| Texas\n| 4 years\n|\n|-\n! 51\n| Ryan Cook\n| Center\n| New Mexico\n| 4 years\n| From Dolphins\n|-\n! 64\n| Tarvaris Jackson\n| Quarterback\n| Alabama State\n| 4 years\n| From Steelers\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3\n! 83\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers\n|\n|-\n! 95\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers\n| From Seahawks\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" | 4\n! 115\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles\n|\n|-\n! 127\n| Ray Edwards\n| Defensive end\n| Purdue\n| 4 years\n| From Colts, via Eagles\n|-\n! 5\n! 149\n| Greg Blue\n| Safety\n| Georgia\n| 4 years\n|\n|-\n! 6\n! 185\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles\n|\n|-\n! 7\n! 227\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the San Diego Chargers\n|\n|}\nNotes:\nTransactions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Re-signed\n|-\n!

The Vikings drew first blood as running back Chester Taylor ran in a 4-yard touchdown on their opening drive; however, during the extra-point try, holder Chris Kluwe fumbled the snap and instead tried to go for a two-point conversion, which failed. The Vikings lead was cut in half later in the quarter, as Redskins kicker John Hall made a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, things were starting to look grim for the Vikings, as Redskins running back Clinton Portis and kicker Hall gave the Redskins a 5-yard touchdown run and another 27-yard field goal to make the score 13–6. The Vikings responded with a last-second 46-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell to close the first half. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued their comeback as quarterback Brad Johnson threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marcus Robinson to give Minnesota a 16–13 lead. However, the Redskins tied the game up on a 22-yard field goal by Hall. Late in the fourth quarter, Longwell gave the Vikings a 19–16 lead, as he kicked a 31-yard field goal. During the final minute of the game, the Vikings held their ground and hung on to give Brad Childress his first head coaching win, as Hall missed a 48-yard field goal for the home side.\nWeek 2: vs. Carolina Panthers\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 2: Carolina Panthers at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=September 17\n|Road=Panthers\n|R1=0|R2=10|R3=3|R4=0|R5=0\n|Home=Vikings\n|H1=3|H2=3|H3=0|H4=7|H5=3\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT/12:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT\n|weather=Indoors\n|stadium=Hubert H.
