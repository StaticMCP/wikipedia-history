In the wake of the resulting social upheaval and unrest, a young boy named Amō Shiiba stumbles across an abandoned AMAIM called Kenbu and a rogue autonomous AI named Gai.

However, this began a war between the competing foreign powers for control of Japan through the use of autonomous mecha units called AMAIMs in a conflict known as the Boundary War. By 2061, the war has long ended, but Japan remains divided into four occupied regions. Amō Shiiba is a young orphan who is slowly rebuilding an abandoned AMAIM he found. While scavenging for parts, he comes across an AI core containing an autonomous AI calling itself Gai who requests Amō save him before his battery runs out. Amō plugs Gai into his salvaged AMAIM, and Gai begins rebuilding it and learns it is a rare manned model called Kenbu. Meanwhile, Oceanian mercenaries falsely accuse Amō and his scavenger friends of terrorism, forcing him to pilot Kenbu to destroy the AMAIMs sent after him.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = In order to protect his friends, Amō proclaims himself a terrorist who exploited them to build Kenbu before fleeing.

Soon, they reach a small coastal village where Gai has to temporarily enter sleep mode to process the new data he has acquired. Amō heads out to search for food, and ends up helping an elderly farmer harvest his crops. However, the farmer and his wife discover Amō is a fugitive, but decide to shelter him anyways, as they realize he's not a terrorist. They also have no love for the Oceania, as their son was killed during the Boundary War. Realizing his presence will only endanger the couple, Amō leaves in the middle of the night and borrows their son's abandoned fishing boat. As Amō and Gai leave Oceania's territory, they are ambushed by the Asian military. While Amō and Gai put up an effective fight, they are quickly outnumbered and pinned down until they receive assistance from another manned AMAIM.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Amō and Gai are rescued by another AMAIM pilot, Gashin Tezuka who pilots the AMAIM Jogan and is assisted by another autonomous AI named Kei. Gashin reveals he is part of the Japanese liberation group Yatagarasu and takes Amō to their base camp, where he meets the local leader, Goken Kumai. Kumai reveals that Kenbu was originally commissioned by Yatagarasu and belongs to the group, but was lost after the Yatagarasu branch it was destined for was destroyed. Kumai offers to let Amō join Yatagarasu as Kenbu's pilot, or give up Kenbu and return to civilian life under a new identity. It's also revealed Gashin's father was Jogan's previous pilot before being killed. Amō remains uncertain about joining, as he is afraid of having to fight. After spending some time with other Yatagarasu members and sympathizing with their cause, Amō ultimately decides to join them while Kenbu is upgraded. Amō and Gashin then participate in a mock battle where they switch to using each other's AMAIMs, and the battle ends in a draw.

Amō is traumatized upon learning of Risa's death while Yatagarasu evacuates the area. Shortly after, officers from the North American military to investigate the site, and manage to conclude that Kenbu and Jogan battled the Ghost. Intrigued by the Ghost's presence in the area, the North American officers decide to deploy more forces. Meanwhile, Gashin leaves Amō to grieve for Risa's death. Eventually, Amō decides not to join Yatagarasu, as he's afraid of seeing people he has befriended die. Gashin allows Amō to leave with Gai, under the condition he hide Kenbu for Yatagarasu to recover later.

Amō informs them about Risa's death, but her friends reveal that Risa's family have all moved away due to scandal of her joining Yatagarasu. However, they do know where Risa's family grave is, where he can return necklace and pay his respects. That night, Mr. Nose and Hina are kidnapped by the local Deputy Governor, who intends to sell them as part of his human trafficking ring. The local townspeople protest Mr. Nose's arrest, and the Deputy Governor responds by arresting many of the protestors and sentencing them to death. Unwilling to stand by and watch more innocent people die, Amō retrieves Kenbu and rescues the prisoners while Gai broadcasts evidence of the Deputy Governor's illegal dealings. In order to save face, the Asian military releases all of the prisoners, including Mr. Nose and Hina, and orders the Deputy Governor be removed from his post.

Yatagarasu arranges for a collaborator to provide them the parts they need in a nearby city. Amō and Gashin hide their AMAIMs and head for the city. Meanwhile, the Oceanian military decides to take advantage of the Asian military's human trafficking scandal to stage an attack on the Asian territory. Amō and Gashin do their best to help civilians evacuate, but soon find themselves caught between the fighting between the Asian and Oceanian forces. Suddenly, an unknown AMAIM arrives and destroys multiple AMAIMs on both sides, forcing the Oceanian and Asian militaries to cease fighting and retreat. Amō and Gashin meet with the new AMAIM, which reveals it is controlled by the third pilot and an AI named Angelo.

As the trio travel to Yatagarasu's HQ, Amō becomes curious about the source of their AMAIMs and AI companions, especially since no other nation has such advanced technology. Gashin explains that they are receiving support from Brenson Corp, an unregistered corporation. Meanwhile, the North American military tasks Captain Brad Watts with hunting down Ghost, with the intention to either capture it so its AI technology can be studied, or destroy it to prevent it from falling into foreign hands. Brad leads an elite AMAIM squad to subdue Ghost, and despite being able to seriously damage it, Brad and his team suffer losses and are unable to stop Ghost from escaping. Brad promises to get revenge on Ghost for his fallen comrades.

Since one of Yatagarasu's missions is to provide humanitarian relief, Udou and Goken agree to help the Fudou family. Yatagarasu helps rebuild the village, as well as constructing a well and waterwheel and repairing an old kiln. They quickly run into an issue where their efforts to build a well are blocked by a layer of thick bedrock, though they are able to build a laser drill and pile bunker to break through it. With access to water and electricity allowing them to be self sufficient, the Fudou family thanks Yatagarasu for their help.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| TranslitTitle       = Jichiku\n| NativeTitle         = 自治区\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Masashi Abe\n| WrittenBy           = Noboru Kimura\n| Aux2                = Masashi Abe\n| OriginalAirDate     =\n| ShortSummary        = While on a supply run, Amō, Gashin, and Shion encounter Yuusei Suenaga, Gashin's foster brother and ex-Yatagarasu member. They both have a happy reunion and agree to meet each other again. Yuusei explains that he is the mayor of an autonomous city, where Japanese citizens can live and self govern without foreign interference. He explains that he wants to try a different path to achieve Japanese independence through negotiation and compromise rather than violence, which is why he left Yatagarasu. After touring the trio around the city, Yuusei privately offers Gashin residence in the city so that they can live together and Gashin can leave a life of violence behind. That night, German warns Gashin that Yuusei is a spy for the Asian military, which was how he was able to build the autonomous city. Gashin does his own investigation and finds that the Asian military is coercing Yuusei to give up information about Japanese rebels in return for much needed supplies for the city. Gashin then lays a trap and catches Yuusei red handed attempting to steal data from Yatagarasu. Gashin reveals that the data Yuusei stole was bait and Yatagarasu will be long gone by the time the Asian military mobilizes. Yuusei remains adamant with collaborating with the Asian military, and Gashin cannot bring himself to kill Yuusei and lets him go, wondering if he made the right choice.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = On a request from German, Yatagarasu sends Amō, Gashin, and Shion to the Eurasian military held Tohoku region to rescue another resistance group, Arahabaki. Their leader, Konno, explains that they used to be the largest resistance group in the area until Eurasian officer Alexei Zelenoy took command. Meanwhile, Alexei notices the arrival of the Yatagarasu AMAIMs and decides to personally head to the frontline in his own manned AMAIM. Amō, Gashin, and Shion begin scouting the surrounding area, and discover a network of remote sensors the Eurasian military had set up to detect rebel movements. Together with their AIs, the manage to hack the sensor network to lure the Eurasian forces into a trap, where they destroy the majority of the AMAIMs, leaving only Alexei left.

Brad and his team are contacted by German, who leaks them Ghost's current location. However, Brad notes that Ghost is likely still in Asian territory, and its self-improving nature means they will need even more troops to suppress it. Later, Amō and his friends head into a nearby city to buy supplies, and Amō accidentally runs into Brad, who recognizes his voice. That night, Amō and his friends head to a hot spring to relax, where Brad meets them. He tells them about his position as a North American soldier, as well as Ghost's location in the Oki Islands before leaving.

Meanwhile, Brad and his team keep an eye on the situation, ready to seize Ghost when the moment is right. At the Oki islands, Amō, Gashin, and Shion engage Ghost and save a detachment of Asian soldiers, who surrender to Yatagarasu and are allowed to evacuate with the civilians. Amō, Gashin, and Shion realize Ghost is far more formidable than the last they fought it, so they lure it into an abandoned ammo dump and detonate it.

Meanwhile, Brad watches the battle from a drone as he records all of the data. Ghost is quickly able to disable both Jogan and Reiki, leaving Kenbu as the only combat capable AMAIM. Gashin and Shion transfer most of their remaining power to Kenbu. They also find out that Ghost high performance comes at the cost of generating massive amounts of heat, and it relies on a heat sink on its back to keep itself cooled. Amō then confronts Ghost alone, with Gai removing Kenbu's limiters to allow Amō to fight Ghost on equal footing for a short period of time. Amō is able to distract Ghost long enough for Shion and Gashin to ambush it and destroy its heat sink. Rapidly heating up, Ghost attempts to flee to the ocean but Amō risks his life to stop Ghost. Ghost explodes, taking Kenbu with it. Unable to stay in the area for too long, Yatagarasu is forced to flee the islands and declare Amō missing in action. Later, Brad and his team are able to recover Ghost's AI core from the ocean floor, and Brad promises that he will put Ghost's capabilities to good use.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Eight months after the battle with Ghost, the North American Coalition has managed to develop automated AI which they begin using in their AMAIMs, giving them a serious advantage over the other nations. Brad meanwhile is attempting to build an AMAIM that can contain Ghost. Soon, the NAC's territory begins to expand significantly, with many Japanese civilians being caught in the crossfire. Gashin, Shion, and Yatagarasu continue to fight to try and protect as many civilians as they can, but after losing contact with German and Brenson Corp, they are running short of supplies. Soon, a group of refugees and resistance warriors arrive at Yatagarasu's camp, having been chased there by advancing NAC forces. Lacking the strength to fight off an NAC army, Kumai attempts to negotiate for the safe release of the refugees, but the NAC commander sabotages the negotiations and attacks anyways. Gashin and Shion attempt to hold off the NAC army but are soon overwhelmed. However, at the last moment, Kenbu arrives and pushes back the NAC forces, revealing that Amō has survived.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With Amō's help, Yatagarasu is able to escape the NAC's encirclement. Maki then arrives, bringing a convoy of much needed supplies. She reveals she's actually the president of TRYVECTA, an AI development group affiliated with Brenson Corp. She also admits she was the person who developed Ghost. Brenson Corp took possession of Ghost but lost control of it, while Maki used Ghost as a basis to develop Gai, Kei, and Nayuta. She had intended to recover Ghost herself after the battle at the Oki Islands, but gave up the chance to save Amō and Gai instead. In addition, German betrayed Brenson Corp, trading Ghost for a position in the NAC and attempting to destroy Brenson Corp. For the past eight months, Brenson Corp has been busy rebuilding Kenbu, but Mika won't say what Amō was doing, and Amō himself seems far more distant and withdrawn than before. The next day, the NAC renews their attack, but Amō, Gai, and Shion are able to easily destroy their forces with their newly upgraded AMAIMs. When the NAC commander refuses to surrender, Amō coldly executes him, shocking everybody.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = After witnessing Amō kill another person, Shion is left conflicted over her motivation to fight, while Gashin notices that Amō seems to be hiding some sort of trauma that he refuses to talk about. Meanwhile, Brad and his squad are sent to reinforce NAC forces battling a Eurasian army led by Alexei, who is invading NAC territory. The local commander, unwilling to let Brad steal the credit, decides to attack before the reinforcements arrive. Alexei takes advantage of this by luring the NAC forces into a trap, miring them in quicksand. Brad arrives just in time in a brand new AMAIM that incorporates Ghost in its program. Assisted by Ghost's rapid learning, Brad is able to destroy the majority of the Eurasian force and defeat Alexei in battle, with Alexei barely managing to escape with his life when Brad's AMAIM breaks down. Realizing that the NAC will gain a massive advantage if Brad's AMAIM is completed and mass produced, Alexei decides to retreat and regroup. Elsewhere, Amō, Gashin, and Shion arrive a Yatagarasu's new headquarters. There, Gashin and Shion confront Amō about what had happened to him in the past eight months.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Seeing how concerned his friends are, Amō finally opens up about what happened in the past eight months. After German's betrayal of Brenson Corp, Amō fled with TRYVECTA to an emergency shelter, where he helped take care of the staff's children. However, the shelter was eventually discovered by German's men and assaulted, resulting in much of the staff being massacred. Amō meanwhile was forced to use a gun to kill one of the attackers in order to protect the children, becoming traumatized in the process. Meanwhile, Brad enlists German's aid in procuring blackmail material on Senator Roy Walker to prevent him from cutting the NAC's military budget. However, Brad voices his suspicion that German is involved with other elements of the NAC military as well. In the rest of the Japan, the other nations begin mobilizing their forces in preparation for more hostilities. German then talks with Joe Spears, Brad's superior officer and adoptive father, warning him that Brad is beginning to get suspicious. Spears simply replies that they can deal with Brad when the time comes.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yuusei contacts Yatagarasu, informing them of a Japanese sanctuary city that lies on the Eurasian territory's border with the NAC, which is under threat of invasion. Yatagarasu agrees to lend their aid and travel to the Sanctuary, led by Eurasian officer Cyril Zhirkov. Cyril reveals that he has a deep appreciation for Japan, and organized the Sanctuary under the guise of a corporate holding to avoid notice from his superiors. However, the NAC is preparing to invade the area, and the Eurasian military has refused to send reinforcements. The next day, Yatagarasu and Cyril's forces pretend to fight each other before ambushing the approaching NAC forces. However, Amō and his friends are caught off guard when NAC scientist Zack Taylor arrives with a unit of AMAIMs containing copies of Ghost's programming. While Amō and his friends are initially surprised, they quickly adapt and destroy the AMAIMs and force Zack to flee, pointing out his Ghost copies were incomplete. The NAC retreats from the area, and the Eurasian military, believing Cyril successfully repelled Yatagarasu, finally agrees to send reinforcements. Amō witnesses Cyril's wife giving birth to his daughter, and the baby taking a liking to him helps him overcome his trauma.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Shortly after Amō and his friends return to HQ, they and the rest of Yatagarasu begin acting strangely, secretly coming up with some sort of plan while trying to keep Gai, Kei, and Nayuta in the dark. At first, the AIs are curious about the secret operation, prodding everybody for information. However, when everybody refuses to tell them what is going on, and with the discovery that Amō and his friends have bought a number of high tech parts, they begin to fear that Yatagarasu is building a new AI to replace them. On the day the operation is supposed to commence, Gai, Kei, and Nayuta seclude themselves inside their AMAIMs, requiring Amō, Gashin, and Shion to coax them out. Amō and his friends then reveal that they have been organizing a surprise birthday party for Gai, Kei, and Nayuta to celebrate one year since their creation. In order to facilitate this, they had developed a special room where the AIs can manifest in an augmented reality system. As everybody celebrates, Udou quietly excuses himself from the celebrations and returns to his office, where it is revealed that he has secretly allied with the Eurasian, Asian, and Oceanian militaries.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Udou reveals to Yatagarasu that the Asian, Eurasian, and Oceanian blocs have formed an alliance to resist the NAC and are offering Yatagarasu to join in return for granting the Hokuriku region Japanese autonomy. However, the catch is that they will have to battle the NAC, who hold the legitimate Japanese government as a puppet state and will not voluntarily relinquish that advantage. In addition, the allied resistance organizations based in Hokuriku may not necessarily accept the deal. After some thought, and despite fears of betrayal, Yatagarasu ultimately decides to join the alliance. After a public signing ceremony, the alliance officially announces their intention to form the autonomous state of New Japan, inviting the Japanese government to administer it. Meanwhile, Brad begins making his own plans, much to his subordinate Sofia's concern, as she feels he's changed ever since he obtained Ghost. Spears orders to German to eliminate the alliance by any means necessary. Back in New Japan, Alexei reports that the NAC wants to hold a preliminary meeting, of which he will attend, and announces that the NAC also specifically requested Amō attend as well.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Amō and Alexei arrive in Tokyo on behalf of the newly formed New Japan Cooperation Organization to negotiate with the NAC. However, the mediator for the meeting, Congressman Roy Walker, is shot and wounded by a sniper. Amō and Alexei are detained by the NAC while they attempt to investigate the incident. Brad takes the opportunity to meet Amō personally, and Amō immediately suspects that he is in league with German. Meanwhile, it is revealed that German was responsible for the shooting, and he begins planting false rumors that the NJCO was responsible, giving Spears the pretext he needs to mobilize his troops again. Sofia voices her concerns about Brad's plans to Raymond, who agrees to help her investigate. The NAC attempts to invade the Asian territory, but are repelled thanks to Gashin intervening with an upgraded Jogan. Brad then meets with Amō and Alexei again, warning them that having been handed a humiliating defeat at the hands of the NCJO, the NAC will likely detain them indefinitely as hostages. However, Brad leaves behind security cards to allow the pair to escape.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With NAC forces in pursuit of them, Amō and Alexei flee into the wilderness as they try to reach the safety of New Japan. Meanwhile Yatagarasu sends a rescue force consisting of Masaki and Dahlia to make contact with them until Shion is ready to deploy in Reiki. NAC forces soon surround Amō and Alexei, but Shion, Masaki, and Dahlia arrive just in time to distract the NAC forces. As Alexei is evacuated from the area, Amō begins to board Kenbu, but Masaki is killed protecting Dahlia from enemy fire. Angered by the death of their comrade, Amō and Shio rout the remaining NAC forces and they retreat. While the mission is a failure, Spears points out that with the escape of NCJO delegation and the battle that took place, the NAC has more than enough justification to stage an invasion of New Japan. Brad looks forward to the battle, eager to test his newly finished Brady Ghost AMAIM. Back in New Japan, everybody in Yatagarasu is despondent at the loss of Masaki.\n| LineColor           = A62633\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Amō and Alexei return to New Japan, and the NCJO immediately begins their plans to defend against the NAC's inevitable assault. However, the odds are heavily against them due to the NAC's superior numbers and more advanced tactical AIs, so Maki begins work on upgrading the NCJO's tactical AIs. Meanwhile, Dialo and his men leave New Japan to hunt down German, but their initial attempt fails and German manages to elude them. The NAC's Command in Chief Freeman arrives in Japan to lead the NAC offensive, while Public Security warns Sofia to stop investigating Brad, as she risks blowing the cover of their own investigation. Public Security also captures men associated with Brad and German. Back in New Japan, Amō, Gashin, and Shion decide to spend the day visiting a nearby shrine so they can have an opportunity to relax before the battle.
