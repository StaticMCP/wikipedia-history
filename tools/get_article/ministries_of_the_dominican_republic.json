The change was effective on February 6, 2010, by Decree no. 55–10.\nThe history of these offices can be traced to the first Constitution of the Dominican Republic, signed at San Cristóbal, on November 6, 1844. The first four institutions, known as Secretaries of State, were: Justice and Public Instruction; the Interior and Police; Finance and Commerce; and War and Navy. As of February, 2023, the Dominican Republic has a total of 24 Ministries, including the General Attorney's Office.\nMinistries are analogous to Departments and Secretaries of State in others nations.\nCouncil of Ministers\nThe heads of the ministries, known as Ministers of their respective department, form the traditional Cabinet of the Dominican Republic, an executive organ that serves at the disposal of the president for the coordination of the government affairs and normally act as an advisory body to the presidency.\nOut of the 24 Ministries, only 3 are women, as of February 2023.\nCurrent Ministries\nAs of February, 2023, the Dominican Republic has a total of 24 Ministries, the latest being the Ministry of Housing and Constructions, established on 2021.
