It's situated at the western edge of the Cascade Range on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Green Mountain is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Its nearest neighbor is Mount Teneriffe,  to the southwest, and the nearest higher peak is Moolock Mountain,  to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from Green Mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River.\nClimate\nGreen Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger.\nGeology\nThe history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving  deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys is a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Cascade Range.\nSee also\n* Geology of the Pacific Northwest\n* Geography of Washington (state)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather forecast:[https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lon=-121.673602&lat=47.517633#.XZ-izX9lBLO National Weather Service]\n* Localized weather: [https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Teneriffe/forecasts/1459 Mountain Forecast]\n* Green Mountain: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrJnlG9WtkA YouTube]"
