On the first day, there were 23 students under teacher Miss Mary Frawley. On 1 January 1909, it became Helidon Scrub State School. As there was no space for a playground, in 1914 it was proposed that the school be relocated to a new site. On 6 March 1916, a new school building was built on a new site with the old school building to be the Iredale School of Arts. Eight of the original students attended the school's 50th anniversary in June 1944. Circa 1944, it was renamed Iredale State School (a name had been used informally for many years). It closed in 1975.
