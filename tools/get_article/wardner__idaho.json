Located in the Silver Valley mining region, the population was 188 at the 2010 census, down from 215 in 2000.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\nHistory\nThe city was named for Joe or Jim Wardner, an early promoter of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mine in the 1880s and a seller of corner lots in the city. Born in Wisconsin in 1846, he held various occupations in Arizona, California, Utah, Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Washington state. After his time in the Silver Valley of Idaho, he followed the mining booms to South Africa, British Columbia, and the Klondike; he published his autobiography in 1900 and died in El Paso, Texas in 1905.\nIn 1892, and again in 1899, angry union miners converged on the Bunker Hill mine during confrontations with mine owners.\nHard rock miners in Shoshone County protested wage cuts with a strike in 1892. After several lost their lives in a shooting war provoked by discovery of a company spy, the U.S. army forced an end to the strike. Hostilities erupted once again in 1899 when, in response to the company firing seventeen men for joining the union, the miners dynamited the Bunker Hill & Sullivan mill. Again, lives were lost, and the army intervened.\nThe gondola for the Silver Mountain ski resort passes over the town.\nDemographics\n|2020= 192\n|2020n=\n|estyear= 2024\n|estimate= 204\n|estref=\n}}\n2010 census\nAt the 2010 census there were 188 people in 75 households, including 60 families, in the city.
