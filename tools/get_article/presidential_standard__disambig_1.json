The standard recalls the colors of the flag of Italy, with particular reference to the standard of the historic Italian Republic of 1802–1805; the square shape and the savoy blue border, whose use was maintained even in the Republican era, symbolize the Italian Armed Forces, which are commanded by the president. Blue in heraldry also metaphorically symbolizes command.]]\nThe presidential standard or presidential flag is the flag that is used in many countries as a symbol of the head of state or president. In some countries it may be for exclusive use of the president or only raised where the president is present. An equivalent in a monarchy is a royal standard, and in an empire, an imperial standard.\nList\nCurrent Presidential standards\n*Presidential standard of Abkhazia\n*Presidential standard of
