In electorates with 3 or more candidates, preferences were not distributed if a candidate received more than 50% of the primary vote.\nIf none received more than 50%, all except the top two candidates were eliminated from the count and their preferences distributed between the two leaders, with the one receiving the most votes declared the winner.\nResults by electoral district\nAlbert\nAubigny\nBalonne\nBarcoo\nBowen\nBremer\nBrisbane\nBulimba\nBundaberg\nBuranda\nBurke\nBurnett\nBurrum\nCairns\nCarnarvon\nCharters Towers\nChillagoe\nCook\nCooroora\nCunningham\nDalby\nDrayton\nEacham\nEast Toowoomba\nEnoggera\nFassifern\nBy-election\n* Caused by the resignation of Arnold Wienholt\nFitzroy\nFlinders\nFortitude Valley\nGregory\nGympie\nHerbert\nIpswich\nIthaca\nKennedy\nKeppel\nKurilpa\nLeichhardt\nLockyer\nLogan\nMackay\nMaranoa\nMaree\nMaryborough\nBy-election\n* Election was voided by the Court of Disputed Returns.\n* This by-election was held on 12 October 1912.\nMerthyr\nMirani\nMitchell\nMount Morgan\nMundingburra\nMurilla\nMurrumba\nMusgrave\nNanango\nNormanby\nBy-election\n* This by-election was caused by the death of George Fox.\n* It was held on 5 March 1914.\nNundah\nOxley\nPaddington\nPittsworth\nPort Curtis\nBy-election\n* This result was overturned by the Court of Disputed Returns and a by-election was held on 26 October 1912.\nQueenton\nRockhampton\nRosewood\nSouth Brisbane\nStanley\nToombul\nToowong\nToowoomba\nTownsville\nWarrego\nWarwick\nWide Bay\nWindsor\nSee also\n* 1912 Queensland state election\n* Candidates of the Queensland state election, 1912\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1912-1915\nReferences"
