His father, a banker, had to sell Powis House in 1827 on collapse of the Stirling Banking Company. He received his training in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.\nIn 1837, he married Eveline Marie Mitchell (16 April 1821 – 1906), daughter of Colonel Charles Collier Michell, RA, surveyor general of Cape of Good Hope, in Cape Town on 25 October 1837.\nIn 1853, he obtained Westerton House in Bridge of Allan, built in 1803 by Dr John Henderson of the East India Company (a cousin and friend). Here he became an elder of Logie Kirk, walking there each Sunday.\nHe died in Ryde on the Isle of Wight but is buried in Old Logie Churchyard just east of his home town of Stirling. The graveyard lies several hundred metres north of Logie Cemetery and the 19th century Logie Kirk.\nAfter his death, his trustees sold Westerton House to Edmund Pullar.\nMilitary career\nIn 1820, he joined the British East India Company's army, transferring into the British Army in 1825. As aide-de-camp to the British envoy to Persia, he witnessed fighting during the war between Persia and Russia in 1826 and in 1829 was present in the Balkans during the Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829.\nFrom 1832 to 1834, he witnessed the War of the Two Brothers in Portugal, and in 1835 he took part in the 6th Cape Frontier War in South Africa as aide-de-camp and private secretary to Sir Benjamin d'Urban.\nIn 1838, he was made a Knight Bachelor for his services. From 1841, he served in Canada, among others in the staff of Sir William Rowan. During the Crimean War, he commanded the 14th (Buckinghamshire) Regiment of Foot as lieutenant-colonel in the Siege of Sevastopol in 1855 and held an important command during the New Zealand Wars, from 1860 to 1862. Alexander published two books based on his experiences in New Zealand. He retired from active service in 1877 and on 1 July 1881 was given the honorary rank of general.\nExplorer\nOn behalf of the Royal Geographical Society (which he had co-founded), he conducted an exploring expedition into Namaqualand and Damaraland, lasting from 8 September 1836 to 21 September 1837, in the course of which he collected rock specimens, pelts of rare animals, bird skins, weapons and implements from the Herero and Nama, as well as drawing maps of the region and making a first list of Herero words.\nSubsequently, John Arrowsmith (cartographer) made use of his data to draw a map accompanying his book of the expedition. Alexander Bay on the Orange River mouth, is named after him.\nIn 1877, he was largely responsible for the preservation and transfer of Cleopatra's Needle to England.\nFile:General Sir James Edward Alexander c.1880.png|General Sir James Edward Alexander c.1880\nFile:The grave of General Sir James Edward Alexander, Old Logie Kirkyard.jpg|The grave of General Sir James Edward Alexander, Old Logie Kirkyard\nFile:MA I173830 TePapa Colonel-Sir-J-E-Alexander full.jpg|Colonel Sir J.
