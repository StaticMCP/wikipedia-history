He was a right-handed batsman and a leg-break bowler, and occasional wicket-keeper. He was born and died in Durban.\nSteward began playing Second XI cricket for Essex during the 1962 season, scoring a duck on his debut for the team, before making fourteen further appearances for the team before the end of the year. While he spent the following year still as a part of the Second XI, it was his consistent performances this season which brought him up to the first-team squad, for whom he made his debut first-class appearance in 1964, playing a single University Match prior to his first appearance in the County Championship a month later.\nSteward batted well from the Essex lower order, frequently scoring in double-figures with tenacious partnership-building from more experienced members of the team, and making nine County Championship appearances before the season came to a close.\nSteward's second and final season of first-class cricket in England came the following year, but Essex underperformed, finishing third-bottom in the 1965 County Championship table. Steward found himself out of the team and moving back to South Africa at the end of the season.\nSteward made a return to cricket during the 1967–68 season, playing three games for Natal B in the Currie Cup. Nearly a decade later, he made two further appearances for South African Country Districts in miscellaneous matches.\nExternal links\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Players/5/5311/5311.html Tony Steward] at Cricket Archive"
