In several articles and letters, written in 1931–1935, he spoke about the Universal Day of Culture. In his \"Greetings to the Bruges conference in 1931\" Roerich defined the Universal Day of Culture as a day which \"shall be consecrated to the full appreciation of all national and universal treasures of culture\". According to Roerich, the celebrations had to take place in all schools and educational institutions. In 1933, in his \"Prayer for Peace and Culture\" Roerich includes also the churches into this list and specifies that on this day \"the world will be reminded of the true treasures of humanity, of creative heroic enthusiasm, of improvement and enhancement of life.\" On April 15, 1935, when the Roerich Pact was signed in Washington, Roerich mentioned this date as \"memorable day\" and \"significant date\", which later led to consideration of April 15 as the Universal Day of Culture.\nInternational movement\nThe International Movement for the affirmation of April 15 as Universal Day of Culture (IMAUDC) was established in December 2008 by NGOs from Cuba, Italy, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia and Spain. As of 2014, 40 organizations from 14 countries and 25000 individuals participate in the Movement.\nLithuania\nLithuania is the first country in which the Universal Day of Culture is celebrated on government level since 2006. On November 24, 2007 the 26th session of the Baltic Assembly adopted a Resolution, initiated by Lithuania, in which the Assembly proposed to the governments of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to proclaim April 15 as Day of Culture of the Baltic states. At the celebrations in 2009 the minister of defense of Lithuania Rasa Juknevičienė, the minister of culture Remigijus Vilkaitis, ambassador of Day of Culture at Council of the Commission about the Culture of the Union of the Baltic Cities Aukse Narvilene appeared with salutatory addresses. In her address to the Banner of Peace hoisting ceremony to mark the Universal Day of Culture in 2011 the Speaker of Seimas of Lithuania Mrs. Irena Degutienė said that this is a day, on which \"people are exchanging ideas on the fundamental values, raising and addressing fundamental questions, and the word \"culture\" is uttered more often than usual.\" She specified culture \"not only as the artistic and creative heritage passed on from generation to generation, but also as our level of communication, capacity of building bridges of tolerance, and the level of trust in others who have different views and profess different faith.\"\nIn 2012, during Universal Day of Culture celebrations, three Lithuanian towns - Dubingiai, Rietavas and Ylakiai - were proclaimed as towns of peace, where priority of culture is implemented in all aspects of public life.\nRussia\nIn Russia the Universal Day of Culture is supported by numerous institutions and organizations, including the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography, the Moscow State University of Culture and Arts, The Nicholas Roerich Estate Museum in Izvara, The Union of Artists of Russia, local branches of the International League for the Protection of Culture, etc. Celebrations are held annually in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Irkutsk and Berezniki.

The members of the Russian Duma Elena Drapeko and Nikolay Rastorguyev, and the cosmonaut Aleksandr Balandin are among them. The Association of Space Explorers in Russia also supported the Universal Day of Culture.\nBrazil\nIn Brazil the celebrations are organized annually by Brazilian Roerich Institute, which was established in 1999.
