It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white flowers and ribbed, cylindrical to cup-shaped fruit.\nDescription\nEucalyptus stowardii is a mallee that typically grows to a height of  and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull bluish green, egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are  long and  wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped,  long and  wide, tapering at the base to a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils, usually in groups of seven on a thin, unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds on pedicels  long. Mature buds are a blunt, elongated oval shape,  long and  wide and finely ribbed with a rounded operculum about the same length as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between June and November and the flowers are creamy white.\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus stowardii was first formally described in 1917 by Joseph Maiden in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales from specimens collected near Kellerberrin by Frederick Stoward. The specific epithet honours the collector of the type specimens.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe fluted-horn mallee is found on stony rises, limestone hills and road verges between Dowerin, Carnamah and Wubin in the central northern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, where it grows in open shrubland in gravelly sand-loam soils.\nConservation status\nThis mallee is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.\nSee also\n*List of Eucalyptus species\nReferences"
