The flag sported the Pan-Iranian colors of red, white and green, as a nod to the republic's Persian-descended culture. The flag was adopted on March 20, 1953 by decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik SSR:\n}}\nThe red represents the unity of the republic and the aspect of workers' revolution, white symbolized cotton production, the basis of Tajik agriculture, and the green was for other agricultural produce.\nAfter 1953, the flag received a unique reverse side. The reverse side of the flag was the same as the obverse with the exception of it lacking the yellow hammer and sickle. In 1991, after Tajikistan became an independent country, this flag was used until a new flag was created and adopted in 1992.\nHistorical flags\nThe first specifically Tajik flag was introduced in 1929. Before that, Tajikistan had been part of the Bukharan SSR (partly transferred to the Turkestan SSR in 1924); before the Russian revolution it had been part of the Emirate of Bukhara (since 1873 a protectorate of the Russian Empire).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ||23 February 1929 – April 1929 || First flag of the Tajik ASSR|| Adopted on 23 February 1929, with the coat of arms in the top-left corner.\n|-\n| || April 1929 – 24 February 1931||Flag of the Tajik ASSR ||\n|-\n| || 24 February 1931 – 04.07.1935||Flag of the Tajik SSR||Latin script (ç.i.ş.toç)\n|-\n| || 04.07.1935 – 26 May 1936||Flag of the Tajik SSR||Latin script (ÇSS Tocikiston)\n|-\n| || 26 September 1936 – 1938||Flag of the Tajik SSR|| Latin (ÇSS Tocikiston) and Cyrillic script, with hammer and sickle\n|-\n| || 1938 – 28 September 1940||Flag of the Tajik SSR||Latin (RSS Tocikiston) and Cyrillic script\n|-\n| || 28 September 1940 – 1953|| Flag of the Tajik SSR ||Cyrillic script only, in Tajik (РСС Тоҷикистон) and Russian (Таджикская ССР).\n|-\n| ||20 April 1953 – 24 November 1992 ||Flag of the Tajik SSR||A red banner with a large white and small green stripe in the middle (below the gold hammer and sickle).
