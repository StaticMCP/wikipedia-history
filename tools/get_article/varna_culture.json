The oldest golden artifacts in the world (4600 BC – 4200 BC) were found in the Necropolis of Varna. These artefacts are on display in the Varna Archaeological Museum.\nThe site was accidentally discovered in October 1972 by excavator operator Raycho Marinov. Research excavation was under the direction of Mihail Lazarov and Ivan Ivanov. About 30% of the estimated necropolis area is still not excavated.\nThe Varna culture is characterized by polychrome pottery and rich cemeteries, the most famous of which are Varna Necropolis, the eponymous site, and the Durankulak lake complex, which comprises the largest prehistoric cemetery in southeastern Europe, with an adjoining coeval Neolithic settlement (published) and an unpublished and incompletely excavated Chalcolithic settlement. 294 graves have been found in the Varna necropolis, many containing sophisticated examples of the oldest gold metallurgy in the world, copper metallurgy, pottery (about 600 pieces, including gold-painted ones), high-quality flint and obsidian blades, beads, and shells.\nThe oldest gold jewelry in the world found in the necropolis is dated 4,600 BC to 4,200 BC.\nThe findings showed that the Varna culture had trade relations with distant lands, possibly including the lower Volga region and the Cyclades, perhaps exporting metal goods and salt from the Solnitsata rock salt mine. The copper ore used in Varna artifacts originated from the Sredna Gora mine near Stara Zagora, and Mediterranean spondylus shells found in the graves may have served as primitive currency.\nAn analysis of wear traces on carnelian and agate beads crafted by the Varna culture found evidence for the use of \"some sort of fast or lap wheel\" in their production.\nBurial rites\nGraves of the Varna Necropolis contained the oldest known examples of gold working in the world. Burials included both crouched and extended inhumations. Some graves did not contain a skeleton, only grave gifts. These symbolic (empty) graves are the richest in gold artifacts. 3,000 gold artifacts were found altogether, with a weight of approximately 6 kilograms. Three symbolic graves also contained masks of unfired clay.\n}}\nMetaphysical beliefs\nThe Varna culture believed in the afterlife and developed hierarchical status differences. It has the oldest known burial evidence of an elite male (Grave 43). Some authors have described the Varna elite males as 'kings'. The end of the fifth millennium BC is the time that Marija Gimbutas, founder of the Kurgan hypothesis claims the cultural descent into male dominance began in Europe. The high status male was buried with remarkable amounts of gold, held a war axe or mace and wore a gold penis sheath or possibly a decorative (gold) belt tip. The bull-shaped gold platelets perhaps also venerated virility, instinctive force, warfare and a proto-castle cult.\nGenetics\nThe elite male from Grave 43 (c. 4495 BC) belonged to the paternal (Y-DNA) haplogroup T-M184 and the maternal (mtDNA) haplogroup U2. Other male samples from the Varna necropolis belonged to the Y-DNA haplogroups I2a1, I2a2, G2a, T1a, E1b1b and R1b-V88.\nGallery\nFile:Burial with gold treasure, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm25.jpg\nFile:Burial with gold treasure, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm26.jpg\nFile:Gold treasure, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm24.jpg\nFile:Grave Offerings from Grave 4 (Varna Archaeology Museum) (35921851754).jpg\nFile:Bull pendants from Grave 36 (Varna Necropolis) (36756066545).jpg\nFile:Golden amulet, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm22.jpg\nFile:Grave 43 (Varna Archaeology Museum) (36755886415).jpg\nFile:Varna1.png\nFile:Insignias of power, gold, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm28.jpg\nFile:Face and funeral golden jewelry, 4600-4200 BC, AM Varna, Varm21.jpg\nFile:Grave offerings (Varna Necropolis) (35947337093).jpg\nFile:08 ENEOLIT-Ceramik.tif|Eneolithic ceramic vessels from the Golemja Ostrov Tell near Durankulak (RIM-Dobrich)\nFile:Vessel, pottery, 4500-4000 BC, AM Varna, Varm12.jpg|Ceramic vessel from the necropolis at Durankulak, late Chalcolithic, Varna culture\nFile:Small furniture and utensils, terracottas, 5000-3000 BC, AM Varna, Varm04.jpg\nFile:Durankulak-Golemija ostrov.JPG|Durankulak.
