One of the aspects of the accord (Article IX) called for a plebiscite to be held within the year in order to resolve any problems with the Greek Constitution. This plebiscite would help establish elections and thus create a constituent assembly that would draft a new organic law. In another aspect of the treaty, both signatories agreed to have the Allies deploy overseers within the country, who would ensure the legitimacy of the elections. The accord also promised that members of the EAM-ELAS would be permitted to participate in political activities if they surrendered their weapons. Moreover, all civil and political liberties would be guaranteed along with the undertaking by the Greek government towards establishing a nonpolitical national army.\nDisarmament\nThe treaty specified the disarmament of EAM-ELAS, which, according to records, surrendered within the next few days or weeks 100 artillery pieces of various types, 81 heavy mortars, 138 light mortars, 419 machine guns, 1,412 submachine guns, 713 automatic rifles, 48,973 rifles and pistols, 57 antitank rifles and 17 radios.\nHowever, the real numbers were higher, as receipts for weapons were sometimes refused. Panagiotis Koumoukelis relates in 'All That Grief' that he refused a receipt for his gun and that since he could not produce his receipt, he was tortured by members of the Security Battalions.\nAftermath\nUltimately, the promises enshrined in the Treaty of Varkiza were not upheld. The main problem was that the treaty gave amnesty only for political reasons, but many of the actions by communists during the Dekemvriana were viewed as nonpolitical. After the signing of the treaty, there was widespread persecution of communists and former EAM members and supporters over the next two years. This period, immediately prior to the outbreak of the Greek Civil War, was known as the White Terror.\nThe Communist Party of Greece remained legal during the Greek Civil War until 27 December 1947.\nNegotiators\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center|Greek Government\n|-\n!Name\n!Portfolio\n|-\n| Ioannis Sofianopoulos\n| Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)\n|-\n| Periklis Rallis\n| Ministry of the Interior (Greece)\n|-\n| Pafsanias Katsotas\n| Military Advisor of the Greek Government\n|-\n|colspan=2 align=center|Left-wing forces\n|-\n!Name\n!Portfolio\n|-\n| Georgios Siantos\n| General Secretary of the Communist Party of Greece\n|-\n| Ilias Tsirimokos\n| General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Greece\n|-\n| Dimitrios Partsalidis\n| Secretary of the Central Committee of EAM\n|-\n| Stefanos Sarafis\n| Military Advisor of EAM\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nSources\n*Xydis, Stephen G. \"Greece and the Yalta Declaration.\" American Slavic and East European Review.
