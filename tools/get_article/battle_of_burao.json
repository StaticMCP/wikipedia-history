Seeking autonomy for the northern regions, the SNM initiated a series of offensives against government forces.\nThe Battle\nOn 27 May 1988, SNM forces, led by Col. Ahmed Mire Mohamed, commenced an assault on Burao. The attack was notable for its surprise element, with SNM fighters infiltrating the city under the cover of darkness. The operation began with evening prayers at Baliga Samatar Ahmed, where Col. Ahmed Mire addressed his troops, emphasizing the significance of their mission.\nThe SNM fighters, including both men and women, advanced from Baliga Samatar Ahmed towards Burao. Despite encountering initial resistance from government forces, they managed to penetrate the city's defenses. The surprise and determination of the SNM forces led to the swift capture of key installations within the city.\nAftermath\nThe capture of Burao by SNM forces was a significant milestone in the Somaliland War of Independence, It demonstrated the capability and resolve of the SNM to challenge the Somali government's authority in the northern regions. However, the battle also resulted in substantial destruction and civilian displacement, as government forces launched counter-offensives to retake the city. The events in Burao, along with similar attacks in other northern cities, intensified the conflict and galvanized support for the SNM's cause.\nLegacy\nThe Battle of Burao is remembered as a turning point in the struggle for Somaliland's independence, It highlighted the effectiveness of the SNM's guerrilla tactics and their ability to mobilize local support. The battle also exposed the vulnerabilities of the Somali government's military apparatus in the northern regions. The events of 27 May 1988 are commemorated annually in Somaliland as a symbol of resistance and the quest for self-determination.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.oodweynemedia.com/2024/05/27/27-may-1988-gudo-galkii-snm-uu-hogaaminayey-mujaahid-axmed-mire-ee-magaalada-burco/ 27 May 1988: Gudo-galkii SNM Uu Hogaaminayey Mujaahid Axmed Mire Ee Magaalada Burco]\n* [https://www.araweelonews.com/warar/axmed-siilaanyo-waaysigii-uu-kaga-hadlay-halyeeyadii-snm-ee-magaalada-burco-galay-27-may-1988/ Axmed Siilaanyo: Waraysigii Uu Kaga Hadlay Halyeeyadii SNM Ee Magaalada Burco Galay 27 May 1988]"
