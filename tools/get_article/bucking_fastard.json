The title, Bucking Fastard, refers to a synchronized verbal slip the sisters made in court.\nIn February 2025, it was announced that Herzog would make a film under the same name based on a true story about twins Joan and Jean, with real-life siblings Kate and Rooney Mara on board to star. It would be the sisters' first project together. Speaking about working with her sister for the first time, Kate said: \"We’ve been looking for something to do together for a while. The first hurdle was finding a filmmaker that we both like, and while we like a lot of the same things, we both had an equal excitement about working with Werner. We’re playing total equals who speak in unison and do everything the same. They dream the same in the film, and they’re so in sync. We could have never imagined finding two roles in a film where we’re literally equals in so many ways, and it was just so perfect.\"\nPrincipal photography took place at Dublin's Pigeon House film studios and in and around the town of Naas; the Mara sisters were spotted during shooting on Dublin's Capel Street in early April, with additional scenes set to be filmed in Slovenia. Filming wrapped by the end of the month, with Orlando Bloom and Domhnall Gleeson being revealed as part of the cast. Herzog reunited with various collaborators, including cinematographer Peter Zeitlinger, editor Marco Capalbo, and composer Ernst Reijseger.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
