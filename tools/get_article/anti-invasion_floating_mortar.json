The walls of the mortar were  thick, protecting it against potential enemy gunfire of that period. At the front of the boat was a hollow brass cap shaped like a ram that was 9 feet thick. Inside the ram was a case filled with a heavy charge of explosive powder. With only the funnel and a domed structure covering the pilot being visible above water, the mortar sought to attack enemy ships by ramming the hull with the explosive-filled ram at speeds of over . Because of potential dangers associated with its means of attack, the Anti-Invasion Floating Mortar was never built.\nSee also\n*Spar torpedo\n*\n*Monitor (warship)\nReferences"
