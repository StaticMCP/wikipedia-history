A total of 30 entries took part in the competition across five heats. Each heat consisted of six songs, with the top two songs directly qualifying for the final. Unlike in the previous edition, only the third-placing song proceeded to a final qualification round at the end of the fifth heat, which featured five songs instead of ten. The top two songs in the final qualification then progressed to the final, which comprised 12 songs. The winner of the final was determined by a 50/50 combination of votes from the public and an international jury.\nOn 26 November 2024, it was announced that Zelmerlöw would participate in Melodifestivalen 2025 with the song \"Revolution\". The song, which participated in the fourth round on 22 February 2025, went directly to the final.
