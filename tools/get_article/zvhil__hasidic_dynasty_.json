He was also the grandson of Rabbi Yitzchok of Drubitsh and Rabbi Aharon of Karlin. As in several inter-related Hasidic dynasties, family tradition held that Rabbi Moshe was a descendant of King David.\nRabbi Moshe died in 1831 and was succeeded by his son Rabbi Yechiel Michl Goldman of Zvhil. The last rebbe to reside in Zvhil was Grand Rabbi Yaakov Yisroel Korff.  Rabbi Yaakov Yisroel was also the Tsar-appointed Chief Rabbi of Russia.\nThe town of Zvhil () is located in Volhynia, in present-day Ukraine. Today it is known as Zviahel. The Jewish version of the name, Zvhil, instead of Zvyahel can be attributed to the similarity between Zvhil and Zvul (one of the holy names for the ancient Jewish Temple in Hebrew, pronounced 'Zvil' by Ukrainian Jews).\nLineage\n*Rabbi Isaac of Drubitsh (d. 1752)\n**Rabbi Yechiel Michl, the Maggid of Zlotshev (1726-1781), son of Rabbi Isaac.
