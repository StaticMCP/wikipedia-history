Here is a listing of such, grouped in various useful ways.\nAcoustic models and speech corpus (compilation)\nThe following list presents notable speech recognition software engines with a brief synopsis of characteristics.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 8 Pro allow you to change the system language, and therefore change which speech engine is available. Windows Speech Recognition evolved into Cortana (software), a personal assistant included in Windows 10.\nWindows 7, 8, 10, 11 third-party speech recognition\n* Braina – Dictate into third party software and websites, fill web forms and execute vocal commands.\n* Dragon NaturallySpeaking from Nuance Communications – Successor to the older DragonDictate product. Focus on dictation. 64-bit Windows support since version 10.1.\n* Tazti – Create speech command profiles to play PC games and control applications – programs. Create speech commands to open files, folders, webpages, applications. Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 versions.\n* Voice Finger – software that improves the Windows speech recognition system by adding several extensions to it. The software enables controlling the mouse and the keyboard by only using the voice. It is especially useful for aiding users to overcome disabilities or to heal from computer injuries.\nMicrosoft Speech API\nThe first version of the Microsoft Speech API was released for Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 in 1995, it was then part of Windows up to Windows Vista. This initial version already contained Direct Speech Recognition and Direct Text To Speech APIs which applications could use to directly control engines, as well as simplified 'higher-level' Voice Command and Voice Talk APIs. Speech recognition functionality included as part of Microsoft Office and on Tablet PCs running Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. It can also be downloaded as part of the Speech SDK 5.1 for Windows applications, but since that is aimed at developers building speech applications, the pure SDK form lacks any user interface (numerous applications were available), and thus is unsuitable for end users.\nBuilt-in software\n*Microsoft Kinect includes built-in software which allows speech recognition of commands.\n*Older generations of Nokia phones like Nokia N Series (before using Windows 7 mobile technology) used speech-recognition with family names from contact list and a few commands.\n*Siri, originally implemented in the iPhone 4S, Apple's personal assistant for iOS, which uses technology from Nuance Communications.\n*Cortana (software), Microsoft's personal assistant built into Windows Phone and Windows 10.\nInteractive voice response\nThe following are interactive voice response (IVR) systems:\n* CSLU Toolkit\n* Genesys\n* HTK – copyrighted by Microsoft, but allows altering software for licensee's internal use\n* LumenVox ASR\n* Tellme Networks; acquired by Microsoft\nUnix-like x86 and x86-64 speech transcription software\n* Janus Recognition Toolkit (JRTk)\n*Mozilla DeepSpeech was developing an open-source Speech-To-Text engine based on Baidu's deep speech research paper.\n*Weesper Neon Flow – professional voice-dictation software that provides offline speech-to-text processing on macOS and Windows using local AI models. It is not open source and offers a paid subscription after a 15‑day free trial.\nDiscontinued software\n* IBM VoiceType (formerly IBM Personal Dictation System)\n* IBM ViaVoice – Embedded version still maintained by IBM. No longer supported for versions above Windows Vista. Untested above macOS 10.4 or on Macintoshes with an Intel chipset.\n* Quack.com; acquired by AOL; the name has now been reused for an iPad search app.\n* SpeechWorks from Nuance Communications.\n* Yap Speech Cloud – Speech-to-text platform acquired by Amazon.com.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences"
