According to humanitarian groups and media, such incidents have occurred both in southern Israel, where families were killed by Hamas-led militants during the 7 October 2023 attacks, and in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes and shelling have destroyed family homes. Some scholars and observers have described these patterns as targeting of family units, coining terms such as \"kinocide\".

Israel has stated that its strikes target militants and military infrastructure, and that Hamas operates from within civilian areas, placing responsibility for civilian casualties on the group.\nAcademic researchers have described the phenomenon of entire families being killed as unprecedented in scale. The killing of families across generations by Israel was highlighted specifically in South Africa's International Court of Justice filing accusing Israel of genocide.\nThe abduction and killing of families in southern Israel have been described as war crimes. The UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel reported that deliberate attacks on civilians, including the killing of families in Kfar Aza, Nir Oz, and Be’eri, violated international humanitarian law. A study published by Israeli legal scholars referred to the systematic erasure of kinship groups as “kinocide.”\nSee also\n* Casualties of the Gaza war\n* Kfar Aza massacre\n* Kidnapping and killing of the Bibas family\n* Nir Oz attack\n* Salem family airstrikes (December 2023)\nReferences"
