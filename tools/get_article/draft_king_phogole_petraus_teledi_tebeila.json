He was an African British soldier who served in the first world war from 1914 untill second world war in 1945. His military involvement has been a breakthrough of British South Africa Company 's Political landscape and one step towards unity to the Republic of Transvaal , Natal , Gazankulu and Bophuthatswana. King Teledi who is famously known by his glen praise name Phogole was the right blood to the royal throne of Thebeeile tribe (Tebeila), meaning the dove we have exalted or venerated has flown away), but how ever he decided to join military service after the broke of the first world in 1914. Teledi was awarded South African War Medal Service and British Royal Navy Service Award by King George VI (Queen Elizabeth 's father) for his bravery in the military service. His choice to join military,eventually dragged the attention of the British Monarch and the German Colonial rule of the Union of the Republic of South Africa, because it was puzzling for a king to leave tribal throne to join military. His tribal intolerant clushes forced him to stop focusing on tribal matters to join war. However his father 's chieftainship was compromised and complicated at the time of his death in 1945 at the military camp at British Colony. After his death there was great division of the Kingdom of Thebeeile which nearly wanted to ignite a contagious civil war which was not gonna be prevented for longer, because he was the last string to hold together his amalgamated empire. Some celebrated his death, while others were deeply mourning for him because there were those who felt  like he abandoned the tribe and divided it. As  tribal and racial violence rose seriously in the early 1950 around his pwople, five years after his death it was too late to manage the fire outbreak because others saw it as an opportunity to permanently divide his empire and to celebrate his throne fall. Petraus 's nomadism cost his glen because he never had time to rule and manage his people. After his birth her mother hidd her inside the Baobab tree to be protected as an infant due to Natal clushes between the black and the white people, this was done so because Phogole was carrying the royal blood. As a results much of Petraus 's childhood was spent at his uncle's place usually because African  Tradition doesn't allow a future King to grow among ordinary village boys and girls. However it never discouraged Teledi to lone for her mother as naturally as he was born with tolerance. Even thou other boys grew up around the presence of their mothers, King Phogole was usually quite aware of the motive in which they are trying to protect him away from tribal killings He continued to cope to tribal wars because he was aware that one day he will squart his father 's throne. Teledi is a  biological grand-father to a well known popularly author Makate Meshack Tebeila\nReferences\nThe National Archives\nImperial War Museums\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC)"
