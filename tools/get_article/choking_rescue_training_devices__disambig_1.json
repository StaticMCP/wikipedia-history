They have been approved and used by the European Resuscitation Council, St John Ambulance, and International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The simulation devices are used to demonstrate choking rescue techniques such as abdominal thrusts and backslap method and practice choking rescue protocols by American Heart Association and Red Cross.\nDevices\nAnti-choking training vests\nThe Anti-Choking Trainer, developed by Act+Fast, LLC, is a light-weight neoprene vest that users wear to practice the abdominal thrust maneuver and backslap method.   There are two protocol models available: Act+Fast Red with a Back Slap Pad for the Red Cross Choking Rescue Protocol and Act+Fast Blue for the American Heart Association Protocol.\nChoking manikins\nChoking Charlie\nThe Choking Charlie manikin, developed by Laerdal Medical, is an adult torso specifically designed for training students in the performance of the Heimlich Maneuver and backslap method. Cast by a human specimen, Choking Charlie’s realistic anatomy and response-using simulated boluses provide instructors with a tool for instructing and practicing the anti-choking techniques.\nSimulaids\nSimulaids choking manikins are life-sized and are designed for choking training in specific individuals. The manikins are in infant, child and adult sizes and are also modelled in different body types such as obese choking manikin. The manikins are designed anatomically accurate internally as well allowing for choking boluses to be inserted for providing visual feedback upon performing anti-choking techniques.\nOperations\nThe simulation device is designed so when the trainee does the Heimlich maneuver correctly a foam plug, simulating a foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO), is launched in the air.\nThe manikins are used for practicing the abdominal thrust maneuver, the back slap method and CPR. When the abdominal thrusts are performed correctly, the object simulating the FBAO is expelled from the manikin's airway. The manikins have anatomical landmarks including a ribcage, jugular notch, and xiphoid process to provide anatomical reference points for demonstrations.\nReception and real world use\nChoking rescue training devices have been used in first aid training in schools, rescue groups and fire departments.\nThe use of the devices in first aid training has been attributed to help save individuals choking in real world scenarios.\nReferences"
