This two-story wood-frame house was built in the 1830s by Edward Miller, a local veteran of the American Revolutionary War.  The house is a well-preserved Federal style structure, despite having experienced significant alterations c. 1912, when it was used as an inn, and in 1960, when it housed the offices of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Quincy, Massachusetts\nReferences"
