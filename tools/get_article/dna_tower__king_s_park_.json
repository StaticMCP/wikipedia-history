The person responsible for it being built was the park's director at the time, John Beard, who was also responsible for setting up the park's botanic gardens. The double-helix design was decided upon for pragmatic reasons, for the convenience it provided for people to climb and descend the staircase.\nIt is built on the highest point of Kings Park on Mount Eliza, and is a white  double helix staircase with 101 steps. It was inspired by a double staircase in the Château de Blois in France. Its design resembles the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule. The paving below the DNA Tower is made with stones sent from 11 towns and 80 shires in Western Australia.\nThe tower was briefly closed in 2021 due to corrosion but was refurbished and repainted in 2021.\nReferences"
