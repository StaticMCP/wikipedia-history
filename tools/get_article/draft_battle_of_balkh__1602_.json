Shah Abbas I sought to exploit this turmoil by invading the southern territories of the Amu Darya basin, then controlled by the Bukhara Khanate.\nIn April 1602, Abbas I marched with an army of about 120,000 men and 300 cannons toward Balkh, hoping to crush Baqi Muhammad Khan’s 80,000-strong force and to secure control over the region.\nThe battle\nDespite the Safavid army’s superior numbers and artillery, they failed to overcome the Bukharan forces. Fighting near Balkh in June 1602 resulted in heavy losses for the Safavids, forcing them to retreat. The Bukharan victory ensured that Shah Abbas was unable to secure Balkh or any lasting presence in the region.\nAccording to Persian chronicles, Abbas I continued operations in nearby cities such as Marv, Andkhud, and Sheberghan, but these campaigns achieved little success. In one account, the Shah’s army, while retreating, attempted a desperate river crossing, narrowly avoiding total destruction. The chronicles depict the defeat as a divine punishment for the Safavids and a humiliation before the Uzbeks.\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Balkh halted Safavid expansion into the north for several decades. The Bukhara Khanate, under Baqi Muhammad Khan, consolidated control over Transoxiana and preserved its independence from Persian influence.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nSee also\n* Persian–Uzbek Wars\n* Bukhara Khanate\n* Shah Abbas I\n* Baqi Muhammad Khan"
