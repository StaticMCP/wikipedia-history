The film nominations were announced live via YouTube on November 22, 2022 by Raúl Castillo and Taylour Paige, while the television nominations were announced on December 13, 2022 by Asia Kate Dillon.\nLike last year, the ceremony was separated from its previous longtime berth on the day before the Academy Awards. Instead, there were eight days separating the ceremonies, with the 95th Academy Awards taking place on March 12, 2023. This ceremony occurred during the middle of final Oscar voting, taking place between March 2 and March 7, meaning the winners of this year's Independent Spirit Awards may have had an impact on Oscar voters.\nFor the first time since 1997, the ceremony wasn't broadcast live on the American basic cable channel IFC but instead streamed live on IMDb's YouTube channel, as well as both Film Independent's YouTube channel and Twitter. American comedian Hasan Minhaj hosted the ceremony.\nThe A24 absurdist comedy drama Everything Everywhere All at Once won seven awards, including Best Feature, sweeping every category it was nominated for and winning the most awards for a single film in the history of the Independent Spirit Awards.\nChanges\nThis year, gender-neutral categories were introduced. The organization has switched the traditionally separated male and female lead and supporting categories for film and television, and instead combined them with ten nominations each in two new categories: Best Lead Performance and Best Supporting Performance. The same has become true for the television categories with Best Lead Performance in a New Scripted Series as well as the newly added award for Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series. Additionally, a retired film category was re-introduced: Best Breakthrough Performance; it was discontinued in 2005, but is limited to only five nominees. Film Independent has also increased the budget cap for eligible films to $30 million to account for the rising cost of production. Over the years, the budget cap has increased incrementally from $20 million in 2006 to $22.5 million in 2019. The budget cap for the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award, presented to a film's writer, director and producer, also increased from $500K to $1 million. In response to the continuing effects of COVID-19 on filmmakers and the industry, Film Independent once again waived the theatrical run typically required for eligibility, ensuring more opportunities for independent filmmakers to be recognized and celebrated.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n, Best Feature co-winners, and Best Director and Best Screenplay winners]]\n, Best Lead Performance winner]]\n, Best Supporting Performance winner]]\n, Best Breakthrough Performance winner]]\n, Robert Altman Award co-winner]]\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Feature\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\nEverything Everywhere All at Once\n* Bones and All\n* Our Father, the Devil\n* Tár\n* Women Talking\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert – Everything Everywhere All at Once'\n* Todd Field – Tár\n* Kogonada – After Yang\n* Sarah Polley – Women Talking\n* Halina Reijn – Bodies Bodies Bodies\n|-\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Lead Performance\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Supporting Performance\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'Michelle Yeoh – Everything Everywhere All at Once as Evelyn Wang'\n* Cate Blanchett – Tár as Lydia Tár\n* Dale Dickey – A Love Song as Faye\n* Mia Goth – Pearl as Pearl\n* Regina Hall – Honk for Jesus.
