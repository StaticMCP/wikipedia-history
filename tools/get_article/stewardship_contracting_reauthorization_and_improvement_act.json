The bill would have given the federal government more authority to enter into what are known as \"forest stewardship contracts\", with the goal of reducing the risk of forest wildfires.\nIn July 2013, Senator Flake warned the public that the legal authority for forest stewardship contracts would end by September 2013, and without extending the authority, Flake argued that the U.S. Forest Service would lose an important firefighting tool. The bill, which Flake introduced that month, would extend the legal authority for forest stewardship contracts until 2023.\nBackground\n}}\n, shown here.]]\n, Arizona, on June 28, 2013. Within two days, the fire killed 19 City of Prescott firefighters, members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. The wildfire was fully contained by July 10, 2013. The fire caused the highest wildland firefighter death toll in the United States since the 1933 Griffith Park Fire killed 29 firefighters, and the highest death toll from any U.S. wildfire since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire killed 25 people.The Stewardship Contracting Reauthorization and Improvement Act seeks to reduce the risk of wildfires in the United States.]]\nA forest stewardship contract is a type of contract between the U.S. Forest Service and other parties, such as forest industry companies and local government agencies. The contracts are centered around a specific piece of National Forest System land.\nThe contract can include an agreements on a number of forest projects. For example, a contract could give a company the right to conduct a limited amount of timber and forest restoration work.\nOther examples of projects that could be included in a stewardship contract are prescribed burning (for fire prevention), road maintenance, watershed or stream rehabilitation, and the sale of forest products off the same piece of land.\nWhen creating a forest stewardship contract, the Forest Service works with and takes input from several parties such as state and local governments, environmental conservation groups, Native American tribes, and fire safety councils.\nIf the contract allows forest products, such as timber, to be cut down and sold, the money from the sale is used to offset other activities spelled out in the contract.\nIn 2012, around 25 percent of all timber taken from National Forest System land was sold under a stewardship contract.\nArizona wildfires\nThe western United States, and Arizona in particular, suffers from a large number of wildfires every year. In an editorial published on April 25, 2014, The Arizona Republic newspaper wrote the following about wildfires in Arizona and other western states: \"Washington, D.C., has not yet intellectually grasped the fact that wildfires in the Western states are every bit as devastating to drought-stricken Arizona, New Mexico and other Western states as hurricanes are to the Gulf Coast and tornadoes are to the Midwest.\"\nIn May 2014, a wildfire prompted the evacuation of over 3,000 residents in Coconino County, Arizona. The fire burned thousands of acres between Flagstaff and Sedona. Over 960 firefighters, 15 \"hotshot\" crews, and three air tankers were required to fight the fire.\nMajor provisions\nExtension of stewardship program\nThe bill extends the stewardship program another ten years, until the year 2023.\nReserve funds for cancelled contracts\nDue to federal rules, the government usually must hold onto the money for a forest stewardship contract for as long as the contract goes on for. Some contracts last up to ten years. The bill would give the government flexibility in how long it holds onto the money, which would help the government cover the cost of canceled contracts.\nThe bill would allow the government to use any excess income from stewardship contracts to pay for canceled contracts. Currently, the government must pay for the canceled contract upfront in a lump sum. The bill would change that rule to allow payment in stages. According to the Senate committee report on the bill, this change is consistent with rules that the Department of Defense uses in its contracts.\nFire liability\nThe bill makes the fire liability provisions of the stewardship contracts equal to the fire liability provisions in timber contracts. Timber contracts have a ceiling on how much fire liability the contractor must carry, but stewardship contracts do not have a ceiling. According to the Senate committee report on the bill, the lack of a ceiling can make stewardship contracts uneconomical for companies bidding on them.\nLegislative history\nIn the late 1990s, Congress passed legislation that created a pilot program for stewardship contracts. In 2003, Congress expanded the stewardship program and authorized it to run until 2013.\nOn July 16, 2013, Senators Flake introduced the bill, along with four original cosponsors: Senators McCain, Crapo, Risch, and Heller. The Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining held a public hearing on the bill on July 30. On December 19, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources passed the bill by a voice vote.\nRelated bills\nThe Library of Congress has identified two other bills in Congress that are similar to S. 1300:\n* S. 816 - Stewardship End Result Contracting Project Act, introduced by Senator Mark Udall (D-CO)\n* S. 849 - Permanent Stewardship Contracting Authority Act of 2013, introduced by Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO)\nSee also\n* List of bills in the 113th United States Congress\n* Yarnell Hill Fire\n* Wallow Fire\n* List of California wildfires\n* List of Colorado wildfires\nGallery of Arizona wildfires\nFile:Arizona Bushfire Pyrocumulus.jpg|A photograph of a well-developed Pyrocumulus cloud produced by a bushfire in the Gila River valley southwest of Phoenix, Arizona.\nFile:20120625-FS-UNK- 0002 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|A DC-10 air tanker drops fire retardant on the Poco Wildfire in Tonto National Forest in Arizona on June 14, 2012.\nFile:20120625-FS-UNK- 0005 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|A fire burns through brush and trees at the Poco Wildfire in Tonto National Forest near Young, Arizona on June 21, 2012.\nFile:20120625-FS-UNK- 0001 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|Spot fires ahead of the main Poco Wildfire in the Tonto National Forest near Young, AZ on June 16, 2012.\nFile:20120625-FS-UNK- 0003 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|The Poco Wildfire jumps Fire Road 512 in the Tonto National Forest near Young, AZ on June 14, 2012.\nFile:Sedona Brins Fire 2006.jpg|A wildfire in Sedona, Arizona\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Academic articles\n**\n**\n* Congressional documentation\n**[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113srpt179/pdf/CRPT-113srpt179.pdf Senate Report 113-179], official committee report for S. 1300\n** [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-113shrg82863/pdf/CHRG-113shrg82863.pdf Official report on Senate subcommittee hearing on S. 1300 (S.
