The elections are conducted by the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ).\nMayors and single-member wards\nAll 77 councils use optional preferential voting (OPV) for mayoral elections. Under this system, voters are only required to vote for one candidates, although they can choose to preference other candidates.\nIn the 22 councils that use single-member wards (including Brisbane, Gold Coast and Townsville) OPV is also used.\nMulti-member wards\nOnly Ipswich uses multi-member wards, with four two-member wards (resulting in eight total councillors).\nNo form of preferential voting is in place, with plurality block voting − also referred to as first-past-the-post by the ECQ − instead used. Voters are only required to mark the same amount of candidates as there are positions to be elected (in the case of Ipswich, two candidates).\nUndivided councils\n54 councils are undivided, meaning they do not use any forms of wards and all councillors are elected to a single area representing the entire council.\nPlurality block voting is used for these councils.\nParty changes before elections\nAs of October 2024, two councillors have joined a party before the 2028 elections.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Most wards are not contested by political parties and are rarely successful when they do. The sole exception to this is Brisbane, which is contested by the Liberal National Party, Labor and the Greens. These parties are all likely to recontest in 2028. There are also a number of councillors and candidates who are members of political parties but ran as independents.\nReferences"
