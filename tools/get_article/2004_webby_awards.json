Due to cutbacks in the Webby event budget resulting from the 2002 Internet bubble, the decision was made to hold this year's ceremony entirely online (a step further than the 2003 Webbys which had already been partially online). Judging was provided by the 480-person International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.\nNominees and winners\n: (from http://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2004)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
