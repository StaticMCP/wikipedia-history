      "text": "# Fred Ward Memorial Show\n\nThe Fred Ward Memorial Show was an annual professional wrestling memorial event produced by the Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) promotion, which was held from 2004 to 2009. The show was held in honor of Fred Ward, a pioneering wrestling promoter who controlled the central Georgia wrestling territory for over 30 years, who died on May 7, 1992. It was originally held in Columbus, Georgia by GCW until Jerry Oates' retirement in 2006, whereupon the new owners Bill and Diane Hewes relocated the promotion, renamed Great Championship Wrestling, to Phenix City, Alabama. Its third annual memorial show, the last show held at the GCW Arena, \"drew the biggest crowd [at the venue] in over a year\".\nMany of the featured wrestlers were former stars in World Championship Wrestling or were then competing in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling as well as local stars such as Jason Cross, Damian Steele, Vordell Walker, and David Young. Older regional stars from the Georgia territory, many of whom had worked for Fred Ward, also made guest appearances. The first Ward tribute show in 2004 saw masked wrestler The Wrestler defeat GCW United States Junior Heavyweight Champion Vordell Walker and an 8-man single-elimination tournament in which the winner, Jason Cross, received an award from Mr. Wrestling II. Ole Anderson, Bill Dromo, Thunderbolt Patterson, Les Thatcher, Masked Superstar, The Oates Brothers (Jerry and Ted Oates), and Brad and \"Bullet\" Bob Armstrong were seen in later shows.\nShow results\nFirst Annual Fred Ward Tribute Show (2004)\nAugust 10, 2004 in Columbus, Georgia (GCW Arena)\n{| style=\"font-size: 85%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!#\n!Results\n!Stipulations\n!Times\n|-\n|1\n|Elix Skipper and Sonny Siaki wrestled to a time-limit draw.\n|rowspan=\"4\"| First Round Tournament match\n|na\n|-\n|2\n|Johnny Swinger defeated John Bogey\n|na\n|-\n|3\n|Jason Cross defeated Damian Steele\n|n/a\n|-\n|4\n|A.J.
