It was fought between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth led by Marcin Kazanowski and Krzysztof Radziwiłł against the Tsardom of Russia and Tatars led by Ivan the Terrible. After 7 hours of fighting on an open field, it resulted in a Polish–Lithuanian victory.\nPrelude\nIn 1577, the Danzig rebellion came to an end, with Stephen Báthory being elected. This led to the collapse of the plan to partition the Polish–Lithuanian state between Moscow and the Habsburgs, which caused Ivan IV to undertake the last, decisive and \"great\" campaign of 1577.\nBy 1581, the situation became more and more critical for Ivan IV due to the Polish–Lithuanian troops remaining in Muscovy territory.\nOn 25 June that year, a Russian army supported by Tatars which consisted of 30,000–45,000 men crossed the Dnieper. It had no possibility of besieging cities, and its main goal was to devastate the area. They would attack the suburb or Mogilev two days later.\nBattle\nOn 27 June, which was a Tuesday, the Russian army attacked the outskirts of Mogilev. The civilians or riflemen, along with 200 hussars began to defend against the attack. They pushed the enemy out of the city and fought for 7 hours on the open field. After receiving false information that the entire army was approaching the Dnieper, the Russians fled in panic when they saw 300 light cavalry along with Temryk Szymkowicz's and Krzysztof Radziwiłł's rotas arrive. An attempt to burn the city down was also thwarted. Two voivodes died in the battle: Roman Buturlin and prince Nikita Czerkaski.\nAftermath\nPolish troops suffered large losses in horses, with many villages being burned and some wounded. However, none of the Polish soldiers died.\nOnce Ivan's troops withdrew, Batory was finally able to march on Pskov.\nThere are many accounts of the Battle of Mogilev, including one given by Lieutenant Markowice:\nAnother account of the battle was also completed by Father Jan Piotrowski:\nLegacy\nThe battle showed just how powerful the hussars were. Michał Mackiewicz from the Polish Army Museum states:\nHe further continued this by saying:\nSee also\n* Livonian War\nReferences\nSources\n*"
