It was released in 2002 through Spinefarm Records in Finland, Drakkar Entertainment in the rest of Europe, Century Media Records in the US, and Toy's Factory in Japan. It is the first album which features now-former bassist and male vocalist Marko Hietala, who left the band in January 2021. It is also the first Nightwish album to feature an orchestra.\nSpinefarm Records released a 2-CD special edition of the album in 2002. It includes liner art with the band members' signatures, and a Video CD containing the music video for their cover of Gary Moore's \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". In addition, the booklet contains an ID code that allows the owner to download the entire album and three extra tracks from the Internet for a limited time. The bonus tracks are \"Nightwish\", \"The Forever Moments\" and \"Etiäinen\", all from the band's first demo of 1996.\nThe album was certified double platinum in Finland with more than 60,000 sold copies, the second best selling album of 2002 in Finland. Century Child has sold more than 80,000 copies in Finland alone.\nMusical style\nCentury Child is the beginning of a shift in sound for the band, with a smaller emphasis on power metal previously seen in Wishmaster and Oceanborn, and instead focuses on deeper lyrics and more of a film soundtrack sound, with Century Child having a more gothic and symphonic sound. The album is the first of the band's discography to be recorded with a live symphony orchestra and chorus, as well as being the first to include a permanent male vocalist with the addition of Marko Hietala, incorporating a \"beauty and the beast\" dynamic into the band.\nIn an interview with Perkele Magazine in 2002, songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen discussed the central theme of the album, which he stated was \"childhood\" and the \"loss of innocence\". When asked more about the theme, he stated:\n}}\nTrack listing\nAll lyrics are written by Tuomas Holopainen, except where noted; all music is composed by Holopainen, except where noted; all lead vocals by Tarja Turunen, except where noted.\n| extra5 = Turunen with Hietala\n| length5 = 4:31\n| title6 = Forever Yours\n| length6 = 3:51\n| title7 = Ocean Soul\n| length7 = 4:14\n| title8 = Feel for You\n| extra8 = Turunen with Hietala\n| length8 = 3:54\n| title9 = The Phantom of the Opera\n| note9 = Andrew Lloyd Webber cover\n| lyrics9 =\n| music9 = Lloyd Webber\n| extra9 = Turunen with Hietala\n| length9 = 4:09\n| title10 = Beauty of the Beast\"\n*\n*\n*\n| music10 = |Holopainen |Vuorinen }}\n| length10 = 10:22\n| total_length = 50:09\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits for Century Child adapted from liner notes.\nNightwish\n*Tarja Turunen – lead vocals\n*Tuomas Holopainen – keyboards\n*Emppu Vuorinen – guitars\n*Marko Hietala – bass, male vocals on tracks 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 & 10\n*Jukka Nevalainen – drums, percussion\nAdditional musicians\n*Joensuu City Orchestra – orchestra\n*Juha Ikonen – orchestra leader\n*Riku Niemi – orchestra and choir conductor, orchestra and choir arrangements, orchestra and choir production\n*Mongo Aaltonen – orchestral percussion\n*St. Thomas Chorus of Helsinki – choir vocals\n*Hilkka Kangasniemi – choirmaster\n*Sam Hardwick – spoken words on \"Bless the Child\" and \"Beauty of the Beast\"\n*Kristiina Ilmonen – tin whistle\n*GME choir – additional noise\nProduction\n*Tero \"TeeCee\" Kinnunen – production\n*Mikko Karmila – mixing\n*Mika Jussila – mastering\n*Veijo Laine – orchestra and choir arrangements, orchestra and choir production\n*Terhi Kallio – orchestra engineering\n*Tuomas Holopainen – art direction\n*Markus Mayer – cover art\n*Spelltone – layout\n*Hilkka Kangasniemi – choirmaster\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2002)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2002)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| 97\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101231042248/http://www.nightwish.com/en/ Nightwish's Official Website]"
