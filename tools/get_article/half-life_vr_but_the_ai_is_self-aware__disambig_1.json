The series, live streamed to Twitch with highlights later uploaded to YouTube, was filmed using a modification for ''Garry's Mod that allows for the use of virtual reality. The series loosely follows the events of the game, with Half-Lifes protagonist, Gordon Freeman, accompanied by other employees of Black Mesa who, despite the name of the series, are performed by improv actors playing the role of AI controlled non-player characters.\nHalf-Life VR but the AI Is Self-Aware was met with generally positive reception by critics for its absurdist humor and unique recontextualization of the source material.\nWayneRadioTV has produced several spin-offs and sequels, including the 2021 Half-Life: Alyx but the Gnome Is Too Aware, in which Wayne carries a conscious garden gnome (again improvisationally voiced by hidden actors) through the game, and Chronicles of Benry'', an offshoot exploring Benrey's character with separate versions by Socpens and Hollow_tones, both also using Garry's Mod.\nWayneRadioTV has confirmed that a sequel to the original series, titled Half-Life 2 VR: Self Aware AI, is slated to be released in 2025.\nPlot\nWalking through the Black Mesa Research Facility, physicist Gordon Freeman (WayneRadioTV) comes across three scientists with eccentric personalities: Tommy (Baaulp), a scientist that speaks and acts like a child, Dr.HaroldCoomer (hollow_tones), a friendly scientist and the subject of frequent glitches, and Dr.Bubby (MasterGir), a cranky scientist that acts rude towards Freeman. Freeman also encounters Benrey (socpens), an antagonistic security guard who demands he provide a passport for identification, and begins to follow him.\nFreeman and the scientists experiment on a crystal of unknown origin, which goes awry and triggers a resonance cascade. Freeman, the scientists, and Benrey make their way through the damaged facility in an attempt to escape from alien creatures teleported in by the incident. During the journey, Coomer accidentally noclips out of the map, causing him to suspect he may be in a video game. Freeman is betrayed by Bubby and Benrey, leading him to be captured by the government soldiers deployed to clean up the incident. The soldiers cut off his arm and throw him into a trash compactor.\nA delirious Freeman comes to and makes his way to an abandoned section of Black Mesa where he rejoins Tommy. He then encounters Coomer, who attempts to use Freeman as a way to escape the video game. His plan fails and he rejoins Freeman's group. Freeman then finds Bubby, himself betrayed by the military, along with Benrey. Freeman reluctantly allows them to rejoin the group.\nFreeman and the team proceed to Black Mesa's Mixology Department, headed by Darnold (Logmore), who fits Freeman's missing arm with a machine gun. The team fight their way to the Lambda Complex, where they teleport to Xen. In Xen, they find Benrey has grown into a giant and begins floating around the others, taunting them. Benrey is revealed to be the source of the resonance cascade, transforming into a monstrous alien form and attacking the science team. The scientists work together to eventually defeat him.\nAfter defeating Benrey, Freeman is captured by G-Man (spaghoner), who thanks him for taking down Benrey and invites him to the birthday party of his adopted son, Tommy. After a brief argument, Freeman accepts the invitation. In the credits sequence, the science team and G-Man celebrate Tommy's birthday at a Chuck E. Cheese, much to Freeman's internal despair. In a post-credits scene, Dr. Coomer calls Gordon and congratulates him for beating the game, thanking him for taking the science team with him on his adventure.\nReception\nHalf-Life VR but the AI Is Self-Aware was generally well received by reviewers. Emily Rose of Ars Technica called it \"exceptionally hilarious\" and suggested HLVR:AI's style of virtual performance was the next stage in the human narrative tradition. Kotaku Zack Zwiezen stated it was \"as good as [''Freeman's Mind and G-Man Squad]\", two other well-known Half-Life series, calling it \"a funny and oddly compelling show\". Quint Iverson of The Pacific Index stated that \"the frequency at which Half-Life VR but the AI is Self-Aware'' turns me into a laughing mess is unparalleled\". In contrast, Esther Warren of Loud and Clear described it as \"trash\" and \"Frequently stupid, frustrating, and hard to follow,\" but agreed that it still had moments of \"unalloyed greatness.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
