Misc. C. 12), Yawar Ziwa is the name of one of the heavenly trees.\nAs an epithet\nYawar Ziwa is also an epithet for several figures in Mandaean scripture, including:\n*Abatur\n*Hibil Ziwa\n*Manda d-Hayyi\nŠum Yawar Ziwa\nThe Šum Yawar Ziwa () is a sacred gold ring worn by Mandaean priests.\nSee also\n* List of angels in theology\nReferences"
