It opened on 26 March 1988. At the time it was the largest underground diesel bus station in the world.\nThe southern portal connects to Victoria Bridge and Cultural Centre busway station. The former western portal was converted into a tunnel and connects to King George Square busway station.\nHistory\nThe bus station was originally divided into several platforms named after Australian native animals. In June 2015, the platforms were renamed with letters and numbers.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Formerplatforms\n!Currentplatforms\n|-\n|Kangaroo, Platypus\n|1A–1H\n|-\n|Koala\n|2A–2C\n|-\n|Crocodile\n|3A–3B\n|}\nServices\nThe station is served by 18 routes, operated by Transport for Brisbane as part of the Translink network.
