For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n34 & 35 Vict.\nThe third session of the 20th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 9 February 1871 until 21 August 1871.\nPublic general acts\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  in relation to Foreign Securities, Mortgages of Stock, and Proxy Papers.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Supply Act 1871|public|6|30-03-1871|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of four hundred and sixty-two thousand five hundred and eighty pounds nine shillings and elevenpence out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the years ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy and one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one.|note4= }}\n| or the Supply Act 1871|public|7|31-03-1871|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of five million four hundred and eleven thousand nine hundred pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  for regulating Schools of Anatomy.}}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Working of Jews on Sunday Act 1871|public|19|25-05-1871|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for exempting persons professing the Jewish religion from penalties in respect of young persons and females professing the said religion working on Sundays.|note4= }}\n| or the Supply Act 1871|public|20|25-05-1871|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of seven million pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Protection of Life and Property (Ireland) Act 1871or the Westmeath Act 1871|public|25|16-06-1871|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to empower the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland to apprehend and detain for a limited time persons suspected of being members of the Ribbon Society, or of being concerned in the commission of any crime or outrage under the direction or influence of said Ribbon Society in the county of Westmeath, or in certain adjoining portions of the county of Meath and the King's County;
