Then the f(y) factor of the spatial dimension becomes the effect of time that in words of Einstein \"curves space\". How it curves space will define one or other solution to a space-time world. For that reason, different models of space-time use warped geometries.\nMany basic solutions of the Einstein field equations are warped geometries, for example, the Schwarzschild solution and the Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker models.\nAlso, warped geometries are the key building block of Randall–Sundrum models in string theory.\nSee also\n* Metric tensor\n* Exact solutions in general relativity\n* Poincaré half-plane model\nReferences"
