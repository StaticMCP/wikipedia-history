The land was located approximately six kilometres south from the Main Line railway, towards Woodlands. Boyd named this property Forest Hill, after seeing Allan Cunningham's map of the region where he had marked \"extensive indifferent forest ground\". A stopping place was established on the Main Line railway to service the property called Boyd's Siding which later changed its name to Forest Hill.\nForest Hill was recorded as a railway station in 1881 and was located one kilometre east down the line from its later location. The railway station moved to its later location in 1886. In the 1920s, it was Queensland's largest produce loading centre. However, the increasing use of road transport for farm produce led to the railway station's closure on 3 July 1992. The main railway station was relocated to the Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway at Swanbank. The railway station waiting room was restored and relocated to Anzac Park (also known as Forest Hill Place) in Forest Hill.\nThe first Forest Hill Post Office opened on 1 February 1890 at the railway station (replacing a receiving office named Forest Hill Siding open since 1889). The office moved to its current site at 40 Victoria Street on 7 January 1908.\nForest Hill Provisional School opened on 23 January 1893, becoming a state school in 1899.\nSt Thomas's Anglican Church was dedicated on 2 August 1903 by Archdeacon Arthur Evan David.
