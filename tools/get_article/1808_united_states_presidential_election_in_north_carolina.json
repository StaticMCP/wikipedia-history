North Carolina voters chose fourteen representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNorth Carolina voted for the Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison over the Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and Democratic-Republican James Monroe, who would become president following Madison.\nNorth Carolina used an electoral district system to choose its electors, with each district electing a single elector. This is similar to the way Nebraska and Maine choose their electors in modern elections.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1808 United States presidential election in North Carolina\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican\n| James Madison\n| align=\"right\" |8,829\n| align=\"right\" |51.08%\n| align=\"right\" |11\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#EA9978; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Federalist\n|Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\n| align=\"right\" |7,523\n| align=\"right\" |43.53%\n| align=\"right\" |3\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n|Democratic-Republican\n|James Monroe\n|931\n|5.39%\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |17,283\n| align=\"right\" |100.00%\n| align=\"right\" |14\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in North Carolina\nReferences"
