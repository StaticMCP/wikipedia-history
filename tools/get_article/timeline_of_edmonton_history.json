The rim of the river valley and its ravines and hilltops in Edmonton are known to have been well-used as campgrounds and look-out points during this time. Rabbit Hill, today's Mary Lobay Park, Mount Pleasant Cemetery and Huntington Heights (near Whitemud Drive west of Calgary Trail) are known to be sites of human activity for millennia. As well, the \"Old North Trail\" of the Blackfoot goes through present-day Edmonton, as it goes from Mexico to the Barren Lands up north. (Part of it survives is preserved as the Great Western Trail through the U.S.) At about Edmonton the Trail branched, with one branch going through present-day site of Ft. Assiniboine and toward western Arctic lands; the other branch going NE then breaking north to descend the Athabasca River. Some conjecture that the Trail's crossing of the North Saskatchewan River at the site is the reason for the siting of fur-trade posts in Rossdale.\n18th century\n*1754 – Anthony Henday, an explorer working for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area.\n*1795 – Fort Edmonton was established on the north bank of the river near today's Fort Saskatchewan, as a major trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company.\n19th century\n*1802 - Fort Edmonton (Hudson's Bay Company)  moves to Rossdale.\n*1810 - Fort Edmonton (Hudson's Bay Company) moves to near Smoky Lake.\n*1812 – Fort Edmonton (Hudson's Bay Company) moves to Rossdale, never again to move out of today's Edmonton. This is start of Edmonton's recorded permanent occupancy.\n*1821 the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company merge, and fur-trade activities at Edmonton are concentrated in Fort Edmonton.\n*1824 - Horse packtrail established to connect Fort Edmonton to HBC's Fort Assiniboine, which serves as trans-shipment point on the Athabasca River, part of the Mackenzie River watershed flowing to the Arctic.\n*1830 – Fort Edmonton moves up the hill, to near today's legislative building. From 1830 to 1860, the fur trade in western Canada uses Edmonton as a prominent transshipment point connecting the prairies with New Caledonia (interior BC) and with the fur trading posts up north. By 1860s ships are sailing from the Atlantic Ocean \"around the Horn\" to the west coast, and that more and more causes a decline in the importance of Edmonton as a transportation link.\n* 1859-1860 - Gold rush in the Cariboo region of BC leads to gold-panners coming to Edmonton. Among them Thomas Clover, who founds  settlement at Clover Bar. (Later dredges are used to mine gold from river bed.)\n*1870 – Fort Edmonton and environs becomes part of Canada and of the North-West Territories.\n*1871 – The first prominent buildings outside the walls of Fort Edmonton, a Methodist church mission building and manse, built by George McDougall and his family, formerly of Victoria Settlement.  They add mix to the existing campsites and log cabins of gold prospectors, frontier farmers and hunters, Indigenous, European and Métis, who live in the bush where City of Edmonton sits today.\n*1874 - North-West Mounted Police makes Great March to western prairies. Second Patrol, a spin-off of the main March West, arrives in Edmonton in exhausted dribs and drabs Oct. 29-Nov. 2\n*1875 - Arrival of Edmonton's first sternwheeler/steamboat Northcote.\n*1876\n**Donald Ross opens Edmonton's first hotel\n**Treaty 6 is signed by representatives of the Queen and local Native leaders.

Matthew McCauley is named to head a settlers rights protective association (in local parlance \"a vigilance committee\"). He and others throw a squatter's shack over the edge of the river valley.\n**Dominion Land Survey is conducted in Edmonton area. Fixes in place a mixture of riverlots along river and square sections elsewhere. It helps firm up local land ownership.\n*1883 - Edmonton, at the time an unincorporated hamlet, elects Frank Oliver as its first representative to the NWT Territorial Council.\n*1885 - Telephone service begins with just two telephones\n*1885 - North-West Rebellion and the simultaneous First Nations uprising, both centred in Saskatchewan, strikes fear in many in Edmonton.

With completion of Legislative Building and High Level Bridge, unemployment became problem. Land in the Hudson's Bay Company reserve was put on the market and sold, with the money raised by the sales going to HBC headquarters out of the province. British investment dried up as Europe invested in military preparation for the coming war. This all caused real estate prices to drop. With the start of World War I, the city's population declined, going from 72,000 in 1914 to under 54,000 in only two years, people leaving to eke out existence on farms, or off to war, or to other centres.\n*1914 - Vote held on street naming system (following amalgamation of Strathcona and Edmonton, each with their own systems) Numerical numbering (centred on Jasper Avenue and 101 Street) got 2099 votes; \"Edmonscona\" scheme (a mixed number-name system) got 1471 votes.\n*1914-1915 -  Prince of Wales Armouries built.\n*1915\n**Fort Edmonton (No.&nbsp;5) is dismantled.

At first known as the Edmonton Rugby Foot-ball Club, the team had taken the name Eskimos.

After a relatively calm but still prosperous period in the 1960s, the city's growth took on renewed vigour concomitant with high world oil prices, triggered by the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
