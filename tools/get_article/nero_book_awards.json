They are run by coffeehouse chain Caffè Nero in partnership with the Booksellers' Association, Brunel University London, and Right To Dream, \"a football community dedicated to expanding people's understanding of excellence through football\".\nThe awards are made in four categories: children's fiction, fiction, debut fiction, and non-fiction. A short list of four is drawn up for each category, and category winners are chosen, receiving £5,000. There is then a further selection process before one of the category winners is awarded the £30,000 \"Golden Nero\" award as \"Book of the year\". The awards are open to books published in the UK and Ireland, and at the time of entry the author must be alive and have been resident in the UK or Ireland for three years. The criteria for the awards are described as: \"Our judges will be asked to choose the books they would most want to press into the hands of friends and family for their quality and readability.\"\nTimeline\nFor the 2023 awards, announced in 2024 for books published predominantly in 2023, the timeline was:\n* 1 December 2022 to 30 November 2023: Publication date for eligible books\n* 19 June 2023 - 21 July 2023: Submission of entries\n* 21 November 2023: Shortlists announced\n* 30 January 2024: Category winners announced\n* 14 March 2024: Golden Nero overall winner announced\nA similar pattern of eligibility and submission dates has been announced for the 2024 awards.\nShortlists and winners\nThe overall winner for each year is shown in boldface, and category winners are indicated by highlighted rows.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Publisher\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|- style=\"background: lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"16\" |2023\n|\n|'\n|Hamish Hamilton\n||Overall winnerFiction winner'\n||\n|-\n|\n|Birnam Wood\n|Granta\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Fiction shortlist\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|Ordinary Human Failings\n|Jonathan Cape\n|-\n|\n|Fifteen Wild Decembers\n|Europa\n|- style=\"background: lightyellow;\"\n|\n|Close to Home''\n|Hamish Hamilton\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Debut fiction winner\n| rowspan=\"1\" |\n|-\n|\n|'\n|Bloomsbury\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Debut fiction shortlist\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|'\n|Chatto & Windus\n|-\n|\n|Sunburn\n|Verve\n|- style=\"background: lightyellow;\"\n|\n|\n|Puffin\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Children's fiction winner\n| rowspan=\"1\" |\n|-\n|\n|Gwen and Art Are Not in Love\n|Bloomsbury\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Children's fiction shortlist\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|Bitterthorn\n|Andersen Press\n|-\n|\n|Wild Song\n|\n|- style=\"background: lightyellow;\"\n|\n|Strong Female Character\n|Brazen\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Non-fiction winner\n| rowspan=\"1\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|Coronet\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Non-fiction shortlist\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|Undercurrent\n|Coronet\n|-\n|\n|Hags\n|Fleet\n|- style=\"background: lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"17\" |2024\n|- style=\"background: lightyellow;\"\n|\n|Maurice and Maralyn\n|Chatto & Windus\n|Overall winnerNon-fiction winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Pixel Flesh\n|Headline\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Non-fiction shortlist\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|W.
