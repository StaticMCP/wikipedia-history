In the , East Mackay had a population of 3,725 people.\nGeography\nAs the name suggests, East Mackay is the suburb to the east of the city centre. It is flat low-lying coastal land (less than 10 metres above sea level). It is bounded by the Pioneer River to the north and the Coral Sea to the east. There is a sandy beach along the foreshore to the sea known as Town Beach.\nEast Mackay has the following sandy beaches:\n* Iluka Beach (Town Beach) ()\n* Illawong Beach (Far Beach) () which extends into South Mackay and Paget\nIt is possible to swim at the beaches at high tide, but, as the tide goes out, extensive mudflats are revealed.\nThe suburb is mostly used for residential purposes except for the northern part of the suburb at the mouth of the Pioneer River, which is a wetland known as the Sandfly Creek Environmental Reserve and managed by the Mackay Regional Council. The wetland serves a number of purposes, acting as a levee against coastal erosion, providing a habitat for shorebirds and other fauna, and providing a walking track for visitors.\nHistory\nVictoria Park State School opened on 1 July 1926. On 27 January 1970, the school was divided to create a separate Victoria Park State Infants School for the early years of schooling, but on 16 December 1994 the infants school was merged back into the main school. The infants school was at 43-47 Skakespeare Street (the triangular block enclosed by Shakespeare Street, Hague Street and Macrossan Street, ).\nDemographics\nIn the , East Mackay had a population of 3,564 people.\nIn the , East Mackay had a population of 3,725 people.\nEducation\nVictoria Park State School is a government primary (Early Childhood to Year 6) school for boys and girls at 15 Goldsmith Street ().
