It was a two-night event which took place on September 3 and September 4, 2005 at the Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles, California.\nIt was a sixteen-man tournament which concluded with Chris Bosh defeating AJ Styles in the tournament final to win the inaugural tournament.

Chris Sabin was originally announced as a participant in the tournament against Frankie Kazarian but Sabin broke his jaw, forcing him to withdraw from the tournament. Rocky Romero replaced Sabin in the tournament.\nEvent\nNight 1\nThe event kicked off with a six-man tag team match pitting Gunning For Hookers (Hook Bomberry and Top Gun Talwar) and Human Tornado against Chris Sabin, Disco Machine and Excalibur.

Lost attacked the referee after the match until Scorpio Sky returned and attacked Lost.\nLater, AJ Styles took on Jack Evans. Styles was knocked out of the ring via the top rope by Evans. Evans then attempted to hit a diving front flip but Styles countered it into a Styles Clash on the floor outside the ring and then tossed Evans into the ring to pin him for the win.\nIt was followed by the last match in the first round between the PWG Champion Kevin Steen and Super Dragon. Dragon nailed a Psycho Driver on Steen for a near-fall which Steen countered by pinning Dragon with a crucifix for the win. After the match, Dragon extended a handshake to Steen and Steen shook his hands and hugged him and then Dragon attacked Steen and tried to hit a Supernatural Driver but Disco Machine and Excalibur made the save.\nNight 2\nThe second night of the event kicked off with a six-man tag team match pitting Chris Sabin, Hook Bomberry and T. J. Perkins against Disco Machine, Excalibur and Ronin. After a series of finishers among the six participants, Sabin concluded the match by nailing a Cradle Shock to Excalibur for the win.\nNext, the second round of the Battle of Los Angeles began with a match between Quicksilver and Rocky Romero. Quicksilver countered a roll-up attempt by Romero by pinning him with a double leg cradle for the win.\nJames Gibson took on Chris Bosh in the next second round match. Bosh insulted Gibson before the match which led to Gibson respond Bosh by kicking him in the gut. Gibson was about to deliver a Gibson Driver to Bosh nearing the climax of the match but Joey Ryan and Scott Lost interfered and distracted Gibson, allowing Bosh to roll-him up.\nIn the next second round match, American Dragon took on Christopher Daniels. Dragon countered an Angel's Wings'' by Daniels with a backdrop and hit a forearm smash to Daniels and then hit Daniels with twenty-five airplane spins and then applied a crossface chickenwing to Daniels to make him submit to the hold.

Bosh blocked a Spiral Tap by Styles with his knees and hit two vertical suplex piledrivers to Styles for the win.\nReception\nBrad Garoon of 411Mania rated the event 6.5 out of 10. He appreciated the Rocky Romero versus Frankie Kazarian and American Dragon versus Ricky Reyes matches in the first round, while \"the first round was kind of a bust\" and the eight-man tag team match on the second night \"completely outshined everything in the tournament\". According to Garoon, both nights \"as a whole are solid, but a lot to get through without much waiting for you at the end.\"\nAftermath\nAs a result of winning the inaugural Battle of Los Angeles Tournament, Chris Bosh earned a PWG Championship title shot against Kevin Steen at After School Special. Bosh had initially won the title but the original referee regained consciousness and disqualified Bosh for attacking him, thus reversing the decision and Steen subsequently retained the title. This led to Bosh getting a rematch against Steen due to their match not ending in a proper way and AJ Styles was added into their title match for having pinned Steen in the Battle of Los Angeles tournament, thus setting up a three-way match between Steen, Styles and Bosh for the title at Straight To DVD, where Steen retained the title.\nScorpio Sky's attack on Scott Lost at Battle of Los Angeles led to a match between the two at After School Special, which Lost won.\nResults\nTournament brackets\nThe first annual Battle of Los Angeles was held on September 3 and 4, 2005, in Los Angeles, California.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com/results/2005/show0033.html 2005 Battle of Los Angeles - Night One official results]\n*[http://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com/results/2005/show0034.html 2005 Battle of Los Angeles - Night Two official results]"
