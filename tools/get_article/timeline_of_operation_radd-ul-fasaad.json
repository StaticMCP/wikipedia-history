The operation aimed to eliminate the threat of terrorism, and consolidating the gains of Operation Zarb-e-Azb which was launched in 2014 as a joint military offensive.\nLaunch\n* 22 February 2017 — The Pakistan Army publicly announced the launch of Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad (literally, “Elimination of Discord”) nationwide. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement described its goals as eliminating residual and latent terrorist threats, consolidating gains from previous operations, and securing Pakistan's borders.\n* The operation was designed to incorporate multiple security agencies (army, air force, navy, civil armed forces, police, and intelligence bodies) working in coordination.\n* Alongside counterinsurgency, a “de-weaponisation” campaign and explosive control measures were declared as cardinal components.\n2017: Early Operations & Sub-Operations\n* By April 2017 — Military sources reported seizures of weapon caches and hundreds of arrests in Punjab province under Radd-ul-Fasaad, as security forces intensified operations in Pakistan's heartland.\n* Operation Khyber IV (as a component of Radd-ul-Fasaad) — This sub-operation was conducted in Rajgal Valley (FATA region) to prevent ISIS-Khorasan infiltration from Afghanistan, and to further secure the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.\n* Lahore bombing, 23 February 2017 — A bombing in Lahore's Defence area killed 10 people. Occurring one day after the operation's launch, this attack was initially considered as part of the terror threat landscape that Radd-ul-Fasaad sought to address.\nIntermediate Years (2018–2021): Consolidation & Statistics\n* End of 2018 — Pakistani official data indicated that in 2018, 368 civilians, 163 soldiers, and 166 terrorists had been killed in 163 incidents.

According to the locals, the two gunmen had been \"guests\" at the TTP commander's home for several days before they killed him and fled. Qari Saifullah Mehsud was a key Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander and was among the terrorists most wanted to Pakistan for his involvement in several terror attacks in the country. He was notorious for preparing suicide jackets and suicide bombers for terrorist acts and was also the mastermind behind 2015 Karachi bus shooting. According to the Analysts, the killing of Mehsud is a big hit for the TTP as he was trying to unite all the split militant groups. His death was also confirmed by TTP. Mehsud was also previously arrested by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2016 but was later released after spending 14 weeks in jail in Afghanistan. Mehsud funeral ceremony and burial took place in Gurbaz district of Khost Province.\n2020\nJanuary\nOn 30 January, two senior members of TTP were shot dead by unknown gunmen in Kabul, Afghanistan. The deceased were identified to be Sheikh Khalid Haqqani and Qari Saif Younis and their bodies were found in the vicinity of Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul. Sheikh Khalid Haqqani held key position in the TTP leadership council, and formerly served as the group's deputy leader. He was accused of being involved in several high-profile attacks on Pakistani politicians and an attack on school in Peshawar in 2014. Qari Saif Younis was a military commander in TTP and directed suicide operations. According to one militant source, the men were planning to hold a secret \"meeting\" in Kabul, on the direct orders of the group's leadership, apparently travelling from the eastern Afghan province of Paktika. The militants did not reveal who they were planning on meeting. Both the TTP members were killed on 30 January, however, their death was confirmed on 7 February by the TTP leadership. The TTP leadership had initially ordered the news to be kept \"secret\", partly as they were rattled by the assassinations, and partly to avoid awkward questions about why the men were in the city.\nThe statement from TTP said that the two men were killed in clashes with the United States troops. However, the sources within the group also acknowledged that it was also possible that gunmen or militants linked to Pakistani intelligence services were responsible for the assassination. The bodies of the men killed in Kabul were handed over to the group, and a large funeral was held for them on Monday in their stronghold in eastern Kunar province.\nFebruary\n* 17 February  - February 2020 Quetta bombing\nMarch\nApril\nMay\nJune\n* 29 June 29 - Pakistan Stock Exchange attack\nJuly\n* 29 July  - A soldier was killed in a terrorist attack at Bajaur security post.\nAugust\n* 5 August – At least 39 people were injured in an RGD-1 grenade attack on a Jamaat-i-Islami rally in the Gulshan-e-Iqbal neighborhood of Karachi.
