He died while on active duty commanding the 84th Infantry Division near Camp Howze, Texas.\nAlthough it is believed that he was named after Confederate Lieutenant General Thomas Jonathan \"Stonewall\" Jackson, it is not believed he is related to him. However, his father, Samuel Warren Jackson (1841-1923), was a cavalryman who served under Jackson in the 3rd Texas Cavalry Regiment during the American Civil War.\nThe younger Jackson served in the Army of Occupation after the First World War. He later served as professor of military science and tactics at Georgetown University, and taught at Cornell. Jackson was made commander of the 84th Infantry Division in February 1943, and was promoted to major general on March 15, 1943.\nJackson died on October 13, 1943, at the Camp Polk Station Hospital as a result of injuries received in a plane crash on October 4, 1943. He was one of the highest-ranking American generals to die in the United States during World War II along with General Malin Craig, Major General Herbert Dargue, Major General Frank C. Mahin, Major General Robert Olds, Major General Paul Newgarden, and Major General William H. Rupertus.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://ancexplorer.army.mil/publicwmv/#/arlington-national/search/results/1/CgdqYWNrc29uEglzdG9uZXdhbGw-/ Arlington National Cemetery]\n*[https://generals.dk/general/Jackson/Stonewall/USA.html Generals of World War II]"
