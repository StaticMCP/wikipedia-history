Bill Hollar would finish in last-place on the first lap due to an issue with his clutch. Bill Champion received his second straight top-five finish. Richard Childress would be involved in a fire during the race while a crash would take D.K. Ulrich out of the race. 300 laps were performed in front of 3,800 live spectators. Bobby Isaac and Richard Petty were exchanging the lead for the entire race.\nIsaac would go on to defeat Elmo Langley after more than 90 minutes of racing action; with Harry Hyde as the winner's crew chief. Isaac's qualifying speed of  earned him the pole position for this race. Notable crew chiefs for this race were Harry Hyde, Dale Inman, Vic Ballard and Lee Gordon.\nThe race car drivers still had to commute to the races using the same stock cars that competed in a typical weekend's race through a policy of homologation (and under their own power). This policy was in effect until roughly 1975. By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power anymore.\nQualifying\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
