The Hocking Glass Company was founded in 1905 by Isaac Jacob (Ike) Collins in Lancaster, Ohio, and named after the Hocking River. That company merged with the Anchor Cap and Closure Corporation in 1937.\nFrom 1937 to 1983, the company operated the oldest glass-manufacturing facility in the United States, established in 1863, in Salem, New Jersey. Anchor Hocking's wine and spirit bottles were crafted at a factory in Monaca, Pennsylvania. It also had facilities in Elmira, New York, and Streator, Illinois.\nThe company was the sponsor of the radio drama Casey, Crime Photographer. It was also slated to sponsor television's first late-night talk show, The Don Hornsby Show, before Hornsby suddenly died shortly before its debut.\nAnchor Hocking and their headquarters in Lancaster, Ohio, are a focus of Brian Alexander's February 2017 book Glass House.\nCorporate history\nIn 1905, the Hocking Glass Company was founded by Isaac Jacob (Ike) Collins in Lancaster, Ohio, and named after the Hocking River. In 1937, that company merged with the Anchor Cap and Closure Corporation, thus becoming Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation.\nIn 1934, Hocking Glass and a subsidiary, General Glass, developed the first nonreturnable beer bottle, considered a significant development in the field.\nIn 1987, the Newell Company acquired Anchor Hocking Corporation.\nIn 2004, Newell Rubbermaid sold Anchor Hocking to New York City-based Global Home Products, LLC, an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP.\nWhen Global Home Products declared bankruptcy in 2007, Anchor Hocking was sold to Monomoy Capital Partners, who merged Anchor Hocking with Oneida in 2012 and created EveryWare Global. In January 2014, EveryWare Global announced its plans to close its regional office and the Oneida outlet store, both in Sherrill, New York, with the process starting in April.\nThe original Oneida outlet store in Sherrill, New York, was closed April 26, 2014. EveryWare Global filed for bankruptcy in 2015. EveryWare Global was renamed The Oneida Group in 2017.\nIn June 2021, Oneida Consumer LLC, including the Oneida brand, was acquired by Lenox Corporation. Reflecting its remaining activities, in July 2021, The Oneida Group was renamed to Anchor Hocking Holdings, Inc.\nLocations\nMost of the original Anchor Hocking glass container plants then operating were \"spun off” in 1983 to form the newly created Anchor Glass Container Corporation (AGGC), with headquarters in Tampa, Florida. A wide variety of glass containers for many types of foods, beverages, and other products was produced. AGCC filed for bankruptcy in 2011. Their \"stylized anchor\" trademark logo, which consists of two angular letter, G oriented back-to-back (or “mirrored” ) was registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on February 19, 1985.
