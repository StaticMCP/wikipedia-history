The documentary wrestles with the question of how to maintain dignity in the face of terror.\nBackground\nHistorians cite the Karabakh war (1989–1994) as one of the first signs of the Soviet Union's collapse.\nVardan Hovhannisyan, front line journalist and former prisoner of war, lived alongside soldiers, doctors, nurses, villagers, and children caught in the conflict, capturing their immediate thoughts, impressions and last words to their families. He spent years processing his war experience before finally creating the retrospective documentary.\nCritical reception\nHe does not emphasize the political side of the conflict, but the psychological effects the war had on the young soldiers. He juxtaposes chaotic and terse frontline images of 12 years ago with panoramic shots in fixed frames of the beautiful scenery today. But all this calm is an illusion, as one soldier puts it.'\n–International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA).\nTribeca Film Festival Executive Director Peter Scarlet comments:\n\"...what the film offers is something quite remarkable: it's made by a filmmaker who covered the war at the time, and who inter-cuts his old footage with interviews he's filmed now with the surviving soldiers ... it succeeds heartbreakingly in driving home the fact that somehow we know that nothing justifies the fact of taking the precious, irreplaceable life of even a single human being.\"\nThe film has won numerous awards and has been shown in film festivals all over the world including IDFA (Amsterdam), Barcelona Film Festival, One World Film Festival (Prague), Doc Aviv (Tel Aviv), Al-Jazeera Film Festival, Zagreb Film Festival, Hot Docs (Toronto), Belfast Film Festival and Tribeca Film Festival (NY), Mexico International Film Festival (Rosarito), etc.\nAwards and nominations\n* Tribeca Film Festival, NY - Best New Documentary Filmmaker\n* IDFA - Nomination for the Joris Ivens Award at the FIPRESCI prize\n* Mexico Festival - Special Jury Prize\n* Trieste Film Festival - Audience award\n* ZagrebDox Film Festival - Special Mention in the International competition\n* Docaviv Film Festival - Special mention award\n* Golden Apricot Film Festival - Best Intl.
