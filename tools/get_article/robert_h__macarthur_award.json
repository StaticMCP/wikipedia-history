MacArthur Award is a biennial prize given by the Ecological Society of America to ecologists for their pivotal contributions to their field. The acceptance speeches of many recipients have been given at the annual meeting of the society and subsequently published in the ESA's journal, Ecology.\nThe following is a self-descriptive quote taken from the Robert H. MacArthur Award page on the ESA's website: \"The Robert H. MacArthur Award is given biennially to an established ecologist in mid-career for meritorious contributions to ecology, in the expectation of continued outstanding ecological research. Nominees may be from any country and need not be ESA members. The recipient is invited to prepare an address for presentation at the annual meeting of the society and for publication in Ecology.\"\nRecipients\nSource: [https://esa.org/history/robert-h-macarthur-award/ ESA]\n*1983 Robert Treat Paine, United States\n*1984 Robert McCreadie May, United Kingdom\n*1986 Thomas W.
