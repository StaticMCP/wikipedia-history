It is the sequel to The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 (2011) and the fifth and final installment in The Twilight Saga film series. The film stars Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner, reprising their roles as Bella Swan, Edward Cullen, and Jacob Black, respectively; Mackenzie Foy portrays Renesmee Cullen. The ensemble cast includes Billy Burke, Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed, Jackson Rathbone, Ashley Greene, Michael Sheen, and Dakota Fanning. In the film, Bella, now a vampire, aligns with the Cullens, the werewolves, and other allies to face the Volturi, who view her half-human, half-vampire child as a possible threat.\nSummit Entertainment announced that Breaking Dawn would be adapted into a two-part film on June 10, 2010. Principal photography for both parts began on November 1, 2010, and wrapped on April 22, 2011. The second part was shot in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; and Vancouver, Canada.\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 premiered at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on November 12, 2012, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16, by Summit Entertainment. The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $868 million worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing film of The Twilight Saga series, and the highest-grossing film released by Summit Entertainment. The film received eleven nominations at the 33rd Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony and won seven awards, including Worst Picture making it the highest-grossing film to win the award.\nPlot\nThe film continues from the events of the previous film, as Bella, who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation. After her vampire husband Edward Cullen helps her tame her initial thirst for blood, Bella is introduced to their daughter Renesmee. The rest of the Cullens and Bella's werewolf friend Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has \"imprinted\" on her, a werewolf phenomenon that makes Jacob and Renesmee soul-mates.\nMeanwhile, Bella's father, Charlie, has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle, the Cullen patriarch and a medical doctor, announces that they have to leave Forks, Washington, to protect their identities.\nJacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tells him that Bella is alive and vaguely describes that she has transformed, revealing his wolf form to Charlie to persuade him to stop asking further questions. Charlie goes to the Cullen house to see Bella and meet Renesmee. He accepts that Bella is now recovered but somehow different, though he does not know what has changed or where Renesmee came from, instead accepting she is \"adopted\".\nSeveral months pass with Carlisle monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. The vampire Irina spots Renesmee in the forest and mistakenly assumes she is an \"immortal child\": a type of vampire transformed in childhood who, because it cannot be reasoned with or trained, sucks the blood out of humans uncontrollably. The creation of such children is outlawed by the vampire leadership, the Volturi, and anyone caught with one is executed on the spot. Irina reports the supposed crime to the Volturi.\nAfter Edward's sister Alice, who can see glimpses of the future, experiences a vision of the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, she instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child.\nAs the Volturi serve punishments swiftly, the Cullens and their werewolf allies prepare for a possible battle. Bella soon realizes she has a special ability: a powerful mental shield that had protected her from Edward's mind-reading even when she was human, which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire superpowers.\nThe army of the Volturi arrives in Forks, led by Aro, who can read people's minds by touching them. Seeing the Cullens alongside their witnesses and allies, the Volturi hesitate. The Cullens are able to prove to Aro that Renesmee is not an immortal child.\nHowever, the Volturi are eager to subdue the Cullens to forcibly enlist their talented members, so they summarily execute Irina for her mistake to provoke the Cullens into battle. But before an all-out fight breaks out, Alice appears in time to give Aro her vision of the future if fighting ensues.\nIn Alice's violent vision, Carlisle, Aro, and several others on both sides are killed, including other Volturi, Cullens, and werewolves. Aro, despite being afraid of the vision, still wants to execute Renesmee as she might be a threat to the vampires' secrecy.\nAlice reveals their final witness, a Mapuche man from South America, who is a half-human half-vampire, just like Renesmee. He proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not one either. The Volturi unhappily leave, Aro concluding that there will be no battle today.\nBack at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella greeting Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee, also a couple, on a sun-dappled beach. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her.\nAlone in their favorite meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment they have shared together in a montage. They kiss after Bella tells him, \"nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you\", and he romantically responds \"There’s one exception\".\nCast\n*Kristen Stewart as Bella Cullen (née Swan)\n*Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen\n*Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black\n*Mackenzie Foy as Renesmee Cullen\n*Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen\n*Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale\n*Peter Facinelli as Carlisle Cullen\n*Elizabeth Reaser as Esme Cullen\n*Kellan Lutz as Emmett Cullen\n*Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale\n*Billy Burke as Charlie Swan\n*Michael Sheen as Aro\n*Jamie Campbell Bower as Caius\n*Dakota Fanning as Jane\n*Christopher Heyerdahl as Marcus\n*Cameron Bright as Alec\n*Casey LaBow as Kate\n*MyAnna Buring as Tanya\n*Maggie Grace as Irina\n*Lee Pace as Garrett\n*Christian Camargo as Eleazar\n*Mía Maestro as Carmen\n*Noel Fisher as Vladimir\n*Guri Weinberg as Stefan\n*Joe Anderson as Alistair\n*Angela Sarafyan as Tia\n*Rami Malek as Benjamin\n*Daniel Cudmore as Felix\n*Judith Shekoni as Zafrina\n*Tracey Heggins as Senna\n*Charlie Bewley as Demetri\n*J.

She found the greatest challenge in writing the scripts to be the final sequence of Part 2, explaining, \"The final battle sequence is a big challenge because it lasts 25 pages. It's almost an entire three-act story in and of itself. You have to track [keep it all in one setting] hundreds of characters. It's an enormous challenge to choreograph on the page and for Bill [Condon] to choreograph on the stage.\" She had written various drafts of the scene but, at the time, hadn't revised or discussed them with Condon yet. She said, \"That's the next big hurdle to sit down with the stunt coordinator and create the ballet. It's a lot of work. I'm exhausted, but we're intent on making them the best scripts yet.\" Producer Wyck Godfrey called Part 2 \"an action film in terms of life-and-death stakes\" and said that in Part 1 \"there are the pangs of newlywed tension that occur that are relatable even in a fantasy film. Marriage is not quite the experience that they thought it was.\"\nGodfrey considered releasing the second film in 3D to differentiate between the time before and after Bella becomes a vampire, an idea originally proposed for The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, but said that the decision was up to Condon. However, he said that if the second film were to be released in 3D, he would like to shoot it with the proper equipment in \"real\" 3D as was done with Avatar (2009), not convert it into 3D in post-production as was done with Clash of the Titans (2010).\nFilming\nPrincipal photography started on November 1, 2010, and wrapped on April 22, 2011, ending the franchise's three years of production since March 2008. Filming was shot on location in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana; and Vancouver, Canada. Filming also occurred at Raleigh Studios in Baton Rouge.\nOn the subject of the final day and her final moment as Bella, Stewart stated, \"After that scene, my true final scene, I felt like I could shoot up into the night sky and every pore of my body would shoot light. I felt lighter than I've ever felt in my life.\"\nIn April 2012, the crew and some of the cast, including Pattinson and Stewart, returned for reshoots to pick up some additional shots for technical work. These re-shoots did not include any new scenes or dialogue.\nSpecial effects\nTippett Studio first began working on the CGI (computer-generated imagery) wolves in February 2009 for The Twilight Saga: New Moon, and the look of the creatures has evolved, becoming more photo-real over the course of the saga, with the input of three different directors. \"It's a subtle balance of just how anthropomorphic these wolves are,\" says Eric Leven. \"Bill [Condon] wanted to make sure that we had a sense of the human or the shapeshifter in there. Finding that balance of how much of a human performance versus an animal performance was important for Bill.\"\nLeven adds, \"Bill has always treated the wolves as characters and never as computer-generated things, and directs them in the same way he'd direct any actor. He would always give us direction like Sam should be angrier. It's the best way to work. His treating these creatures as characters, instead of just computer bits, was really great.\"\n\"Because we've been working on this franchise for such a prolonged period of time, we've been able to improve the look from show to show,\" comments Phil Tippett. \"Wolves generally are pretty darn clean and since Bill wanted the wolves rangier, that means a lot more fur matting and clumping, like they've lived out in the woods. We edged towards something a bit more feral.\"\n\"However, there is also a balance between look and technology,\" adds Tippett. \"The body count of the wolves escalates and because we're adding a great deal more hair to get the right texture, that fur really ups the rendering time. We've gone from four wolves to eight to twelve, to sixteen in Part 2. So we have to be very careful about that balance because it takes hundreds of hours to render each wolf.\"\nMusic\nIt was revealed in January 2012 that the soundtrack for Part 2 had already started production. Confirmed for the soundtrack in advance were \"Heart of Stone\" by Iko, which plays when Edward and Bella are talking in the cottage after finding Alice's note and \"Where I Come From\" by Passion Pit, which will play when Bella wakes up from her transformation. The lead single from the soundtrack is \"The Forgotten\", performed by the American rock band Green Day. \"A Thousand Years, Pt. 2\" by the American singer Christina Perri is also featured on the soundtrack album.\nCarter Burwell, the composer of Twilight and Breaking Dawn: Part 1, returned to score the final installment of the series.\nRelease\nBox office\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 earned $293 million in North America and $575 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $868 million.

The consensus states: \"It's the most entertaining Twilight, but that's not enough to make Breaking Dawn Part 2 worth watching for filmgoers who don't already count themselves among the franchise converts.\" At Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 31 critics. Audiences polled on CinemaScore gave it an average rating of \"A\".\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The final installment of the immortal Bella/Edward romance will give its breathlessly awaiting international audience just what it wants\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Breaking Dawn: Part 2 starts off slow but gathers momentum, and that's because, with Bella and Edward united against the Volturi, the picture has a real threat\". Sara Stewart of the New York Post wrote, \"Finally, someone took the source material at its terribly written word and stopped treating the whole affair so seriously\". Justin Chang of Variety praised the performance of Stewart by saying, \"No longer a mopey, lower-lip-biting emo girl, this Bella is twitchy, feral, formidable and fully energized, a goddess even among her exalted bloodsucker brethren\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, \"Despite the slow start Mr. Condon closes the series in fine, smooth style. He gives fans all the lovely flowers, conditioned hair and lightly erotic, dreamy kisses they deserve\".\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, saying \"its audience, which takes these films very seriously indeed, will drink deeply of its blood. The sensational closing sequence cannot be accused of leaving a single loophole, not even some of those we didn't know were there\". He concluded by saying, \"Breaking Dawn, Part 2 must be one of the more serious entries in any major movie franchise... it bit the bullet, and I imagine fans will be pleased.\" Helen O'Hara of Empire gave the film a mixed review and said, \"Fans will be left on a high; other viewers will be confused but generally entertained by a saga whose romance is matched only by its weirdness\".\nHome media\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2013. As of June 1, 2014, Breaking Dawn: Part 2 has sold 4,810,249 DVDs along with 1,224,869 Blu-ray Discs for $71,418,469 and $24,472,107, respectively, totaling $99,195,325.\nSpin-offs\nIn September 2016, Lionsgate co-chairman Patrick Wachsberger stated that a sequel was \"a possibility\", but would only go ahead if Stephenie Meyer wanted to do one. On August 8, 2017, Variety reported that Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer has interest in having spinoffs made for The Twilight Saga, and wants to create a writers' room to explore the idea.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=6; style=\"text-align: center; background:#ffffff;\"\n!Year !!Award !!Category !!Recipients !!Result !!\n|-\n|rowspan=5|2013\n|rowspan=5|Empire Cinemas Alternative Movie Awards\n|Best On-Screen Couple\n|Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart)\n|\n|rowspan=5|\n|-\n|Best On-Screen Kiss\n|Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart)\n|\n|-\n|Best Fight Scenes\n|Breaking Dawn – Part 2\n|\n|-\n|Best Film Villain\n|Aro (Michael Sheen)\n|\n|-\n|Best Male Body\n|Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner)\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=11|2013\n|rowspan=11|Golden Raspberry Awards\n|Worst Picture\n|Breaking Dawn – Part 2\n|\n|rowspan=11|\n|-\n|Worst Actor\n|Robert Pattinson\n|\n|-\n|Worst Actress\n|Kristen Stewart(for Breaking Dawn – Pt. 2 and Snow White and the Huntsman)\n|\n|-\n|Worst Supporting Actor\n|Taylor Lautner\n|\n|-\n|Worst Supporting Actress\n|Ashley Greene\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Worst Screen Couple\n|Mackenzie Foy and Taylor Lautner\n|\n|-\n|Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart\n|\n|-\n|Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel\n|Breaking Dawn – Part 2\n|\n|-\n|Worst Director\n|Bill Condon\n|\n|-\n|Worst Screenplay\n|Melissa Rosenberg and Stephenie Meyer\n|\n|-\n|Worst Screen Ensemble\n|Entire cast of Breaking Dawn – Part 2\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|MTV Movie Awards\n|Best Shirtless Performance\n|Taylor Lautner\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Moviefone Fonie Award\n|Most Extreme Role Adjustment\n|Kristen Stewart(for Breaking Dawn – Pt. 2 and On the Road)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\n|Favorite Movie Actress\n|Kristen Stewart\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards\n|Favourite UK Actor\n|Robert Pattinson\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|People's Choice Awards\n|Favorite Movie Fan Following\n|Twihards\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Richard Attenborough Film Award\n|British Performer of the Year\n|Robert Pattinson\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2013\n|rowspan=2|Virgin Media Award\n|Hottest Movie Actor\n|Robert Pattinson\n|\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n|Hottest Movie Actress\n|Kristen Stewart\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Young Artist Award\n|Best Performance in a Feature Film – Supporting Young Actress\n|Mackenzie Foy\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|2013\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Teen Choice Awards\n| Choice Movie: Romance Actress\n| Kristen Stewart\n|\n|\n|-\n|Choice Movie: Scene Stealer\n|Kellan Lutz\n|\n|\n|-\n|Choice Movie: Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actor\n|Taylor Lautner\n|\n|\n|-\n|Choice Movie: Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actress\n|Kristen Stewart\n|\n|\n|-\n| Choice Movie: Sci-Fi/Fantasy\n|Breaking Dawn – Part 2\n|\n|\n|-\n|Choice Movie: Romance Actor\n|Robert Pattinson\n|\n|\n|-\n|Choice Movie: Romance\n|Breaking Dawn – Part 2\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Vampire films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}"
