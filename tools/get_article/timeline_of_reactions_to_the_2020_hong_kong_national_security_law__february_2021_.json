      "text": "# Timeline of reactions to the 2020 Hong Kong national security law (February 2021)\n\nOn 22 February 2021, Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, proposed that Hong Kong's governance had to be in the hands of \"patriots\". Observers considered it possible that the definition of \"patriot\" would require candidates for public office to embrace the rule of the Chinese Communist Party, as also suggested by Hong Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang; and that this signified a departure from the position that had prevailed since a speech by China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1984.\nBritish and Australian governments reminded their nationals that dual nationality was no longer recognized in Hong Kong. On 28 February, 47 pro-democracy protestors from the 6 January arrests were called to a court session on 1 March; their earlier bail agreements had set the session date to early April.\n1 February\nJimmy Lai court hearing\nMedia tycoon and founder of Next Digital, Jimmy Lai, was accused of violating the national security law and had been granted bail by the High Court on 23&nbsp;December 2020. Public prosecutors subsequently argued that the bail provisions had been incorrectly interpreted, and their appeal was admitted on 31&nbsp;December. A panel of five judges at the Court of Final Appeal, three of whom were hand-picked by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, heard the statements of both parties. They centered around the meaning of Article&nbsp;42 of the National Security Law, which puts the onus on the criminal suspect or defendant to prove that they would not endanger national security if released. The panel was to further determine if the December bail decision had been legally valid, and the hearing was adjourning. Outside court, pro-Beijing protesters gathered, with a banner of Politihk Social Strategic reading, \"Severely punish Jimmy Lai. Denounce the black hand of political black violence.\"\n2 February\nChris Tang: In 2020 the police arrested 97 persons suspected of violating National Security Law\nCommissioner of Hong Kong Police, Chris Tang, stated in a video conference of the Legislative Council Security Affairs Committee that in 2020, the police arrested 97 persons suspected of violating the Hong Kong national security law, on suspicion of splitting the country, subverting state power, colluding with foreign forces, and terrorist activities. Eight of them were prosecuted. As for the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a total of 10,200 people were arrested by the end of December 2020, of which 40% were students, nearly 2,450 people were prosecuted, judicial procedures involving more than 940 accused were completed, and more than 190 people imprisoned. Tang said that social order had been \"gradually restored\" in the city, and that investigations would continue to adopt an \"intelligence-driven\" approach. He emphasized that police would \"seriously prevent illegal activities from reviving\", and that it would have to stop \"radical individuals from launching lone wolf attacks\".\nCarrie Lam responds to the relaxation of BNO's naturalization eligibility\nCarrie Lam responded to the relaxation of the BNO application for naturalization qualifications, accusing the British government of violating its promises and 'political packaging, full of false reasoning', providing Hong Kong people holding BNOs with a path to residency and naturalization in the UK. Regarding the belief that the United Kingdom, as a large economy, does not care about benefits from Hong Kong, Lam pointed out that Hong Kong has always been an important source of foreign investment in the United Kingdom, and British real estate developers also clearly regard Hong Kong people as their main sales targets.\n3 February\nAmerican banker police assault case\nRadio Free Asia reported that a 35-year-old American banker was charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer at MTR Causeway Bay station on 7 December 2019. He was charged with assaulting a police officer and alternate ordinary assault. During the hearing of the case in the Eastern Magistrates' Court, the defense claimed that some CCTV footage in the station was deleted by the MTR due to police actions. It believed that the trial would be unfair to the defendant and therefore applied for termination of the hearing. The police admitted in writing that they destroyed the first set of CCTV footage and only provided the second set of CCTV footage to the court. In addition, the defense filed an application to the court, alleging that the original alert in the case had a large amount of evidence of illegality, including the Good Citizen Award awarded in cash to major witnesses.\nHong Kong University Students' Union screened the documentary film 'Lost in Fumes'\nHong Kong University Students' Union organized a total of three screenings of the documentary Lost in Fumes, a documentary about Edward Leung.

If students raise slogans and pull links in the school, school authorities should immediately dissuade them, and point out if they are suspected of illegal activities or if necessary, consult the police-civil relations officer of the police district. In serious or emergency situations, they can even call the police and record the suspected illegal acts, persons and details.\nThe bureau requires schools to fully implement national security education within two academic years, and establish a national security education working group, which needs to submit a work report every year. National security content is to be integrated into a wide range of subjects, such as general studies in elementary schools, Chinese subjects, and Chinese history, history, economics, corporate finance, geography, and biology in high schools.\nIp Kin-yuen, a former legislator of the education sector, criticized the Education Bureau for not consulting the sector or holding a press conference to explain the guidelines, saying that the practice was counterintuitive and broad in scope, thus pressurizing the principals and teachers of primary and secondary schools. Edward Wong, a member of the non-governmental legal review group, believes that it will threaten the academic freedom of schools.\nCanada announces 3-year work visa scheme for overseas graduates from Hong Kong\nThe Canadian government announced that Hong Kong citizens who have graduated from a Canadian college or equivalent foreign education in the past 5 years can apply for a work visa for a maximum period of 3 years.

Lam said that in the past two years of social turmoil, coupled with the raging COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, she has seen the Internet flooded with issues such as 'doxxing', hateful and discriminatory remarks, and fake news. She was referring to governments around the world introducing legislative or administrative measures to deal with these issues, and said that the Hong Kong government will study the approach in other countries and places. She added that it is difficult to submit a comprehensive legislative proposals in the short term, but it will first deal with the more urgent 'doxxing' behavior.\n5 February\nFemale nurse sentenced to community service order for disclosing police officer's personal data\nA 25-year-old part-time female nurse was convicted of using the computer at the Kowloon No. 1 Dermatology Specialty Center on 13 August 2019 for doxxing on her personal Instagram the details of a police officerhis name, Hong Kong identity card number, date of birth, and phone number, with the title \"Mile of the Black Policemen and Doctors\".

Tang denied that the police's performance had deteriorated, and instead pointed out that 'fake news' on the Internet undermined the relationship between the police and the public. Democratic Party chairman Lo Kin-hei criticized Tang for \"living his own lies in the world.\" Tang also claimed that of the arrested persons in connection with the anti-amendment law, only 19 received the Superintendent's warning, which he believed was because those warned had been led to believe that refusing to speak after being arrested would help their cause.\n7 February\nRadio host charged with sedition\nNational Security Department of the Hong Kong Police officially charged the radio host Wan Yiu-sing (a.k.a. Giggs) with performing an act with seditious intent. The prosecution reportedly accused Giggs of making seditious remarks through online comments inciting others to try and overthrow the Chinese Communist Party, endorsing the independence of Hong Kong, Taiwan's right to self-determination and primary elections and assisting Hong Kong criminals to escape to Taiwan. Magistrate Victor So refused to release the defendant on bail, and the trial was scheduled for 10 May.\n8 February\nNo jury in the first national security law court case\nOn 1 July 2020, a defendant, Tong Ying-kit, was involved in driving a motorcycle with the Liberate Hong Kong flag and crashing into a police officer. He was subsequently charged with 'inciting secession', the first to be prosecuted under the national security law. It transpired that Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng had earlier in the month written to the legal team of Tong to advise that he would only be tried by three judges as per the provisions of the national security law, out of concern for the safety of jurors.\nPolice seized explosives in Fanling\nPolice seized 23.5 kilograms of bomb materials, bows and arrows, extendable batons and political flyers at a flat in Wing Fok Centre in Fanling.

It also said that the bureau was currently handling the case, not the national security division.\n9 February\nJimmy Lai denied bail\nCourt of Final Appeal issued a verdict, and the five judges unanimously ruled that the prosecutor's appeal was successful and the decision to bail Jimmy Lai was revoked. The court held that when the High Court approved Lai's bail, it incorrectly cited the legal principles in the case of Tong Ying-kit, the first defendant involved in allegedly violating the national security law, and that the case also misinterpreted Article 42, misunderstanding the nature and effectiveness of the new threshold requirements.\nAbout 40 citizens waited in line outside the court before the trial, including deputy director of the European Union Office in Hong Kong Charles Whiteley, League of Social Democrats member Tsang Kin-shing, Emeritus Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen, CEO of Next Digital Cheung Kim-hung, social activist Grandma Wong and others, generally in good order. Some expressed their hope that they would be able to enter the venue to support Lai, having lined up outside the court more than 12 hours in advance. Outside the court, about 10 pro-Beijing citizens held up signs and slogans in the demonstration area.\nFile:People queue entry to court 20210209.png|About 40 members of the public lined up outside the court before the trial begins\nFile:LSD protest outside Court of Final Appeal 20210209.png|LSD member Leung Kwok-hung and Raphael Wong protesting outside the Court of Final Appeal while holding up banners.\nFile:Leung Kwok-hung 20210209.png|Leung Kwok-hung leaving Court of Final Appeal while chanting slogans\nFile:People protest againt Jimmy Lai 20210209.png|Pro-Beijing protesters outside the court held placards and chanted slogans\n10 February\nAustralia says Hong Kong no longer recognizes dual citizenship\nAustralia updated its travel guidelines for Hong Kong, stating that Hong Kong no longer recognized dual nationality.

She also said that some people misunderstood the national security law deliberately or due to inadequate understanding. Regarding the government's research on criminalizing 'doxxing', Cheng said that the Department of Justice would cooperate with relevant policy bureaus in the drafting work, and provide legal suggestions on amending the law.\nChris Tang said that police may introduce alternative weapons to reduce force\nWhen the Commissioner of Police Chris Tang visited his colleagues at Cheung Chau Police Station, he said that the police had introduced two weapons, including tear gas guns and pepper ball pistols.

In his letter, Kwok stated that Apple Daily not only ignored the unreasonable sanctions imposed by individual countries on Hong Kong, but also made false claims about arrests made in accordance with the law . The letter also emphasized that the police force has strict rules on the use of force, and the force used must be the minimum force required to complete a legal task.

The guidelines had previously stated that basic rights and freedoms are respected in Hong Kong, but the update raised concerns about lack of freedom of speech and diminishing freedoms. It pointed out that after the implementation of the Hong Kong national security law, four pro-democracy legislators were disqualified, the third time that China violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration.

He was later charged with obstructing police. The case was officially opened in West Kowloon Magistrates' Court. The court had originally arranged for 7 reporters to enter the courtroom, but in the morning, security staff did not allow reporters to enter, on the grounds that the screen could not completely conceal the appearance of an anonymous witness. Journalists from Apple Daily and Stand News were among those prevented from entering, the first time the court denied journalists access on this ground. The reporters were allowed to enter after police officers had completed their testimony.\n18 February\nBail application of Jimmy Lai denied by High Court\nMedia tycoon Jimmy Lai applied to the High Court for bail on charges of fraud and under the Hong Kong national security law.

He stated that China must strictly implement the 'patriots ruling Hong Kong' principle to consciously defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose any secession; Hong Kong must respect and recognize the system led by the Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system.

He said that the turmoil in the second half of 2019 to 2020, when the raging COVID-19 pandemic had dealt unprecedented blows to Hong Kong's economy and people's livelihoods, had 'exposed loopholes and deficiencies in the governance and policy implementation of the SAR government.' He believes that if one country, two systems is to go on, the thinking of the SAR government and the entire governance system also need to be adjusted. He also said that when CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to HK Chief Executive Carrie Lam's 2020 work report, he emphasized that Hong Kong's restoration from chaos to governance revealed a profound truth - to ensure the stability and long-term practice of one country, two systems, they must always insist on 'patriots ruling Hong Kong.' Regarding the concept of 'patriots ruling Hong Kong', Tam believes that political participants must agree with the central government's comprehensive governance over and the political system of Hong Kong, and must be loyal. Hong Kong will never allow political participants to collude with foreign forces, openly undermine national sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n20 February\nLeticia Wong and the High School Student Concern Group fined by police\nAt about 2pm, Sha Tin District Councillor Leticia Wong and the Secondary School Student Concern Group Alliance was at the Lai Street station in City One, Sha Tin.

Democratic Party Central Committee member Winfield Chong stated that the police arranged identification procedures in August of the previous year and identified two suspects. But so far, no arrangements have been made for appearances in court. He pointed out that as time passes, it will increase the difficulty of identifying people. At the same time, he said that there were more such episodes, but the police's attitude was passive, and he was disappointed and distressed by the lack of investigation.\nHigh School Student Concern Group protest Liberal Studies reform\nSix members of the Secondary School Student Concern Group were at Baijie station in Kwun Tong this afternoon to oppose the revision of the Liberal Studies subject to the national education subject. Although the 6 people were divided into 2 groups, wearing masks and maintaining a distance of more than 1.5 meters between them, the police decided that they were violating the gathering restriction order, since they had the same purpose, no matter how far apart they were. This could potentially have resulted in a total fine of HK$30,000, but the police only issued a warning afterwards, and the group finally decided to leave the station.\nStudent Politicism fined for setting up street booth\nIn the afternoon, the organization Student Politicism set up a street station on Soy Street in Mong Kok, urging the citizens to boycott the government's LeaveHomeSafe mobile app. The police car was parked outside the street station on alert. At about 5pm, a large number of police officers went to the street to warn those present that they were violating the gathering restriction order. Some people chanted anti-government slogans and played protests songs. The police officers immediately pulled up an orange belt to cordon off the scene, and waving purple flags, warned those present that they were violating the national security law. Three members of the organization were intercepted by police officers for investigation and issued warnings to them to adhere to gathering restriction order. The organizer, Wong Yat-chin, said that the police said that even if they were separated by more than 1.5 meters, they were dissatisfied because they had raised the same slogan and were regarded as a \"gathering with a common purpose.\"\n22 February\nAgnes Chow and Ivan Lam withdraw their bail application\nJailed activists Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam withdrew their bail application after High Court judge Andrew Chan said he would be referring the case to the Court of Appeal, and thus their bail would be denied. Lawyers for both activists later said the pair will both serve out their sentences, with Lam due to be released in April and Chow in June.\nXia Baolong said that patriots ruling Hong Kong is the core of the one country, two systems policy\nXia Baolong, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended the online seminar of the National Hong Kong and Macau Research Association, setting the tone for the principle of \"patriots ruling Hong Kong\", indicating that Hong Kong's governance must be in the hands of patriots to fully and accurately implement the one country, two systems policy. He pointed out that the unprecedented chaos in Hong Kong was due to loopholes in the electoral system, which allowed anti-China chaos in Hong Kong to stir up troubles, and the principle of 'patriots ruling Hong Kong' could not be implemented. He also alleged that claiming to support one country, two systems while opposing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is 'contradictory'. Therefore, a number of 'patriots' standards are listed, including strict compliance with the Constitution of Mainland China and Hong Kong Basic Law, respect for Beijing's leading power, compliance with Hong Kong's actual conditions, implementation of an administrative leadership system, and sound institutional guarantees. He also mentioned the need to improve the relevant systems, especially the election system, to ensure that members of the administrative, legislative, and judicial bodies of the SAR and the heads of important statutory bodies are all true patriots and Hong Kong people. He also stated that it is the minimum standard for Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong. Chief Executive Carrie Lam welcomed the speech by Xia and rejected concerns that the new guidelines would oppress voices of dissent, saying: \"If we must use the word oppress, it's oppressing those who advocate Hong Kong independence, who attempted to push Hong Kong into the abyss of violence and those who forget their ancestry, do not recognise themselves as Chinese, who collude with foreign political organisations to destroy Hong Kong.\"\nObservers considered it possible that the definition of \"patriot\" would include a requirement on candidates for public office to embrace the rule of the Chinese Communist Party, as were reflected in comments by Hong Kong Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang. They also noted that this would signify a departure from the position that had prevailed since a speech by Deng Xiaoping in 1984.\nThe democrats believe that Xia's statement is to further tighten the election space for the democrats and deliberately design a controllable electoral system.\nTwo plead guilty in 721 Yuen Long attack case\nIn the 721 Yuen Long attack, eight men were charged with rioting and intentional assault. The case opened in the District Court. Among the eight people, two defendants pleaded guilty to rioting. The prosecution said it will not prosecute the crime of intentional assault, and those charges will be filed later in the court.

Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Erick Tsang, even stated that the list of examples cannot be exhaustive.

Tsang also predicted that 4 district councilors will be disqualified after the amendment passes, including district councilors Cheng Tat-hung, Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen and Fergus Leung.\nGermany claims that China is trying to intimidate Hongkongers overseas\nSüddeutsche Zeitung published a letter from the German Ministry of the Interior in reply to Gyde Jensen, the chairwoman of the Congressional Human Rights Committee, acknowledging that since the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, the Chinese government may have used different methods to intimidate Hong Kong people living in Germany. The letter mentioned an August 2019 rally in support of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement in Hamburg which had been filmed and photographed by counter-protesters \"presumably for the purpose of intimidation\". The letter also pointed out that there are currently about 720 Hong Kong people holding residence permits in Germany. The spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Wang Wenbin responded that the relevant reports are artificially creating 'speculation', were totally false and had no factual basis.\n25 February\nCUHK cut ties with Student Union\nThe new 'Syzygia' student union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong had been elected, as the sole candidate, on 24 February to run the university student council. Before the election, it had accused university management of having bowed to the government in assisting arrests, in relation to an incident in January where a security guard had been attacked and an unknown powder thrown at him; the university had rejected this and made counter-accusations against Syzygia on 3&nbsp;February. The university announced on 25&nbsp;February that it would cut ties with the student union, including stopping the collection of fees on its behalf; executive members would be ousted from all their ex-officio positions within the university. As justification for its measures, the university cited the failing of the student union executive committee members to clarify their earlier statements, which the university considered to be a potential breach of the national security law and having incurred a reputational risk to the university. The Student Union hastily convened a press conference at around midnight to explain the details, expressing extreme regret and grievance about the incident, which was unprecedented in the more than 50 years since its founding. It criticized the school for suppressing the voice of students and ignoring the authorization by students of the union. Committee members bowed and apologized to their supporters twice.\n26 February\nActivists involved in the primary election notified by the police to report earlier\n55 activists who participated in the primary election were accused of violating the national security law and arrested.

The day they received the National Security Department summons coincided with the Lantern Festival, and they all expressed that they would cherish their time to get together with their families and people around them.\nHKBU cancels co-organization of World Press Photo Exhibition\nHong Kong Baptist University originally planned to hold the 2020 World Press Photo Exhibition on 1 March, displaying a number of works related to the anti-extradition bill protests movement, including the 'Hong Kong Unrest' series by AFP reporter Nicolas Asfouri (Demonstrators sing in the new city square, students pulling chains, photos of police and demonstrators rushing forward), and a fragment of 'Battleground of PolyU' by DJ Clark, reporter of China Daily.
