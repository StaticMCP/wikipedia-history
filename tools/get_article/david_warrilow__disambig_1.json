In 1967 in Paris, he joined Réalités, editing the magazine for eleven years. He co-founded the Mabou Mines theater group in 1970. Three years later, he starred in a theatrical adaptation of Beckett’s The Lost Ones, directed by Lee Breuer and Thom Cathcart. In 1984, he directed a cinematic adaptation of the novella.\nAt Warrilow's request, Beckett wrote A Piece of Monologue for him in 1979, impressed by the actor’s bilingualism. \"In August 1977\", writes James Knowlson, \"the actor, David Warrilow, who had had such a resounding success with the adaptation of The Lost Ones, wrote to Beckett asking him if he would write a solo piece for him to perform. Questioned as to what he had in mind, Warrilow wrote back saying that he 'had an image of a man standing on stage lit from above. He’s standing there in a sort of cone of light. You couldn't see his face and he’s talking about death.' Beckett's reply began: 'My birth was my death.'\"Cited in James Knowlson, Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett, London, Bloomsbury, 1996, p. 649 The play, directed by the actor, premiered in New York in December 1979.\nIn 1981 Warrilow played the \"Reader\" in Beckett's Ohio Impromptu under Alan Schneider’s direction. First performed in Columbus, Ohio, the play toured New York City, Paris, London and Edinburgh. In 1983 in Paris, he starred in Beckett’s That Time and Catastrophe, both plays directed by Alan Schneider. In 1989 in London, Warrilow was Krapp in Beckett’s ''Krapp's Last Tape, directed by Antoni Libera.\nBetween 1986 and 1995, the actor worked with Paris-based theater director Joël Jouanneau, interpreting the texts of Samuel Beckett, Thomas Bernhard, Joseph Conrad, Robert Pinget, and Robert Walser. In 1991 Warrilow played the role of Stanford Garland in the film Barton Fink, directed by Joel Coen. A year after his performance in Beckett’s Company, a theatrical reading directed by Jouanneau at the Petit Odéon in Paris, Warrilow died of complications of AIDS in 1995, aged 60.\nFilmography\n*1975: The Lost Ones (directed by Lee Breuer)\n*1980: Simon (directed by Marshall Brickman) - Blades\n*1981: Strong Medicine (directed by Richard Foreman) - Doctor\n*1984: Le Dépeupleur (directed by David Warrilow) (adaptation of novella by Samuel Beckett)\n*1987: Radio Days (directed by Woody Allen) - Roger\n*1988: Bright Lights, Big City (directed by James Bridges) - Rittenhouse\n*1988: Milan noir (directed by Ronald Chammah) - Moran\n*1989:  (directed by Jacques Rouffio) - Piepe\n*1991: Buster's Bedroom (directed by Rebecca Horn) - Mr. Warlock\n*1991: Barton Fink (directed by Joel Coen) - Garland Stanford\n*1992: Mirror On The Moon (directed by Leandro Katz) - as Corrigan.\n*1994: Les Derniers Jours d'Emmanuel Kant (directed by Philippe Collin) - Immanuel Kant (final film role)\nTheatre\n*1978: The Lost Ones by Samuel Beckett, directed by Lee Breuer and Thom Cathcart, Théâtre Gérard Philipe (Saint Denis)\n*1983: Solo, cette fois by Samuel Beckett, directed by K.
