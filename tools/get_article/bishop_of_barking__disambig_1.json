The total population of these in 2023 was 1,674,392 (estimated) and includes a wide mix of ethnicity and culture. The area comprises 166 churches, 60 of which are set in urban priority area parishes. The Barking area also includes the main site for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Initially, the see was suffragan to the Bishop of St Albans – the Diocese of Chelmsford was not created until 1914. The bishops suffragan of Barking have been area bishops since the Chelmsford area scheme was erected in 1983.\nThe current bishop, since 2022, is Lynne Cullens.  She had previously been Rector of Stockport and Brinnington in the Diocese of Chester since 2019.\nList of bishops\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\"|Bishops of Barking\n|-valign=top\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|From\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"10%\"|Until\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"30%\"|Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color:#D4B1BB\" width=\"45%\"|Notes\n|-valign=top bgcolor=\"white\"\n|align=\"center\"| 1901 ||align=\"center\"| 1919 || Thomas Stevens || (1841–1920).
