This album included the song \"July You're a Woman,\" which John also recorded for his 1969 album California Bloodlines.\nJohn and Buffy married in 1975.  John considered Buffy to be his muse and inspiration for many of his songs.

It was initially released as The Essential John and Buffy.\nThey also recorded ''John Stewart & Darwin's Army'' in 1999 with Dave Crossland and John Hoke, an album of acoustic traditional music with drum accompaniment.\nSolo career\nBuffy's 2012 album Same Old Heart, produced by Craig Caffall, featured the final vocal performance by the late Davy Jones on John Stewart's song \"Daydream Believer\" which had been originally recorded by The Monkees.
