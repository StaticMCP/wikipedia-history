Because of this, most of the town's people entered and exited the town through Mazraat Bani Saab and Beit Kassab. One day, Anton El-Khazen, the leader of the town's militia was kidnapped by the Syrians but a successful mission by the town's people rescued him. The Zghartawis then started to harass the townspeople and assisted the Syrians. The town leaders then met with a military commander of the Lebanese Front who told them that Qnat was at a disadvantage geographically and militarily, but the townspeople insisted on staying to defend it.\nBattle\nOn Tuesday, February 12, 1980, following clashes between the Kateab and the Marada, a Syrian patrol unit entered the town of Qnat and skirmishes then began between the Phalangist combatants. The patrol unit was helped by the Zghortans in order to facilitate their plans.\nOn the morning of the 13th, Lebanese reinforcements arrived headed by Assad Arida and Hani Rahme. 11 Lebanese reinforcements also arrived from the Adonis' Defense Units, headed by Hanna Atik, along with 7 elite ″commandos″, led by Suleiman Hoayek. The next day, 9 more Adonis units arrived, and the day after that, in the morning at 5:30 AM, Syrian special forces started to move towards the school in the middle of the town which was the center of the local militia. Clashes then ensued, and about 7, an RPG fired at a tank and disabled it. The Syrians heavily bombarded the school, destroying the upper floors and wounding two Lebanese fighters.\nOn February 15, 9 more Lebanese reinforcements arrived and that day at 5, the Syrian special forces conducted a targeted bombardment of the school along with a ground operation until they reached 50 meters from the school. Violent clashes then ensued in the east of the town, and at around 3 the Syrians retreated leaving behind dozens of dead and military equipment. A half hour later, they tried to infiltrate again, but they were discovered and forced back. Two Lebanese were wounded that day but morale was high. During the night of the 15th, 6 Syrian troop carriers arrived, carrying reinforcements for the Syrians. Near midnight that night, Bob Haddad led a group of Lebanese fighters through the mountains to the town as well.\nThe following morning, on Saturday, the Lebanese launched a two pronged surprise attack on the Syrians. One group, led by Abou Nader, would attack from Mazraat Bani Saab, and another, led by Samir Geagea, would attack from the town. The attack was effective. On Sunday, February 17, the two parties agreed to a ceasefire, and Lebanese fighters withdrew to Bani Saab and Assaf. That evening, as fighters were attempting to withdraw, one of their fighters, Michel Haddad was killed. Syria then threatened to use aerial attacks, putting helicopters on standby at Hamat Airport. The Syrian army eventually gained control of the town, but not before most residents had evacuated. The Syrians would end up withdrawing from the town and the nearby farms. The fighters retreated to the town of Niha and Beit Kassab, which remained a line of conflict throughout the war. Several thousand civilians were also displaced during the battle and stranded in the cold weather and snow.\nLegacy\nThe battle turned Samir Geagea, the son of a modest family from the same district as Qnat, into a respected leader and a member of Maronite community's new elite. When describing this battle, Bachir Gemayel said: \"The Battle of Qnat paralleled the Hundred Days' War in Achrafieh\".\nReferences"
