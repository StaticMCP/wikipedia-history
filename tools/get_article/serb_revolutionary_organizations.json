A board (committee) was established at the turn of 1861–62, which also included official Lazar Arsenijević Batalaka as president, and lieutenant Franjo Zah. Ilija Garašanin came to manage the operations. Nikolić made up plans for preparations for uprising in the interior of European Turkey. The committee had, according to his memoir, agents in \"Bosnia, Herzegovina, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Bulgaria, Macedonia and Bucharest\" and there were sub-boards in all of them. Nikolić blamed Minister of Defence Milivoje Blaznavac for Serbia's inaction in the matter. Nikolić was himself used as an agent, transferring arms from Russia in 1862 and twice in 1867, which affected the work of the organization.

When the persecution of Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija, Preševo kaza and Sanjak of Novi Pazar by Muslim Albanians and Muslim Slavs increased in the years of 1897–1900, and lack of effort to prosecute the crimes by Ottoman authorities, the Priština Consulate organized assassinations of the worst kachak perpetrators and Albanian organizers of violence on Serbs.
