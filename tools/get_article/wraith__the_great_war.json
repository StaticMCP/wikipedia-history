White Wolf followed the game up with a related historical role-playing game in April 1999, Wraith: The Great War, which was published as a one-off game, unlike the other historical role-playing games which the company was publishing for the other World of Darkness lines at that time.\nReception\nSF Site thought the game had a great narrative pull, and that it was the kind of supplement that made them want to play Wraith: The Oblivion.\nReviews\n*Casus Belli #120\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.legrog.org/jeux/wraith-le-neant/wraith-2eme-edition/great-war-en Guide du Rôliste Galactique]"
