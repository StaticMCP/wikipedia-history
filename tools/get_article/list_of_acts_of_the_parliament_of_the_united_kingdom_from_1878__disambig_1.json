Sources published during the regnal year 41 Vict refer to this session as 41 Vict, because, at that time, it was not known when the session would end.\nDuring the year 1878 and the session 41 & 42 Vict, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed 79 public general acts; 32 public acts of a local character, which were placed amongst the local and personal acts; 238 local acts; and 7 private acts printed by the Queen's Printer.\nThe number shown after each act's short title or popular title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held.\nMost of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\nPublic general acts\n*Acknowledgement of Deeds by Married Women (Ireland) Act 1878 c. 23 — repealed by Conveyancing Act 1882 (45 & 46 Vict. c. 39)\n*Admiralty and War Office Regulation Act 1878 c. 53 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1950 (14 Geo. 6. c. 6)\n*Adulteration of Seeds Act 1878 c. 17\n*Annual Turnpike Acts Continuance Act 1878 c. 62 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1898 (61 & 62 Vict. c. 22)\n*Appropriation Act 1878 c. 65 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Arranmore Polling District Act 1878 c. 75\n*Baths and Washhouses Act 1878 c. 14 — repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1976 (c. 16)\n*Bills of Exchange Act 1878 c. 13 — repealed by Bills of Exchange Act 1882 (45 & 46 Vict. c. 61)\n*Bills of Sale Act 1878 c. 31\n*Bishoprics Act 1878 c. 68\n*British Museum Act 1878 c. 55 — repealed by British Museum Act 1963 (c. 24)\n*Commons (Expenses) Act 1878 c. 56\n*Consolidated Fund Act (6,000,000l.) c. 1 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Act 1878 c. 9 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Consolidated Fund (No. 3) Act 1878 c. 21 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Consolidated Fund (No. 4) Act 1878 c. 45 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act 1878 c. 74 — repealed by Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act 1915 (5 & 6 Geo. 5. c. 66)\n*County of Hertford Act 1878 c. 50 — repealed by Courts Act 1971 (c. 23)\n*Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1878 c. 15 — repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1973 (c. 39)\n*Debtors Act 1878 c. 54\n*Dentists Act 1878 c. 33 — repealed by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1986 (c. 12)\n*Drainage and Improvement of Lands (Ireland) Act 1878 c. 59\n*Duke of Connaught and of Strathearn (Establishment) Act 1878 c. 46.
