Clues to the formation of these galaxies may lie within the vast space being studied. PAndAS is searching for this history, hence the term \"galactic archaeology\".\nThe project is headed by Dr. Alan McConnachie at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics (NRC-HIA), and involves over twenty five investigators from that institute, as well as from universities in Canada, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.\nSee also\n*Extragalactic astronomy\n*Observational cosmology\n*Andromeda XXI\n*Andromeda XXII\nReferences"
