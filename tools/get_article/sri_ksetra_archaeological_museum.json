It is a key institution dedicated to the preservation and exhibition of artifacts recovered from Sri Ksetra, which was once the largest and most influential Pyu settlement, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2014 as part of the \"Pyu Ancient Cities.\"\nHistory\nArchaeological work at Sri Ksetra dates back to the early 20th century, with significant explorations by figures such as Emil Forchammer (1882-1883), Taw Sein Ko, and the Leon de Beylie (1905-1907). In the 1900s, the Epigraphy Department began storing antiquities found at the Sri Ksetra site in a small building. The Thayet Taw Museum was established near the Sri Ksetra palace site between 1907 and 1910. After it burned down in 1915, the first official museum, called Kyaukka Thein Museum, was established there.\nThe current museum building was built between 1960 and 1961, and opened in 1962. Systematic excavations intensified after the 1960s, continually enriching the museum's collection.\nCollection\nThe museum consistently displays around 265 cultural artifacts, though its total collection encompasses a much larger number, with 5,998 objects recorded as of recent inventories. The majority of the artifacts date to the country's Pyu period of the first millennium CE. The collection provides a comprehensive insight into the art, culture, and daily life of the ancient Pyu people.\nReferences"
