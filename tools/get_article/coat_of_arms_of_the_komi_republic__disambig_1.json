The blazon has a field gules, featuring a bird of prey or with the face below corresponding with the goddess Zarni An, and six unhorned elk heads. On December 17, 1997, the Republican State Council passed the law, which changed the official coat of arms definition in order to agree with the rules of heraldry.\nA bird of prey in the traditional interpretation embodies the sun, authority, and the upper world, while elk is associated with power, generosity, and beauty.
