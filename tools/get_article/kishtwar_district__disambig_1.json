Although \"controlled\" and \"held\" are also applied neutrally to the names of the disputants or to the regions administered by them, as evidenced in sources (f) through (h) below, \"held\" is also considered politicized usage, as is the term \"occupied,\" (see (i) below).\n(a)  (subscription required) Quote: \"Kashmir, region of the northwestern Indian subcontinent ... has been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan since the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. The northern and western portions are administered by Pakistan and comprise three areas: Azad Kashmir, Gilgit, and Baltistan, the last two being part of a territory called the Northern Areas. Administered by India are the southern and southeastern portions, which constitute the state of Jammu and Kashmir but are slated to be split into two union territories.\"; (b)  (subscription required) Quote: \"Aksai Chin, Chinese (Pinyin) Aksayqin, portion of the Kashmir region, at the northernmost extent of the Indian subcontinent in south-central Asia. It constitutes nearly all the territory of the Chinese-administered sector of Kashmir that is claimed by India to be part of the Ladakh area of Jammu and Kashmir state.\";  (c)  C. E Bosworth, University of Manchester Quote: \"KASHMIR, kash'mer, the northernmost region of the Indian subcontinent, administered partlv by India, partly by Pakistan, and partly by China. The region has been the subject of a bitter dispute between India and Pakistan since they became independent in 1947\";  (d)  Quote: \"Jammu and Kashmir: Territory in northwestern India, subject to a dispute betw een India and Pakistan. It has borders with Pakistan and China.\" (e)  Quote: \"We move from a disputed international border to a dotted line on the map that represents a military border not recognized in international law. The line of control separates the Indian and Pakistani administered areas of the former Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir.\";   (f)  (subscription required) Quote: \"... China became active in the eastern area of Kashmir in the 1950s and has controlled the northeastern part of Ladakh (the easternmost portion of the region) since 1962.\";  (g)  Quote: \"J&K: Jammu and Kashmir. The former princely state that is the subject of the Kashmir dispute. Besides IJK (Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir. The larger and more populous part of the former princely state.

Its capital is the town of Muzaffarabad. AJK has its own institutions, but its political life is heavily controlled by Pakistani authorities, especially the military), it includes the sparsely populated \"Northern Areas\" of Gilgit and Baltistan, remote mountainous regions which are directly administered, unlike AJK, by the Pakistani central authorities, and some high-altitude uninhabitable tracts under Chinese control.\"  (h)  Quote: \"Kashmir’s identity remains hotly disputed with a UN-supervised “Line of Control” still separating Pakistani-held Azad (“Free”) Kashmir from Indian-held Kashmir.\";  (i)  Quote:\"Some politicised terms also are used to describe parts of J&K. These terms include the words 'occupied' and 'held'.\"\nAs of 2011, it is the largest and the least populous district of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.\nGeography\nKishtwar district has a total area of . The district is bordered by Kargil district in the east and north, Chamba district to the south, and Anantnag and Doda districts to the west. The Chenab river flows through the district, forming the Chenab valley in the southern areas of the district. The Marusudar river, a tributary of Chenab, also flows through the district.\nHistory\nKishtwar is first referred to in the Rajatarangini by the ancient name Kashthavata during the reign of Raja Kalsa of Kashmir (1063–1089), when \"Uttamaraja\", the ruler of Kashthavata visited the court of the Kashmir King in company with several other hill chiefs to pay their respects to the Raja.\nThis place, as said by people, is also mentioned in the epic Mahabharata.\nKishtwar was part of the Jammu state during the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Dev.\nKishtwar became part of the Jammu Dogra state of Raja Gulab Singh, when he annexed it in 1821.\n' in 1913]]\nThe local ruler of this place, Mohammed Tegh Singh, was sent to prison in Lahore jail, where he killed himself. The Dogra state eventually became the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. With the passage of time, Kishtwar became a Tehsil of the Udhampur district and remained so until 1948, when it became part of the newly created District Doda in the wake of first re-organization of the state during the post-independence period. In 2008 it became a newly district as a part of Jammu Division. Now District Kishtwar has become the largest district in term of area in union territory of Jammu & Kashmir with least population.\nAdministration\nKishtwar district consists of 4 Sub-Divisions, 11 tehsils, and 13 blocks.\nFollowing are the blocks: Marwah, Warwan, Dachhan, Kishtwar, Nagseni, Drabshalla, Inderwal, Mughal Maidan, Bunjwah, Machail, Palmar, Thakrie Trigham, and Paddar.\nEach block consists of several panchayats. Block Kishtwar is the 1st block of Kishtwar District and Bairoon Town 1st Kishtwar is the 1st panchayat of Block Kishtwar, Bairoon town panchayat consists of Panditgam, Zewar, Nagdera, Bucherwal Mohalla, Semmna and Wazgwari.

This gives it a ranking of 586th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of  . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 21.06%. Kishtwar has a sex ratio of 938 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 58.54% (Male 71.75%, Female 44.13%). The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes account for 6.2% and 16.5% of the population of the district.\nThe demography of the district is complex as compared to its neighboring districts primarily because of the wide diversity in its population. In the past, Kishtwar was largely inhabited by Kishtwari people before people started settling here from Kashmir and other adjoining areas. The reasons for Kashmiri people settling here in the past in 17th and 18th century is matter of ambiguity between historians. However, Sumantra Bose says it was repression by feudal class that drew people to the district of Doda, Ramban and Kishtwar.\nMuslims are in majority with nearly 58%. Hindus are 41%. There is a small percentage of Buddhists in the far-eastern areas of the district who are the Ladakhis.\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Kishtwar district: religion, gender ratio, and % urban of population, according to the 2011 Census.\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n!|\n!| Hindu\n!| Muslim\n!| Christian\n!| Sikh\n!| Buddhist\n!| Jain\n!| Other\n!| Not stated\n!| Total\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:left;\" | Total\n|| 93,931 || 133,225 || 277 || 450 || 2,094 || 3 || 514 || 202 || 230,696\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n|| 40.72% || 57.75% || 0.12% || 0.20% || 0.91% || 0.00% || 0.22% || 0.09% || 100.00%\n|-\n| colspan=10|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Male\n|| 49,604 || 68,655 || 164 || 296 || 1,056 || 0 || 273 || 117 || 120,165\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Female\n|| 44,327 || 64,570 || 113 || 154 || 1,038 || 3 || 241 || 85 || 110,531\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Gender ratio (% female)\n|| 47.2% || 48.5% || 40.8% || 34.2% || 49.6% || 100.0% || 46.9% || 42.1% || 47.9%\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Sex ratio (no. of females per 1,000 males)\n|| 894 || 940 || – || – || 983 || – || 883 || – || 920\n|-\n| colspan=10|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Urban\n|| 4,398 || 10,288 || 34 || 97 || 24 || 0 || 0 || 24 || 14,865\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Rural\n|| 89,533 || 122,937 || 243 || 353 || 2,070 || 3 || 514 || 178 || 215,831\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:right;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | % Urban\n|| 4.7% || 7.7% || 12.3% || 21.6% || 1.1% || 0.0% || 0.0% || 11.9% || 6.4%\n|-\n|}\n}}\n|label1 = Kashmiri |value1 = 44.60 |color1 = lightgreen\n|label2 = Kishtwari |value2 = 20.67 |color2 = yellow\n|label3 = Gojri |value3 = 14.36 |color3 = tomato\n|label4 = Dogri |value4 = 10.03 |color4 = indigo\n|label5 = Padari |value5 = 7.44 |color5 = lightblue\n|label6 = Hindi |value6 = 1.31 |color6 = orange\n|label7 = Siraji |value7 = 1.25 |color7 = blue\n|label8 = Bhaderwahi |value8 = 0.34 |color8 = darkorchid\n}}\nEconomy\n}}The economy of the area is not regularized with no visible investment from the government.
