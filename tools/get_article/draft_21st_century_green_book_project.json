The 21st Century Green-Book Project's scope includes the entire range of bias crime impacted communities through a one stop website to promote bias crime education and provide victims with access to portals hosted by federal, state, local law enforcement and civil society hosted web portals dedicated to combating bias crimes and incidents.\nUnited States\nUnder U.S. Federal Law Hate or Bias Crimes are prosecuted.

This includes acts of physical harm and specific criminal threats motivated by animus based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.” The list is not exhaustive, while covering a wide range of biases there are state laws that go further in scope.\nBeginning in 1996, the FBI annually produces a report on bias crimes in the United States from voluntary reports from local law enforcement agencies.  The number of bias crimes reported annually range from just over 11,000 to around 20,000 incidents. The [https://www.justice.gov/crt/statutes-enforced-criminal-section FBI Hate Crime Statistics for 2023] number only 11,447 incidents involving 13,857 victims.

An article by the Washington Post on April 15, 2014, reported that 200,000 to 300,000 hate or bias crimes go unreported each year.  That same year the [https://ucr.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2014/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses%20final FBI reported 5,462 single-bias] incidents that involved 6,385 offenses, 6,681 victims, and 5,176 known offenders. The situation is not improving, on January 1, 2023, NPR reported that [https://www.npr.org/2023/01/01/1145973412/researchers-say-the-fbis-statistics-on-hate-crimes-across-the-country-are-flawed FBI's statistics on hate crimes across the country are flawed] The numbers on bias crimes are consistently under reported since statistics were first collected in [https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/1996/hatecrime96.pdf 1996].  The reason for under reporting according to J[https://criminaljustice.spia.princeton.edu/people/jacob-kaplan acob Kaplan, a researcher at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs], may be a lack of awareness that a crime has been committed.\nThe Basis of bias can begin when a person very young as part of the lived experiences, norms and values taught or observed by a member of a family, community, denomination, ethnic, or racial, class or caste system.\nBias is human. Bias is not necessarily bad or good, it the action or inaction of people that can recast a bias as a crime. The set of biases taught or learned can be expanded by the lived experience of the person as they develop experiences.\nFor example, if someone learns through primary or learned experiences gained from others that strawberries are bad--a bias can form against consuming strawberries. People with food biases rarely want to eliminate from existence the foods that they do not like or want to consume. To advocate for a extreme response to a food bias would be seen as absurd and not defensible.\nUnfortunately, biases towards others are not always kept as private matters of preferences, but can lead to violence or threats. Biases that are linked to violence or criminal conduct are crimes, to reduce future threats to ones self and others, they should be reported to authorities or advocacy communities who take bias incident reports.\nPilot Test: Baltimore and Houston\nThe 21st Century Green-Book Project launched a [https://www.21stgb.org/post/21st-century-green-book-project-launches-we-the-people-initiative-to-combat-bias-crimes-at-the-loc We the People Initiative] on Juneteenth 2025, to pilot test of the bias crime reporting portal\nthrough Labor Day 2025.\nThe initiative is founded on the belief that impacted communities cannot wait to be saved—they must take responsibility for restoring the Golden Rule through micro-engagements that shift daily interactions from passive to proactive efforts sustaining peace. By fostering justice, empathy, and inclusivity, individuals can turn small acts into larger movements, reshaping how communities address bias crimes.\nThis effort is based on the words of the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States, which says: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\nThe initiative seeks to align with local [https://www.21stgb.org/partners community partners] that have the mission to combating bias and bias crimes in their communities.\nFuture Plans\nThe 21st Century Green-Book [https://www.21stgb.org/project plans] to expand the bias crime incident reporting options to all communities throughout the United States  starting at the end of 2025 through 2026 with the help of local, state, and federal partners.\nThis big tent approach is intended to stay above competing interests and focus solely on the needs of victims and impacted communities.\nThe Problem\nAccording to [https://sciences.ucf.edu/sociology/person/eaven-holder/ Eaven Holder], [https://www.npr.org/2023/01/01/1145973412/researchers-say-the-fbis-statistics-on-hate-crimes-across-the-country-are-flawed there are 200,000 to 300,000 hate crime incidents in a given year] and the FBI data records less than 10,000 of them.\n[https://www.21stgb.org/about The 21st Century Green-Book Project]\nThe 21st Century Green-Book Project is a nonprofit dedicated to raising awareness about bias and bias crimes with a focus on increasing understanding about its impact on the economy.  Bias in public spaces has a chilling effect freedom of movement, association, travel, and commerce. The challenge is gaining insight into this impact of bias with incomplete data on the incidence of bias.\nThe first step in addressing bias in public policy and commercial decision making is to see it.  Policymakers, advocates, and those who are targets of bias need information to decrease incidents and improve safety.\nThe 21st Century Green-Book Project has created a portal that supports [https://www.21stgb.org/understanding-bias-crimes bias crime education] and provides a one stop web resource to access a range of bias crime [https://www.21stgb.org/report reporting websites].\nThe Origin of Bias in the United States\nThe territories that comprise the United States were occupied by Indigenous People who began arriving about 26,000-19,000 years ago. The origins of bias in this land arrived as populations of people with different origins, lived experiences or beliefs started to make contact with each other.  Conflicts exited among the native people as a consequence of competition for food, living space, and dominance.\nColonization and Colonial Rule\nIn the late 15th Century European  colonization began in the Americas--which included the United States. Colonies in what is now the mainland United States were formed by Britain, France, and Spain. The arrival of Europeans also resulted in conflicts with indigenous people, and later conflicts among colonies as old biases resulted in tensions and conflicts among New World Settlements.\nIndigenous People and Colonization\nThe colonial period of the United States introduced the Colombian Exchange, which brought new animals, plants, crops, technology, people, practices, and disease to the Americas. Native people had no immunity to diseases and no learned experience with technology or comprehension of Europe or its people.\nIndigenous people were treated as curiosities by Europeans who took delegations to Europe to demonstrate how savage they were and to foment bias in the minds of rulers to govern how they would be treated with regards to property rights and legal standing.\nIndigenous people were useful to colonists in helping them to managing the balance of power among the Britain, France and Spain settlements. They were recruited to take sides in inter colonial conflicts, which was influenced by an opposing colony's relationship with a tribe that was an enemy.\nThe idea of property ownership and laws that enforce this right based on a ruler who would never be seen was lost on indigenous people.\nThe drives to own and control land led to forced relocations, armed conflict, and imposition of restrictions on movement that placed people who had no immunity to European diseases in close proximity. Under these conditions, diseases like smallpox, cholera, measles, and mumps when contracted by one person would spread widely and killed in great numbers. An estimated ninety-five percent or 55 million native persons died.  Hundreds of thousands reduced to two thousand in five years is what is reported to have been the case in Florida.\nThe beliefs of native people were discounted and dismissed by bias, and missionaries and governing authorities attempted to convert native people through force. Later, following the colonial period, the children of native people were taken from families and placed in [https://boardingschoolhealing.org/education/us-indian-boarding-school-history/ boarding schools] to reeducate them in an effort to erase their cultural identity.\nThe plight of native people in the history of America is one of dominance, control, and exploitation.\nThe Pursuit of Cheap Labor\nThe drive for colonization was to claim  and hold the land by defending it from all others who would claim it as their own. The next goal was to explore and cultivate it to create wealth that would assure its continued productivity.  The colonials needed labor, but the first colonists were not dominated by trades persons, farmers, or skilled people.\nColonists needed labor to do the hard work necessary for the construction of forts, shelters. The needed farmers to produce food, along with tamers, blacksmiths, and other trades to supply the needed technology and tools to sustain them.  Skilled laborers in Europe had trades and customers and predictable lives.  They were not willing leave these lives behind for an uncertain future, where stories of failed colonies, disease, death and wars with savages offered uncertainty.\nTo completely end the shortage of labor required funds that colonists did not have, so they sought ways to meet the demand for labor. First, they tried to enslave native people who were too susceptible to disease, had cultural and language barriers that made them resistant to adaption of European norms and customs.\nThe next effort to find labor came in the form of indentured servants. These were mostly comprised of poor unskilled labor or low wage workers who wanted to escape poverty in Europe by working for a term of years after which they would be free.\nThe labor of workers needed to clear land of rocks, boulders, trees, vegetation, drain swampy areas, divert creeks and streams, and remove roots that had accumulated from the time when the ocean had receded was substantial.  tobacco proved that the land was fertile and could be productive through his importation of tobacco to the Virginia Colony.\nIndentured Servants from Europe were not always in the best health and found it hard to work in the climate especially that in the South were high temperatures and swamps where malaria carrying mosquitoes took their toll on workers.  They would be employed for a few years then free which meant another unskilled Indentured servant would be needed to train and use until their term ended.\nThe need for labor provide Britain with a solution to more labor when overcrowding in prisons led to the convict labor as indentured servants.  It is estimated that between 50-120,000 prisoners were sent to the American Colonies as indentured servants under the Transportation Act, which created the convict labor system. Most of the prisoners working as indentured servants were in the Mid-Atlantic area what is today Maryland and Virginia. They worked for a term of seven to fourteen years depending on the severity of their offenses then were free.  This program did not end until the end of the American Revolution in 1776.\nThe desire for cheap labor predated the use of prisoners for labor, which carried with it costs to governments and to property owners for labor that would be for a term and no longer. The steady pressure for labor that was cheap and inexhaustible resulted in a corrosive form of labor that would super charge a new global economic model based on chattel slavery. Chattel slavery would establish a self-perpetuating free labor source wherein people are treated like property. Under this system a horse, a plow, a bushel of corn and now a human being could be owned, treated in any manner, and discarded as the owner wished.\nThe process of creating chattel slavery required that all institutions, social norms and values, and religious beliefs affirm and attest to the authority of white benefactors of this economic model had the legal and rights under their religion to own other human beings and any children they may have--or forced to have for the sole benefit of the owner.\nThe first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619. The millions who followed on slave ships did so under the most inhumane conditions imaginable.  Support for chattel slavery was voiced from authorities in Europe and the American colonies. Greed was the motivating factor and no accountability or consequences for the treatment of enslaved persons or their deaths. Later in the laws were passed by Britain to address treatment of enslaved persons, this was the first step towards abolishing the practice of enslaving people.\nBias is not limited to skin color or racial identity, but it has had an outsized impact on bias incidents and crimes because it had such impact on life in the United States.  From the a decision to create a hierarchy based on skin color with two groups black and white, as others with different skin colors arrived they had to find a place in the order of superior to inferior.\nForms of Bias Addressed in Federal Criminal Law:\nRacial Bias;\nSkin Color Bias;\nReligious Discrimination;\nGender Bias;\nSexual Orientation Bias;\nNational Origin Bias; and\nDisability Bias.\nBias divides and prevents cooperation among groups.  This condition impacts groups who are victims of bias may have a history of bias towards other groups that make it difficult to build trust and collaborations. The ability to withstand the pressures of bias requires community efforts that share the burdens and cooperate to create new communities that share the benefits and rewards of economic cooperation.\nThe 21st Century Green-Book Project aims to build a new economic model that transects communities impacted by bias to find the shared experiences that can help to build models for engagement in local neighborhoods and communities to begin the process of healing and building a better life one community at a time."
