Elections under the military regime of Mathieu Kérékou had been indirect, with the president chosen by the National Assembly.\nThe first round, held on 10 March, saw no candidate receive more than 37% of the vote.  Prime Minister Nicéphore Soglo led the field, with Kérékou in second place.  The second round on 24 March resulted in a decisive victory for Soglo, with almost two-thirds of the vote. Voter turnout was 56% in the first round and 64% in the second.\nThe elections marked the first instance in post-colonial Francophone Africa that an opposition candidate won a free election.\nResults\nReferences"
