Since 1979, direction in children's series and specials competed in the same category. However, by the nineties, separate categories were created for the two mediums. In November 2021, it was announced that all Daytime Emmy categories honoring children's programming will be retired in favor of a separate Children's & Family Emmy Awards ceremony that will be held starting in 2022.\nWinners and Nominees\nWinners in bold.
