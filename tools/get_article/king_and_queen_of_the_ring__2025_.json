They were the 24th edition of the men's King of the Ring tournament and third edition of the women's Queen of the Ring tournament that took place from June 9 to June 28, 2025, each held between wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The respective winners were crowned \"King of the Ring\" and \"Queen of the Ring\" and received a world championship match of their respective brand at SummerSlam. In the King of the Ring final, held between two SmackDown wrestlers, Cody Rhodes defeated Randy Orton to earn a match for the Undisputed WWE Championship, while in the Queen of the Ring final, SmackDown's Jade Cargill defeated Raw's Asuka to earn a match for the WWE Women's Championship.\nTournament matches began on the June 9, 2025, episode of Raw and continued to be held across episodes of Raw and SmackDown. The respective tournaments concluded at the Night of Champions pay-per-view and livestreaming event in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on June 28, 2025.\nBackground\nKing and Queen of the Ring are respective men's and women's professional wrestling tournaments periodically held by the American company WWE. The King of the Ring tournament was established in 1985 with Queen of the Ring introduced in 2021 (originally as Queen's Crown; renamed in 2024). The respective winners are crowned the \"King of the Ring\" and \"Queen of the Ring\", and since 2024, they also receive a world championship match of their respective brand at SummerSlam. From 1993 to 2002 and in 2015, the King of the Ring finals took place at the King of the Ring event, while in 2024, both tournament finals took place at the King and Queen of the Ring event, which was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. For all other years the tournaments were held, the finals took place at another event.\nThe 24th King of the Ring and third Queen of the Ring tournaments were announced during the June 6, 2025, episode of SmackDown, with tournament matches beginning on the June 9 episode of Raw and subsequently held across episodes of Raw and SmackDown. First round matches for each tournament consisted of four fatal four-way matches with eight wrestlers each from the Raw and SmackDown brands. The winners of those matches advanced to the semifinals and those subsequent winners advanced to the finals at the Night of Champions pay-per-view and livestreaming event on June 28, 2025, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Unlike prior tournaments since 2019 where there were separate Raw and SmackDown brackets and the respective bracket winners faced each other in the final, the 2025 brackets were mixed, creating the possibility that the final could be between two wrestlers from the same brand (which did in fact happen for the men).\nFinals\nThe King of the Ring final was between two SmackDown wrestlers, thus guaranteeing that regardless of winner, their world championship match at SummerSlam would be for the Undisputed WWE Championship. In the final, Cody Rhodes defeated Randy Orton to become the 2025 King of the Ring.\nIn the Queen of the Ring final, SmackDown's Jade Cargill defeated Raw's Asuka to become the 2025 Queen of the Ring, thus earning a match for the WWE Women's Championship at SummerSlam. Had Asuka won, she would have challenged for the Women's World Championship at the event.\nBrackets\nKing of the Ring\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\"\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#FBB; width:2em\" |\n|Raw\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#CAE1FF; width:2em\" |\n|SmackDown\n|}\n| RD2=Semifinals\n| RD3=Final\n| RD1-team1 = Bron Breakker\n| RD1-score1=–\n| RD1-team2 = Dominik Mysterio\n| RD1-score2=17:05\n| RD1-team3 = Penta\n| RD1-score3=–\n| RD1-team4 = Sami Zayn\n| RD1-score4=Pin\n| RD1-team5 = Aleister Black\n| RD1-score5=–\n| RD1-team6 = Carmelo Hayes\n| RD1-score6=–\n| RD1-team7 = LA Knight\n| RD1-score7=16:15\n| RD1-team8 = Randy Orton\n| RD1-score8=Pin\n| RD1-team9 = Andrade\n| RD1-score9=–\n| RD1-team10 = Cody Rhodes\n| RD1-score10=Pin\n| RD1-team11 = Damian Priest\n| RD1-score11=–\n| RD1-team12 = Shinsuke Nakamura\n| RD1-score12=17:05\n| RD1-team13 = Bronson Reed\n| RD1-score13=17:25\n| RD1-team14 = Jey Uso\n| RD1-score14=Pin\n| RD1-team15 = Rusev\n| RD1-score15=–\n| RD1-team16 = Sheamus\n| RD1-score16=–\n| RD2-team1 = Sami Zayn\n| RD2-score1=11:25\n| RD2-team2 = Randy Orton\n| RD2-score2=17:05\n| RD2-team3 = Cody Rhodes\n| RD2-score3=Pin\n| RD2-team4 = Jey Uso\n| RD2-score4=20:00\n| RD3-team1 = Randy Orton\n| RD3-score1=19:45\n| RD3-team2 = Cody Rhodes\n| RD3-score2=Pin\n}}\nQueen of the Ring\n| RD2=Semifinals\n| RD3=Final\n| RD1-team1 = Kairi Sane\n| RD1-score1=12:50\n| RD1-team2 = Liv Morgan\n| RD1-score2=–\n| RD1-team3 = Rhea Ripley\n| RD1-score3=–\n| RD1-team4 = Roxanne Perez\n| RD1-score4=Pin\n| RD1-team5 = Jade Cargill\n| RD1-score5=Pin\n| RD1-team6 = Michin\n| RD1-score6=–\n| RD1-team7 = Nia Jax\n| RD1-score7=–\n| RD1-team8 = Piper Niven\n| RD1-score8=12:50\n| RD1-team9 = Alba Fyre\n| RD1-score9=–\n| RD1-team10 = Alexa Bliss\n| RD1-score10=Pin\n| RD1-team11 = Candice LeRae\n| RD1-score11=11:00\n| RD1-team12 = Charlotte Flair\n| RD1-score12=–\n| RD1-team13 = Asuka\n| RD1-score13=Pin\n| RD1-team14 = Ivy Nile\n| RD1-score14=–\n| RD1-team15 = Raquel Rodriguez\n| RD1-score15=15:50\n| RD1-team16 = Stephanie Vaquer\n| RD1-score16=–\n| RD2-team1 = Roxanne Perez\n| RD2-score1=11:20\n| RD2-team2 = Jade Cargill\n| RD2-score2=Pin\n| RD2-team3 = Alexa Bliss\n| RD2-score3=9:25\n| RD2-team4 = Asuka\n| RD2-score4=Pin\n| RD3-team1 = Jade Cargill\n| RD3-score1=Pin\n| RD3-team2 = Asuka\n| RD3-score2=8:35\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
