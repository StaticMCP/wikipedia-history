He is a two-time featherweight world champion, having held the International Boxing Federation (IBF) title twice between 2018 and 2022.\nIn 2018, a documentary style movie filmed over two years called Fighting for a City premiered. The film follows Warrington during his pursuit of winning the IBF title in his home town at Elland Road Stadium, the home of Leeds United.\nProfessional career\nEarly career\nWarrington turned professional in 2009 and won on his professional debut against Wolverhampton's Delroy Spencer (11–89–3) in October before defeating Latvia's Pavels Senkovs (2–10–2), winning both four-round contests by 40–36 points decision.\nIn 2010, Warrington won all three of his fights, defeating Danny McDermid (0–1), John Riley (0–0) and Youssef Al Hamidi (7–27–2), winning all of his four-round contests by points decision.\nBy the end of 2011, Warrington maintained his undefeated record with wins over Steve Gethin (11–56–3), Chris Riley (3–3–2), Marc Callaghan (19–21–1), Dougie Curran (5–8–1) and Ian Bailey (7–8), all by points decision.\nIn the first half of 2012, Warrington defeated Dan Naylor (1–8) and Ibrar Riyaz (4–34–1) by points decision.\nIn November, Warrington won his first professional title after he defeated the previously unbeaten Dudley-born prospect Chris Male (11–0) by unanimous decision in a ten-round contest to win the vacant English featherweight title.

The scorecards read 100–91, 98–92, 100–90 in Warrington's favour. The fight took place at the Banqueting Suite at the Elland Road Stadium in Leeds.\nWarrington vs. Mouneimne\nOn 2 November, Warrington won the vacant Commonwealth featherweight title after he defeated the previously undefeated Hull-born prospect Samir Mouneimne by 12th-round stoppage in a 12-round contest. The fight took place at the Ice Arena in Hull and was Warrington's first fight on a Matchroom Boxing show.\n2014\nWarrington vs. Munroe\nIn early April, it was announced that Warrington would make the first defence of his Commonwealth featherweight title against former super-bantamweight world title challenger Rendall Munroe (28–4–1) on 19 April.

Later that month, Munroe announced his retirement from boxing.\nWarrington vs. Lindsay\nOn 28 April, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington would make the second defence of his Commonwealth featherweight title and fight for the vacant British featherweight title against former British champion Martin Lindsay (21–2) at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on 21 May.\nWarrington won by unanimous decision over twelve rounds with all three judges scoring the fight 119–110.\nFive-fight Matchroom deal\nOn 27 August, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington had signed a five-fight deal with the promotional company. Speaking of the deal, Warrington said: \"It’s great to have signed the deal so that I know that there’s going to be more big nights in Leeds in the next year.\"\nPromoter Eddie Hearn said: \"Josh is the biggest ticket seller in the country right now, and we have an opportunity to do something very big in Leeds. We dipped our toe in the water in May and now we’re diving in headfirst. It’s a huge opportunity for Josh and I think we could see one of the most memorable atmosphere in a British arena for some time.\"\nWarrington vs. Dieli\nOn 4 October, Warrington won the vacant EBU European featherweight title after he defeated Italy's Davide Dieli (15–3) by fourth-round stoppage in a twelve-round contest. The fight took place at the First Direct Arena in Leeds.\n2015–2017\nWarrington vs. Tellez\nOn 15 December, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington would fight on the undercard to Arthur Abraham vs Paul Smith in Berlin on 21 February, his first fight of the year.\nLater it was confirmed that Warrington would fight Nicaragua's Edwin Tellez (9–11–5) in an eight-round contest.\nPrior to the fight, Warrington told the Yorkshire Evening Post: \"Even though he's not got an excellent record, he's a fighter that I cannot take lightly.\"\nWarrington won by fifth-round stoppage\nWarrington vs. Tubieron\nOn 7 January, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington would fight Philippines' Dennis Tubieron (19–3–2) in a WBC world title eliminator and for the vacant WBC International featherweight title.

Maybe if I’d listened to my instructions a little bit more, I’d have got him out of there, but it’s all about experience. I can take so much from that fight.\"\nLater that month, Warrington vacated his EBU European featherweight title after suffering a slight injury.\nWarrington vs. Brunker\nOn 22 June, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington would defend his WBC International and Commonwealth featherweight titles against Australia's Joel Brunker (28–1) at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on 5 September.\nWarrington won by unanimous decision over twelve rounds, with all three judges scoring the fight 120–108.\nWarrington vs. Amagasa\nOn 15 February, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington would make the second defence of his WBC International featherweight title against Japan's Hisashi Amagasa (30–5–2), a former world title challenger at super-bantamweight. The fight would headline the show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on 16 April.\nPromoter Eddie Hearn said of the fight: \"Josh is hunting a summer clash with IBF champion Lee Selby, so he cannot afford any slip-ups against Japanese banger Amagasa.\"\nWarrington won by unanimous decision over twelve rounds, with the scorecards reading 117–111, 118–111 and 120–107.\nWarrington vs. Hyland\nOn 14 June, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington would make the third defence of his WBC International featherweight title against Patrick Hyland (31–2), headlining a show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on 30 July.\nThe WBC International featherweight title wasn't on the line for Hyland as he came in 2lbs and 6oz over weight at the weigh-in.\nWarrington won by ninth-round technical knockout after he knocked Hyland down once in round eight and again round nine.\nLeaving Matchroom and joining Frank Warren\nOn 2 December 2016, Matchroom Boxing announced that Warrington's promotional contract with them had expired. Warrington's promoter and Matchroom managing director Eddie Hearn said in a statement \"we did not share the same plans as his team and decided not to make any further offers.\"\nAfter much speculation, Warrington officially signed for rival British promoter Frank Warren in a \"long-term promotional deal\" later in December. Warren said he was confident of delivering a first world title shot for Warrington as well as a number of shows in Leeds in 2017.\nWarrington vs. Martinez\nIn February, Warren announced that Warrington would be making his return to the ring on 13 May at the First Direct Arena in Leeds. It was initially announced that Warrington would fight WBO Inter-Continental champion Marco McCullough. However, it was since announced that Warrington would not fight McCullough and would instead fight former IBF super-bantamweight world champion Kiko Martinez (36–7–1).\nWarrington defeated Martinez by a majority decision over 12 rounds, with scorecards of 116–112 (twice) and 114–114, in the third defence of his WBC International title.\nWarrington vs. Ceylan\nIn August, it was announced that Warrington would fight the undefeated EBU European champion Dennis Ceylan (18–0–2) in an IBF world title final eliminator, to the title held by champion Lee Selby, at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on 21 October.\nCommenting on the fight, Warrington said: \"With Selby not taking a fight with me, it’s left me annoyed and even more hungry to produce a massive performance on October 21.\"\nWarrington defeated Ceylan by tenth-round technical knockout after twice knocking down Ceylan in the same round.\nSpeaking of Lee Selby, Warrington told BT Sport in his post-fight interview that: \"I want to get the Welshman up here. If we can make it at Elland Road, let's have it. I've waited so long and now I'm there.\"\n2018\nWorld title shot\nWarrington vs. Selby\nOn 23 January, it was confirmed that Warrington would fight IBF world champion Lee Selby (26–1) in his first world title fight on 19 May. On 30 January Elland Road Stadium was confirmed as the venue for the fight.\nWarrington commented on the fight: \"By winning this fight, not only do I get my hands on a world title, but it’s a chance to show everyone that I’m the best featherweight in the UK and propel myself onto the world level.\" Warrington was accompanied to the ring by ex Leeds United player Lucas Radebe whilst band Kaiser Chiefs performed live.\nWarrington secured a split-decision victory over Selby by thoroughly outworking him for the majority of the twelve rounds to claim the title, and hand Selby his second career loss.\nWarrington vs. Frampton\nImmediately after Carl Frampton's win over Luke Jackson, Frank Warren announced that he would challenge Warrington for the IBF title. Warrington was also in attendance and entered the ring. Warren announced the fight would take place in December 2018 and be shown live and exclusive on BT Sport Box Office, BT's new pay-per-view platform. On 28 August, Boxing Scene reported a press conference would take place in the coming weeks with the fight likely to take place at the Manchester Arena. Warren wanted the fight to take place in a stadium, however did not want any mandatories to get in the way as a stadium fight would likely take place in Spring 2019. On 15 September, the fight was officially announced to take place at the Manchester Arena on 22 December 2018. Warrington weighed 125.6 pounds and Frampton came in slightly heavier at 125.9 pounds, both successfully making the featherweight limit. Warrington won the fight by unanimous decision. The judges scored the fight 116–112, 116–112 and 116–113 in his favour.\n2019–2021\nWarrington vs. Takoucht\nOn 7 August, it was confirmed that Warrington would defend the IBF featherweight championship for the third time against Sofiane Takoucht. The fight took place on 12 October, at the First Direct Arena in Leeds, England. This was the 13th time Warrington fought as a professional in his hometown of Leeds. In a one sided fight Warrington beat Takoucht by TKO in the second round.\nWarrington vs. Galahad\nOn 15 June 2019, Warrington had his second title defense against domestic rival and IBF #1 contender Kid Galahad in his hometown of Leeds. In a messy bout, with a lot of holding and clinching from both sides, Warrington proved to be the aggressor more often than his counterpart, which was sufficient to edge the victory and retail his world title. The scorecards read 116–113 and 116–112 in favor of Warrington, while the third judge scored the fight 115–113 for Galahad.\nWarrington vs. Lara\nWarrington faced Mauricio Lara, a relatively unknown 22-year-old Mexican prospect, on 13 February after over a year of inactivity. No title was on the line as Warrington had vacated his IBF featherweight title a month prior.  Warrington started off the fight slower than usual, and in the fourth round, he was hurt by a left hook before ultimately being knocked down. Despite getting up, Warrington never regained his legs, though he was able to land a few effective combinations on Lara in the subsequent rounds. In the ninth round, Lara once again knocked Warrington down with a left hook, and the fight was immediately called off by the referee, handing Warrington his first career loss. Lara's victory was considered a major upset, as he had been rated as an 11/1 (+1100) pre-fight underdog, compared to Warrington having been rated as the 1/33 (-3300) betting favourite. The Ring magazine opined that the result was an early candidate for its Upset of the Year award.\nWarrington vs. Lara II\nIt was announced on 14 July 2021 that Warrington and Lara would face each other in a rematch on 4 September at Emerald Headingley Stadium in the former's hometown of Leeds. The fight ended in a technical draw after two rounds, after Lara was badly cut above his left eye due to a head clash.\n2022\nWarrington vs. Martínez\nWarrington regained the IBF featherweight title by stopping defending champion Kiko Martínez in the seventh round at First Direct Arena in Leeds on 26 March.\nWarrington vs. Lopez\nOnce again at the First Direct Arena in Leeds, Warrington made the first defense of his newly reclaimed title against Luis Alberto Lopez on 10 December. He lost by majority decision with two of the judges scoring the fight 115–113 for his opponent, while the third ruled it a 114–114 draw.\n2023–2026\nWarrington vs. Wood\nAfter 10 months out of competitive action, Warrington challenged WBA featherweight champion Leigh Wood at the Utilita Arena in Sheffield on 7 October. He had appeared to be dominating the bout until being knocked to the canvas by a flurry of punches in the seventh round. Warrington got to his feet but the referee decided he was not fit to continue and waved the fight off.\nWarrington vs. Cacace\nFollowing another lengthy break, this time 11 months, Warrington returned to the ring on 21 September, with IBO super-featherweight champion Anthony Cacace in the opposite corner at Wembley Stadium in London. He lost by unanimous decision.\nWarrington vs. Khan\nWarrington snapped his three-fight losing streak on 25 April with a unanimous decision win over Asad Asif Khan in a 10 round contest at Park Community Arena in Sheffield.\nWarrington vs. Wood II\nWarrington is scheduled to face Leigh Wood in a rematch of their fight from 2023 at Nottingham Arena on 21 February.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|37\n|Win\n|\n| align=\"left\" |Asad Asif Khan\n|UD\n|10\n|25 Apr 2025\n|align=left|\n| align=\"left\" |\n|-\n|36\n|Loss\n|31–4–1\n| align=\"left\" |Anthony Cacace\n|UD\n|12\n|21 Sep 2024\n| align=\"left\" |\n| align=\"left\" |\n|-\n|35\n|Loss\n|31–3–1\n|align=left|Leigh Wood\n|TKO\n|7 (12),\n|7 Oct 2023\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|34\n|Loss\n|31–2–1\n|align=left|Luis Alberto Lopez\n|MD\n|12\n|10 Dec 2022\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|33\n|Win\n|31–1–1\n|align=left|Kiko Martínez\n|TKO\n|7 (12),\n|26 Mar 2022\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|32\n|Draw\n|30–1–1\n|align=left|Mauricio Lara\n|\n|2 (12),\n|4 Sep 2021\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|31\n|Loss\n|30–1\n|align=left|Mauricio Lara\n|TKO\n|9 (12),\n|13 Feb 2021\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|30\n|Win\n|30–0\n|align=left|Sofiane Takoucht\n|TKO\n|2 (12),\n|12 Oct 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|29\n|Win\n|29–0\n|align=left|Kid Galahad\n|SD\n|12\n|15 Jun 2019\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|28\n|Win\n|28–0\n|align=left|Carl Frampton\n|UD\n|12\n|22 Dec 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|27\n|Win\n|27–0\n|align=left|Lee Selby\n|\n|12\n|19 May 2018\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|26\n|Win\n|26–0\n|align=left|Dennis Ceylan\n|TKO\n|10 (12),\n|21 Oct 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|25\n|Win\n|25–0\n|align=left|Kiko Martínez\n|\n|12\n|13 May 2017\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|24\n|Win\n|24–0\n|align=left|Patrick Hyland\n|TKO\n|9 (12),\n|30 Jul 2016\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|23\n|Win\n|23–0\n|align=left|Hisashi Amagasa\n|UD\n|12\n|16 Apr 2016\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|22\n|Win\n|22–0\n|align=left|Joel Brunker\n|UD\n|12\n|5 Sep 2015\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|21\n|Win\n|21–0\n|align=left|Dennis Tubieron\n|UD\n|12\n|11 Apr 2015\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|20\n|Win\n|20–0\n|align=left|Edwin Tellez\n|TKO\n|5 (8),\n|21 Feb 2015\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|19\n|Win\n|19–0\n|align=left|Davide Dieli\n|TKO\n|4 (12),\n|4 Oct 2014\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|18–0\n|align=left|Martin Lindsay\n|UD\n|12\n|21 May 2014\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|17\n|Win\n|17–0\n|align=left|Rendall Munroe\n|\n|7 (12),\n|19 Apr 2014\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|16\n|Win\n|16–0\n|align=left|Samir Mouneimne\n|\n|12 (12),\n|2 Nov 2013\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|15\n|Win\n|15–0\n|align=left|Ian Bailey\n|UD\n|10\n|27 Sep 2013\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|14–0\n|align=left|Jamie Speight\n|UD\n|10\n|22 Mar 2013\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|13\n|Win\n|13–0\n|align=left|Chris Male\n|\n|10\n|9 Nov 2012\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|12\n|Win\n|12–0\n|align=left|Ibrar Riyaz\n|PTS\n|4\n|2 Jun 2012\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|11–0\n|align=left|Dan Naylor\n|PTS\n|6\n|3 Mar 2012\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|10–0\n|align=left|Ian Bailey\n|PTS\n|4\n|18 Dec 2011\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|9–0\n|align=left|Dougie Curran\n|PTS\n|6\n|22 Oct 2011\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|8\n|Win\n|8–0\n|align=left|Marc Callaghan\n|PTS\n|6\n|28 Apr 2011\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|7\n|Win\n|7–0\n|align=left|Chris Riley\n|PTS\n|6\n|9 Apr 2011\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|6–0\n|align=left|Steve Gethin\n|PTS\n|4\n|22 Jan 2011\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|5\n|Win\n|5–0\n|align=left|Youssef al-Hamidi\n|PTS\n|4\n|2 Oct 2010\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|4\n|Win\n|4–0\n|align=left|John Riley\n|PTS\n|4\n|28 May 2010\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|3\n|Win\n|3–0\n|align=left|Danny McDermid\n|PTS\n|4\n|5 Mar 2010\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|align=left|Pavels Senkovs\n|PTS\n|4\n|20 Dec 2009\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|align=left|Delroy Spencer\n|\n|4\n|31 Oct 2009\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|}\nTeam\nWarrington was signed to Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing in the early stages of his career.
