Today it ranks alongside Leptis Magna as one of the major classical sites of the region. The' modern exploration of the ruins was begun in 1926 during the Italian colonial period and in the ensuing years much of the heart of the town was laid bare. During the period of the British Military Administration immediately after the end of the Second World War, three seasons of work were carried out by a British expedition.\nDamage in 2017\nThe site suffered damage resulting from armed conflict in 2017.\nSources\nReferences"
