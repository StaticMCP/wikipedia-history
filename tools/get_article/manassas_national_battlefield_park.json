It was also where Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson acquired his nickname \"Stonewall\". The park was established in 1936 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\nMore than 700,000 people visit the battlefield each year. The Henry Hill Visitor Center, on Sudley Road by the south entrance to the park, offers exhibits and interpretation regarding the First Battle of Bull Run, including Civil War-era uniforms, weapons, field gear and an electronic battle map. The center offers the orientation film Manassas: End of Innocence, as well as a bookstore.\nA recent find in 2014 unearthed bone fragments that led to the discovery of the skeletal remains of two Union soldiers in what is now thought to be a Surgeon's Pit. The remains were found among the bones of several other limbs in the pit. Carbon dating shows that the pair died during the Battle of Second Manassas, also known as Second Bull Run, in August 1862. The remains were moved on Tuesday, June 19, 2018, and transferred from the National Park Service to the US Army who will be burying them in Arlington National Cemetery.\nHistoric sites\nVisitor Center entrance at Manassas Battlefield\nCannon at Manassas Battlefield\n#Stone House – used as a hospital during both battles.
