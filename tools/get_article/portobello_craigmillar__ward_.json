Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it elects four Councillors.\nAs its name suggests, the ward's territory is based around the communities of Craigmillar and Portobello in the east of the city's urban area up to the boundary with Musselburgh (East Lothian) and the coast on the Firth of Forth, also including the neighbourhoods of Bingham, Brunstane, Cleikimin, Eastfield, Greendykes, Joppa, Magdalene, Newcraighall and Niddrie. A minor boundary change in 2017 saw the addition of the western part of the Durham neighbourhood which, combined with housebuilding in the existing area (new and redeveloped), was sufficient to push the population over the threshold for a fourth councillor. In 2019, the ward had a population of 31,957.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Stephen I Hawkins(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Maureen Child(Labour)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Michael A Bridgeman(SNP)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=2|3 seats\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|David Walker(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Mary Campbell(Greens)\n|rowspan=2|Kate Campbell(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Callum Laidlaw(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Alys Mumford(Greens)\n|rowspan=1|Jane Elizabeth Meagher(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Tim Jones(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/portobellocraigmillar-ward-east-lothian#.YGRYuFPTVkw Listed Buildings in Portobello/Craigmillar Ward, East Lothian] [sic] at British Listed Buildings"
