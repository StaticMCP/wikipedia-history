Lead designer Jakub Galczynski joined Singer in 2015 to plan and design the Snow King Mountain Observatory. Max C. Chapman, President of Snow King Mountain, approached Samuel Singer at Wyoming Stargazing's farmers market booth to discuss prospects of the Snow King Observatory.\nIn January 2020, Bridger–Teton National Forest administrators released a draft environmental impact statement regarding the proposed facility.\nThe observatory officially opened with a speech by Bill Nye on June 1, 2024, becoming the first observatory served by a gondola lift in a ski resort in North America. Although this facility is on United States Forest Service land, it is not publicly offered for usage. Privately funded scientists and researchers can use the facilities for a fee.\nIn late 2024, Joe Zator, from University of Colorado at Boulder joined the observatory as the observatory director.\nEquipment and facilities\nThe Snow King Observatory and Planetarium offers a unique 150&nbsp;mm solar telescope (hydrogen alpha), a Planewave CDK1000 1-meter corrected Dall-Kirkham Cassegrain telescope at .\nThe planetarium features a 35-seat theater, and is capable of 180-degree projections on an  screen for films.\nSee also\n* List of astronomical observatories\n* List of planetariums\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
