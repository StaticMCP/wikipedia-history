Participants in the initial American operation, Operation Enduring Freedom, included a NATO coalition whose initial goals were to train the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions after the fall of the Taliban regime in December 2001. However, coalition forces were gradually involved in the broader war as well, as Taliban resistance continued until 2021, when they regained control of the country and formed a new government. This is a list of known code names and related information for military operations associated with the war, including operations to airlift citizens of coalition countries and at-risk Afghan civilians from Afghanistan as the war drew to a close.\nBackground\nFrom May 1996, Osama bin Laden had been living in Afghanistan along with other members of al-Qaeda, operating terrorist training camps in a loose alliance with the Taliban. Following the 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa, the US military launched cruise missiles at these camps with limited effect on their overall operations. A follow-on plan, Operation Infinite Resolve, was planned but not implemented. The UN Security Council issued Resolutions 1267 and 1333 in 1999 and 2000, respectively, applying financial and military hardware sanctions to encourage the Taliban to turn over bin Laden to appropriate authorities for trial in the embassy bombings, as well as to close terrorist training camps.\nAfter the September 11, 2001, attacks, investigators rapidly accumulated evidence implicating bin Laden. In a taped statement released in 2004, bin Laden publicly acknowledged his and al-Qaeda's direct involvement in the attacks. On May 21, 2006, an audiotape attributed to bin Laden was released on a website (the US alleged) known to be used by al-Qaeda affiliates. In it, bin Laden claimed personal responsibility for selecting and directing the 19 hijackers. who carried out the 9/11 attacks, reaffirming Bin Laden's central role in the plot.\n2001: War begins\nA Marine with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit leads a column to a security position after seizing a [[Taliban forward-operating base in November 2001.]]\nThe war in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001, as Operation Enduring Freedom, in response to the 9/11 attacks. This conflict marked the beginning of the US war on terror. The stated purpose of the invasion was to capture Osama bin Laden, destroy al-Qaeda, and remove the Taliban regime, which had provided them support and safe harbor. In December, the Taliban government fell and a transitional government was established.\nCoalition operations\n*Operation Crescent Wind\n*Operation Relentless Strike\n*Operation Rhino\nBattles\n*Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif\n*Siege of Kunduz\n*Fall of Kabul (2001)\n*2001 uprising in Herat\n*Battle of Tarin Kowt\n*Fall of Kandahar\n*Battle of Qala-i-Jangi\n*Battle of Tora Bora\n2002 operations\nCoalition operations\n*Operation Accius\n*Operation Anaconda (includes Operation Harpoon, and the Battle of Takur Ghar)\n* Operation Glock\n* Operation Polar Harpoon\n*Operation Jacana\n** Operation Ptarmigan\n** Operation Snipe\n** Operation Condor\n** Operation Buzzard\n*Operation Mountain Lion\n*Operation Mountain Sweep\n*Raid on Hazar Qadam\nInsurgent attacks\n*Kabul\n2003 operations\nCoalition operations\n*Operation Mongoose\n*Operation Tsunami\n*Operation Eagle Fury\n*Operation Viper\n*Operation Desert Lion\n*Operation Haven Denial\n*Operation Athena\n*Operation Warrior Sweep\n*Operation Mountain Resolve\n*Operation Mountain Viper\n*Operation Avalanche\n*Operation Headstrong\n*Operation Valiant Strike\nInsurgent attacks\nBattles\n2004 operations\n*Operation Asbury Park\n*Operation Asbury Park II\n*Operation Flashman\n*Operation Headstrong\n*Operation Lightning Resolve\n*Operation Mountain Blizzard\n*Operation Mountain Storm\n2005 operations\n*Operation Archer\n*Operation Argus\n*Operation Spurs\n*Operation Mavericks\n*Operation Celtics\n*Operation Red Wings\n* Operation Red Wings II\n* Operation Whalers\n2006 operations\nIn January 2006, NATO's focus in southern Afghanistan was to form Provincial Reconstruction Teams with the British leading in Helmand Province and the Netherlands and Canada leading similar deployments in Orūzgān Province and Kandahar Province, respectively.
