It will be the 24th Final Battle event and will take place on Friday, December 5, 2025, as a part of GalaxyCon at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio. The event will air exclusively on ROH's streaming service, Honor Club.\nProduction\nBackground\nFinal Battle is a professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor. First held in 2002, it is traditionally ROH's last show in the calendar year. It is widely regarded as Ring of Honor's premiere flagship event, similar to WWE's WrestleMania. On August 11, 2025, ROH announced that the 2025 Final Battle would be held at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio on December 5, as part of a partnership with GalaxyCon Columbus, and would air exclusively on Honor Club.\nStorylines\nThe event featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on ROH's weekly series ROH Honor Club TV exclusively on their streaming service Honor Club, on television programs of sister promotion All Elite Wrestling including Dynamite and Collision, and via promotional videos on both the ROH and AEW YouTube channels.\nOne of the main features of Final Battle would be the finals of the ROH Women's Pure Championship tournament. First introduced following the April 12 episode of AEW Collision, the title tournament was originally meant to culminate at Supercard of Honor, but had to be postponed due to injuries, according to Tony Khan. The tournament bracket was officially revealed on August 29, hours before Death Before Dishonor, and would officially begin that night.\nMatches\n|time4 =\n|match5 = Shane Taylor Promotions (Shane Taylor and The Infantry (Carlie Bravo and Capt.
