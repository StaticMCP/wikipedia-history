It grew out of unresolved border disputes between the Republic of Texas and Mexico after the United States annexed Texas nine years after the Texas Revolution. It ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in which Mexico was forced to sell a vast tract of land that amounted to almost half its national territory to the United States.\n]]\nList of battles\n;Key:\n:(A) &ndash; American Victory\n:(M) &ndash; Mexican Victory\n:(I) &ndash; Inconclusive\n1846\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"background: #FFEBAD; color: black;\" | Battle\n! style=\"background: #FFEBAD; color: black;\" | Date\n! style=\"background: #FFEBAD; color: black;\" | Engagement remarks\n! style=\"background: #FFEBAD; color: black;\" | Result\n|-\n| Thornton Affair\n| April 25/26\n| Skirmishing in the disputed borderlands of South Texas.\n| (M)\n|-\n| Siege of Fort Texas\n| May 3–9\n| American forces withstand Mexican Army attacks.\n| (A)\n|-\n| Battle of Palo Alto\n| May 8\n| Mexican Army under Mariano Arista in the disputed land between the Rio Grande (Río Bravo) and the Nueces River engage an American army attempting to lift the aforementioned Siege of Fort Texas.\n|  (A)\n|-\n| Battle of Resaca de la Palma\n| May 9\n| Arista is defeated by Zachary Taylor.\n| (A)\n|-\n| Occupation of Matamoros\n| May 18\n| U.S. troops occupy Matamoros, Tamaulipas, with no resistance.
