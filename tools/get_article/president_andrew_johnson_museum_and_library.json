      "text": "# President Andrew Johnson Museum and Library\n\nThe President Andrew Johnson Museum and Library is the presidential library and museum for Andrew Johnson,\nlocated on the Greeneville campus of Tusculum University in Tennessee.\nHistory\nIn 1840, the number of students at the college was 70. The time had come to expand the campus and construct a new building to replace the second Academy Building. Several citizens, including Johnson himself, donated a total of $4,245.62 for construction of a building that housed classrooms, a chapel, offices, and a library. The structure was ready for students in October 1841 and was used until 1887.  With the addition of other buildings, Old College served a variety of other purposes such as faculty housing, classroom space and a student dormitory. In 1993, the structure, known as Old College, was restored to its original appearance and renovated to house the Andrew Johnson Collection, along with other related programs.\nToday\nThe building is open from Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm or by appointment.\nSee also\n* Presidential memorials in the United States\nSources\nExternal links\n* [http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/ Andrew Johnson Museum and Library]"
