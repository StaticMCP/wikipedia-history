Ramos in response to the growing challenges of globalization. It was created through Executive Order 448 on October 3, 1997. It was institutionalized on February 28, 2001, through the signing of Republic Act 9013, also known as the Philippine Quality Award Act.\nObjectives\nThese are the three objectives of PQA:\n#To promote standards in organizational performance comparable to those of leading business abroad, pursuant to the country's effort to be globally competitive;\n#To establish a national system for assessing quality and productivity performance, thus providing local organizations regardless of size, sector and maturity with criteria and guidelines for self-assessment to guide their quality and productivity improvement efforts; and\n#To recognize organizations in both the private and public sector which excel in quality management and overall organizational performance, thus providing Philippine industries with benchmarks and models to emulate.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"50\" | Year\n! width=\"450\" | Recipient\n! width=\"360\" | Award\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" |2015\n|City Government of Tanauan\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Colegio de San Juan de Letran-Calamba\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Department of Labor and Employment XII\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Department of Science and Technology 4A\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Mindanao Corrugated Fibreboard, Inc.\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Technical Education and Skills Development Authority\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|University of the Philippines-National Engineering Center\n|Commitment to Quality Management\n|-\n|Land Bank of the Philippines\n|Proficiency in Quality Management\n|-\n|Lyceum of the Philippines University-Batangas\n|Proficiency in Quality Management\n|-\n|National Kidney and Transplant Institute\n|Proficiency in Quality Management\n|-\n|The Thomson Reuters Corporation Pte.
