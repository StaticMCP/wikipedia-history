      "text": "# Prudential Spirit of Community Award\n\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program is the United States' largest youth recognition program based exclusively on volunteer community service. The program was created in 1995 by Prudential in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) to honor middle level and high school students for outstanding service to others at the local, state, and national level.\nThe program's goals are to applaud young people who already are making a positive difference in their towns and neighborhoods, and to inspire others to think about how they might contribute to their communities. Over the past 16 years, more than 310,000 young Americans have participated in the program, and nearly 100,000 of them have been officially recognized for their volunteer work.\nThe Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program is also conducted in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Ireland, Brazil and India, where Prudential has significant business operations.\nEligibility\nAny young person who:\nis in grades 5-12 as of November 1 during the applying year,\nis a legal resident of any U.S. state or Washington, D.C.,\nhas engaged in a volunteer activity that occurred at least partly during the 12 months prior to the date of application, and\nsubmits a completed application to a school principal or the head of an officially designated local organization by November 1.\nPrudential Emerging Visionaries winners\nIn 2022, the Spirit of Community Awards transitioned into a new program called the Prudential Emerging Visionaries.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winners\n!Name of Person\n!Awarded For\n!Year Awarded\n|-\n|Nikita Agrawal\n|FinPro World\n|2023\n|-\n|Okezue Bell\n|Fidutam\n|2023\n|-\n|Aaryan Doshi\n|CirFin\n|2023\n|-\n|Catherine Mellett Felix\n|Girley\n|2023\n|-\n|Jordyn Wright\n|Passion to Purpose\n|2023\n|-\n|Jack Bonneau\n|Teen Hustl\n|2023\n|-\n|Varuni Chopra\n|Bridge the Gap Initiative\n|2023\n|-\n|Sydnie Collins\n|It's Perfect Timing\n|2023\n|-\n|Kean Dao\n|Environmental Droners\n|2023\n|-\n|Mia Fritsch-Anderson\n|Choose to Breathe\n|2023\n|-\n|Kylee Hamamoto\n|WeGo!
