It also includes the Wayside, home in turn to three noted American authors. The National Historical Park is under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service and protects  in and around the Massachusetts towns of Lexington, Lincoln, and Concord.\nSites\n* Concord's Old North Bridge, where the Battle of Concord began on April 19, 1775. This was the second battle of the day, after the brief fight at dawn on Lexington Common. Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized the North Bridge Fight as \"the shot heard round the world\" in his 1837 poem \"Concord Hymn\".\n:At this site also stands Daniel Chester French's well-known The Minute Man statue of 1874. The Obelisk Monument stands across the North Bridge, opposite The Minute Man statue. Close by is the grave of the two regular army soldiers killed at the bridge and the Old Manse.\n* The five-mile (8&nbsp;km) \"Battle Road Trail\" between Lexington and Concord includes a restored colonial landscape approximating the path of the running skirmishes between British regulars and American militia. It includes a monument at the site where Paul Revere was captured during his midnight ride, the Captain William Smith House, and the Hartwell Tavern, a restored 18th-century inn and house on the Battle Road where living history programs are presented from May through October. The Battle Road Trail winds through fields and forests and is accessible from several different parking areas.\n* The Wayside, a National Historic Landmark, was home to Concord muster-master Samuel Whitney on April 19, 1775. In later years it became home to authors Amos Bronson Alcott and his daughter Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret Sidney. The Alcotts called the home \"Hillside\"; Hawthorne renamed it \"Wayside\". The house is also part of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.\n* Barrett's Farm was the home of Colonel James Barret, about 1.5 miles west of North Bridge on Barrett's Farm Road; it is the newest addition to Minute Man National Historical Park. It was the destination of British regulars who crossed North Bridge intent on searching the farm for artillery and ammunition that they thought was hidden there. The house and 3.4 acres of land were purchased and restored by Save Our Heritage, a Concord non-profit organization which transferred ownership to the National Park Service in 2012.\n* Lexington Battle Green, formerly known as Lexington Common, is the site of the first action on April 19, 1775. The Town of Lexington owns and maintains it.  The Green is also where the Captain Parker Statue by Henry Hudson Kitson is located.\nPark visitor centers are located at the hill overlooking the North Bridge and along Battle Road.  The main visitor center on Route 2A/Battle Road features the 25-minute multi-media show \"Road to Revolution\" which gives a good introduction to the Lexington-Concord events. An eight-minute film at the North Bridge Visitor Center provides a comprehensive account of events leading to the encounter at North Bridge.\nPersonnel\nThe park's lead interpreter is Jim Hollister, who joined its ranks in 2002.\nGallery\nFile:Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts, July 2005.JPG|Old North Bridge, Concord\nFile:Memorial obelisk - Old North Bridge.jpg|Memorial obelisk adjacent to the North Bridge\nFile:The Wayside Concord Massachusetts.jpg|The Wayside, home in turn to authors Louisa May Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Margaret Sidney\nFile:Captain William Smith House 2023.jpg|Captain William Smith House, Lincoln\nFile:EXTERIOR FROM THE SOUTHWEST - Sergeant Samuel Hartwell House, Virginia Road, Lincoln, Middlesex County, MA HABS MASS,9-LIN,8-2.tif|Samuel Hartwell House, Lincoln, prior to its destruction by fire in the 1970s\nFile:Battle Road P1090874.jpg|Battle Road\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Concord, Massachusetts\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nps.gov/mima/index.htm National Park Service: Minute Man National Historical Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071211174823/http://photo.itc.nps.gov/storage/images/mima/mima-Thumb.00001.html National Park Service Digital Image Archive] of Minute Man NHS\n* [https://wiki-map.com/map/?locale=en&lat=42.4525&lng=-71.2924 Wikipedia articles of the park] – Wiki-Map"
