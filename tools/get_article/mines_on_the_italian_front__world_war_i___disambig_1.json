In order to protect their soldiers from enemy fire and the hostile alpine environment, both Austro-Hungarian and Italian military engineers constructed fighting tunnels which offered a degree of cover and allowed better logistics support. In addition to building underground shelters and covered supply routes for their soldiers (like the Italian Strada delle 52 Gallerie), both sides also attempted to break the stalemate of trench warfare by tunneling under no man's land and laying large quantities of explosives beneath the enemy's positions.\nBetween 1 January 1916 and 13 March 1918, a total of 34 mines were detonated in this theatre of war. Of these, 20 were Italian mines aimed at Austro-Hungarian targets and 14 were Austro-Hungarian mines aimed at Italian targets. The size of the explosive charges ranged from  to  of blasting gelatin. The largest Italian mine held  of explosive.\n, 1915]]\nFocal points of the underground fighting during the War in the Dolomites were Pasubio with 10 mines, Lagazuoi with 5, Col di Lana/Monte Sief also with 5, and Marmolada with 4 mines. The most intense episode was the seven-week period from 16 September to 3 November 1917 which saw 12 mine explosions. After November 1917 and the Italian retreat to Monte Grappa and the Piave river in the aftermath of the Battle of Caporetto, Pasubio with its elevation of  remained the only underground war area on the Austro-Italian front.\nUnlike the mining efforts on the Western Front, where e.g. the mines on the first day of the Somme (1916) were constructed in a chalk and flint area and where e.g. the mines in the Battle of Messines (1917) were constructed in geology dominated by wet sand and clay, the mine galleries on the Austro-Italian front had to be executed at high altitudes in the hard carbonate rock of the Dolomites using hand-operated drilling machines and chisels. Fighting under these conditions, often in exposed areas near mountain peaks and even in glacial ice, required extreme skill of both Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners.\nList of the mines\n1916\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #BBBBBB; width:1%; align=left\"| No.\n! style=\"background-color: #BBBBBB; width:15%; align=left\"| Date fired\n! style=\"background-color: #BBBBBB; width:15%; align=left\"| Location\n! style=\"background-color: #BBBBBB; width:15%; align=left\"| Origin\n! style=\"background-color: #BBBBBB; width:10%; align=left\"| Explosive charge\n! style=\"background-color: #BBBBBB; width:30%; align=left\"| Notes\n|-\n| 1\n| align=\"left\"|1 January 1916\n| align=\"left\"| Lagazuoi:   Piccolo Lagazuoi (Ital)  Kleiner Lagazuoi (Ger)\n| align=\"left\"| Austro-Hungarian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"|  1st Austro-Hungarian mine on Lagazuoi. Fired shortly after midnight, the mine causes a large rock above the Italian Cengia Martini stronghold to fall. Slight damage and some demoralizing effect on the Italian soldiers, but no casualties.\n|-\n| 2\n| align=\"left\"|6 April 1916\n| align=\"left\"| Col di Lana\n| align=\"left\"| Austro-Hungarian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| In early 1916, the Austro-Hungarian army learns through an artillery observer on Pordoi Pass that the fiercely contested Col di Lana summit (the Cima Lana) has been mined by Italian military engineering units. A Tyrolean Kaiserjäger unit on the summit attempts to halt the Italian efforts by firing a hastily prepared small counter mine. The Italian tunnels are damaged only slightly.\n|-\n| 3\n| align=\"left\"|17 April 1916\n| align=\"left\"| Col di Lana\n| align=\"left\"| Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"|  This mine consisted of the Galleria S. Andrea tunnel and two chambers beneath the Cima Lana summit on Col di Lana. The mine, which had only been damaged slightly by the Austro-Hungarian attack of 6 April, is fired at 23:35 Italian time. The detonation creates an oblong double crater  long,  wide and  deep. More than 100 men of the 2nd Tyrolean Kaiserjäger regiment are killed and some 170 taken prisoner as the Italian infantry takes the summit.\n|-\n| 4\n| align=\"left\"|11 July 1916\n| align=\"left\"| Castelletto:   Punta di Bois (Ital)  Schreckenstein (Ger)\n| align=\"left\"| Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| Placed at the end of a nearly  -long gallery beneath an Austro-Hungarian stronghold on a plateau off Tofana di Roces. The detonation of the largest mine fired on the Italian front to that date deforms the plateau and the southern part of Castelletto. 13 enemy soldiers die in the explosion, many more in the ensuing battle until Alpini take the site on 14 July.\n|-\n| 5\n| align=\"left\"|17 September 1916\n| align=\"left\"| Monte Cimone di Tonezza\n| align=\"left\"|  Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"| ?\n| align=\"left\"| Italian troops fire a mine in an unsuccessful attempt to halt an Austro-Hungarian mining attack.\n|-\n| 6\n| align=\"left\"|23 September 1916\n| align=\"left\"| Monte Cimone di Tonezza\n| align=\"left\"| Austro-Hungarian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| The mine attacked by the Italians on 17 September is fired and creates a crater  wide and  deep on the Monte Cimone summit.

Italian troops fail to break through the front line, however, and the crater is taken by the defenders who incorporate it into the Austro-Hungarian fortification system.\n|-\n| 14\n| align=\"left\"|20 June 1917\n| align=\"left\"| Lagazuoi:   Anticima (Ital)  Vorkuppe (Ger)\n| align=\"left\"| Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| After tunneling through the mountain and overcoming a difference in altitude of , Alpini detonate this mine beneath the vacated enemy stronghold on the crag above Cengia Martini, resulting in a large crater and more rubble falling into the valley. The Austro-Hungarians have no casualties but the Italians lose a few men during the ensuing fighting.\n|-\n| 15\n| align=\"left\"|16 July 1917\n| align=\"left\"| Colbricon\n| align=\"left\"| Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"|  2nd mine on Colbricon. The detonation of the charge, placed by the Italians  near the site of the first mine, results in the collapse of the eastern ridge near the summit and kills some 25 Austro-Hungarian soldiers.\n|-\n| 16\n| align=\"left\"|16 September 1917\n| align=\"left\"| Lagazuoi:   Piccolo Lagazuoi (Ital)  Kleiner Lagazuoi (Ger)\n| align=\"left\"| Austro-Hungarian  mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| 4th and final Austro-Hungarian mine on Lagazuoi.

After losing the height to the Italians, Austro-Hungarian troops detonate a charge beneath the western face of Forcella V (Ital) or  Vesurascharte (Ger). Collapsing rock kills some 15 Italian soldiers. Exact site of gallery and chamber not located by 1993.\n|-\n| 19\n| align=\"left\"|27 September 1917\n| align=\"left\"| Monte Sief:   Dente del Sief (Ital)  Knotz (Ger)\n| align=\"left\"|  Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"| ?\n| align=\"left\"| 2nd mine on Monte Sief, fired by the Italians in yet another attempt to destroy an Austro-Hungarian tunnel system.

Placed at an altitude of  in no-man's land near the mountain knoll. When fired in an attempt to crush the enemy gallery, the detonation fails but falling rock kills a miner in the Austro-Hungarian tunnel system.\n|-\n| 23\n| align=\"left\"|21 October 1917\n| align=\"left\"| Monte Sief:   Dente del Sief (Ital)  Knotz (Ger)\n| align=\"left\"| Austro-Hungarian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| 3rd mine on Monte Sief, placed beneath the ridge which links Monte Sief with adjacent Col di Lana. The detonation of the largest mine on the Italian front to that date creates a cut, some  long and  deep, in the ridge between the Monte Sief summit and the Dente del Sief (Ital) or Knotz (Ger), destroying the two earlier craters created by Italian mines. No significant subterranean damage to the Italian tunnel system but the defending infantry, fighting from trenches and caves, lose 51 men. The cut in the ridge renders the summit of Monte Sief almost impregnable, thereby obstructing the Italian advance in the area.\n|-\n|24\n| align=\"left\"|22 October 1917\n| align=\"left\"| Pasubio\n| align=\"left\"|  Italian mine\n| align=\"left\"|\n| align=\"left\"| 2nd Italian mine on Pasubio.

Fire from the detonation also enters the Austro-Hungarian tunnel system, claiming further casualties.\n|-\n|}\nGallery\nFile:Panoramica dal Lagazuoi (Scotoni e Piccolo Lagazuoi).JPG|Lagazuoi\nColdilana0001.jpg|Col di Lana (left) and Monte Sief (right); a large charge was fired beneath the ridge which links the two (see mine #23)\nFile:Tofana Air.JPG|Tofane-Castelletto\nFile:P28.303-01 Altipiano di Tonezza.
