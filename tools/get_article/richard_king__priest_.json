He was a curate at Mullingar and then Holloway before becoming the rector of Drumachose in 1904, a post he held until his appointment to the deanery.\nKing was an ardent Unionist.\nKing was married with Dorothea King, youngest daughter of Andrew Ferguson Smyly, formerly dean of Derry, and niece of William Alexander. When King refused the offer to become Archbishop of Armagh in 1938, the illness of his wife was one of the reasons. In 1947, a stained glass window was installed in her memory in the baptistery of St Columb's Cathedral.\nReferences"
