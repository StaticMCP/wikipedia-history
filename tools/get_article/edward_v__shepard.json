He was graduated from MIT in 1889 with a civil engineering degree, after which he worked in South America and Mexico as well as Massachusetts, also working for the United States Patent Office and teaching at Columbia University. He also devoted many years to his bridge career.\nShepard's engineering training led him to apply mathematical analysis to bridge. His 1913 work Scientific Auction Bridge was the first American book to deal extensively with the mathematics and distribution of bridge hands.\nShepard was one of the twelve members of the Bridge Headquarters, organized in 1931 and representing bridge's \"old guard\" against the insurgent Ely Culbertson.\nShepard was an honorary member of the British Bridge League and the American Bridge League. The Shepard Club, an early Portland, Maine, bridge club organized by John B. Thomes, was named in his honor.\nShepard died February 9, 1937, at home in Manhattan.\nPublications\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t8jd5r32d;view=1up;seq=16 Full text of Expert Auction] (1913, Harper & Brothers) at the Hathi Trust Digital Library (also [https://archive.org/stream/expertauctioncle01shep#page/n0/mode/2up at the Internet Archive])\n*[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t8nc6tr6n;view=1up;seq=8 Full text of Correct Auction] (1920, Harper & Brothers) at the Hathi Trust Digital Library"
