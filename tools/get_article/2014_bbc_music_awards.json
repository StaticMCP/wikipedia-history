The awards were held on 11 December 2014 at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London, which would be the final event to be broadcast from the venue. The awards show was announced on 16 June 2014.\nThe awards recognise the biggest and most exciting artists from the previous 12 months, as well as looking forward to new talent in 2015. A panel of judges decided the winners of each category, except 'Song of the Year', which was decided by the public.\nEd Sheeran, Pharrell Williams and Sam Smith all had two nominations apiece, with Williams winning two awards and Sheeran winning 'British Artist of the Year'.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|Coldplay\n|\"A Sky Full of Stars\"\n|-\n|LabrinthElla Henderson\n|\"Jealous\"\"Ghost\"\n|-\n|Clean BanditLove SsegaJess Glynne\n|\"Mozart's House\"\"Rather Be\"\n|-\n|George Ezra\n|\"Budapest\"\n|-\n|Gregory Porter\n|\"Feeling Good\"\"Liquid Spirit\"\n|-\n|One Direction\n|\"Steal My Girl\"\n|-\n|Ed Sheeran\n|\"Sing\"\n|-\n|Calvin HarrisJohn NewmanEllie Goulding\n|\"Blame\"\"Outside\"\n|-\n|Catfish and the Bottlemen\n|\"Kathleen\"\n|-\n|Paloma FaithSigma\n|\"Only Love Can Hurt Like This\"\"Changing\"\n|-\n|Take That\n|\"These Days\"\n|-\n|will.i.amCody Wise\n|\"It's My Birthday\"\n|-\n|Tom JonesPaloma FaithBBC Concert Orchestra\n|\"God Only Knows\"\n|}\nNominees and winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| British Artist of the Year\n! width=\"50%\"| International Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Ed Sheeran\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Pharrell Williams\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Song of the Year\n! width=\"50%\"| BBC Introducing Award\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Pharrell Williams – \"Happy\"\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Catfish and the Bottlemen\n|}\nRatings\nThe show achieved a total of 4.17 million viewers, making it the fifth most watched programme of the night.
