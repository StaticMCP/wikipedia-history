The township was named for a resident of Conneaut named King, who paid early settlers four gallons of whiskey to name the township for him.\nThe first settler in Kingsville Township was Eldad Harrington, a hunter who arrived in 1803. Two years later, he was followed by former Massachusetts resident Walter Fobes.\nIn 1833, Kingsville Township contained one store, one gristmill, two saw mills, two fulling mills, two carding machines, and a trip hammer.\nGovernment\nThe township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1.
