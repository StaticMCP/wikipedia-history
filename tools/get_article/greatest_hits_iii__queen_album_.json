It is a compilation of latter-day songs, the band members' solo hits and the band's collaborations with other artists (hence the album's credit to \"Queen+\"). It was released on 8 November 1999.  The first two tracks on the album were new previously unreleased versions of classic Queen songs.\nThe album includes \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\" (1991), which was Freddie Mercury's last appearance in a music video, and \"No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)\" (1997), a song dedicated to Mercury which also features the last recording of bass guitarist John Deacon before his retirement. Four songs from their last studio album Made in Heaven (1995) also feature in the compilation, including \"Too Much Love Will Kill You\" and \"Heaven for Everyone\". A home video was also released in the EU and in North America but has since been long out of print, called Greatest Flix III. The album was remastered in 2000 as part of the \"Platinum Collection\" 3-CD set, as well as again in 2011 in celebrating the band's 40th Anniversary with updated cover art (in light blue instead of plain white like in the original design), with a limited run of super jewel case edition.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nMain\n*Queen – producers (2, 4–8, 11, 13, 15–17)\n*Brian May – producer (9), remixing (2)\n*Freddie Mercury – producer (3, 12), original recording producer (10)\n*Roger Taylor – remixing (2)\n*David Bowie – producer (2)\n*Wyclef Jean – remixing (14)\n*Mack – producer (8, 13, 17), original recording producer (10)\n*George Michael – producer (5)\nAdditional\n*Joshua J.
