The society was founded in 1913 and again in 1920, with the object of studying the history and civilization of the Land of Israel and of disseminating its knowledge.\nOverview\nThe Israel Exploration Society plays a key role in archaeological research covering all periods, from prehistoric times to the Ottoman period. It coordinates much of the multi-institutional archaeological research carried out by both Israeli and foreign archaeological expeditions in Israel. Major activities undertaken by the IES include organizing excavations, enlisting financial support for archaeological projects, publishing excavation reports and liaison and cooperation with Israeli and foreign institutions in the field of publication and in a collective effort to promote the cause of archaeology.\nThe IES is a non-profit organization governed by an executive committee and a Council comprising representatives from all of the institutes of archaeology in the Israel and several major archaeological museums.\nHistory\nThe society was founded in April 1913, with David Yellin as president and A. Brawer as secretary. It was called \"The Jewish Society for the Exploration of Eretz-Israel and its Antiquities\" in Hebrew and the \"Jewish Palestine Exploration Society\" in English. Due to the advent of WWI and other reasons, the society folded without conducting any excavations or publishing any reports. In November 1920, the same group of people founded the society again, changing \"Jewish\" to \"Hebrew\" in its Hebrew name but keeping the English name.\nDuring the period of the British Mandate, the society was responsible for the first archaeological excavations ever conducted by a Jewish organization in Palestine, at Hamat Tiberias, where  Nahum Slouschz discovered a Late Roman to Byzantine-period synagogue. Other digs were carried out at Absalom's Tomb, around Jerusalem's Old City walls, Ramat Rachel, Beit She'arim and Tel Bet Yerah.\nFollowing the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the IES received the first excavation permit issued by the Israeli government allowing it to excavate at Tell Qasile. Since then, the IES has organised and sponsored some of the most important archaeological projects carried out in the country including Tel Hazor, Masada, the excavations in Jerusalem near the Temple Mount, in the Jewish Quarter, and at the City of David, the Judean Desert Expeditions, En-Gedi, Tel Arad, Lachish, Aphek, Jericho, Herodium, Yoqneam, Dor and Tel Megiddo.\nIES is a public organization whose work consists of the organization and sponsoring of archaeological projects, publication of periodicals and excavation reports, and the running of professional conferences.\nConferences and publications\nAnnual meetings\nThe IES, in cooperation with other institutions, has held thirty annual meetings for the professional archaeological community in Israel.\nFifty-nine archaeological conferences have been held for members of the IES. These annual gatherings include lectures by archaeologists and guided tours of recently discovered sites.\nCongresses, published proceedings\n*Biblical archaeology: two international congresses on were held on the topic in 1984 and 1990, attracting hundreds of participants from around the world. The proceedings of both have been published in two volumes entitled Biblical Archaeology Today.\n*Dead Sea Scrolls: in 1997, an international congress was held in Jerusalem marking 50 years since the discovery of the DSS.
