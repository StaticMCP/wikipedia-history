The ceremony was  broadcast live from NBC, and was hosted by Nick Jonas. Musical performers were announced during a series of social media posts.\nNominees for Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Latin Male Artist, and Top Rap Female Artist were announced on April 28, 2021. The full list of nominations was presented on April 29, 2021. The Weeknd received the most nominations on the ceremony, being nominated for sixteen awards, later going on to win the most awards of the ceremony with 10 awards.\nPink received the Billboard Icon Award, Trae tha Truth received the Change Maker Award, and Drake received the Artist of the Decade Award.\nBackground\nFinalists and select winners of the 2021 Billboard Music Awards were based on Billboard charts and reports from March 21, 2020, to April 3, 2021. There are two fan-voted categories; Top Social Artist, and Top Collaboration. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no awards were given for any touring category, including Top Touring Artist. The ceremony was sponsored by Rockstar Energy Drink, Security Benefit, Hot Tools, and Xfinity.\nNick Jonas was announced as the host of the ceremony on April 30, 2021. P!nk was announced as the recipient of the Billboard Icon Award and the first confirmed performer on May 4, 2021. She is the youngest recipient of the award to date, and succeeded Garth Brooks, who won the award in 2020. The award was presented by Jon Bon Jovi. Trae tha Truth was announced as the second recipient of the Change Maker Award on May 13, 2021. The award was presented by Tina Knowles-Lawson. In addition, Billboard has partnered with Trae and his non-profit organization, Angels by Nature, to create the awards show's first-ever non-fungible token (NFT). The sales opened up during the weekend of the ceremony, and all proceeds were donated towards the organization.\nAlthough country singer Morgan Wallen earned six nominations this year, Billboard Music Awards producers announced that Wallen was not invited to attend the ceremony, due to a video released earlier this year by TMZ of him using a racial slur while with his friends in Nashville. In a statement, the production company noted, \"Since his recent conduct does not align with our core values, we will not be including him on the show in any capacity (performing, presenting, accepting).\" The company also stated that Wallen's nominations were solely based on his Billboard charts performance.\nBillboard's Top Artists of the 2010s Decade list was officially revealed on May 11, 2021. Drake ranked at number one, and was honored with the Artist of the Decade Award. Taylor Swift, who ranked at number two overall, is the top female artist of the 2010s decade.\nUnlike the 2020 ceremony, which had no fans in attendance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dick Clark Productions allowed fully vaccinated attendees (meaning they would have had their final vaccine before May 6, 2021) to attend the ceremony. Attendees would be required to show their vaccination card before entering the venue, complete wellness screenings, have their temperature taken, sit in dedicated audience seating, and wear facial coverings at all times. There was an estimated 500–600 fans in attendance.\nPerformers\nOn May 10, 2021, performers were announced on a daily basis, leading up to the ceremony, via social media.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Performer(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Song(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| DJ KhaledH.E.R.Migos\n| \"We Going Crazy\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Doja CatSZA\n| \"Kiss Me More\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Twenty One Pilots\n| \"Shy Away\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Alicia Keys\n| 'Songs in A Minor Medley':\n* \"Piano & I\"\n* \"A Woman's Worth\"\n* \"How Come You Don't Call Me\"\n* \"Fallin'\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| AJR\n| \"Bang!\"\"Way Less Sad\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Pink\n| \"Cover Me in Sunshine\"\"All I Know So Far\"Medley:\n* \"Get the Party Started\"\n* \"So What\"\n* \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\"\n* \"Who Knew\"\n* \"Just Like a Pill\"\n* \"Just Give Me a Reason\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sounds of BlacknessAnn Nesby\n| \"Optimistic\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Karol G\n| \"Bichota\"\"El Makinon\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| BTS\n| \"Butter\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Bad Bunny\n| \"Te Deseo Lo Mejor\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Glass Animals\n| \"Heat Waves\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Weeknd\n| \"Save Your Tears\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Duran Duran Graham Coxon\n| \"Notorious\"\"Invisible\"\"Hungry Like the Wolf\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Jonas BrothersMarshmello\n| Closing Medley:\"Leave Before You Love Me\"\"Sucker\"\"Only Human\"\"Remember This\"\"What a Man Gotta Do\"\n|}\nPresenters\nThe full list of presenters was announced on May 21, 2021, via social media.\n* Nick Jonas – host, introduced Doja Cat & SZA and Twenty One Pilots\n* Lil Rel Howery – presented Top Hot 100 Artist\n* Gabrielle Union – presented Top Selling Song\n* Michelle Obama – introduced Alicia Keys\n* Renée Elise Goldsberry – presented Top Country Female Artist\n* Dixie D'Amelio – introduced AJR\n* Lena Waithe – presented Top Latin Artist\n* Jon Bon Jovi – presented Pink with the Icon Award\n* Lil Baby and Nick Jonas – presented Top Hot 100 Song\n* Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis – introduced Sounds of Blackness featuring Ann Nesby\n* Swizz Beatz – presented Top Rap Song\n* Tina Knowles – presented Trae tha Truth with the Change Maker Award and introduced Padma Lakshmi\n* Padma Lakshmi – introduced BTS\n* Drake's friends and family — presented Drake with the Artist of the Decade Award\n* Chelsea Handler – presenting Top Rock Artist\n* Kathryn Hahn – introduced Glass Animals\n* Henry Golding – introduced the Weeknd\n* Cynthia Erivo – presented Top Billboard 200 Album\n* Priyanka Chopra – introduced Duran Duran\n* Leslie Odom Jr. – presented Top Artist\n* Kelsea Ballerini – introduced the Jonas Brothers and Marshmello\nWinners and nominees\nSelect finalists for the 2021 Billboard Music Awards were announced on April 28, 2021.
