Announced in 2023, the team will replace the Carolina Mudcats, who had been located in the nearby town of Zebulon at Five County Stadium since 1991, with the Brewers' decision to move largely based on funding concerns. The team is named after vintage military aircraft, or \"warbirds,\" for the region's history in aviation dating back to World War II, and for the local whirligig outsider artist and former airman Vollis Simpson. With plans to start their first season in April 2026, reactions to the move and subsequent formation of the team has been welcomed in Wilson and largely criticized in Zebulon and the larger Wake County.\nCreation\nThe Carolina Mudcats were a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) team and Single-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers that were located at Five County Stadium in Zebulon, North Carolina, since 1991. In 2022, the Mudcats requested US$15 million from Wake County to renovate Five County Stadium to meet MiLB standards and attract fans. The county, however, only agreed to fund the required expenses. Later, on December 14, 2023, the nearby town of Wilson announced it was funding a $280 million development project, including a $70 million baseball stadium, later named Wilson Stadium. Appealing to the Brewers, they later signed a memorandum of understanding with Wilson to relocate the Mudcats to the new stadium in a lease lasting 25 years. Alongside the construction of the new stadium, the lack of funding being received from Wake County was regarded as a major reason for the Brewers' decision to move the Mudcats.\nOn November 22, 2024, the Brewers organized an air show to announce the \"Warbirds\" as the name and mascot of the new team. The air show saw around 500 attendees, and included three World War II–era warbird aircraft, as well as a live band. The name was chosen to represent the team because of the region's connection to aviation history. Thousands of pilots were trained in the area during World War II and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base is located nearby. Wilson was also the hometown of whirligig outsider artist and former pilot Vollis Simpson. In reference to Simpson's work, \"Wilson Whirligigs\" was the long-time proposed name for the team, and was only changed after a visit by branding organizer Scott Starr to Wilson, who believed the name lacked nuance. The Mudcats played their last season in 2025. The rebranded Warbirds plan to begin their first season in April 2026.\nReception\n's whirligigs in Wilson, North Carolina, were an inspiration for the team's name.]]\nReactions were mixed at the announcement of the Warbirds, being positive in Wilson, and especially critical from Wake County. Brewers President Rick Schlesinger highly regarded Wilson for their actions leading up, remarking he was \"amazed\" Wilson was being \"so supportive of what we're trying to do\". Brewers minor-league prospects Braylon Payne, Eric Bitonti, and Josh Knoth, all helped in the air show unveiling in November 2024.\nWake County and the town of Zebulon, however, released a joint statement on December 15, 2023, remarking they were \"disappointed\" at the Brewers' decision to relocate the Mudcats. The commissioner for eastern Wake County, Don Mial, remarked \"we really hate that they decided to move to Wilson\", and that \"we would love for them to have stayed here in Wake County\", commenting further on the positive economic impact the Mudcats had on the region. Greater Raleigh Sport Alliance executive director Scott Dupree remarked the team was a \"pride to Zebulon\" and the move would be a \"significant and especially painful loss\", but conceded that he was not surprised at the decision as the $70 million new venue was being offered. Commenting further on this, the pro tem mayor for the neighboring town of Wendell, Jason Joyner, criticized Wake County for not better funding the Mudcats and the eastern region of the county as a whole, referring to the Mudcats' decision to move as a \"shining example of Eastern Wake County being forgotten yet again\".\nBranding\nThe Warbirds mascot is currently an unnamed red-tailed hawk, with the specific bird being chosen as it was the most common hawk in the region. The team colors are navy, sage, antique white, bristol, and smalt. The Warbird's away jerseys are colored bristol with a sage band, the alternate jerseys are red with a white band, and their three caps feature bristol, sage, and navy.\nRoster\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
