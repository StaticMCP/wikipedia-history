Facilities at the Centre in 1977 were very basic with an office, a corrugated iron walled dining room with an open fireplace for cooking meals and three wooden sleeping quarters. There were no gardens and only a few trees in the Centre grounds.\nIn 1980, the centre was renamed the Barambah Field Study Centre and, in 1988, it was renamed the Barambah Environmental Education Centre.\nIn the 1990s, the old school building at Gallangowan (now neighbouring  Manumbar) was moved to the centre and is used as the office and staff room.\nAs at 2019, the centre has native gardens and established trees. An extensive plant nursery, with three hot houses and a large fenced hardening area has also been established.  The dining room and kitchen facilities have been updated and easily cater for all groups who utilise the centre, which has the capacity to sleep 75 people.\nReferences\n== = Attribution ==\n=\nThis Wikipedia article contains material from  under CC-BY-4.0 [https://www.qld.gov.au/legal/copyright licence], accessed on 29 May 2019."
