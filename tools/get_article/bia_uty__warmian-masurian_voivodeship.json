It lies approximately  north-east of Iłowo-Osada,  east of Działdowo, and  south of the regional capital Olsztyn.\nThe village structure of Bialutten was shaped by the manor estate (Rittergut) and its outlying farms, Eichberg (Polish: Dębini) and Prusken (Polish: Pruski). Postcards from the period before World War II depict, alongside the manor house (\"Schloss\"), both the Protestant and Catholic churches as well as the \"Gasthaus Aug. Sawetzki\". Today, the manor estate, the Protestant church, and the hereditary burial site of the Oehlrich estate-owning family are in ruins.\nIn July 2022, two mass graves were found in the nearby Białuty Forest. The graves contained ca. 17 tonnes of human ashes, estimated to originate from at least 8000 inmates of the Soldau concentration camp (1940–1944).\nReferences"
