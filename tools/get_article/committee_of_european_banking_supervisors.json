The Groupe de Contact continued activity, including after the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank and its Banking Supervision Committee, as a lower-level venue for addressing individual supervisory cases of common interest. The Groupe de Contact also produced studies that informed other policy processes, including at the global level through the Basel Committee. Upon the creation of CEBS, the Groupe de Contact was subsumed into it as one of the CEBS expert groups.\nOverview\nCEBS was established by the European Commission by Decision 2004/5/EC, and held its first meeting on .
