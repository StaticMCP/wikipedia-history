Shaggy described the album as a \"Summer follow-up\" to Shaggy & Friends, which was released in January 2011. The album was mostly produced by Shaggy. The album's lead single, \"Fired Up (Fuck the Rece$$ion!)\", was released on 8 March 2011, and features vocals from Cuban-American rapper Pitbull. The album's second single, \"Sugarcane\", was released just three days prior to the album, and was produced by Teflon, formerly of hip-hop's Ruff Ryders Crew, and the producer of Eve's worldwide smash hit \"Who's That Girl\". The album was priced at $2.99 for a limited time through iTunes, Amazon and other major digital outlets, however, this promotion ended on Labor Day. In 2012, Shaggy announced plans to release a 'Lava edition' of the album on 7 February 2012, this time being issued both physically and via digital download. The 'Lava edition' was preceded by the album's third single, a new version of \"Dame\" featuring Kat DeLuna. The 'Lava edition' contains two brand new songs - \"Hurting\" and \"She Gives Me Love\", featuring Sly & Robbie.\nTrack listing\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 2:56\n| title2          = Sugarcane\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 3:27\n| title3          = Dame\n| note3           = featuring Celia\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = Costi Ioniță\n| length3         = 3:13\n| title4          = Feeling Alive\n| note4           = featuring Agent Sasco\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Shaggy\n| length4         = 3:23\n| title5          = End of the World (Drink Up)\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 3:10\n| title6          = Soldiers Story\n| note6           = featuring Jaiden\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          = Shaggy\n| length6         = 3:47\n| title7          = Fired Up (Fuck the Rece$$ion!)\n| note7           = featuring Pitbull\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = Shaggy\n| length7         = 3:18\n| title8          = The Only One (Lie to Me)\n| note8           = featuring Jaiden\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          = Shaggy\n| length8         = 4:36\n}}\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| total_length    =\n| title1          = Just Another Girl\n| note1           = featuring Tarrus Riley\n| writer1         =\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 2:56\n| title2          = She Gives Me Love\n| note2           = featuring Sly & Robbie\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 3:39\n| title3          = Feeling Alive\n| note3           = featuring Agent Sasco\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = Shaggy\n| length3         = 3:23\n| title4          = Dame\n| note4           = featuring Kat Deluna\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Costi Ioniță\n| length4         = 3:28\n| title5          = Sugarcane\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 3:27\n| title6          = Fired Up (Fuck the Rece$$ion!)\n| note6           = featuring Pitbull\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          = Shaggy\n| length6         = 3:18\n| title7          = Hurting\n| length7         = 3:49\n| title8          = Soldiers Story\n| note8           = featuring Jaiden\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          = Shaggy\n| length8         = 3:47\n| title9          = The Only One (Lie to Me)\n| note9           = featuring Jaiden\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          = Shaggy\n| length9         = 4:36\n| title10         = End of the World (Drink Up)\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         =\n| length10        = 3:10\n}}\nReferences"
