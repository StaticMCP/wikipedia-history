It was one of six army corps, following the disbandment of the 6th Corps on February 26, 1994, and the decision not to form an 8th Corps.\nEstablished during the later stages of the Bosnian War, the 7th Corps was primarily tasked with unifying military forces from the Bosnian Krajina () in Central Bosnia (). Its headquarters and main military base were located in Travnik.\nThe official establishment of the 7th Corps followed a period of intense preparation and negotiation, complicated by ongoing hostilities, particularly between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). Only after the cessation of these internal clashes—formalized through the Washington Agreement in March 1994—could the Corps be effectively organized and deployed. Appointed as its first commander was Brigadier General Mehmed Alagić, a military leader who brought both strategic insight and organizational discipline to the new formation.\nFrom its inception, the Corps played a central role in key military operations aimed at regaining control over occupied territories and securing vital logistical corridors. It also served as a symbol of the Republic’s ability to adapt and reconfigure its forces in response to the evolving demands of the war. Beyond its tactical significance, the Corps reflected the maturing institutional capacity of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, representing a shift toward more structured, professional military organization even amidst the turmoil of conflict.\nIn the post-war period, following the Dayton Peace Agreement, the 7th Corps, like all wartime formations, entered a phase of demobilization and transformation. As Bosnia and Herzegovina moved toward peace and reconstruction, the military underwent a gradual process of unification and professionalization. The legacy of the 7th Corps thus extends beyond its battlefield contributions; it stands as a symbol of resilience, adaptability, and the continued struggle to assert and defend Bosnian sovereignty during one of the most turbulent periods in the country’s modern history.\nBackground\nThe organization and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina's armed forces evolved through several stages. In the early days of the conflict, defense efforts were modeled on Yugoslavia’s concept of \"all-national defense.\" With much of the territory under occupation and the nation engaged in armed struggle against two adversaries - Army of Republika Srpska supported by Serbia and later the Croatian Defence Council supported by Croatia,  this territorial defense strategy emerged as the only viable approach under the circumstances.\nTerritorial Defense of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nThe concept was rooted in the idea of mass civilian resistance, inspired by the partisan movement of the Second World War.  However, from the very beginning, its development and organizational structure also reflected an effort to achieve a strategic balance of political power between the Yugoslav federation and its constituent republics and provinces. The Territorial Defense of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina maintained a very small peacetime core, consisting of just 1,403 personnel across the entire country. By early April 1992, only 91 active officers were serving, while the remainder of the force comprised reserve military officers and civilians.\nTerritorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nAs the situation evolved, the Presidency declared a state of imminent danger of war, leading to the dissolution of the Socialist Republic’s Territorial Defense and the formation of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This transition established a new headquarters, retained the existing Territorial Defense units and structures, and simultaneously marked the beginning of a new phase in its development. While maintaining legal and historical continuity, this shift signified a critical reorganization to address the growing demands of the war. The main strength of the Territorial Defense lay in its formation process. Following the declaration of imminent danger of war and the subsequent partial mobilization based on the Presidency's decisions, a mass enrollment of volunteers into the Territorial Defense began. A smaller portion of these volunteers arrived at mobilization sites already armed with weapons they had acquired through various means. However, a significant number of volunteers who could not be immediately equipped were registered and sent back home, instructed to await further calls for engagement. Under these circumstances, it was not yet possible to fully control or efficiently manage the organization and deployment of mobilized personnel. Numerous units of varying sizes were formed, ranging from small groups of fighters and divisions to platoons, companies, and detachments. This lack of cohesion further complicated the already fragmented leadership and command structure.\nTo address this, on April 18, 1992, the Headquarters of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina issued an order for consolidation. This reorganization was to be implemented on a territorial basis while preserving the existing structure. Smaller groups and departments operating within localized areas were merged into platoons. These platoons, including those already established at the level of local communities or settlements, were further consolidated into companies.\nAt the municipal level, the order called for the creation of larger infantry units at the battalion-detachment level, along with artillery and anti-tank units based on available resources. Additionally, the formation of anti-sabotage units, military police units, and other necessary formations was directed to strengthen overall organizational capacity.  At the end of April 1992, the Headquarters of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina headquarters had in its records 268 independent platoons, 269 independent companies and 86 detachments, manned by 76,272 members.\nDuring the transitional period, efforts to further organize and consolidate the forces of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina remained a priority. These activities aimed to enhance the structure and readiness of the defense forces amidst escalating conflict. The situation culminated in the official declaration of a state of war in the Republic on June 20, 1992, marking a significant turning point in the nation's efforts to mobilize and defend its sovereignty. Between April 30 and June 30, 1992, the number of mobilized members of the Territorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina surged to 131,528. During this period, the total number of units increased from 676 to 696. This growth was accompanied by a structural reorganization, with a reduction in the number of independent platoons and companies and an expansion in the formation of detachments, battalions, and brigades to enhance operational efficiency and coordination.\nArmy of the Republic Of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nThe transitional period, during which the Territorial Defense functioned as the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, lasted until July 4, 1992. On that date, the Presidency issued a decision that formally established the organization of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This decision outlined the formation of headquarters, commands, units, and institutions of the Army, officially putting it into operation and marking the beginning of its gradual development into a structured and cohesive military force. The Territorial Defense of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina officially ceased to exist, as its Headquarters was transformed into the Main Headquarters of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nDuring the summer of 1992, as the tasks facing the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina grew increasingly complex, the General Staff drafted a proposal for advancing its organizational and structural development by establishing Army corps as permanent formations. This initiative was seen as a potential strategic turning point, enabling a shift from a primarily defensive posture to combined and large-scale offensive operations aimed at liberating the country. On August 18, 1992, the Presidency adopted the decision to establish corps within the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, defining their zones of responsibility and command structure. The formation included the 1st Corps, headquartered in Sarajevo; the 2nd Corps, headquartered in Tuzla; the 3rd Corps, initially designated for Banja Luka but operating from a temporary headquarters in Zenica; the 4th Corps, headquartered in Mostar; and the 5th Corps, headquartered in Bihać.\nFormation\nThe idea to form the 7th Corps arose not only from military necessity but also from a political desire to unite the Krajina military element in Central Bosnia under a separate corps. This corps was envisioned to focus its operations on the Bosnian Krajina (). A key moment for the formation occurred on August 21, 1993, in Zenica, during a briefing between members of the Supreme Command and Corps commanders, where preparations for the 7th Corps were initiated.\nThe Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, through Decision No. 02-111-19/94 dated January 11, 1994, officially approved the formation of the 7th Corps. The Headquarters of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina subsequently began organizing its establishment. However, ongoing combat operations against two adversaries in the operational zone of the 3rd Corps (the future zone of the 7th Corps) delayed progress until the cessation of hostilities between the Croatian Defence Council and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, formalized by the Washington Agreement.\nThe Presidency officially decided on the formation of the 7th Corps on February 26, 1994. appointing Brigadier General Mehmed Alagić as its commander. The Corps was given the temporary wartime formation number T-412.191, the assigned name T-30009, and the military unit number VJ 5029.\nThe first official operational report from the 7th Corps Command to the Headquarters of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina was sent on April 7, 1994. This date is celebrated as the official formation day of the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nIntegration\nFollowing the signings of the Washington Agreement on March 18, 1994, which led to the creation of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Dayton Agreement on December 14, 1995, the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with the Croatian Defence Council, began the process of demobilizing wartime forces. This demobilization marked the beginning of preparations for the transition to peacetime operations and the professionalization of the military. The Defense Law of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted in late August 1996, provided a framework for the gradual integration of the forces into a unified Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This integration was successfully completed over the next three years.\nReform\nAfter the establishment of peace, Bosnia and Herzegovina had three (Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatian Defence Council and Army of Republika Srpska) completely separate armies, which until then were in conflict with each other. Today, after the defense reform of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina are united under a single chain of command and subordinated to civilian authorities, with the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina as the supreme commander.\nOperational Zone\nThe main task of the 7th Corps was to carry out combat operations towards the northwestern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the direction of Bosanska Krajina.\nThe frontline in the operational zone towards the Army of Republika Srpska was about 140 kilometers, and included the Vlasić and Komar-Vrbas  tactical directions and the Kupres tactical direction. In addition the 7th Corps was also engaged towards the Croatian Defence Council. The length of the front line in the operational zone towards the Croatian Defence Council was about 120 kilometers, and included the Lašva and Upper Vakuf directions.\nOperational zone of the 7th Corps included the following municipalities: Banja Luka, Bosanska Gradiška, Bosansko Grahovo, Bugojno, Čelinac, Donji Vakuf, Gornji Vakuf, Glamoč, Jajce, Kotor Varoš, Kupres, Laktasi, Livno, Mrkonjić Grad, Novi Travnik, Travnik, Vitez, Skender-Vakuf and i Šipovo.\nPersonnel\nAs of February 1995, the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina had a total of 23,997 permanent personnel, out of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina overall established strength of 229,823 personnel. The breakdown of the 7th Corps personnel was as follows:\n* Commissioned Officers: 1,263\n* Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs): 1,267\n* Soldiers: 21,467\nThis distribution highlights the typical military hierarchy within the corps, with the majority of personnel consisting of soldiers, supported by smaller numbers of officers and NCOs.\nLeadership\nThe Brigadier General is the highest-ranking officer of the Corps appointed by the Presidency. Due to the constraints placed by the war, the primary role was to organize units and create functioning command structure in the zone of operation. The first and only commander of the 7th Corps was Mehmed Alagić. In 1997, General Mehmed Alagić was awarded with the Order of the Golden Coat of Arms with Swords ().\n.]]\nA deputy commander is the second-in-command to a commander, acts on the Commander's behalf when required and performs other duties as directed by the Commander.

The backbone of the maneuver units would be formed primarily from the exiled population from the occupied territories, for example the 17th Krajina Brigade, 305th Jajace Brigade, later 27th Mountain Brigade.\nIn terms of weaponry, the 7th Corps was a distinctly infantry unit. There were 7 tanks in the Corps. 73 large-caliber artillery pieces, 459 pieces of 82mm and 60mm mortars and over 12,000 infantry firearms.\nThe 7th Corps was formed from the combat elements of the 3rd Corps, primarily from units of OG \"Bosanska Krajina\" and OG\n\"Zapad\".\nThe following brigades from the Operational Zone ‘’Bosanska krajina’’ became part of the 7th Corps:\n17th Knight's Krajina Mountain Brigade\nThe 17th Brigade was formed on 19 November 1992 out of two existing units: the 1st and 7th Brigades () from Krajina. Its headquarters were in Travnik in the former JNA Barracks. Initially it consisted of two battalions primarily of volunteers and refugees from Krajina and with the arrival of more soldiers the 3rd and 4th battalions were created. Fourth battalion was created from the soldiers of the 84th brigade and the elements of the 1st Kotorvaroš Battalion of HVO. It was a “manoeuvre” brigade within the 3rd Corps and took part in actions all over the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From November 1992 to April 1993, it had 900 men.\nOn the first anniversary of the formation of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by the Decree of the President of the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr Alija Izetbegović, dated April 14, 1993 for overall contribution made to the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the exceptional combat successes they continuously achieve and the courage, determination and dedication of their members shown in the performance of all combat and other tasks, as well as the care and protection of citizens the Brigade received the honorary title Glorious ()., and in 1995 the honorary title Knight's ().\nAmir Žilić, commander of the 2nd Battalion, was posthumously awarded with the Order of the Golden Coat of Arms with Swords () in 1994 as well as the Order of the Golden Liliy () in 1993.
