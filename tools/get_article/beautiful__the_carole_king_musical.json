Then, in Brooklyn 1958, 16-year-old Carole tells her mother, Genie, she is going into Manhattan to try to sell a song to music publisher Donnie Kirshner. In the long tradition of mothers, Genie is opposed to her daughter's wish and in the equally long tradition of teenagers not caring about their mother's opinion, Carole goes anyway. At 1650 Broadway, she hears the \"1650 Broadway Medley\". She then sings her new song \"It Might As Well Rain Until September\". Donnie says he will take it and hopes she has others. At Queens College, Carole meets a handsome young lyricist named Gerry Goffin. They agree to collaborate, musically and romantically, which in both cases turns out to be a fertile arrangement. When they go to Donnie's to play their new song, Carole confesses to Gerry that she is pregnant. Gerry asks her to marry him. It gives her an extra depth of feeling when she sings their new song for Donnie, \"Some Kind of Wonderful\", which The Drifters then record.\nThey get an office at 1650. While there, Carole meets a new lyricist Cynthia Weil (\"Happy Days Are Here Again\"), who is looking for a composer to work with. Gerry and Carole sing their new song \"Take Good Care of My Baby\", during which Barry Mann, the composer with the office next door, enters. Barry meets Cynthia and they decide to collaborate. As they begin to work, sparks fly. Donnie tells them he needs a song for the Shirelles. The couples compete for the job. In Donnie's office the next morning, Carole and Gerry present \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\". Cynthia and Barry perform \"He's Sure the Boy I Love\". Donnie picks Carole and Gerry's song for The Shirelles and it goes to no. 1. And so, on either side of the same wall, a competition is born. The two teams turn out an amazing parade of songs: \"Up on the Roof\", \"On Broadway\", \"The Loco-Motion\" and \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\".\nGerry and Carole are at the taping of a TV special where their new song, \"One Fine Day\", is being performed by the dazzling Janelle Woods. During a break, Gerry confesses to Carole that he is restless in their marriage. He wants to sleep with Janelle, and he doesn't want to lie about it. Carole is stunned. As the song begins again, she takes it over and sings it herself.\nAct II\nCarole is in a recording studio doing a demo of \"Chains\". Gerry is off with Janelle but tells her he will meet her later. Nick, a guitarist, asks Carole to come sing at the Bitter End sometime but she declines — she's a songwriter, not a singer. The thing with Gerry is getting her down so she goes and talks to Cynthia who is also having trouble with Barry — they split up. Carole decides to tell Gerry he has to end the affair with Janelle. As she leaves, Barry comes in. He and Cynthia make up and play their new song, \"Walking in the Rain\". Gerry shows up, but he is not making sense. He eventually has a breakdown. At the hospital, he tells Carole he will end the affair with Janelle and that he wants to come home. She suggests they make a new start and move to the suburbs (\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\").\nBarry, Cynthia and Donnie come to see the new house. Barry plays their new song, \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\". Depressed that he and Carole can't do as well, Gerry leaves in a funk for the city. While he is gone, it comes out that Barry and Cynthia have seen him with another woman, a singer named Marilyn Wald. Carole goes to Marilyn's apartment and Gerry is there. It's the final straw, and she ends their marriage. At the Bitter End, where Barry and Cynthia hear their song \"Uptown\", Carole explains she went to Los Angeles for a vacation and has started writing on her own. Nick, the guitarist from the studio who asked her to sing with his group, is playing there and urges her to sing. She sings her new song, \"It's Too Late\". She decides to move to Los Angeles. At 1650, she says goodbye to Donnie, Barry and Cynthia and plays them a parting present \"You've Got a Friend\".\nIn Los Angeles, she records her album, Tapestry. The session goes well until the last song, which she is afraid to sing. It's a song she wrote with Gerry and she is afraid of the feelings it may stir up. Her producer, Lou Adler, persuades her. She sings \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\". The album is a smash. Carole is at Carnegie Hall for her concert, and is met by Gerry, who apologizes for the way he mistreated her in the past and gives her a final prediction - \"you're going all the way\". Carole takes to the piano, and performs for her audience.\nMusic\nMusical numbers\n;Act 1\n*\"So Far Away\" - Carole King\n*\"Oh Carol\" - Neil Sedaka†\n*\"1650 Broadway Medley\" - Ensemble\n*\"It Might as Well Rain Until September\" - Carole King\n*\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\" - Ensemble†\n*\"Some Kind of Wonderful\" - Carole King, Gerry Goffin and The Drifters\n*\"Happy Days Are Here Again\" - Cynthia Weil\n*\"Take Good Care of My Baby\" - Gerry Goffin and Carole King\n*\"Who Put the Bomp\" - Barry Mann†\n*\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" - Carole King\n*\"He's Sure the Boy I Love\" - Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann\n*\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" - The Shirelles\n*\"Up on the Roof\" - Gerry Goffin and The Drifters\n*\"On Broadway\" - The Drifters\n*\"The Locomotion\" - Little Eva and Ensemble\n*\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" - Barry Mann and The Righteous Brothers\n*\"One Fine Day\" - Janelle, Backup Singers and Carole King\n;Act 2\n*\"Chains\" - Carole King and Ensemble\n*\"Walking in the Rain\" - Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil\n*\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\" - Marilyn Wald, Gerry Goffin and Ensemble\n*\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" - Barry Mann\n*\"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\" (Reprise) - Carole King†\n*\"Uptown\" - \"Uptown\" Singer and Ensemble\n*\"It's Too Late\" - Carole King and Ensemble\n*\"You've Got a Friend\" - Carole King, Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Don Kirshner\n*\"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" - Carole King and Ensemble\n*\"Beautiful\" - Carole King and Company\n*\"I Feel the Earth Move\" - Carole King and Company\n† Not included on the original Broadway Cast Album.\nOrchestra\nThe musical uses a 12-member orchestra consisting of three keyboards, two guitars, bass, drums, percussion, two reeds, trumpet/flugelhorn, and trombone/bass trombone.

He wrote that the musical shows the change in King from a modest songwriter to the popular and confident performer of those songs, showing the \"real, conflicted person within the reluctant star.\"\nJesse Green, in his review for the New York Magazine, praised the performers but criticized the book, writing that the musical does not have the \"dramatic coherence of book biomusicals\". Similarly, Elyse Sommer, in her review for curtainup.com, praised the performers, especially Mueller, Spector and Larsen, as well as the \"shimmery lighting\" and the costumes. She wrote that while the musical \"doesn't hang its songs on the greatest or most suspenseful story ever told, it has enough bounce and Broadway show glitz to keep you in your seat\".\nAwards and nominations\nOriginal Broadway production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! style=\"width:45%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=13 style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2014\n| rowspan=7| Tony Award\n| colspan=2| Best Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Book of a Musical\n| Douglas McGrath\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress in a Musical\n| Jessie Mueller\n|\n|-\n| Best Featured Actor in a Musical\n| Jarrod Spector\n|\n|-\n| Best Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Anika Larsen\n|\n|-\n| Best Orchestrations\n| Steve Sidwell\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Design\n| Brian Ronan\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=6| Drama Desk Award\n| colspan=2| Outstanding Musical\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Book of a Musical\n| Douglas McGrath\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Actress in a Musical\n| Jessie Mueller\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Anika Larsen\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Orchestrations\n| Steve Sidwell\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Sound Design in a Musical\n| Brian Ronan\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2015\n| Grammy Award\n| Best Musical Theater Album\n| Jessie Mueller (principal soloist); Jason Howland, Steve Sidwell & Billy Jay Stein (producers)\n|\n|}\nOriginal London production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Award Ceremony\n! style=\"width:45%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2015\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Laurence Olivier Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best New Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress in a Musical\n| Katie Brayben\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical\n| Ian McIntosh\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical\n| Lorna Want\n|\n|-\n| Best Theatre Choreographer\n| Josh Prince\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Alejo Vietti\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Design\n| Brian Ronan\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Achievement in Music\n| The Orchestra\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |WhatsOnStage Awards\n| colspan=\"2\" |Best New Musical\n|\n|-\n|Best Actress in a Musical\n|Katie Brayben\n|\n|}\nFilm adaptation\nOn March 22, 2015, it was announced that Sony Pictures would be bringing the musical to the big screen with Douglas McGrath adapting his book into a screenplay and stage producer Paul Blake producing through Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman's production company, Playtone.\nIn December 2022, Daisy Edgar-Jones was cast in the lead role of the film, with Lisa Cholodenko directing from a script she co-wrote with Stuart Blumberg.
