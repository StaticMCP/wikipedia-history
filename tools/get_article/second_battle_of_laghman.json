It took place near Laghman, present day Afghanistan.\nThe Ghaznavids defeated the Hindu Shahis and emerged victorious in the battle. This battle laid the foundation for the Ghaznavids to establish their dominance over parts of present-day Afghanistan and northern India.\nBackground\nGhaznavids had defeated the Hindu Shahis at the first battle of Laghman in 988. The Hindu Shahi King Jayapala, who was forced to sign a treaty after the battle, returned to his capital Multan, and made preparations to avenge his defeat.\nJayapala orchestrated the formation of a confederacy comprising Hindu chiefs from the Tomara dynasty, Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty, Chahamanas, and Chandelas. This alliance was aimed at preparing for a pivotal battle. Jayapala amassed a force 100,000 cavalry and an immense contingent of foot soldiers.\nBattle\nJayapala led a contingent of Rajput allies as they advanced from Multan toward Laghman. Sabuktigin, leading his outnumbered army, confronted Jayapala and recognized the significant disparity in their forces. To increase his chances of victory in the battle, he made strategic preparations to engage the Shahis. He divided his troops into squadrons of 500 men each, and directed them to attack the enemy on one particular point. Sabuktigin successfully executed his strategy, leading the Ghaznavids to overcome the Hindu Shahi forces. After having high casualties, Hindus gave up but they were driven with dreadful slaughter beyond the Indus.\nFollowing this triumph, Sabuktigin appointed a governor in Peshawar with a force of 10,000 troops. He then proceeded to incorporate the territory between Laghman and Peshawar into his empire.\nReferences"
