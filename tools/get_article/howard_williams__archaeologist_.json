R. Williams  (born 1972) is a British archaeologist and academic who is Professor of Archaeology at the University of Chester in England. His research focuses on the study of death, burial and memory in Early Medieval Britain.\nBiography\nWilliams obtained a BSc from the University of Sheffield, and later attended the University of Reading where he received a MS and a PhD. degree. He has taught archaeology at Trinity College Carmarthen, Cardiff University and the University of Exeter, and since 2008 at the University of Chester.\nWilliams's research focuses on the archaeology of Early Medieval Britain. He has published scholarly journals, books, and co-published books on the archaeology of Medieval Britain, death and burial, Vikings, and landscapes and memory.\nIn 2017 Williams co-founded the Offa's Dyke Collaboratory: an initiative to build momentum for new research into Offa's Dyke, Wat's Dyke and their landscape contexts. The Collaboratory also involves the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust, the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and the Offa's Dyke Association. In 2019 Williams led the establishment of the ''Offa's Dyke Journal'', an open access journal 'promoting the archaeology, history and heritage of frontiers and borderlands focusing on the Anglo-Welsh border'; the journal is edited by Williams and Liam Delaney.\nIn December 2018, Williams was featured in the BBC 4 documentary Beyond the Walls: In Search of the Celts.\nAwards and recognition\nOn 16 February 2006, Williams was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA). In 2017, he won the Society for Medieval Archaeology's Martyn Jope Award for \"the best novel interpretation, application of analytical method or presentation of new findings\" published in that year's volume of Medieval Archaeology, along with co-author Patricia Murrieta-Flores.\nSelected publications\n* Bradley, R.J. & Williams, H.
