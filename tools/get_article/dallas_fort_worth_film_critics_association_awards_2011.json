These awards \"recognizing extraordinary accomplishment in film\" are presented annually by the Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association (DFWFCA), based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex region of Texas. The organization, founded in 1990, includes 29 film critics for print, radio, television, and internet publications based in north Texas. The Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association began presenting its annual awards list in 1991.\nThe Descendants was the DFWFCA's most awarded film of 2011 taking top honors in the Best Picture, Best Actor (George Clooney), Best Supporting Actress (Shailene Woodley), Best Director (Alexander Payne), and Best Screenplay (Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash) categories. This continued a trend of critics groups across the United States giving their top prizes to the film about a family dealing with betrayal, loss, and change.\nNo other film earned multiple 2011 honors from the critics association. Beginners earned Christopher Plummer the Best Supporting Actor honor for his performance as Hal. The other acting award went to Michelle Williams as Best Actress for her leading role as Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn. His work on The Tree of Life earned Emmanuel Lubezki the honor for Best Cinematography. The remaining film honors went to Rango as Best Animated Film, Cave of Forgotten Dreams as Best Documentary, and Iran's A Separation as Best Foreign Language Film.\nAlong with the 11 \"best of\" category awards, the group also presented the Russell Smith Award to We Need to Talk About Kevin as the \"best low-budget or cutting-edge independent film\" of the year. The award is named in honor of late Dallas Morning News film critic Russell Smith.\nWinners\nWinners are listed first and highlighted with boldface.
