This is seen as the first step to achieving 'The 20% Church' – cutting carbon emissions from Church activities, structures and processes to 20% of current levels by 2050, in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\nThe campaign follows a discussion at the 2005 General Synod that resulted in a call for the Church to engage with the issues of climate change and energy use.\nSee also\n*Avoiding dangerous climate change\n*Business action on climate change\n*Christianity and environmentalism\n*Individual and political action on climate change\n*Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom\n*Energy policy of the United Kingdom\n*Kyoto Protocol\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070502151338/http://www.shrinkingthefootprint.cofe.anglican.org/ Shrinking the footprint - official site]\nFurther reading\n*''[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/gensynod/agendas/gs1558.pdf Sharing God's Planet]'' (Church of England's statement on the environment); Church House Publishing;\n*How many lightbulbs does it take to change a Christian?
