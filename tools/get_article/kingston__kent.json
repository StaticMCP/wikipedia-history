The parish contains the hamlet of Marley.\nHistory\n, now World Museum Liverpool]]\nThe Kingston Brooch, an important piece of Anglo-Saxon jewellery dating from the 7th Century, was discovered in a tumulus on Kingston Downs in 1771 by the Reverend Bryan Faussett (1720–1776), then Rector of Kingston. It is 8&nbsp;cm in diameter, made of gold, with garnet, blue glass and shell settings.  It is now on display in the World Museum in Liverpool.\nGeography\nThe village is centred 5 miles south east of the city centre of Canterbury on the edge of the North Downs in rolling hilly countryside that is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\nReligious sites\nThe local church, dedicated to Saint Giles, originated during the 11th century, and is now part of the Barham Downs group of churches. The walls of the nave and about two-thirds of the present chancel are thought to be original, the chancel being extended in the 13th century. The font is also said to date from the 13th Century. The tower of a windmill stands some distance from the village.\nNotable people\nSheila May Edmonds, mathematician, born here in 1916\nExternal links\n* [http://www.barhamdownschurches.org.uk/ Kingston Parish Church]\n* [https://kingstoncanterbury.uk/ Kingston Village Hall]\nReferences"
