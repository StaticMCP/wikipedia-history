He ruled 21 September 1752 – 31 January 1753, and September 1772 – 17 July 1793.\nDeath and succession\nVijay Singh wanted his grandson Man Singh to succeed him. But after Vijay Singh's death on 17 July 1793, a civil war once again started in Jodhpur between his sons and grandsons. Bhim Singh usurped the throne but could never consolidate his rule.\nGulabrai, one of the concubines of the Maharaja, rose up the ranks and became the 18th century Marwar Rajput king's favourite.\nSee also\n*Rulers of Marwar\nReferences"
