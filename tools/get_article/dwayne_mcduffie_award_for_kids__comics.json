It is named in honour of Dwayne McDuffie, a creator known for his work creating comics and animation.\nThe award was created after consultation with McDuffie's widow Charlotte Fullerton.\nKids Read Comics administers the award. It is presented each year at the Ann Arbor Comic Arts Festival at Ann Arbor District Library. Anyone can nominate a title for the award, but the shortlist and winner are chosen by a panel of judges including reviewers, librarians, teachers, and comic industry professionals.\nCriticism\nIn 2017 the award was criticized for creating a shortlist of comics created almost entirely by white people. Raina Telgemeier won the award that year and in her acceptance speech highlighted ten recent graphic novels by diverse creators and gave away ten copies of each to members of the audience.\nIn response to the criticism the award began to allow anyone to nominate titles.\nAward winners and nominees\n2015\n* 'Hilda and the Black Hound by Luke Pearson (Flying Eye Books)'\n* Bird and Squirrel on Ice by James Burks (Graphix)\n* Cat Dad, King of the Goblins by Britt Wilson (Koyama Press)\n* Cleopatra in Space by Mike Maihack (Graphix)\n* Costume Quest: Invasion of the Candy Snatchers by Zac Gorman (Oni Press)\n* El Deafo by Cece Bell (Harry N.
