He is well known for producing artists such as Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur, Nate Dogg, The Game, Xzibit and Tha Eastsidaz, along with a number of other West Coast rappers and artists. Battlecat has also produced a number of noted R&B artists, including Faith Evans, Brian McKnight,\nTyrese and Jon B..\nHis aesthetic is a progression from the early-'90s G-Funk sound pioneered by Above the Law and Dr. Dre, characterized by fat synth bass lines and soulful keys, as well as the occasional use of a vocoder/talk box revolutionized by the late Roger Troutman. He is also the concert DJ for Snoop Dogg. As a youth he was a member of the Neighborhood Rollin 60s crip, because of this he has also produced instrumentals for the 1993 album \"Bangin' on Wax\" by rap collaboration Bloods & Crips, which went Gold.\nIn 2009, Battlecat produced a special song called \"A Soldier Never Dies\", dedicated to fallen Marine, Anthony Vargas. Battlecat is a DJ member of The Worldwide DJ organization, The Core DJs.\nThe music video was directed by Paolo Ongkeko and produced by Don Le. One of the video's leads was portrayed by Sonny Ayon.\nDiscography\n*1988: \"D.J.
