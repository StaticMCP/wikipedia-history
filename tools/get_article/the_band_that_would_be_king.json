It was also their third and last studio album released on their label, 50 Skidillion Watts.\nCritical reception\nTrouser Press wrote that \"a lot of the songs are fragmentary, and the music — a sloppy mess of guitars, harmonica and saxophones — sounds largely improvised, but a few tunes ('Some Things Last a Long Time,' 'Postcard from Far Away,' etc.) are genuinely delightful.\"\nTrack listing\n(last three only mentioned on label, not on the sleeve)\nPersonnel\nHalf Japanese\n* Jad Fair – vocals, guitar, harmonica\n* Don Fleming – guitar, vocals\n* Mr. J.
