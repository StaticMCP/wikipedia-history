The ceremony was hosted by Garry Shandling and was broadcast on ABC.\nThe HBO miniseries Angels in America had the most successful night. It became the first program to sweep every major category, going 7/7, in Emmy history, until 2020 when Schitt’s Creek repeated the feat. Along with Schitt’s Creek, ''Caesar's Hour in 1957 and The Crown in 2021, it is one of only four programs to win all four main acting categories.\nUpstart comedy series Arrested Development won Outstanding Comedy Series (being the second time Fox won that specific award) and two other major awards overall.  Its pilot became the twelfth episode to accomplish the directing/writing double.\nAfter years of winning everything but the top prize, The Sopranos finally took home the crown for Outstanding Drama Series, not only knocking off four-time defending champion The West Wing but by being the first cable show, HBO, ever to beat any of the Big Four television networks for that award.  It led all dramas with twelve major nominations and four major wins. One of those wins was for Drea de Matteo for Drama Supporting Actress and, too, was the first time that award went to a cable network.  Furthermore, the cable network also won for the first times in the Comedy Lead Actress and Comedy Supporting Actress categories (Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon respectively for Sex and the City).\nEntering its final ceremony, five-time series champion Frasier needed five major wins to tie The Mary Tyler Moore Shows record of 27 major wins. Because it was only nominated in three major categories, breaking the record was not possible. Though it did not tie the record, Frasier finished its Emmy career on a high note, winning two major awards, the most it had won since 1998. Its 25 major wins put it at second of all time. When adding its wins in technical categories, its total rises to 37, the most for any comedy series.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in bold:\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Arrested Development (Fox)'\n** Curb Your Enthusiasm (HBO)\n** Everybody Loves Raymond (CBS)\n** Sex and the City (HBO)\n** Will & Grace (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Sopranos (HBO)'\n** 24 (Fox)\n** CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS)\n** Joan of Arcadia (CBS)\n** The West Wing (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Something the Lord Made (HBO)'\n** And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself (HBO)\n** Ike: Countdown to D-Day (A&E)\n** The Lion in Winter (Showtime)\n** The Reagans (Showtime)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Angels in America (HBO)'\n** American Family (PBS)\n** Hornblower (A&E)\n** Prime Suspect VI: The Last Witness (PBS)\n** Traffic (USA)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart (Comedy Central)'\n** Chappelle's Show (Comedy Central)\n** Late Night with Conan O'Brien (NBC)\n** Late Show with David Letterman (CBS)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Amazing Race (CBS)'\n** American Idol (Fox)\n** The Apprentice (NBC)\n** Last Comic Standing (NBC)\n** Survivor (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Kelsey Grammer – Frasier as Dr. Frasier Crane (NBC)'\n** Larry David – Curb Your Enthusiasm as himself (HBO)\n** Matt LeBlanc – Friends as Joey Tribbiani (NBC)\n** John Ritter – 8 Simple Rules as Paul Hennessy (ABC) (posthumous)\n** Tony Shalhoub – Monk as Adrian Monk (USA)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City as Carrie Bradshaw (HBO)'\n** Jennifer Aniston – Friends as Rachel Green (NBC)\n** Patricia Heaton – Everybody Loves Raymond as Debra Barone (CBS)\n** Bonnie Hunt – Life with Bonnie as Bonnie Molloy (ABC)\n** Jane Kaczmarek – Malcolm in the Middle as Lois (Fox)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'James Spader – The Practice as Alan Shore (ABC)'\n** James Gandolfini – The Sopranos as Tony Soprano (HBO)\n** Anthony LaPaglia – Without a Trace as Jack Malone (CBS)\n** Martin Sheen – The West Wing as President Jed Bartlet (NBC)\n** Kiefer Sutherland – 24 as Jack Bauer (Fox)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Allison Janney – The West Wing as C.
