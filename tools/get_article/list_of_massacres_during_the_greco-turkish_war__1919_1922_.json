These territories were given to Greeks as part of the Treaty of Sèvres with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, but was rejected by nationalist Turks leading to the war and a series of bloody massacres committed by both sides.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:110px;\" |Name\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |Date\n! style=\"width:90px;\" |Location\n! style=\"width:80px;\" |Deaths\n! style=\"width:75px;\" |Responsible Party\n! style=\"width:75px;\" |Victims\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Notes\n|-\n| Greek landing at Smyrna\n| 15–16 May 1919\n| Smyrna\n| 400–500 killed\n| Greeks, Turks\n| Turks, Greeks\n| The orderly landing of the Greek army soon turned into a riot against the local Turkish population by local Greeks and Greek soldiers.
