A record number of women (208) were elected as MPs.\nParliament consists of the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons. The State Opening of Parliament at the Palace of Westminster by  Queen Elizabeth II was on 21 June 2017. The subsequent parliamentary session was the longest since the formation of the United Kingdom in 1707, and the longest to sit at Westminster since the Long Parliament in the 17th century. The second and last parliamentary session however was the shortest since October 1948, lasting less than a month, from 14 October 2019 until Parliament dissolved at 00:01 on 6 November 2019. Notable newcomers to enter the House of Commons in this General Election included future Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack and future Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross. For the opposition, newcomers included Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Anneliese Dodds and future Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities Marsha de Cordova.\nThe Parliament was marked by extraordinary political turmoil as Governments led by Theresa May and Boris Johnson were unable to win a series of important votes on the issue of Brexit. This left both Parliament and the Government in a prolonged state of deadlock and unable to move forward on the issue. Consequently, there was an unusually high number of defections and suspensions, including the suspension of 21 Conservative MPs in September 2019; 10 of those suspended MPs re-joined the Conservative Party in October 2019. The Parliament was dissolved after MPs passed the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019, which bypassed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 to bring the next election forward to December 2019 from its original scheduled May 2022 date.\nHouse of Commons composition\nBelow are graphical representations of the House of Commons showing party strengths directly after the 2017 general election, at important intermediate points, and immediately prior to dissolution. This is not an actual seating plan of the House, which has only five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the Speaker of the House of Commons and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.\n{| width=600px\n|-\n|\nFile:UK House of Commons 2017 2018-12-19.svg|As at dissolution (see image description page for date)\nFile:UK House of Commons 2017 2019-02-18.svg|18 February 2019 (following the initial Labour defections to the Independent Group)\nFile:UK House of Commons 2018-12-19.svg|19 December 2018\nFile:UK House of Commons 2017-06-26.svg|26 June 2017\n|}\nThis table shows the number of MPs in each party:\n{|  class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" class=unsortable style=\"vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" | Affiliation\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|  Members\n|-\n! data-sort-type=number|At 2017 election\n! data-sort-type=number|At dissolution\n!

The Co-operative Party was represented in the House of Commons by Labour MPs sitting with the Labour and Co-operative designation.\n*\"Members elected\" refers to the composition resulting from the election on 8 June 2017, but note that the confidence and supply arrangement (C&S) was only reached on 26 June.\n*The \"voting total\" is the effective size of the House excluding vacancies, suspensions, and certain members (ten at dissolution): the Speaker, two (usually three) Deputy Speakers (one Labour and one Conservative) who had only a tie-breaking vote constrained by conventions, and seven abstentionist members (Sinn Féin). This left relevant party voting totals as follows: Con 297, Lab 241, SF 0, Speaker 0.\n*The \"safe majority\" (the number of seats needed to have a majority of one or two), \"Gov short by\" (the margin by which the governing Conservatives are short of that majority), and \"Gov + C&S total\" are based on the voting totals. The government entered into a confidence and supply agreement to secure a small majority, which shrank due to defections, finally disappearing on 3 September 2019. Hence, the \"Gov + C&S majority\", calculated as the sum of voting Conservative and Democratic Unionist Party members, less the sum of all other voting members, was negative at dissolution.\nList of MPs elected in the general election\nThe following table is a list of MPs elected, ordered by constituency.

until the Deputy Speakers had been elected. The election of Deputy Speakers took place on 28 June 2017.\nAlthough Deputy Speakers do not resign from their parties, they cease to vote (except to break ties) and they do not participate in party-political activity until the next election.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The seats remained vacant until dissolution and the election of new MPs in the general election on 12 December 2019.\nDefections and suspensions\nThe label under which MPs sit in the House of Commons can change if they leave or are suspended from or expelled by their party. When suspended, they effectively become independents. This Parliament has had an unusually large number of these changes, resulting in the number of MPs sitting as independents rising to its highest level (33) since the Ballot Act 1872 (which introduced secret ballots for elections in the United Kingdom).\nThe Conservative and Labour parties lost numerous MPs through suspensions and defections to other parties. In February 2019, 8 Labour and 3 Conservative MPs formed a new grouping (later a party in its own right), Change UK. That grouping experienced a split in June, with some of its members resigning to form The Independents. The Liberal Democrats have made a gain of 8 seats since the opening of Parliament, including some former Change UK members. The government lost its majority on 3 September 2019, when the Conservative MP Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats. Later the same day, the Conservatives expelled 21 of their MPs for voting against the government, 10 of whom were later readmitted to the party on 29 October.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Date\n!colspan=\"2\"|From\n!colspan=\"2\"|To\n!Constituency\n!width=\"40%\"|Reason\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Anne Marie Morris\n|\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Newton Abbot\n|Suspended from the Conservatives, pending investigation over using the remark \"nigger in the woodpile\".\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Reinstated.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Jared O'Mara\n|\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Sheffield Hallam\n|Suspended from Labour, pending investigation over alleged sexist and homophobic remarks.\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Reinstated.\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Resigned from Labour.\n|-\n|Kelvin Hopkins\n|\n|\n|\n|Luton North\n|Suspended from Labour, pending investigation into sexual allegations.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Charlie Elphicke\n|\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Dover\n|Suspended from the Conservatives, pending police investigation of \"serious allegations\".\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Reinstated.\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|Suspended once again after being charged with sexual assault.\n|-\n|Ivan Lewis\n|\n|\n|\n|Bury South\n|Suspended from Labour, pending investigation of sexual harassment.
