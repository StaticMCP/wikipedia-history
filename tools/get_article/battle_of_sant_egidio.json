Braccio's victory resulted in his long-desired conquest of Perugia, of which he became lord.\nAs a result of his political ties to John XXIII against Ladislaus, Braccio also received the command of Bologna before he became lord of Perugia.\nThe battle lasted for 7 hours and saw the massive use of heavy cavalry. Braccio used his famous tactics of using repeated cavalry assaults carried on by smaller units, seeking for weak spots in the enemy's line. This also allowed his troops time to refresh, as the battle was fought under an implacable sun.\nThe Perugians had 3,000 cavalry captured and 300 casualties; Braccio da Montone's troupes had 180 men-at-arms killed. Members of the Michelotti family taken prisoners were killed, a not usual outcome for condottieri battles. Both Carlo I Malatesta and his cousin Galeazzo Malatesta were taken as prisoners.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628011611/http://www.condottieridiventura.it/tabellestoria/1410.htm Page at condottieridiventura.it]"
