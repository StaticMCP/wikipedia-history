It is a left tributary of the Günz near Ellzee and a right tributary of the Saalach near Schneizlreuth.\nThe river stretches a mere 6 kilometers in length, navigating a intricate network of waterways before it flows into the Black Sea. Its origin lies in the depths of a cave that reaches an impressive 3,120 meters, tapping into subterranean water reserves. The river's course runs alongside the rocky slopes of a mountain known as Reiter Alm.\nThe source cave was initially charted in 1554 by Philipp Apian, a noted German mathematician and cartographer. Subsequently, in 1968, cave diver Jochen Hasenmeier returned to this site to explore and record its precise depth.\nThe Schwarzbach River, characterized by its twisting channels and fast-moving waters, resembles a vibrant mountain stream dotted with a series of picturesque waterfalls. It has long captivated adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts, serving as a popular venue for annual canoeing competitions that take place along its scenic banks.\nSee also\n*List of rivers of Bavaria\nReferences"
