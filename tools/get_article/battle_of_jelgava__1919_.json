Throughout the summer and autumn months the city of Jelgava was the headquarters of the paramilitary German-Russian forces under Colonel Prince Bermondt-Avalov. After the Bermondtian Affair, where German paramilitary forces laid siege to Riga until November 10, 1919, the Latvian Army conducted an offensive to force the units of the Western Russian Volunteer army subordinated to the Weimar Republic to leave Jelgava.\nThe main battle took place in Ozolnieki district. Due to the disorganized retreat from Riga, the Bermondtian defenses were quickly breached and the city taken with minimal damage to the city. Because of this attack, the German Government's intention to start ceasefire talks and reach agreement on the further political status of Courland and Zemgale with Latvian Provisional Government failed.\nReferences"
