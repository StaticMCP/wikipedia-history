The first major activity organized was the Work Horse Parade held on Memorial Day in 1907 in New York City.\nIn 1909 the Women's Auxiliary decided to establish a dispensary and out-patient clinic for all animals whose owners could not afford to pay for medical treatment. The clinic opened in 1910 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Veterinarians volunteered their services on a part-time basis. The clinic treated 6,028 animals in the first full year.\nOn May 12, 1910, the Women's Auxiliary separated from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and they incorporated themselves as the \"New York Women's League for Animals\".\nThe \"Hospital of the New York Women's League for Animals\" was established in 1914 at 350 Lafayette Street in New York City with Bruce Blair as the resident veterinarian. The hospital was renamed the Ellin Prince Speyer Free Hospital for Animals in 1921 after the death of the founder.\nIn 1959 the League voted to change the name to the \"Animal Medical Center\". In January 1960 construction began on a $4 million facility on 62nd Street on the East River. In 1962 it opened to the public.\nAs of 2023, Helen Irving was President and the hospital was undergoing a large renovation and expansion to meet increased demand and technologies in animal care.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.amcny.org/ Official website of the Animal Medical Center]\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/tags/hospitalofthenewyorkwomensleagueforanimals/ Hospital of the New York Women's League for Animals] from the Library of Congress collection at Flickr Commons"
