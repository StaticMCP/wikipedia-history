Lead singer Jeremy Dunn stated that they have enhanced their sound for the album.\nSingles and early releases\nThe track \"Break the World\" was released as a single on October 29, 2013. It peaked No.&nbsp;1 on BDSradio.com's Christian Rock National Airplay chart on January 15, 2014. Also, \"Surrender\" was released on Tooth and Nail's YouTube channel a month before the album was set to release. Nine Lashes also posted an exclusive stream on RadioU of the entire album about a week before the release date, because the band \"couldn't wait any longer.\" (from official Facebook page, January 16, 2014).\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = HM Magazine\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Indie Vision Music\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Jesus Freak Hideout\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = New Release Tuesday\n| rev5score =\n}}\nFrom Water to War received generally positive reception from six music critics.
