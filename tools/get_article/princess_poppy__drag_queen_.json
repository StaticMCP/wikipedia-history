During the behind the scenes parallel show \"Untucked\" she realized that being a full time drag queen and the social media obligation was not what she wanted, although she will continue to do drag in some fashion.\nShe was the second contestant eliminated from the competition, after losing a lip sync against Amethyst to \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" by Diana Ross.\nPrincess Poppy's look for the reunion episode paid tribute to season 1 contestant Rebecca Glasscock.\nPersonal life\nPrincess Poppy was raised in Charlotte, North Carolina and is based in San Francisco.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
