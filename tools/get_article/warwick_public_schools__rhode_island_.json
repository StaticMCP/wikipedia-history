The Warwick Teachers Union opposed the plan.\nIn 2019, the district announced that students which had families with school lunch fee debts would only be permitted to have sandwiches filled with jelly and nut butter. In response, the company Chobani paid fees of the students, and Hamdi Ulukaya, the head of the company, criticized the policy. The school district ended the sandwich rule.\nIn 2021 Thornton became the Cumberland superintendent again.
