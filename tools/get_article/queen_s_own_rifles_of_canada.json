The unit served in Newfoundland (at the time a separate Dominion) in the defence of two strategic airfields at Botwood and Gander in Newfoundland from August 10 to December 15, 1940. After a build-up and training period, the unit embarked for Britain on July 19, 1941.\nThe regiment mobilized the 3rd Battalion, The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, CASF'' for active service on May 12, 1942.

The battalion fought its way to its D-Day objective – the village of Anisy  inland, the only regiment to reach its assigned objective that day. The QOR had the highest casualties amongst the Canadian regiments, with 143 killed, wounded or captured. As well as losses in the initial landing, the reserve companies' landing craft struck mines as they approached the beach.\nIn the battle for Caen, the QOR – as part of the 8th Infantry Brigade – participated in Operation Windsor to capture the airfield at Carpiquet which was defended by a detachment from the 12th SS Panzer-Division Hitler Jugend. The Germans inflicted heavy casualties and Panzer-grenadiers attempted to recapture the village.\nDuring the war, 463 riflemen were killed in action and almost 900 were wounded as they fought through Normandy, Northern France, and into Belgium and the Netherlands, where they liberated the crucial Channel ports. Sixty more members of the regiment were killed while serving with other units in Hong Kong, Italy and northwest Europe. The overseas battalion was disbanded on November 30, 1945.\nOn June 1, 1945, a third Active Force battalion, designated the ''4th Battalion, The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, CIC, CAOF'', was mobilized for service with the Canadian Army Occupation Force in Germany.

The regiment consisted of two Regular Force battalions and the Reserve (Third) battalion in Toronto until 1968. There was also a regimental depot in Calgary.\nKorea\nThe 2nd Battalion, commanded by LCol W.H.V.
