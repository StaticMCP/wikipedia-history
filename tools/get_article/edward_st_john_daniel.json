On 5 November at the Battle of Inkerman he, as Aide-de-camp (ADC) to the captain, remained by his side throughout a long and dangerous day. On 18 June 1855 he was again with his captain in the first scaling party at the assault on the Redan, binding up his superior officer's severely wounded arm and taking him back to a place of safety.\nLater life\nDaniel also served in the Second Anglo-Burmese War and the Indian Mutiny. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant.\nDaniel was the first of eight men whose VCs were forfeited.  He was stripped of the medal on 4 September 1861 after being convicted of desertion and evading court-martial. His family sought the \"restoration\" of his award in a mid-twentieth century petition. However this was rejected with this statement:  \"...the restoration of forfeited awards may only be made on a petition to the Sovereign from the former recipient himself. In Daniel’s case this is not possible. Furthermore, as your proposal relates to events so long ago it is considered inappropriate to reverse the decision made in 1861 by Queen Victoria\". However, he and the seven other whose awards were forfeited are officially listed as VC holders.\nDaniel died at Hokitika in the South Island of New Zealand on 20 May 1868. He is buried in the Hokitika Cemetery.\nSee also\n* List of British recipients of the Légion d'Honneur for the Crimean War\nReferences"
