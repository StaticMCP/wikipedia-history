A witness in the city west of Baghdad said that militants had set up checkpoints each manned by six to seven people in central and south Fallujah. \"In Ramadi, it is similar – some areas are controlled by ISIL and other areas are controlled by\" tribesmen, the interior ministry official said, referring to the Al Anbar Governorate capital, which lies farther to the west. A journalist in Ramadi saw dozens of trucks carrying heavily armed men driving in the city's east, playing songs praising ISIL.
