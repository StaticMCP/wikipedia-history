Inspired by her success in Samson and Delilah, Hedy Lamarr and Victor Pahlen intended to produce the series about the love affairs of famous women throughout history.  The episodes were to be directed by Edgar G. Ulmer who had collaborated with Hedy Lamarr in her production of The Strange Woman.  The runaway production series was to consist of 39 half hour episodes photographed in colour with exteriors to be filmed on Continental European locations using frozen profits of American film producers. Star Hedy Lamarr was to be costumed by Haute couture fashion houses such as Jacques Fath and Dior.\nWhen the television series idea was shelved, three of the teleplays were put together as the film to be shot in Italy.  The original director Edgar G. Ulmer had multiple disputes with Hedy Lamarr and walked off the film.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82106/the-loves-of-three-queens Loves of Three Queens] at TCMDB"
