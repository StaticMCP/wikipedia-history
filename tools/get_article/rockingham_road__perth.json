It is allocated National Route&nbsp;1 – part of Australia's national Highway&nbsp;1 – between Stock Road in Munster and its southern terminus in Kwinana.\nThe first part of Rockingham Road is a main road and suburban distributor that goes from the southern edge of Fremantle into Hamilton Hill and Spearwood, passing the Phoenix Park shopping centre and the offices of the City of Cockburn. It then leaves the urban area (but not the metropolitan area).\nAfter becoming Highway 1, Rockingham Road acquires a very wide median strip - at one point the northbound and southbound lanes are 180 metres apart. The road then passes the small towns of Wattleup and Hope Valley before entering the Kwinana heavy industrial area in Naval Base and Kwinana Beach.\nAfter the intersection with Mandurah Road it changes name to Patterson Road and continues on to the city of Rockingham.\nMajor intersections\nAll intersections below are controlled by traffic signals unless otherwise indicated.\nHampton Road (north) / Cockburn Road (south) (State Route&nbsp;12)\n|notes=Northwestern terminus at signalised T-junction}}\n|notes=Unsignalised LILO junction}}\n|notes=}}\n|notes=Planned to be converted to a roundabout}}\nSpearwood Avenue (State Route&nbsp;14)\n|notes=}}\n|notes=Roundabout.
