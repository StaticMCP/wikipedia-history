With only her wits and the use of an American flag, Vautrin was able to repel incursions into her college and thereby protected thousands of Chinese women from being raped as she oversaw the refugee camp at Ginling Women's Arts and Science College where she served as the acting president.\nJames McCallum\nJames McCallum drove the Drum Tower Hospital ambulance to pick up wounded around the city day and night, fighting to keep himself awake.\nGrace Bauer\nGrace Bauer worked in the Drum Tower Hospital to help care for the wounded who poured in.\nMary Twinem\nMary Twinem, née Fine (), or Mrs. Paul de Witt-Twinem, taught at Kwang-hwa High School, where she was one of Soong Mei-ling's teacher. An American from Trenton, New Jersey, she was later naturalized as a Chinese citizen and considered herself Chinese.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*   [http://www.china918.net/cn/zuanti/nankingnew/dashiji/hongshiziqi/hongshiziqiliebiao2.htm List of members with Chinese names]"
