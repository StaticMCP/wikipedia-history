The position was defended by a battalion of the 5th Gebirgsjäger Division and another battalion from the Paratroopers Regiment \"Folgore\" supported by German artillery: in total 1,500 men.\nThe operation opened with an attack on the German observation post at the Pointe de Bellecombe (2750m), which was reached after a 600m night climb in difficult weather. The post was destroyed, but a counter-attack forced the Chasseurs off the feature later the same day. The main objective for the French was the old fort at Mont-Froid which commanded the surrounding areas. After gaining a foothold in the fort on the 5 April, French forces finally captured it after several days of confused fighting at close quarters. However, an attack against the Fort de la Turra was a failure, and the offensive stalled when the heavy artillery units were withdrawn for the operation against the . On the 12 April a perfectly executed counter-attack by the Gebirgsjäger'' and the troops of the \"Folgore\" recaptured the fort and evicted the French from the Mont-Cenis plateau. During the operation, the French lost 61 men.\nAftermath\nThe failure of Operation Izard had severe consequences for Doyen's force as it persuaded the Americans to withhold further supplies for the offensive. The Mont-Cenis pass was captured only on the 27 April after Axis forces had retreated from the area.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
