      "text": "# Mail banking\n\nMail banking is a service provided by a financial institution which allows its customers to deposit cheques into their account by mail. It is primarily used by virtual banks (as they may not offer branches or ATMs that accept deposits) and by customers who live too far from a branch. Typically, the institution that advertises such a service will provide its own business reply mail envelopes as a courtesy.\nSee also\n*Telephone banking\n*Offshore Bank Accounts\n*Online banking"
