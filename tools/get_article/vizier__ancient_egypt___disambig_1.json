Vizier is the generally accepted rendering of ancient Egyptian ,  etc., among Egyptologists. The Instruction of Rekhmire (Installation of the Vizier), a New Kingdom text, defines many of the duties of the , and lays down codes of behavior. The viziers were often appointed by the pharaoh. During the 4th Dynasty and early 5th Dynasty, viziers were exclusively drawn from the royal family; from the period around the reign of Neferirkare Kakai onwards, they were chosen according to loyalty and talent or inherited the position from their fathers.\nResponsibilities\n, vizier and designer of Khufu's pyramid, at the Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim, Germany.

The vizier's paramount duty was to supervise the running of the country, much like a prime minister. At times this included small details such as sampling the city's water supply. All other lesser supervisors and officials, such as tax collectors and scribes, reported to the vizier. The judiciary was part of the civil administration, and the vizier also sat in the High Court. At any time, the pharaoh could exert his own control over any aspect of government, overriding the vizier's decisions. The vizier also supervised the security of the pharaoh and the palace by overseeing the comings and goings of palace visitors. The viziers often acted as the pharaoh's seal bearer as well, and the vizier would record trade. From the Fifth Dynasty onwards, viziers, who by then were the highest civilian bureaucratic official, held supreme responsibility for the administration of the palace and government, including jurisdiction, scribes, state archives, central granaries, treasury, storage of surplus products and their redistribution, and supervision of building projects such as the royal pyramid. In the New Kingdom, there was a vizier for Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt each.\nInstallation of the Vizier\nAccording to the Installation of the Vizier, a New Kingdom document describing the office of the vizier, there were certain traits and behaviors that were required to be a vizier:\n*Act by the law\n*Judge fairly\n*Do not act willfully or headstrong\nList of viziers\nEarly Dynastic period\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Viziers of the Early Dynastic period\n!|Vizier  !! |King !! |Dynasty !! |Comments\n|-\n| Rekhit|| Narmer || 1st Dynasty  || Retired to look after the estates of Neithhotep in their older years\n|-\n| Saiset|| Hor-Aha || 1st Dynasty  || Served as administrator of  the Memphite region\n|-\n| Amka|| Djer, Djet and Merneith's regency || 1st Dynasty  || Served as administrator of Her-sekhenti-dju.
