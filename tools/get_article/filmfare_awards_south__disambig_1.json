They are presented by Filmfare magazine of The Times Group. When it was introduced in 1954, the Filmfare Awards initially only recognized achievements in the Hindi cinema. In 1964 the awards were extended to Telugu, Tamil, Bengali and Marathi languages. Malayalam cinema was included in the awards in 1967 and Kannada cinema followed in 1970.\nEach industry is given its own set of creative awards in annual ceremonies that have predominantly been held in Chennai and Hyderabad. Before 1976, the ceremony was held in Mumbai along with Hindi segment. From 1976, the southern region segment were separated from Hindi and moved to Chennai and later to Hyderabad.\nHistory\nThe awards were first given in 1953 and the ceremony used to be held along with Hindi cinema's Filmfare Awards. The awards were being held in the Kalaivanar Arangam, Chennai in the early days. Later the ceremony was shifted to the distinctive Music Academy.\nIn 1953, initially only the Hindi film industry was recognized. In 1963 Awards extended to Best Picture in Telugu, Tamil, Bengali & Marathi, for the awards and from 1966 Malayalam films were added. Kannada films became a part of the event in 1969. In 1972 the awards were extended to Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Director categories in all south Indian films.

Categories for Best Male Playback Singing and Best Female Playback Singing were introduced in 1997.\nIn 2002, awards for Best Supporting actors were given for Tamil and Telugu films. Since 2005, these awards were extended to the Malayalam and Kannada film industries. In the same year, additional categories such as Best Lyricist, Best Playback Singing were also introduced. Awards for Best Comedian were given from 2002 till 2006 and was discontinued later.\nStatuette\nThe statuette, depicting a woman whose arms uprise in a dance number with her fingers touching, is commonly referred to as \"Black Lady\" (or \"The Lady in Black\"). Originally designed by N.G. Pansare under the supervision of The Times of India's art director Walter Langhammer, it is generally made of bronze, its height is 46.5&nbsp;cm and it weighs around five kg.\nTo celebrate the 25th year of the awards, the statues were made in silver and to celebrate the 50th year the statues were made in gold.\nThe Red Carpet\nThe Red Carpet is a segment that takes place before the beginning of the actual ceremony. This is where actors, actresses, producers, directors, singers, composers, and others that have contributed to Indian cinema are introduced. Hosts question the celebrities about upcoming performances and who they think deserves to take the Black Lady home.\nSuperlatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Superlative\n! Artist\n!
