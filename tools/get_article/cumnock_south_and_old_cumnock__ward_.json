The ward elected one councillor using the first-past-the-post voting electoral system.\nThe ward was a Labour stronghold as the party successfully held the seat at every election.

The remainder of the ward was split between the Auchinleck, Cumnock East and Cumnock West wards.\nBoundaries\nThe Cumnock South and Old Cumnock ward was created for the 1984 local elections by the Initial Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements in 1981 from the former Cumnock Burgh and Old Cumnock Parish wards.
