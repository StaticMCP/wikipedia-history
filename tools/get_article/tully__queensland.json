It is adjacent to the Bruce Highway, approximately  south of Cairns by road and  north of Townsville. Tully is perhaps best known for being one of the wettest towns in Australia, and home to the  tall Golden Gumboot.\nThe Tully River, previously known as the Mackay River, was named after Surveyor-General William Alcock Tully in the 1870s. The town of Tully was named after the river when it was surveyed during the erection of the sugar mill in 1924, although the river does not flow through the town or the locality. During the previous decade, a settlement known as Banyan had grown up on the other side of Banyan Creek.\nTully is one of the larger towns of the Cassowary Coast Region. The economic base of the region is agriculture: sugar cane and bananas are the dominant crops. The sugar cane grown at the many farms in the district is processed locally at the Tully Sugar Mill, and the raw sugar produced is shipped elsewhere for further refining.\nIn the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,368 people.\nHistory\nDyirbal (also known as Djirbal) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around Tully and Tully River Catchment extending to the Atherton Tablelands. The Dyirbal language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Cassowary Coast Regional Council and Tablelands Regional Council.\nThe Tully River area was slowly settled once Cardwell, to the south, was established. The river was renamed in 1872 in honour of William Alcock Tully, then under-secretary for public lands and chief commissioner of crown lands in Queensland and later Surveyor General of Queensland. The first settlers were the nephews of James Tyson, who  raised beef cattle. It was not until the government constructed a sugar mill in 1925 that the town began to develop.\nBanyan Provisional School opened on 30 June 1924. In 1925, it became Tully State School. When erected in 1924, it was known as Banyan Provisional and has since gone through a number of name changes: Tully Provisional (1925); Tully State School (1926); Tully State Rural School (1934); Tully State Rural and High School (1951); and reverted to Tully State School in 1964. The school's current motto is \"Work well and succeed\".\nAugustinian priests based in Innisfail began to conduct Roman Catholic services in Tully in 1926. Vicar Apostolic of Cooktown John Heavey laid the foundation stone for a church dedicated to St Clare of Montefalco in May 1926. St Clare's Catholic School was established in 1928 by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. A separate Tully Parish of the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of Cooktown, now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cairns, was established in 1935.\nTully was originally within the Cardwell Division, which became the Shire of Cardwell in 1903. The first headquarters for the division/shire were in older town of Cardwell. In 1929, the decision was taken to relocate the shire council's headquarters to the newer but more populous town of Tully. The first council meeting held in Tully was in June 1929. A new shire chambers was built in 1930 on the south-east corner of Bryant and Morris Streets.\nTully State High School  opened on 28 January 1964. During  Cyclone Yasi in 2011, B Block was completely destroyed and G Block was damaged. Both have since been rebuilt.\nTully remained the administrative centre for the Shire of Cardwell, until the shire was amalgamated into the Cassowary Coast Region in 2008. The regional council has its headquarters in Innisfail.\nIn 2019, Tully became the inaugural winner of a Loud Shirt Day competition to find Queensland's Loudest Town. Inspired by a local story, and facing strong competition from other regional Queensland towns, members of the community rallied together to raise $13,410 to support services provided to young people with hearing loss.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,436 people.\nIn the , Tully had 2,390 inhabitants.\nIn the , the locality of Tully had a population of 2,368 people.\nHeritage listings\nTully has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Tully Court House, 69 Bryant Street\n* Tully State School, 17 Mars Street\nClimate\nTully has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af). This is due to its strong exposure to the southeasterly trade winds. With an average annual rainfall exceeding , and the highest-ever annual rainfall in a populated area of Australia ( in 1950), Tully is arguably the wettest town in Australia. A rivalry exists between Tully and the nearby town of Babinda for that title.\nAlthough Tully's average rainfall is less than that of Babinda, a giant gumboot, the \"Golden Gumboot\", was erected in Tully in 2003, as a monument to the town's high rainfall. It also serves as a museum, documenting past floods, as well as displaying the rainfall for the current year.\n|date=April 2012}}\nCyclone Yasi\nBuildings in Tully were badly damaged by Cyclone Yasi on 3 February 2011. According to residents, Tully was \"...a scene of mass devastation\". An unknown number of homes were completely destroyed as intense winds, estimated at , battered the area. Many other homes not destroyed sustained severe façade and or roof damage. As daybreak came, reports from the town stated that about 90 percent of the structures along the main avenue sustained extensive damage.\nAgriculture\nIn March 2015, a farm at Tully tested positive for the soil-borne Panama disease.  Follow-up testing confirmed the results.  One of the strains of the disease affects all types of bananas and has previously only been detected in the Northern Territory.  Harvesting continued on the property with strict protocols allowing the farm to continue to operate and distribute product without posing a threat.\nOutside experts were brought in to review Biosecurity Queensland's performance 15 February to 24 May 2021. Their assessment credits BQ with quick and effective response which is being emulated by other countries. Thus far TR4 continues to be contained to the Tully Valley only and containment is thought to be possible as long as accidental human movement and transport in flowing water can be halted.\nEducation\nTully State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 21 Mars Street ().
