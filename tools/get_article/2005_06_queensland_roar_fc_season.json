Queensland Lions withdrew their first team from the QLD State League and entered it in the new fledgling competition as ‘The Roar’ having been accepted by Football Federation Australia to take part as the sole representative for Queensland after no other club was able to raise the required funds to participate. The Queensland Roar were previously playing in the Brisbane Premier League under the name Queensland Lions.\n2005–06 season\nThe Queensland Roar made their A-League debut against the now-defunct New Zealand Knights, in a 2–0 win in front of over twenty thousand fans at their home ground of Suncorp Stadium. Unfortunately, the Roar were mediocre in the next rounds and after a series of draws and losses would not record their next win until Round 6 against the Newcastle Jets. The rest of the 2005–06 season would follow in a similar fashion as after 21 rounds of the regular season the Roar finished with seven wins, seven draws and seven losses, placing them sixth on the ladder from eight teams.\nIt has been said the Roars first season in the inaugural A-League was more successful off-field than on.\nThe club was the first to have 100,000 spectators pass through the gates and overall had the second highest attendance for the season (148,609) and despite failing to qualify for the finals, the club's home attendance was the second highest in the opening season (average 14,860 a game). Despite the clubs average win–loss record the club had a number of highlights throughout the year, notably the season's equal highest scoring win (5–0 over the Newcastle Jets in Round 20) and striker Alex Brosque being one of four A-League players awarded the Reebok Golden Boot Award for Top Scorer of the Year with 8 goals.\nInaugural A-League squad\nSeason 2005–06 results\nRound 1\n----\nBaird\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 20,725\n| referee = Matthew Breeze\n}}\nRound 2\n----\nRound 3\n----\n| goals2 = Moon\n| stadium = Members Equity Stadium\n| attendance = 8,509\n| referee = Simon Przydacz\n}}\nRound 4\n----\nMcKay\n| goals2 = Allsopp\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 15,444\n| referee = Ben Williams\n}}\nRound 5\n----\n| team2 = Sydney FC\n| goals1 = Timpano\n| goals2 = Corica , McFlynn\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 23,142\n| referee = Matthew Breeze\n}}\nRound 6\n----\n| goals2 = Moon McKay\n| stadium = EnergyAustralia Stadium\n| attendance = 7,436\n| referee = Srebre Delovski\n}}\nRound 7\n----\n| goals2 = Spencer\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 13,195\n| referee = Perry Mur\n}}\nRound 8\n----\nBaird\n| stadium = North Harbour Stadium\n| attendance = 4,182\n| referee = Simon Przydacz\n}}\nRound 9\n----\n| goals2 = Fernando   Pantelis\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 15,181\n| referee = Peter O'Leary\n}}\nRound 10\n----\nRound 11\n----\nMuscat\n| goals2 = McKay\n| stadium = Olympic Park Stadium\n| attendance = 13,239\n| referee = Mark Shield\n}}\nRound 12\n----\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = Sydney Football Stadium\n| attendance = 13,030\n| referee = Ben Williams\n}}\nRound 13\n----\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 13,004\n| referee = Mark Shield\n}}\nRound 14\n----\nOsman\n| goals2 = Brosque    Baird\n| stadium = Bluetongue Stadium\n| attendance = 5,194\n| referee = Matthew Breeze\n}}\nRound 15\n----\n| goals2 = Yeo\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 8,607\n| referee = James Lewis\n}}\nRound 16\n----\nQu   Veart\n| goals2 = Baird   Brosque\n| stadium = Hindmarsh Stadium\n| attendance = 8,426\n| referee = Matthew Breeze\n}}\nRound 17\n----\nReinaldo\n| stadium = Members Equity Stadium\n| attendance = 11,087\n| referee = Peter Green\n}}\nRound 18\n----\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 12,710\n| referee = Mark Shield\n}}\nRound 19\n----\n| goals2 = Petrovski\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 13,302\n| referee = Simon Przydacz\n}}\nRound 20\n----\nMcKay   Brosque   Richter   Reinaldo\n| stadium = EnergyAustralia Stadium\n| attendance = 10,271\n| referee = Peter O'Leary\n}}\nRound 21\n----\nBrosque\n| goals2 = O'Sullivan   Petrie\n| stadium = Suncorp Stadium\n| attendance = 13,641\n| referee = Ben Williams\n}}\nSeason 2005–06 ladder\nNotes and references"
