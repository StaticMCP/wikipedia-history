Ideologically Marxist-Leninist. It was founded through the unification of National Students Movement (), East Bengal Students Union () and two centers of National Students Group () in the historic Bottola premises at the University of Dhaka.\nThe highest body within RSU is the Central Council, which convenes every two years. Since the 16th National Council of Revolutionary Student Unity, which was held on 30-31 May 2024, Dilip Ray has been serving as President, Jabir Ahmed Jubel as General Secretary, Shakil Hossain as Organizing Secretary and Shahriar Khandakar Alif as Deputy General Secretary. The current central committee consists of 17 members.\nRaising the banner of unity against the breakdown of parties and organizations in the left-wing politics of Bangladesh has been one of the goals of Revolutionary Student Unity since its inception. The organization has set its goal to establish a one-way science based democratic education system in Bangladesh. It had a significant role during most of the recent progressive movements, notably in the 1990 mass uprising against the military rule of Hussein Muhammad Ershad and the anti-Razakar 2013 Shahbag protests.\nReferences"
