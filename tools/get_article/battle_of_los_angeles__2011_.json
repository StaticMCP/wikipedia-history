The event took place on August 20, 2011, at the American Legion Post #308 in Reseda, Los Angeles, California. It marked the first time that the Battle of Los Angeles tournament was held over one night.\nThe event concluded with a tournament final in which El Generico defeated Kevin Steen. The card included non-tournament matches aside from the tournament which saw The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) retain the World Tag Team Championship against The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli) and The Dynasty (Joey Ryan and Scorpio Sky) defeat The RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma) to become the #1 contenders for the World Tag Team Championship. The event featured the PWG debut of veteran wrestler Dave Finlay.\nBackground\nIn July 2011, PWG announced the 2011 Battle of Los Angeles as an eight-man tournament to be held on one night unlike previous editions which took place across two or three nights. The participants announced for the tournament included Dave Finlay, the World Champion Kevin Steen, Roderick Strong, Eddie Edwards, Chris Hero, Claudio Castagnoli, El Generico and Willie Mack.\nAside from the tournament, it was announced that The Dynasty (Joey Ryan and Scorpio Sky) would take on The RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma) at Battle of Los Angeles. The winning team would receive a title shot against The Young Bucks for the World Tag Team Championship at ''The Perils of Rock N' Roll Decadence.\nEvent\nQuarterfinals\nThe tournament kicked off with a match between Chris Hero and Willie Mack. Mack reversed a Deathblow'' attempt by Hero into a backslide and pinned him for the win.\nNext, the PWG World Champion Kevin Steen took on the debuting Dave Finlay. Steen injured Finlay's left leg by repeatedly smashing it into the ring post. Finlay's leg injury worsened when he tried to block a senton by Steen, allowing Steen to apply a Sharpshooter and make Finlay submit for the win.\nNext, Claudio Castagnoli took on El Generico. Castagnoli countered a hurricanrana attempt by Generico into a sunset flip but Generico reversed it and pinned Castagnoli with a bridge for the win.\nIt was followed by the last quarterfinal match between Roderick Strong and Eddie Edwards. Edwards pinned Strong with a small package for the win.\nNext, The Dynasty (Joey Ryan and Scorpio Sky) took on The RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma) to determine the #1 contenders for the PWG World Tag Team Championship. Sky pinned Goodtime with a roll-up for the win. After the match, The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) attacked both teams and cut a promo in which they insulted the crowd and said that they had no opponents for that event. Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli) interrupted them and challenged Young Bucks to a match for the World Tag Team Championship later in the night which Bucks accepted.\nSemifinals\nThe first semifinal match took place between El Generico and Willie Mack. Generico hit a Yakuza Kick to Mack and a Brainbustah!!! for the win.\nThe next semifinal took place between Kevin Steen and Eddie Edwards. Steen made Edwards submit to the Sharpshooter for the win.\nNext, The Young Bucks defended the World Tag Team Championship against The Kings of Wrestling. Matt Jackson pinned Claudio Castagnoli with a roll-up while putting his feet on the ropes for the win. After the match, Kings of Wrestling attacked Young Bucks and delivered a KRS-1 to Matt.\nFinal\nThe tournament final took place between Kevin Steen and El Generico. Generico got a near-fall after three Yakuza Kicks and a Brainbustah!!!, leading to Generico hitting another brainbuster to Steen on the apron to win the 2011 Battle of Los Angeles tournament. After the match, the referee Rick Knox awarded the Battle of Los Angeles trophy to Generico and a little fan wearing Generico's mask who insulted Steen. Steen broke the trophy and retreated from the ring.\nReception\nRyan Rozanski of 411Mania rated the event 8.5 out of 10 and praised it as \"one of the most consistently entertaining installments of the tournament.\" He appreciated El Generico's tournament match against Claudio Castagnoli as a \"great outing\". The World Tag Team Championship match was considered \"worthwhile\". He stated that the tournament final between Generico and Kevin Steen was \"a fantastic thirteen-minute war\".\nAftermath\nAfter winning the Battle of Los Angeles, El Generico opted to challenge Kevin Steen for the PWG World Championship. At ''The Perils of Rock N' Roll Decadence, The Young Bucks attacked Steen after the latter retained the World Championship against Davey Richards, prompting Generico to make the save for Steen. Steen low blowed Generico and then Generico challenged Steen to a ladder match for the title at Steen Wolf, which was later made official. Generico went on to defeat Steen in the subsequent match to win the title.\nThe Dynasty received their World Tag Team Championship opportunity against The Young Bucks at The Perils of Rock N' Roll Decadence'', which they failed to win.\n|stip1=Singles match in the quarter-final round of Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|match1=Willie Mack defeated Chris Hero\n|time1=19:17\n|stip2=Singles match in the quarter-final round of Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|match2=Kevin Steen defeated Dave Finlay\n|time2=15:00\n|stip3=Singles match in the quarter-final round of Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|match3=El Generico defeated Claudio Castagnoli\n|time3=15:18\n|stip4=Singles match in the quarter-final round of Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|match4=Eddie Edwards defeated Roderick Strong\n|time4=17:50\n|stip5=Tag team match to determine the #1 contenders for the PWG World Tag Team Championship\n|match5=The Dynasty (Joey Ryan and Scorpio Sky) defeated The RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma)\n|time5=12:14\n|stip6=Singles match in the semi-final round of Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|match6=El Generico defeated Willie Mack\n|time6=10:30\n|stip7=Singles match in the semi-final round of Battle of Los Angeles tournament\n|match7=Kevin Steen defeated Eddie Edwards\n|time7=12:32\n|stip8=Tag team match for the PWG World Tag Team Championship\n|match8=The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) (c) defeated The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli)\n|time8=20:44\n|stip9=Singles match for the Battle of Los Angeles tournament final\n|match9=El Generico defeated Kevin Steen\n|time9=13:46\n}}\nTournament brackets\n| RD1-team3 =Claudio Castagnoli\n| RD1-team4 =El Generico\n| RD1-score3 =Pin\n| RD1-score4 =15:18\n| RD1-team5 =Eddie Edwards\n| RD1-team6 =Roderick Strong\n| RD1-score5 =Pin\n| RD1-score6 =17:50\n| RD1-team7 =Dave Finlay\n| RD1-team8 =Kevin Steen\n| RD1-score7 =Sub\n| RD1-score8 =15:00\n| RD2-team1 =Willie Mack\n| RD2-team2 =El Generico\n| RD2-score1 =Pin\n| RD2-score2 =10:30\n| RD2-team3 =Eddie Edwards\n| RD2-team4 =Kevin Steen\n| RD2-score3 =Sub\n| RD2-score4 =12:32\n| RD3-team1 =El Generico\n| RD3-team2 =Kevin Steen\n| RD3-score1 =Pin\n| RD3-score2 =13:46\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://prowrestlingguerrilla.com/2011BOLA/ 2011 Battle of Los Angeles official website]"
