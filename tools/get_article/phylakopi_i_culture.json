It spans the period ca. 2300-2000 BC and was named by Colin Renfrew, after the settlement of Phylakopi on the Cycladic island of Milos. Other archaeologists describe this period as the Early Cycladic III (ECIII).\nSee also\n*Grotta-Pelos culture\n*Keros-Syros culture\n*Kastri culture\n*History of the Cyclades\n*Cycladic art\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~prehistory/aegean/?page_id=67 The Chronology and Terminology of Aegean Prehistory], Dartmouth's Aegean Prehistoric Archaeology\nReferences"
