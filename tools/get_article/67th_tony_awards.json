The casts of Once, The Phantom of the Opera, and The Rascals performed.\nThe Emmy-winning opening number \"Bigger!\", written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Tom Kitt, starred Neil Patrick Harris and \"featured neophyte cheerleaders, contortionists, chirpy newsies, a scene-hogging Mike Tyson and, in a Broadway season notable for the number of children in its shows, enough pint-size performers to fill, as Harris aptly quipped, a Chuck-E-Cheese.\" During the ceremony, three Broadway performers, Andrew Rannells, Megan Hilty, and Laura Benanti, whose television shows have been cancelled, sang a comic \"failed TV career\" medley with Harris. The song was based on several familiar Broadway melodies, including \"America\", \"What I Did For Love\", and \"The Ladies Who Lunch\", with lyrics by Michael John LaChiusa.\nDuring the \"In Memoriam\" tribute, Cyndi Lauper performed her 1986 hit \"True Colors\".\nThe closing number featured Harris and Audra McDonald singing special lyrics to Empire State of Mind, mentioning the winners.\nNominees and winners\nThe nominees were announced on April 30, 2013.
