The Writers Guild of America began making the distinction between an original screenplay and an adapted screenplay in 1970, when Waldo Salt, screenwriter for Midnight Cowboy, won for \"Best Adapted Drama\" and Arnold Schulman won \"Best Adapted Comedy\" for his screenplay of Goodbye, Columbus. Separate awards for dramas and comedies continued until 1985.\nWinners and nominees\n1960s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n! width=\"5%\" |Year\n! width=\"30%\" |Film\n! width=\"30%\" |Recipient(s)\n! width=\"35%\" |Source material\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1969\n! colspan=\"3\" |Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Midnight Cowboy †\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Waldo Salt\n|style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | The novel by James Leo Herlihy\n|-\n|Anne of the Thousand Days\n|John Hale, and Bridget Boland\n| The play by Maxwell Anderson\n|-\n|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\n|Jay Presson Allen\n| The novel by Muriel Spark\n|-\n|''They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\n|James Poe, and Robert E.
