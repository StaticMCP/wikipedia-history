Leonard Wood led a force against Datu Ali in the Cotabato Valley in retaliation for refusing to obey an antislavery law. Wood used a force of five companies and an artillery battery with a 3.2 inch piece to attack Ali's cotta and several thousand Moros.  The cotta surrendered after two days of American shelling but not before Ali and most of his men fled.\nThe Moros left behind 21 Spanish cannons and 72 lantakas.  Secretary of War William Taft criticized Wood afterwards for the excessive use of force and brutality.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of siranaya\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Siranaya"
