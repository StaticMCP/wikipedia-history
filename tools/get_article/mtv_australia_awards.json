The last edition took place in 2009.\nHistory\nThe MTV Australia Video Music Awards were announced in 2004 as the seventeenth country to host its own MTV award show, with nominees being announced in December of that year. The inaugural show premiered on 3 March 2005 at Luna Park Sydney, Australia, and was hosted by The Osbournes, featuring numerous guest stars, nominees, performers, and presenters. The second AVMA (held at Acer Arena) was hosted by Ashlee Simpson. The third annual Australian Video Music Awards took place at Acer Arena, with hosts Fergie (from the Black Eyed Peas) and Good Charlotte, as well as MTV's Laguna Beach star, Kristin Cavallari. The MTV Mile High Gig made its debut in celebration of the launch of MTV New Zealand's Viewer's Choice which flew Kiwi fans via Air New Zealand to the awards show with live music guests on the plane. In 2008 the show's name was changed to MTV Australia Awards (or MTVAA's), accompanied by a new format to the awards with the introduction of the categories Best Australian and New Zealand artist awards, Video of the Year, Good and Bad Karma Awards, Television moment, Live Performance award and Re-Make award, with the show being hosted by Wyclef Jean. The MTV New Zealand Mile High Gig made its return with Dizzee Rascal and Scribe headlining the event. In 2010, MTV Networks Australia announced it would launch MTV Classic. A music event will be held for the channel May launch and will replace the MTV awards show for the year.\nAward locations\n* 3 March 2005 – Big Top Sydney hosted by The Osbournes\n* 12 April 2006 – Acer Arena, Sydney hosted by Ashlee Simpson\n* 29 April 2007 – Acer Arena, Sydney hosted by Fergie and Joel Madden and Benji Madden from Good Charlotte\n* 26 April 2008 – Australian Technology Park, Sydney hosted by Wyclef Jean\n* 27 March 2009 – Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre, Darling Harbour, Sydney hosted by Pete Wentz\nAward categories\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | 2005\n! scope=\"col\" | 2006\n! scope=\"col\" | 2007\n! scope=\"col\" | 2008\n! scope=\"col\" | 2009\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Video/Video of the Year\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Aussie\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Kiwi\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Breakthrough\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Collaboration/Best Hook-Up\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Rock Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Dance Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Moves\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Free Your Mind\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | International Music Artist of the Year\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Video Vanguard Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Download of the Year\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Album of the Year\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Song of the Year\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Hip-Hop Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best R&B Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Pop Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Male Artist\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Female Artist\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Group\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best Dressed Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sexiest Video\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Movie Star Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sport's Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Supernova Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | VH1 Music First Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Viewer's Choice (Australia & New Zealand)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Television Moment Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Good Karma Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Bad Karma Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Live Performer Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Remake Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Spankin' New Aussie Artist Award\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nAward winners\n2005\n* Best Male Artist: Shannon Noll\n* Best Female Artist: Delta Goodrem\n* Breakthrough Artist: Missy Higgins\n* Best Group: Green Day\n* Best Dance Video: Usher – Yeah!\n* Best Pop Video: Guy Sebastian – Out with My Baby\n* Best Rock Video: Green Day – American Idiot\n* Best R&B Video: The Black Eyed Peas – Hey Mama\n* Sexiest Video: The Black Eyed Peas – Hey Mama\n* Best Dressed Video: Gwen Stefani – What You Waiting For?\n* Video of the Year: The Dissociatives – Somewhere Down the Barrel\n* Pepsi Viewers Choice: Delta Goodrem\n* Supernova: Evermore\n* VH1 Music First: Cher\n* Free Your Mind: AusAID\n2006\n* Best Male Artist – Shannon Noll\n* Best Female Artist – Ashlee Simpson\n* Spankin' New Aussie Artist – The Veronicas\n* Best Group – Green Day\n* Best Dance Video – Rogue Traders – Voodoo Child\n* Best Pop Video – Ashlee Simpson – Boyfriend\n* Best Rock Video – The Darkness – One Way Ticket\n* Best R&B Video – Chris Brown – Run It!\n* Best Hip-Hop Video – Snoop Dogg – Drop It Like It's Hot\n* Album of the Year – Bernard Fanning – Tea and Sympathy\n* Song of the Year – James Blunt – You're Beautiful\n* Video of the Year – The Veronicas – 4ever\n* Viewers Choice – Anthony Callea\n* Free Your Mind Award – Peter Garrett\n2007\n* Spankin' New Artist – Teddy Geiger – For You I Will (Confidence)\n* Sexiest Video – Fergie – Fergalicious\n* Best Pop Video – Guy Sebastian – Elevator Love\n* Best Rock Video – Thirty Seconds to Mars – The Kill\n* Best Male Artist – Shannon Noll – Lonely\n* Best Female Artist – Pink – U + Ur Hand\n* Best Group – Red Hot Chili Peppers\n* Album of the Year – Evanescence – The Open Door\n* Best Hip Hop Video – Snoop Dogg ft.

At the show they had a circus tent set up and when awards were given, clowns were shown doing things that related to the award (e.g. Best Group had clowns holding a net ready to catch the other clown jumping from a high place).\nThe theme for 2006 was the budgie smuggler. During the lead up to the show MTV Australia aired adverts where men would talk about their budgie smugglers and how they like to wear them and so on. The logo for the show however did not reflect this theme.\nIn 2007, the TV advertising campaign for the 2007 awards featured various singers and groups unrolling their own red carpets in different locations around Australia.\nThis year MTV Advert was about the focus on the Technology park with people with white costumes with a white helmet with cords and plugs on the helmet it was shot at the technology park where the event is going to be taken place.\nSee also\n* List of MTV award shows\n* MTV Australia\n* Recipients of the MTV AVMA's New Zealand Choice Award\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mtv.com.au MTV Australia]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120211105942/http://www.mtvawards.com.au/home.aspx Official MTVAA site]"
