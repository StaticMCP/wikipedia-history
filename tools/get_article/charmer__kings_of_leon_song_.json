It is the second track on the album.\nThe song was released on October 29, 2007 in the UK and compared to previous releases reached a lowly No. 85 on the UK Singles Chart.  In October 2011, NME placed it at number 115 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\nIn an interview with the BBC backstage at the Reading Festival, frontman Caleb Followill let slip that the video, filmed in the UK by director Robert Hales, would involve a hypnotist; he said, \"There was an actual hypnotist there, he was meant to hypnotise us, but I dunno, we must have too strong a will, he couldn't do it so we faked it.\" He also commented: \"It's one of the best looking videos we've done so far, we spent a lot of money on it.\"\nTrack listing\nCD & 7\" vinyl:\n# \"Charmer\"                                          3:00\n# \"My Party\" (Kenna & Chad Hugo Remix)               3:41\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
