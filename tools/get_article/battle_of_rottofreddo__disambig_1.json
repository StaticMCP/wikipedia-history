The French were led by Marshal Maillebois, and could repel the Austrian attack, but had to withdraw after the battle.\nBattle\nAfter the defeat at Piacenza the French and Spanish army had to retreat across the Po river. The Austrian commander Antoniotto Botta Adorno tried to prevent this and send Count Serbelloni with the vanguard to attack. The Bourbon Army defended the town of Rottofreddo till their baggage train crossed the Tidone to the west, but were then overwhelmed by the Austrian mainforce. During the following attack against the main French army at Castel San Giovanni, Austrian field marshal Bärenklau tried a flank attack in the south, but was hit by a musket ball and died shortly after. The French and Spanish could hold their line but finally decided to retreat to Tortona. In the aftermath Piacenza surrendered to Austrian General\nNádasdy, but the following invasion of the Provence should end in failure. Nevertheless Italy was secured for the Austrians.\nReferences\nSources\n* [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/italy/piemabs.html World History at KMLA]\n* Janko, Wilhelm Edler von, \"Bärenklau zu Schönreith, Johann Leopold Freiherr von\" in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie 2 (1875), S. 59 [Online-Version]; URL: https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd135853958.html#adbcontent GERMAN\n*Plan de la Battaille donnée de l'Armée Imperiale Royale d'Hongrie à l'Armée Espagnole Francaise le 10te.
