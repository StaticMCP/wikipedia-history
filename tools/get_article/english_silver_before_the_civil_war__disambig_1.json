Her remarks were reinforced by Kirstin Kennedy in her review in The Burlington Magazine: \"Schroder’s clear, thoughtful account . . . marries object-based evidence with visual and documentary sources . . . The arguments of the text are supported by superb photographs . . . a clear layout and a detailed index.\" In Silver Magazine, Dorothea Burstyn commented favourably on the book's production: \"As with all books published by John Adamson, this volume has a very pleasing and elegant layout with gorgeous photography.\" Philippa Glanville captured the book's quintessence when she wrote in Silver Studies: \"From the first glance, the book is a celebration of the period, as well as of specific objects, and this shines through in every aspect.\"\nAuthor\nTimothy Schroder is an English art historian, born in 1953.
