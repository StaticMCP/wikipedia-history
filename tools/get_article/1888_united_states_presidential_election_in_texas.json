State voters chose 13 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nTexas was won by the incumbent President Grover Cleveland (D–New York), running with the former Senator and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio Allen G. Thurman, with 65.70% of the popular vote, against former Senator Benjamin Harrison (R-Indiana), running with Levi P. Morton, the 31st governor of New York, with 24.73% of the vote and former Illinois state representative Alson Streeter (L–Illinois), running with Charles E. Cunningham, with 8.24% of the vote.\nThe Prohibition Party ran brigadier general Clinton B. Fisk and John A. Brooks and received 1.33% of the vote.\nCampaign\nMembers of the Knights of Labor and former members of the Greenback Party attended a convention in Waco on July 5, 1887, and formed an affiliate of the Union Labor Party. Around 300 delegates, mostly members of the Farmers' Alliance, from seventy counties attended a convention on May 15, 1888, to consider possible electoral campaigns. The delegates appointed Mayor H.S. Broiles as a one-man executive committee and he called for a Nonpartisan Convention to be held on July 2–3. The Nonpartisan Convention created a platform and slate of candidates. The ULP endorsed these candidates and platform and William R. Lamb, the chair of the Nonpartisan Convention, was given a seat on the ULP executive committee.\nResults\nThe electors in Texas for Grover Cleveland were as follows, according to an October 27, 1888 edition of The Lampasas Leader:\nState at large- A. W. Terrell, J. W. Bailey\n1st District- A. T. McKinney\n2nd District- E. C. Dickinson\n3rd District- R. C. DeGrafenried\n4th District- Howard Templeton\n5th District- J. H. Cobb\n6th District- J. S.
