Starting in 1988, the USC Libraries Board of Councilors award the year's best film adaptation of a printed work, recognizing the original author and the screenwriter.\nIn 2016, a second Scripter award, for episodic series adaption, was added. The Literary Achievement Award honors significant contributions to storytelling across form, genre, and medium. The Ex Libris Award recognizes long-time supporters of the USC Libraries. The latter two awards are presented on an occasional basis. Per the Scripter Awards website, \"Scripter celebrates writers and writing, collaboration, and the profound results of transforming one artistic medium into another. It stands as an emblem of libraries’ ability to inspire creative and scholarly achievement.\"\nFilm\n1980s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Film\n! width=\"30%\" | Nominees\n! width=\"40%\" | Source Material\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1988 || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | 84 Charing Cross Road || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Hugh Whitemore || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | The memoir by Helene Hanff\n|-\n|The Dead\n|Tony Huston\n|The short story by James Joyce\n|-\n|Housekeeping\n|Bill Forsyth\n|The novel by Marilynne Robinson\n|-\n|The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne\n|Peter Nelson\n|The novel Judith Hearne by Brian Moore\n|-\n|The Princess Bride\n|William Goldman\n|The novel by Goldman\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1989 || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | The Accidental Tourist || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Frank Galati and Lawrence Kasdan || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | The novel by Anne Tyler\n|-\n|Eight Men Out\n|John Sayles\n|The book Eight Men Out: The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series by Eliot Asinof\n|-\n|''Everybody's All-American\n|Thomas Rickman\n|The book by Frank Deford\n|-\n|Madame Sousatzka\n|Ruth Prawler Jhabvala and John Schlesinger\n|The book by Bernice Rubens\n|}\n1990s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Film\n! width=\"30%\" | Nominees\n! width=\"40%\" | Source Material\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1990 || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Awakenings || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | Steven Zaillian || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" | The memoir by Oliver Sacks\n|-\n|Dances with Wolves\n|Michael Blake\n|The novel by Blake\n|-\n|Goodfellas\n|Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese\n|The book Wiseguy by Pileggi\n|-\n|Misery\n|William Goldman\n|The novel by Stephen King\n|-\n|Presumed Innocent\n|Frank Pierson and Alan J.
