The album was released only in Europe and Japan, though some promo copies also circulated in Australia.\nOverview\n''Don't Mind If I Do'' was Culture Club's first album of new material in 13 years, after the break-up of the band in 1986 and subsequent reformation in 1998. Numerous producers worked on the project, including Culture Club's original producer Steve Levine (who had produced their first three hit albums). However, despite heavy promotion, the album was a commercial failure, only peaking at No.64 in the UK Albums Chart. The album contains the UK Top 5 single, \"I Just Wanna Be Loved\", which had been released over a year earlier and was originally included on the band's Greatest Moments compilation. Further singles taken from the album included \"Your Kisses Are Charity\" which reached Number 25 in the UK, while the next single \"Cold Shoulder\"/\"Starman\" stalled at Number 43.\nTrack listing\n1: Recorded & Mixed at Roundhouse Recording Studios, London 1999.\n2: Recorded and Mixed at Strongroom Studios, 1999.\n3: Strongroom Studios, London 1994.\n4: Recorded at Konk Studios, Church Studios, London 1999.\n5: Recorded at Konk Studios, London 1999.\n6: Recorded & Mixed Themis Mobile Studio.\n7: Recorded at Konk Studios, Church Studios, London 1999.\n8: Recorded at Konk Studios, London 1999.\n9: Produced for Man Made Soul Ltd., Recorded & Mixed at Man Made Soul Studio.\n10: Recorded at Konk Studios, London 1999.\n11: Recorded at Church Studios, Mixed at Konk Studios, London 1999.\n13: Recorded & Mixed @ Konk Studios, London 1999.\n14: Additional production and Remix for Drum Promotions, programmed for Strongroom Management.
