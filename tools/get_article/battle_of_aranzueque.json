On September 19, the loyalists pressed a final attack upon the tired and depleted Carlists at Aranzueque.  Espartero succeeded in taking the village, with the artillery bombardment causing the full rout of the Carlists.  This victory for the loyalists definitively ended the Carlist campaign known as the Expedición Real.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of aranzueque\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Aranzueque"
