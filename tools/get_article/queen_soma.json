She was also the first female leader of Cambodia. Her consort was Kaundinya I (also known as \"Huntien\" and \"Preah Thong\"). She is known as Soma (Sanskrit), Liǔyè (), Liễu Diệp (}}) and Neang Neak (, UNGEGN: Néang Néak; ).\nKhmer legend\nQueen Soma and her husband, Kaundinya I, are known in Khmer legend as \"Preah Thong (Kaundinya) and Neang Neak (Soma)\". According to reports by two Chinese envoys, Kang Tai and Zhu Ying, the state of Funan was established by an Indian merchant from ancient Kalinga named Kaundinya.\nAccording to the Chinese history book Book of Liang, the people of Funan made a woman, named Liǔyè (柳葉), their monarch, and then she surrendered to a foreign man named Hùntián (混塡) and was married to him.\nAccount\nAs per the legends, an Indian merchant ship was attacked by the pirates led by Soma, daughter of the chieftain of the local Nāga clan. The merchants led by Kaundinya fought back and fended off the attackers but the ship had been damaged and was beached for repairs. The Indians were wary of a second attack but Princess Soma was impressed by Kaundinya's bravery and proposed marriage which was accepted. The union led to the foundation of the House that became the royal dynasty of Funan which would rule the region for many generations and the royal legitimacy was also acquired through the female line in the kingdom. This also explains the reason why the serpent (Nāga) became an important part of Khmer iconography as is seen a thousand years later when this historic mystical union remained an important part of the court ceremonies at Angkor during the era of the Khmer Empire.\nModern theories\nNewly discovered DNA evidence suggest there is some truth to the Khmer creation mythology. DNA sample taken from a protohistoric individual from the Wat Komnou cemetery at the Angkor Borei site in Cambodia contains substantial level of South Asian admixture (ca. 40–50%). Radiocarbon dating result on the human bone (95% confidence interval is 78–234 calCE) indicate that this individual lived during the early period of Funan. Further studies of some fossils from 3rd century BCE have yielded similar Indian ancestry from Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.\nReferences"
