      "text": "# Fifth Dynasty of Egypt__disambig_1\n\nThe Fifth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty V) is often combined with Dynasties III, IV and VI under the group title the Old Kingdom. The Fifth Dynasty pharaohs reigned for around 150 years, from the early 25th century BC until the mid 24th century BC.\nChronology\nThe Fifth Dynasty of Egypt is a group of nine kings ruling Egypt for around 150 years in the 25th and 24th centuries BC.2374,590}}600}} 25102370, 25102460, 25042345, 24982345, 24942345, 24652323, 24542297, 24502335,\n24502325, 24352306, 23922282}} The relative succession of kings is not entirely secured as there are contradictions between historical sources and archaeological evidence regarding the reign of the shadowy Shepseskare.\nRulers\nKnown rulers in the Fifth Dynasty are listed below. Manetho assigns 248 years of rule to the Fifth Dynasty; however, the pharaohs of this dynasty more probably ruled for around 150 years. This estimate varies by both scholar and source. The Horus names and most names of the queens are taken from Dodson and Hilton.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dynasty V monarchs\n! style=\"width:110px\" |Nomen (personal name) !! style=\"width:120px\" |Prenomen (throne name) !! style=\"width:120px\" |Horus-name !! style=\"width:50px\" |Image!! style=\"width:120px\" |Reign !! style=\"width:120px\" |Pyramid !! style=\"width:200px\" |Spouse(s)\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Userkaf || Irimaat || ||c. 2498 – c. 2491 BC || Pyramid of Userkaf||\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Sahure || Nebkhau || ||c. 2491 – c. 2477 BC || Pyramid of Sahure|| Meretnebty\n|-\n| Kakai|| Neferirkare || Userkhau || ||c. 2477 – c. 2460 BC || Pyramid of Neferirkare|| Khentkaus II\n|-\n| Isi || Neferefre || Neferkhau || || c. 2460 – c. 2458 BC|| Unfinished Pyramid of Neferefre||\n|-\n| Netjeruser || Shepseskare || Sekhemkhau || || Around a few months, c. 2458 BC || ||\n|-\n| Ini || Nyuserre || Setibtawy || || c. 2458 - c. 2422 BC || Pyramid of Nyuserre Ini|| Reptynub\n|-\n| Kaiu || Menkauhor|| Menkhau || ||c. 2422 - c. 2414 BC || ||\n|-\n| Isesi || Djedkare || Djedkhau ||  || c. 2414 - c. 2375 BC || Pyramid of Djedkare Isesi||\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Unas || Wadjtawy || || c. 2375 - c. 2345 BC || Pyramid of Unas|| NebetKhenut\n|}\nManetho writes that the Dynasty V kings ruled from Elephantine, but archeologists have found evidence clearly showing that their palaces were still located at Ineb-hedj (\"White Walls\").\nAs before, expeditions were sent to Wadi Maghareh and Wadi Kharit in the Sinai to mine for turquoise and copper, and to quarries northwest of Abu Simbel for gneiss. Trade expeditions were sent south to Punt to obtain malachite, myrrh, and electrum, and archeological finds at Byblos attest to diplomatic expeditions sent to that Phoenician city. Finds bearing the names of several Dynasty V kings at the site of Dorak, near the Sea of Marmara, may be evidence of trade but remain a mystery.\nUserkaf\nHow Pharaoh Userkaf founded this dynasty is not known for certain. The Westcar Papyrus, which was written during the Middle Kingdom, tells a story of how king Khufu of Dynasty IV was given a prophecy that triplets born to the wife of the priest of Ra in Sakhbu would overthrow him and his heirs, and how he attempted to put these children – named Userkaf, Sahure, and Neferirkare – to death; however in recent years, scholars have recognized this story to be at best a legend and admit their ignorance over how the transition from one dynasty to another transpired.\nDuring this dynasty, Egyptian religion made several important changes. The earliest known copies of funerary prayers inscribed on royal tombs (known as the Pyramid Texts) appear. The cult of the god Ra gains added importance, and kings from Userkaf through Menkauhor Kaiu built temples dedicated to Ra at or near Abusir. Then late in this dynasty, the cult of the deity Osiris assumes importance, most notably in the inscriptions found in the tomb of Unas.\nDjedkare Isesi\nAmongst non-royal Egyptians of this time, Ptahhotep, vizier to Djedkare Isesi, won fame for his wisdom; The Maxims of Ptahhotep was ascribed to him by its later copyists. Non-royal tombs were also decorated with inscriptions, like the royal ones, but instead of prayers or incantations, biographies of the deceased were written on the walls.\nComparison of regnal lists\nThe ancient kings lists are in broad agreement on the order of the kings of this dynasty, though some kings were omitted on certain lists. The Turin King List is today in a fragmentary state and names and reign lengths are missing for some parts of this dynasty. While Shepseskare's reign is placed before Neferefre on these lists, Egyptologists today believe he reigned briefly after Neferefre rather than before him.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Historical Pharaoh\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Abydos King List\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Saqqara Tablet\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Turin King List\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Manetho\n! colspan=\"2\" |Reign Years\n|-\n!Turin List\n!Manetho\n|-\n|Userkaf\n|Userkaf\n|Userkaf\n|[User]kaf\n|Ouserkheres\n|7\n|28\n|-\n|Sahure\n|Sahure\n|Sahure\n|Name lost\n|Sephres\n|12\n|13\n|-\n|Neferirkare Kakai\n|Kakai\n|Neferirkare\n|Name lost\n|Nepherkheres\n|Lost\n|20\n|-\n|Shepseskare\n|–\n|Shepseskare\n|Name lost\n|Sisires\n|7\n|7\n|-\n|Neferefre\n|Neferefre\n|Khaneferre\n|Name lost\n|Kheres\n|Lost\n|20\n|-\n|Nyuserre Ini\n|Nyuserre\n|–\n|Name lost\n|Rhathoures\n|10+\n|44\n|-\n|Menkauhor Kaiu\n|Menkauhor\n|Menkauhor\n|Menkauhor\n|Menkheres\n|8\n|9\n|-\n|Djedkare Isesi\n|Djedkare\n|Maatkare\n|Djedu\n|Tankheres\n|28\n|44\n|-\n|Unas\n|Unis\n|Unis\n|Unis\n|Onnos\n|30\n|33\n|}\nFifth Dynasty timeline\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:12\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:30 right:130 left:20\nAlignBars  = justify\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:-2494 till:-2338\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:30 start:-2494\nScaleMinor  = unit:year increment:10  start:-2494\nColors     =\nid:canvas      value:rgb(0.97,0.97,0.97)\nid:PA   value:green\nid:GP   value:red\nid:eon    value:rgb(1,0.7,1)   # light purple\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Rulers\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbarset:Rulers\nfrom: -2494 till: -2487 color:PA text:\"Userkaf\"\nfrom: -2487 till: -2474 color:PA text:\"Sahure\"\nfrom: -2474 till: -2454 color:PA text:\"Neferirkare\"\nfrom: -2454 till: -2452 color:PA text:\"Neferefre\"\nfrom: -2452 till: -2451 color:PA text:\"Shepseskare\nfrom: -2451 till: -2415 color:PA text:\"Nyuserre\"\nfrom: -2415 till: -2407 color:PA text:\"Menkauhor\"\nfrom: -2407 till: -2368 color:PA text:\"Djedkare\"\nfrom: -2368 till: -2338 color:PA text:\"Unas\"\nbarset:skip\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
