It adds features for DSLR filmmaking and still photography, and is free and open-source.\nMagic Lantern was originally written for the Canon EOS 5D Mark II by Trammell Hudson in 2009 after he reverse engineered its firmware. He ported it to the Canon EOS 550D in July 2010. There are now versions for many other Canon DSLRs and the current lead developer is known as \"names_are_hard\", previous lead developer was \"a1ex\".\nSince installing Magic Lantern does not replace the stock Canon firmware or modify the ROM but rather runs alongside it, it is both easy to remove and carries little risk. The camera checks a \"boot flag\" in its re-writable memory, and if set, reads from a memory card to get the additional firmware routines. Each time the camera is started, there is an option to disable Magic Lantern.\nHistory\nMagic Lantern firmware was originally written for the Canon EOS 5D Mark II by Trammell Hudson in 2009 after he reverse engineered its firmware. He ported it to the Canon EOS 550D in July 2010.\nStarting in September 2010, a person using the name \"A1ex\" on the CHDK (Canon Hack Development Kit) website forum and other people ported Magic Lantern to the Canon EOS 50D, 60D, 500D and 600D. As of August 2017 support for the Canon EOS 5D, 5D Mk III, 6D, 7D, 60Da, 650D, 700D, and 1100D DSLRs and the mirrorless EOS M had also been added. Later mirrorless cameras are not supported because they use a codebase similar to Canon PowerShot cameras rather than Canon EOS cameras; therefore CHDK ports are planned.\nAround 2020, a1ex, after years of hard work, left the project. A very small number of volunteers kept things alive, but nothing worked well. Nobody had deep knowledge of Magic Lantern code. Those that remained had to learn how everything worked, then fix it. Then add support for new cams without breaking the old ones. Newly supported cameras (as of June 2025) includes the 200D, 6D Mk II, 750D, 7D Mk II\nThe new Magic Lantern Core Team consists of g3gg0, kitor, names_are_hard, and WalterSchulz\nOriginally developed for DSLR filmmaking, Magic Lantern's features have expanded to also include those for still photography.\nFeatures\n* Firmware and source code is released under the GNU General Public License.\n* Audio controls, on-screen audio meter, audio monitoring via A/V cable\n* HDR video, bitrate control, FPS control, auto-restart\n* Precise ISO, White Balance, and Shutter Speed controls\n* Zebras, false color -- histogram, waveform, spot meter, vectorscope\n* Focus peaking, 'magic zoom', trap focus, rack focus, follow focus, motion detection\n* Automatic Exposure Bracketing, focus stacking\n* Intervalometer, bulb timer (up to 8 hours), bulb ramping\n* Custom cropmarks/on-screen graphics\n* On-screen focus and DOF info, CMOS temperature, clock\n* Customizable menus and scripting\n* Customizable \"P\" Program mode\n* 14-bit raw video on some DSLRs\n* Dual-ISO for increased dynamic range up to about 3 EV, with trade-off of somewhat less resolution and more complicated post processing involving cr2dng\n* Auto-Dot-Tune on some DSLRs for automatic micro-focus-adjustment to calibrate lens and body (5D Mk II, 6D, 50D, 5D Mk III and 7D)\nSelected screenshots of advanced functions\nCanon-EOS-100D-Magic-Lantern-Screenshot-Display-with-ML-Info-17-02-2023.png|Main screen with additional information\nCanon-EOS-100D-Magic-Lantern-Screenshot-Expo-Screen-12-02-2023.png|Expo menu with advanced exposure functions\nCanon-EOS-100D-Magic-Lantern-Screenshot-Advanced-Bracket-Options-17-02-2023.png|Advanced bracket options with up to 11 images\nCanon-EOS-100D-Magic-Lantern-Screenshot-Modules-Menu-24-02-2023.png|Extensibility via modules and Lua scripts\nCanon-EOS-100D-Magic-Lantern-Screenshot-Menus-Screen-12-02-2023.png|Overview screen of all functions\nMagic Lantern liveview overlay.jpg|Overlays on the live view screen\nMagic Lantern audio menu.jpg|Audio menu on the Canon 5D Mark II\nOriginal Canon warranty\nBecause installing Magic Lantern does not replace the stock Canon firmware or modify the ROM but rather runs alongside it, it is both easy to remove and carries little risk. Canon has not made any official statements regarding the add-on firmware, either on the subject of warranty or on the features. In response to emails Canon has stated that while their warranty doesn't cover damage caused by third party firmware, it will cover unrelated issues such as malfunctioning buttons even if third party firmware has been installed.\nSee also\n* AXIOM (camera)\nReferences"
