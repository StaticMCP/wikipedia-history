After winning the Democratic presidential nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey asked the convention to nominate Maine Senator Edmund Muskie as his running mate. The convention overwhelmingly voted to ratify the choice of Muskie, though Julian Bond picked up a scattering of votes. Muskie was surprised by the selection, as he was from a Northeastern state with few electoral votes. Humphrey almost chose Oklahoma Senator Fred R. Harris, but Humphrey decided that Muskie's age, governmental experience, and quiet temperament made him the better candidate. Humphrey also strongly considered South Carolina Governor Robert McNair, his name being \"the last name marked off the list\"  for Humphrey's running mate. McNair was informed that had the Vice President opted for a southerner as a running mate, it would've been him. The Humphrey–Muskie ticket ultimately lost to the Nixon–Agnew ticket in the 1968 election. Muskie's place on the national ticket helped make him an early front-runner for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination, though Muskie ultimately dropped out of the contest.\nPotential running mates\nFinalists\nFile:Muskie.jpg|\nFile:Joseph Alioto 1958.jpg|\nFile:FredRoyHarris (1).jpg|\nFile:Richard J.
