He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, who served in the Delaware General Assembly and as Governor of Delaware.\nEarly life and family\nThomas was born at Dragon Neck in Red Lion Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware, son of Charles & Susanna McCallmont Thomas. His father was an elder of the New Castle Presbyterian Church and president of the New Castle Turnpike Company. Charles Jr. married Eliza Stoops and they had one child, Eliza. They lived at the \"Thomas House\" at the corner of Harmony Street and the Strand, now the Parish House of Immanuel Episcopal Church. They were members of New Castle Presbyterian Church.\nThere are no known records showing the fate of Thomas' wife, Eliza. What is known is that his daughter Eliza was cared for by Dr. John Rumsey of Wilmington until she was about 10 years old, and then moved in with Thomas' sister Sally, who was married to William T. Read, his college roommate, and grandson of George Read, the Signer. William and Sally resided at the Thomas House, and donated it to the Episcopal Church.\nProfessional and political career\nThomas attended Princeton College and studied law with George Read Jr. He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1813 and began the practice of law at New Castle. He served in the 1818 session of the state house, and the 1822 and 1823 session of the state senate. Since he was the Speaker in the 1823 session, he succeeded to the office of governor upon the death of Governor Joseph Haslet. He then served as Governor of Delaware from June 24, 1823, until January 20, 1824.\nThomas continued the advocacy of several other governors on behalf of improved public education. As told by Carol Hoffecker in Democracy in Delaware, \"'In these portentous times,' remarked Governor Thomas in 1824, 'it seems rather a hazardous experiment to permit one generation to sleep in ignorance.' He advocated a special school tax, which he promised 'would be a blessing to the people...for it would...relieve them of the most intolerable of all burdens, the burdens of immorality and ignorance. 'In vain,' he said, 'do we boast of our elective franchise, and our civil rights, if a large portion of our citizens are unable to read the tickets which they annually present at the polls. Such men may think themselves free, but in fact they are slaves.... If education is confined to the rich,' he warned, 'the few will govern.'\"   By refusing to raise taxes or surrender local control, the General Assembly again failed to act.\nThomas was also an advocate for penal reform. Again from Hoffecker, Thomas \"noted without pride that 'the penal laws of this State are much severer than those of any State in the Union.\" Arguing against imprisonment for debt, he said \"An opinion seems to pervade the community that our poor houses...are rather nurseries for vice than asylums for the helpless.\"\nFor now, this request received no response.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width: 94%\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"\n|-bgcolor=#cccccc\n!colspan=12 style=\"background: #ccccff;\" |Delaware General Assembly   (sessions while Governor)\n|-\n!Year\n!Assembly\n!\n!Senate Majority\n!Speaker\n!\n!House Majority\n!Speaker\n|-\n|1823\n|47th\n|\n| |Republican\n| |vacant\n|\n| |Republican\n| |George Clark Jr.\n|}\nDeath and legacy\nThomas died at New Castle and is buried there at the Presbyterian Cemetery.
