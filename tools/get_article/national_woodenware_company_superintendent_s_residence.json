It was built in 1910 as housing for the local manager of a manufacturing plant that produced wooden buckets and tubs for Armour and Company.  The National Woodenware Company relocated to Hill City from Ithaca, Michigan, in 1910, purchasing a third of the town's lots, constructing residences for its employees, and tripling the population.  The Superintendent's Residence was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for having local significance in the themes of exploration/settlement and industry.  It was nominated for being the most prominent reminder of Hill City's principal employer and developer in the early 20th century.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Aitkin County, Minnesota\nReferences"
