In 2002, he got his start into racing by becoming an owner-driver in the Pure Stock Division of the NASCAR Weekly Series. Five years later in 2007, Edwards broke into the national ranks by starting in 5 ARCA Racing Series events posting a best finish of 17th for Andy Belmont Racing at the Pocono Raceway.\nEdwards partnered up with Norm Benning in 2012 and made his debut in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series driving the No. 75 Chevrolet in a start and park effort. He finished 33rd after falling out of the race within 5 laps.\nIn 2014, after a two-year hiatus, Benning and Edwards reunited by attempting 5 races continuing the start and park efforts. All of his starts that year were in late field filler entries (the Truck Series had short starting fields that year in a number of races), which is why he received zero points in the 2014 standings. The following year, Edwards raced for Jennifer Jo Cobb in 2 races at the Texas Motor Speedway and the Gateway Motorsports Park.\nEdwards also pursues in instructing and is a driving instructor at Andy Hillenburg's Fast Track High Performance Racing School where he coaches drivers and fans of Motorsports.\nPersonal life\nEdwards was born in Falls Church, Virginia, on May 9, 1980, and graduated from Virginia Tech in 2002. He co-authored the novel Faster Pastor with Sharyn McCrumb; the 2010 book is loosely based on his teaching experiences.\nMotorsports career results\nNASCAR\n(key) (Bold&nbsp;– Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
