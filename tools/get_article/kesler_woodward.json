Known for his colorful paintings of northern landscapes, he was awarded the first Alaska Governor's Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts in 2004. Woodward has also written extensively on the Art of the circumpolar North and has curated exhibitions which have toured Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, and Georgia.\nThe North dominates Woodward's oeuvre and his iconography of ravens, canyons, sandbars and black spruce has been described as “deeply evocative of Alaska”. Considered one of \"Alaska's most innovative artists\", author Julie Decker noted that, unlike traditional landscape painters, \"His focus is as much on the character of the media as it is on the subject matter.\" Woodward works in oils, oil pastels, and acrylics and has described his artistic process as \"applying, scraping away, modifying, and building up other colors ... to achieve a sense of how I felt, being in a certain place, more than just how that place looked.\" Birch trees, his signature subject, are painted to be both representational and, when viewed up close, abstract. Although a \"realist\", his graphic compositions prompted ARTnews reviewer Richard Maschal to add, \"his interest and strategy veer toward abstraction. Whether the spaces are wide-open or confined, Woodward depicts them as flattened areas with foreground and background pressed together and the whole reduced to pattern.\"\nEarly life\nKesler Edward Woodward was born in Aiken, South Carolina in 1951. After high school, Woodward enrolled as a chemistry major at Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina. Following an introductory painting course and visit to the National Gallery in Washington, he developed an interest in contemporary abstract art. At Davidson, he studied painting under Herb Jackson and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Art) in 1973. He continued his studies in painting and printmaking and graduated in 1977 with a Master of Fine Art from Idaho State University, (Pocatello). Woodward then moved to Juneau, Alaska, and began to incorporate landscape into his art. His work was influenced by artists Richard Long (artist), Andy Goldsworthy, and Hamish Fulton, and by 1982 landscape was his dominant genre.\nCareer\nEarly career\nWoodward was first appointed Curator of Temporary Exhibits (1977-1978), and then Curator of Visual Arts (1979-1981) at the Alaska State Museum (Juneau).

Art Historian Estill Curtis Pennington wrote \"Kes Woodward seems to bring the full authority of a carefully studied art historical tradition to ... sweeping visions of the seemingly measureless Alaska turf.\" In The Artist and the American Landscape John Driscoll wrote of the artist's “simple and compelling devotion to nature’s beauty and tranquility.” In ''Icebreakers: Alaska's Most Innovative Artists'', Julie Decker described his work as \"approachable both as color field abstractions as well as depictions of real or synthesized places.\" In November 2004 Woodward received the Governor's Lifetime Achievement Award for the Arts. Woodward was also awarded the Rasmuson Foundation's 2012 Distinguished Artist Award \"in recognition of an Alaskan artist's creative excellence and superior accomplishments in the arts\".
