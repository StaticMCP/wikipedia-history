First explored by European John Smith in 1608, when while conducting an expedition up the Chesapeake Bay he landed on the area known as the Patapsco Neck.  In 1664 Thomas Todd of Virginia patented 1,150 acres (4.7 km2) of land on the Patapsco Neck, this being the first deed in Baltimore County. The Todd family farmhouse is today a nationally registered landmark with the National Park Service on the North Point State Park. It is known today as the Todd Farmhouse or \"Todd's Inheritance\".\nThe North Point peninsula was settled beginning in the 1660s by families with various land grants from  King Charles I and the lord proprietor of the Province of Maryland, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675), and his brother Leonard Calvert (1606–1647), who served as the first governor.\nFort Howard  is the location of the actual artillery installation of 1898, Fort Howard, a Baltimore County Designated Historic Park Landmark granted to Baltimore County in 1973 by the federal government under a national park program initiated during the Johnson administration. Fort Howard Park is a former military establishment from the late 1890s to World War I, and the site of a British Army and Royal Navy landing during the War of 1812 to attack Baltimore, and the Battle of North Point on September 12, 1814.\nReferences\n*"
