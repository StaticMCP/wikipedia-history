Its main objective is to protect the nation's identity, guarantying the cultural rights of its people. At the same time, it coordinates awards, festivals, fairs, museums, among others.\nIt appeared on 2000 as the Secretary of State of Culture (Secretaría de Estado de Culture). Its headquarters are located at Santo Domingo. Its Minister is Milagros Germán, since October 10, 2021.\nHistory\nThe first reference to an office dedicated specifically to culture in the Dominican Republic can be found on 1934 with the creation of the Secretary of State of Education and Fine Arts (Secretaría de Estado de Educación y Bellas Artes). This is the origin of the modern Ministry of Education. On 1965, this institution received the name Secretary of State of Education, Fine Arts and Worship (Secretaría de Estado de Educación, Bellas Artes y Cultos), taking attributions from the Secretary of State of External Relations. On 1997, its name would change again to Secretary of State of Education and Culture (Secretaría de Estado de Educación y Cultura).\nOn 1979, a UNESCO mission, together with Dominican intellectuals, made a diagnosis of the government cultural institutions, which concluded that these offices were scattered between several Secretaries and that it was necessary to create a consolidated organism to take over all cultural matters.\nIt wouldn't be until 1997, during the first presidency of Leonel Fernández, that the Presidential Board of Culture (Consejo Presidencial de Cultura) was created to coordinate the General Archive of the Nation, the National Library, the National Theater, several museums, school, theaters and other cultural and crafts centers. This Board was led by singer and composer Víctor Víctor.\nTo answer these demands of artists and intellectuals, on June 28, 2000, Leonel Fernandez's Government signed Law 41–00, which would definitely create the Secretary of State of Culture (Secretaría de Estado de Cultura) as the coordinator of all cultural matters.\nIt adopted its current name, Ministry of Culture (Ministerio de Cultura), after the 2010 Constitutional reform and the subsequent Decree no. 56-10 which changed the names of all government agencies.\nInternal structure\nSimilar to other Ministries of the Dominican Republic, the Ministry of Culture is subdivided into vice-ministries. These are:\n* Vice-ministry of Cultural Development and Investigation\n* Vice-ministry of Creativity and Artistic Training\n* Vice-ministry of Cultural Heritage\n* Vice-ministry of Cultural Identity and Citizenship\n* Vice-ministry of Cultural Identities\n* Vice-ministry for Territorial Decentralization and Coordination\nAffiliated institutions\nThe Ministry of Culture is in charge of many different cultural activities. This is the reason why it has many affiliated agencies, according to the different arts and cultural centers. Some of these are:\n* Great Cibao Theater\n* Eduardo Brito National Theater\n* National Craftsmanship Center\n* General Office of Cinematography\n* Visual Arts National School\n* Drama National School\n* National Conservatory\n* National Center for Works of Arts and Documents Conservation\n* Pedro Henríquez Ureña National Library\n* Dominican National Ballet\n* Narciso González Cultural Center\n* Elia Mena National School of Music\nOther offices also connected to this Ministry are:\n* Dominican National Committee to the UNESCO\n* Public Shows National Committee\n* General Office of Museums\n* National Office of Landmark Heritage\n* National Office of Sub-aquatic Cultural Heritage\n* National Office of Books and Reading\nThe National Archive of the Nation became an autonomous institution on 2010.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Ministry of Culture - [https://cultura.gob.do/ official website]"
