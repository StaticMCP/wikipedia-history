The ceremony was broadcast on Fox from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California. The network TNT received its first major nomination at this ceremony.\nFor its ninth season, Cheers won Outstanding Comedy Series for the fourth time, tying All in the Familys record. Cheers spinoff Frasier would later break this record, ultimately winning five in a row. Cheers also received the most major nominations (9) and major awards (4) during the ceremony. The drama field also saw a four-time winner crowned as L.A. Law won Outstanding Drama Series for the fourth time in five years. This tied the record set by Hill Street Blues whose four wins came consecutively. James Earl Jones joined an exclusive club, as he won two acting Emmys for his work on two different series.\nJohn Gielgud's win for the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Special made him the fourth person to become an EGOT.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Cheers (NBC)'\n** Designing Women (CBS)\n** The Golden Girls (NBC)\n** Murphy Brown (CBS)\n** The Wonder Years (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'L.A.
