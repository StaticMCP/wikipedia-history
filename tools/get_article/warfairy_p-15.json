It was printed using a LulzBot Taz printer via the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method. It was created by WarFairy\nThe stock works a lower receiver for the FN-P90 but would work with any standard AR.\nIt is an offspring of the  Charon open source project, which was a 3D-printable AR-15 lower receiver project that was partially inspired by the P90. It began as a design exercise by a DEFCAD user to explore FDM additive manufacturing technology as a means of integrating the P90's ergonomics into a stock for the AR-15, resulting in the WarFairy P-15 stock set.\nSee also\n*List of notable 3D printed weapons and parts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://github.com/maduce/fosscad-repo/tree/master/Rifles/AR-15_WarFairy_P-15_Stock_v2.0-WarFairy AR-15_WarFairy_P-15_Stock_v2.0-WarFairy]"
