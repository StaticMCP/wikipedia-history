From 1201, tin miners in Devon and Cornwall were exempt from the jurisdiction of all English courts other than that of the Vice-Warden of the Stannaries. The jurisdiction of the Cornwall stannary institutions covered the whole of the duchy, while the stannary courts of Devon had a reputation for harsh justice, and once jailed a Westminster MP (Richard Strode).\nAccording to Thomas Pitt, judgements from the court could be appealed to the Vice-Warden of the Stanneries, then to the Warden, then finally to the Prince in Council.\nNotes\nReferences\nSee also\n*Stannary law\n*Cornish Stannary Parliament\n*Stannary Convocation of Devon\n*Duchy of Cornwall"
