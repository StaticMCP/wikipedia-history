The Takeda vanguard, which included Baba Nobuharu, was hard-pressed. Shingen himself led the Takeda main body.\nThe battle turned in favor of the Takeda when Yamagata Masakage launched a furious counterattack, inflicting heavy casualties on the Hōjō and forced the Hōjō army to retreat north, allowing the Takeda return to Kai — leaving behind some 900 dead.\nSee also\n* Myōki\nReferences\n*\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
