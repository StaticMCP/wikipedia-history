The Republic was established by the Partisan resistance movement and its administrative center was in the town of Užice.\nBorders\nThe Republic of Užice comprised a large portion of western part of the occupied territory and had a population of more than 300,000 (according to another source, nearly one million). It was located between the Valjevo–Bajina Bašta line in the north, the river Drina on the west, the river Zapadna Morava in the east, and the Raška region to the south.\nDifferent sources provide differing information about the size of the republic: according to some sources, it included 15,000 or 20,000 square kilometres.\nHistory\nThe government was made of \"people's councils\" (odbori), and the partisans opened schools and published a newspaper, Borba (meaning \"Fight\"). They even managed to run a postal system and around 145&nbsp;km of railway and operated an ammunition factory from the vaults beneath the bank in Užice.\nIn November 1941, in the First anti-Partisan offensive, the German troops occupied this territory again, while the majority of Partisan forces escaped towards Bosnia, Sandžak and Montenegro, re-grouping at Foča in Bosnia.\nEnd\nThe leftist policy then pursued by Josip Broz Tito (known later as the leftist errors) substantially contributed to the defeat of the partisans in the Republic of Užice. Because of the pro-fascist Serbian propaganda which described the partisans as being led by foreigners, the population of Serbia turned against the uprising and against the partisan insurgents. At the beginning of December 1941 the partisans moved from Serbia to Bosnia (nominally part of the NDH) and joined their comrades who had already left Montenegro.\nIn popular culture\nThe 1974 Yugoslav partisan feature film The Republic of Užice covers the events surrounding the existence of the Republic of Užice.\nSee also\n*Republic of Bihać, a similar, albeit created 1 year later, republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n*Former countries in Europe after 1815\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*Venceslav Glišić, Užička republika, Belgrade, 1986.\n*Jovan Radovanović, 67 dana Užičke republike (67 дана Ужичке републике), Belgrade, 1972.
