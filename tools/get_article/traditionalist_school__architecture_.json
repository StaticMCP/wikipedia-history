In the Netherlands Traditionalism was a reaction to the Neo Gothic and Neo-Renaissance styles by Pierre Cuypers (Rijksmuseum Amsterdam 1885, Centraal Station Amsterdam 1889). One of the first influential buildings of Traditionalism was the Beurs van Berlage in Amsterdam, finished in 1903. Since the 1920s Traditionalist architecture has been a parallel movement to Modern architecture (Cubist, Constructivist and Expressionist architecture).\nIn Dutch architecture, the Traditionalist School was also a reaction against Functionalism as well as the Expressionism of the Amsterdam School, and meant a revival of rural and national architectural styles and traditions, with tidy, visible brickwork, minimal decoration and \"honest\" (that is, traditional and natural) materials.\nIt occurred after the First World War and at its center was, as it was called after 1945, the Delft School, led by Marinus Jan Granpré Molière, professor at the Technical University in Delft from 1924 until 1953.\nTraditionalism can be seen in many ways as a direct successor to Berlage-type Rationalism.\nIt was highly influential on church design up after 1945, especially in Catholic architecture but gaining influence as well on Protestant architecture just before World War Two, especially on architects like Berend Tobia Boeyinga and Egbert Reitsma. During the reconstruction after the war, its influence on secular architecture reached a peak while its importance for church architecture slowly vanished.\nBeyond the Netherlands, the Traditionalist movement found resonance across Northern Europe as architects sought to reconcile modern construction methods with regional identity. In Scandinavia, Danish architects such as Kay Fisker and C.F. Møller integrated traditional brick craftsmanship and proportion systems into functional, restrained designs that came to be known as Nordic Classicism or Danish Functional Tradition. In Germany, figures like Paul Schmitthenner and Heinrich Tessenow promoted an architectural ethos centered on simplicity, permanence, and continuity with vernacular forms, opposing both avant-garde modernism and historicist eclecticism.\nBy the mid 20th century, the Traditionalist approach influenced post war reconstruction throughout Western Europe, especially in civic and housing projects that sought to evoke familiarity and stability amid rapid modernization. Although eclipsed in prominence by the International Style during the 1950s, Traditionalist architecture remained a key component of regionalist movements and continues to inform contemporary debates on sustainable and context sensitive design.\nDelft School Members\n*Marinus Jan Granpré Molière\n*Cornelis Hubertus (Cees) de Bever\n*Gijsbert Friedhoff\n*Bernardus Joannes Koldewey\n*Kees van Moorsel\nOthers\n*Alexander Kropholler\n*Alphons Boosten\n*Frits Peutz\n*Hendrik Willem Valk\nSources\n*[http://www.archimon.nl/history/traditionalism.html Archimon]"
