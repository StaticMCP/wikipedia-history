The first production was on October 18, 1948, in the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, Ireland.\nPlot\nThe story is set in 1787, in Ireland, where a young woman, Una Brehony, is rescued by an aged man, Bartley Dowd, from an Anglo-Irish landlord, Caesar French, who sought her \"for the first night\" before she was marry her future husband, which was disturbing and frightful. Dowd, although an elderly man, is capable of fighting with the shillelagh or wooden walking stick in the process of rescuing her. The story has twist and turns as Brehony has actually used Dowd to rescue the man she actually loves, her future husband.\nThe play brings up the issue of claims that feudal lords had Droit du seigneur'' or lus primae noctis (right to the first night) from serfs in medieval Europe. Dowd beings to see himself a servant of the Christian messiah, one of the men of \"The King of Friday's Men\". An ancient prayer in Ireland refers to Jesus as \"The King of Friday\" due to his death on Good Friday.\nAbbey Theatre Productions\nThe show premiered at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin in 1948. The following year was the same production. The show then premiered in the United States.\nUS Productions\n(1954) was in the 1951 Broadway production.]]\nThe show was at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey in 1951 and then moved to the Broadway's Playhouse Theater later that year.

It’s hard to stomach, but this is something that really went on. The fact that the situation is so repulsive to a modern audience shows how far we’ve come with women’s rights, but with all of the abuse and misconduct from high profile men that has come to light this year, it’s easy to see how far we have yet to go.”\nReferences"
