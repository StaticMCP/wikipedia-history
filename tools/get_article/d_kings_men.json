Since its inception, multiple acts have signed to the label, including Kayswitch, J.Sol, Jay Sleek, Durella and Dee Vee. In an interview with Seun Apara, D'banj said Don Jazzy produced four songs on the album and that the record consists of a compilation of songs recorded by himself, Kayswitch, and J.Sol. In an effort to curb piracy, the album was made available for purchase at all GT Bank offices in Nigeria and sent to consumers who pre-ordered it from D'banj's official website.\n''D'Kings Men'' was released on iTunes a day after D'banj and 2 Chainz headlined the DKM concert on June 23, 2013, at the Eko Hotels and Suites.
