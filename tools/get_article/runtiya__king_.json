He was the first member of the ruling dynasty of Melid to take the title of king, earlier rulers having been called \"country-lords\".\nName and attestations\nRuntiya is known from the rock inscriptions at the sites of Gürün and Kötükale, near Malatya in Turkey. The name \"Runtiya\" is derived from a Hittite god of the hunt, and is written in Luwian hieroglyphs with the symbol of the god, a stag's head. In his inscriptions, he identifies himself as \"Country-lord\" and \"Great King,\" the son of PUGNUS-mili I and grandson of Kuzi-Teshub, the \"hero\" of Carchemish.\nReferences"
