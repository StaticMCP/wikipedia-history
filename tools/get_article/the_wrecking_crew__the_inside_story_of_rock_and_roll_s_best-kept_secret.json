The book won the Frances Fuller Victor Oregon Book Award in 2013, and it was a Los Angeles Times bestseller. The book was inspired by a conversation between the author and Larry Knechtel, a member of the band Bread, and previously a member of the Wrecking Crew.\nThe 2013 film 20 Feet from Stardom covered uncredited backup singers in the same era, and has been connected with Hartman's The Wrecking Crew in a review.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
