The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 34th Academy Awards, thirteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Argentina, Austria and Switzerland submitted films for the first time. France and Italy both failed to be nominated for the first time since the introduction of the competitive award. The five nominated films came from Denmark, Japan, Mexico, Spain and Sweden.\nSweden and Ingmar Bergman won for a second year in a row with Through a Glass Darkly, which was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay in the subsequent ceremony (35th Academy Awards).\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
