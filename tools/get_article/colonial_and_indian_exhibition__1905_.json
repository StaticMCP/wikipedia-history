Those that organised the exhibition are reported in  The Times, 12 October 1904, as saying there would be ‘no better site’ than the Crystal Palace ‘for this Imperial undertaking than the vast house of glass constructed for the epoch-making exhibition of 1851.’\nContents\nThe plan of the proposed Colonial and Indian Exhibition, 1905, shows a West Indian Court along with Concert Room, Great Orchestra and Theatre and twenty other exhibits unlabelled on the plan.\nIt was reported in the Marlborough Express newspaper on 27 October 1905 that the New Zealand displays gained numerous awards at the exhibition. Thirteen grand prizes were awarded for the exhibit representing New Zealand dairy, meat, grain and wool industries. Twenty-six gold medals, five silver medals and one bronze medal were awarded for other displays of colonial industries in New Zealand ranging from tinned fish to oil painting.\nReferences"
