The tour was in support of their twelfth studio album, A Kind of Magic, and featured 26 shows across Western Europe. In addition, the band performed one show behind the Iron Curtain in Hungary.\nThe highlight of the tour was the two sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium on 11–12 July. Both concerts were professionally filmed. The second show was released as Queen at Wembley. The final show of the tour, held at Knebworth on 9 August in front of at least 120,000 fans, marked a significant moment in the band's history. It was also the last time that lead singer Freddie Mercury performed live with Queen before his death five years later.\nBackground\nQueen's tour in 1986 featured 26 shows and marked the band's first concert series since their performance at Live Aid in July 1985, which earned them high praise and boosted their popularity. The tour included support acts such as the Alarm, Belouis Some, Marillion, INXS and Status Quo.\nPreparations for the tour started in May 1986, and the band rehearsed for four weeks, which was their longest preparation for a stage show. Despite promoters' uncertainty about whether they would sell enough tickets for stadium and outdoor venues, the gigs were met with high demand.\nIn addition to debuting new songs like \"One Vision\" and \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", the band decided to reintroduce some older tracks and an acoustic rock 'n' roll medley into their set. The final part of the show repeated the six songs Queen had played at Live Aid. The band also added a new song, \"Friends Will Be Friends\", as the final encore between \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\". Freddie Mercury personally asked his friend Diana Moseley to design stage clothes for the band, including a large crown and gown which he wore at the end of the show. The stage was  long and flanked by two  runways. Roger Taylor said the new stage show would make \"Ben Hur look like the Muppets\".\nItinerary\nThe tour began on 7 June 1986 in Stockholm. During the 21 June concert at the Maimarktgelände, Mannheim, Marillion frontman Fish sang \"Tutti Frutti\" with Mercury. Five days later at the Waldbühne, West Berlin, the group played an impromptu version of Led Zeppelin's \"Immigrant Song\". A cover of Shirley Bassey's \"Big Spender\" was performed twice on the tour, having been regularly featured in the group's early days.\nThe concert at Slane Castle on 5 July was marred by bad weather and crowd violence. The group played St James' Park, Newcastle, on 9 July. All profits for the concert were donated to Save the Children Fund. Support band INXS were delayed because of traffic. During the tour, Mercury told the audience about rumours that Queen would disband, and flatly denied them.\nAll 72,000 tickets for the 11 July show at Wembley Stadium sold out quickly, so a second date was added for the following night. The group played for over 150,000 people over the two nights. The first was played during bad weather, but the second was clear and filmed by Tyne Tees and recorded by Capital Radio for a future television and radio broadcast. Giant inflatable models representing the cartoon version of the group on the A Kind of Magic album cover were released; three were caught by the crowd, while one landed in Chelmsford approximately 35 miles away. During the show, Mercury addressed the audience, again denying rumours that Queen were splitting up, adding \"we're gonna stay together until we fucking well die\". After the second show, Mercury played an impromptu set at Kensington Roof Gardens with Fish, Samantha Fox and Gary Glitter.\nThe concert at the Népstadion, Budapest, on 27 July was one of the first concerts by a major rock group behind the Iron Curtain. As well as 80,000 tickets selling out, a further estimated 45,000 people listened to the group outside. Some fans had travelled from as far away as Russia and Poland to see the concert. The show was professionally filmed on 35 mm movie film by 17 of Hungary's best cameramen. The gear employed, including seventeen cameras and 25 miles of film, was all that was accessible in the country, and the Hungarian government approved the entire operation. During the show, the group performed an acoustic arrangement of the traditional Hungarian folk song \"Tavaszi Szél Vizet Áraszt\". Mercury wrote the lyrics on the palm of his hand.\nThe Knebworth concert on 9 August 1986 was added to the end of the tour because earlier dates at Wembley Stadium had sold out. 120,000 fans attended, making it the group's biggest UK concert.  The stage featured 5,000 amplifiers,  of cable and a  video screen. This was the last live concert featuring the classic line-up of Queen. Henry Lytton Cobbold, 3rd Baron Cobbold, owner of Knebworth Castle, later said he felt it was one of the best Queen gigs, but owing to an oversight, nobody remembered to tape video footage of the concert, although the show was professionally multitracked, along with handheld audience footage capturing the show. A photograph of a swarm of helicopters branded under the 'Magic' emblem was used for promotional purposes.\nThe tour played to more than 400,000 fans, and earned the group £11&nbsp;million. Supposedly, it was the only Queen tour that made a profit.\nAftermath\nAfter the tour, Mercury told his bandmates that he did not want to do any more large-scale shows. In spring 1987, he was diagnosed as having AIDS. When the group reconvened to record The Miracle in 1989, the press were informed that Mercury wanted to \"break the cycle of album, tour, album, tour\" and consequently the album would not have any accompanying live performances. He died on 24 November 1991. Queen did not undertake another full tour until 19 years later, when the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour began in March 2005. By then, John Deacon had retired from music, and did not take part.\nReleases\nSeveral concerts from the tour have been released commercially. The album Live Magic, containing greatly edited highlights, was released in December 1986 and was a top 5 hit. The second Wembley gig has been released several times. The full audio was released as a CD ''Live at Wembley '86 in 1992. A video, Queen at Wembley was released in 1990, containing only part of the show, with multiple overdubs and other edits. It was followed by the full concert on DVD in 2003. Part of the first night at Wembley also featured on this DVD and was released in full in 2011, with minor edits. The Budapest show has been released as Live in Budapest on VHS and Laserdisc. The show was later remastered, remixed and retitled as Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest'' in 2012.\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Lists of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, opening act and number of available tickets\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | City\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Opening act\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Attendance\n|-\n| 7 June 1986\n| Stockholm\n| Sweden\n| Råsunda Stadium\n| Gary MooreTreat\n| 37,500 / 37,500\n|-\n| 11 June 1986\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Leiden\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Netherlands\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Groenoordhallen\n| rowspan=\"2\" | INXS\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 25,600 / 25,600\n|-\n| 12 June 1986\n|-\n| 14 June 1986\n| Paris\n| France\n| Hippodrome de Vincennes\n| Belouis SomeLevel 42Marillion\n| 40,000 / 65,000\n|-\n| 17 June 1986\n| Brussels\n| Belgium\n| Forest National\n| Dayman\n| 9,200 / 9,200\n|-\n| 19 June 1986\n| Leiden\n| Netherlands\n| Groenoordhallen\n| INXSCraaft\n| 12,800 / 12,800\n|-\n| 21 June 1986\n| Mannheim\n| rowspan=\"4\" | West Germany\n| Maimarktgelände\n| CraaftGary MooreLevel 42Marillion\n| 85,700 / 115,000\n|-\n| 26 June 1986\n| West Berlin\n| Waldbühne\n| CraaftMarillion\n| 22,600 / 22,600\n|-\n| 28 June 1986\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Munich\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Olympiahalle\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Craaft\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 22,400 / 22,400\n|-\n| 29 June 1986\n|-\n| 1 July 1986\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Zürich\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Switzerland\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Hallenstadion\n| rowspan=\"2\"|22,800 / 22,800\n|-\n| 2 July 1986\n|-\n| 5 July 1986\n| County Meath\n| Ireland\n| Slane Castle\n| Chris ReaThe FountainheadThe Bangles\n| 90,000 / 120,000\n|-\n| 9 July 1986\n| Newcastle\n| rowspan=\"4\" | England\n| St James' Park\n| Status QuoZeno\n| 38,000 / 38,000\n|-\n| 11 July 1986\n| rowspan=\"2\" | London\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Wembley Stadium\n| rowspan=\"2\" | INXSStatus QuoThe Alarm\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 144,000 / 144,000\n|-\n| 12 July 1986\n|-\n| 16 July 1986\n| Manchester\n| Maine Road\n| Belouis SomeStatus Quo\n| 35,000 / 35,000\n|-\n| 19 July 1986\n| Cologne\n| West Germany\n| Müngersdorfer Stadion\n| CraaftGary MooreLevel 42Marillion\n| 50,000 / 50,000\n|-\n| 21 July 1986\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Vienna\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Austria\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Wiener Stadthalle\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Craaft\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 24,000 / 24,000\n|-\n| 22 July 1986\n|-\n| 27 July 1986\n| Budapest\n| Hungary\n| Népstadion\n| CraaftZiZi Labor\n| 80,000 / 80,000\n|-\n| 30 July 1986}}\n| Fréjus\n| France\n| Arènes de Fréjus\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Craaft\n| 15,000 / 15,000\n|-\n| 1 August 1986\n| Barcelona\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Spain\n| Mini Estadi\n| 34,000 / 34,000\n|-\n| 3 August 1986\n| Madrid\n| Vallecas Stadium\n| 45,000 / 45,000\n|-\n| 5 August 1986\n| Marbella\n| Estadio Municipal de Marbella\n| 37,000 / 37,000\n|-\n| 9 August 1986\n| Stevenage\n| England\n| Knebworth Park\n| Belouis SomeBig CountryStatus Quo\n| 120,000 / 120,000\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nPersonnel\nQueen\n*Freddie Mercury – lead vocals, piano, rhythm guitar (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\")\n*Brian May – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals, keyboards (\"Who Wants to Live Forever\")\n*Roger Taylor – drums, tambourine, backing vocals\n*John Deacon – bass guitar, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\n*Spike Edney – keyboards, piano, backing vocals, rhythm guitar (\"Hammer to Fall\")\nSee also\n*List of highest-attended concerts\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/magic.html Queen Concerts]"
