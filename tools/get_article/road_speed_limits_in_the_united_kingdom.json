The speed limit in each location is indicated on a nearby traffic sign or by the presence of street lighting. Signs show speed limits in miles per hour (mph) or the national speed limit (NSL) sign may be used.\nThe national speed limit is 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) on motorways and dual carriageways, 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) on single carriageways and generally  ( in Wales) in areas with street lighting (built-up area). These limits may be changed by road signs and apply to cars, motorcycles, car-derived vans up to 2 tonnes maximum laden weight (MLW), and to motorhomes or motor caravans not more than  maximum unladen weight. Other classes of vehicles are subject to lower limits on some roads.\nEnforcement of UK road speed limits was traditionally achieved using police 'speed traps' set up and operated by the police who now increasingly use speed guns, automated in-vehicle systems and automated roadside traffic cameras. Some vehicle categories have various lower maximum limits enforced by speed limiters.\nEver since they have been introduced, speed limits have been controversial. They are both opposed or supported from various sources; including motoring advocacy groups, anti-motoring groups and others who either consider them to be irrelevant, set too low or set too high.\nCurrent regulations\nNational speed limits\nimplying a speed limit of 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) or  depending on vehicle type]]\nDefault maximum speed limits apply to all roads where no specific lower numeric speed limit is already in force. The default speed limit is known as the national speed limit (NSL). The NSLs vary by road type and for vehicle types.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+National speed limits by vehicle type and road type\n!!!|Built-up area (Wales)!!Built-up area (England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland)!!Single carriageway!!Dual carriageway!!Motorway\n|-\n|Cars and motorcycles (including car-derived vans up to 2 tonnes max laden weight)\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h)\n| colspan=\"2\" |70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h)\n|-\n|Vehicles towing caravans or trailersinc cars, motorcycles, goods vehicles up to 7.5 tonnes MLW\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h)\n|60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h)\n|-\n|Vans, buses, coaches, minibuses up to Goods vehicles up to 7.5 tonnes MLW\n|70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h)\n|-\n|Goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes MLW (in England and Wales)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h)\n|-\n|Goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes MLW (in Scotland and Northern Ireland)\n|\n|\n|}\nIn Northern Ireland only, vehicles displaying L-plates (for learner drivers) or R-plates (for newly qualified drivers) may not exceed , regardless of whether the driver is required to display them. This restriction does not apply to goods vehicles, buses and coaches displaying L-plates while driving on a motorway, or to motorcycles of Class A2 or A displaying R-plates.\nSpeed limiters\nSome classes of vehicles are required to have speed limiters which enforce a maximum speed by physical means. New vehicles should be fitted with limiters as follows:\n*Buses and coaches, including minibuses:\n*HGVs:\n*Mopeds:\nThe law also stipulates retrofitting of limiters to older buses and HGVs, mostly at the above speeds, with two minor variations allowing \"70 mph\" (technically, 112&nbsp;km/h) for some older buses, and \"60 mph\" (96.5&nbsp;km/h) for a limited selection of HGVs between 7.5 and 12 tonnes. Some older mopeds may be restricted instead to either 30&nbsp;mph or 50&nbsp;km/h (31&nbsp;mph), although the accuracy and reliability of the restriction methods used is variable.\nSome other vehicles, especially light commercial or service vehicles, may be voluntarily fitted with limiters by their owners (either private businesspeople or company fleets), generally set to various speeds between  and 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h), though some mostly-citybound service and delivery vehicles may be limited to  or less. Likewise, some heavy goods vehicle operators choose to limit to  or  for fuel saving. In all cases, a warning sticker must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle.\nSigns\nFile:UK traffic sign 670V20.svg|Maximum speed limit of\nFile:UK traffic sign 670V30.svg|Maximum speed limit of\nFile:UK traffic sign 670V40.svg|Maximum speed limit of\nFile:UK traffic sign 670V50.svg|Maximum speed limit of\nFile:UK traffic sign 670V60.svg|Maximum speed limit of 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) (only used on dual carriageways)\nFile:70mph sign (used in Scotland and some UK special roads).png|Maximum speed limit of 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) (only used on Scottish motorways and UK special roads)\nFile:UK traffic sign 671.svg|National speed limit\nFile:UK traffic sign 672.svg|Minimum speed limit of\nFile:UK traffic sign 673.svg|End of minimum speed limit of\nFile:UK traffic sign 674.svg|Entrance to a  speed limit zone\nFile:UK traffic sign 675.svg|Exit from a  speed limit zone (maximum speed limit of )\n20 mph speed limits and zones\nThe Department for Transport encourages the use of either ' speed limits' or ' speed limit zones' in urban situations where vulnerable road users are at particular risk.\nIn 1998 the TRL reported that signed  speed limits only reduced traffic speeds by about  and delivered no discernible reduction in accident numbers but that  zones achieved average speed reductions of  with child pedestrian accident reductions of 70% and child cyclist accident reductions of 48%. The report noted that the cost of wide area traffic calming was prohibitive.\n20 mph speed limits\nspeed limits are based on signage alone and are used where 85th percentile speeds are already below .\nA report published in 2010 by the Department for Transport regarding Portsmouth City Council's  speed limit on  of the city's  of roads found a small  reduction in traffic speed and a small 8% increase in the number of serious accidents – neither of which were statistically significant – and a 21% reduction in the number of accidents. There was a 6% increase in the numbers killed or seriously injured (KSI) – also not statistically significant due to the small numbers involved – and a 22% reduction in the total number of road casualties.\n20mph zones\nIn places where  speeds are desired but where excessive speeds (85th percentile speed of  or above) occur,  zones are recommended. These have to use traffic calming measures to reduce speeds to below .\nA report published in 2008 estimated that following the introduction of  zones in London, a reduction of casualties by 45% and KSI by 57% occurred.\n20 mph default speed limit in Wales\nOn 17 September 2023, Wales introduced a default speed limit of  in built up areas. An estimated  of the  of road in the country was changed from a  to a  speed limit, with local authorities allowed to apply for exemptions to the new law. Following its introduction, only an estimated 3% of the total road network in Wales remains at , as opposed to 37% before the change. The Welsh Government said they were implementing this to reduce death and injury on the roads, as well as to reduce noise and pollution and encourage active travel. This was despite their own figures showing the measure could cost Wales £4.5 billion over a 30-year period. Spain had already enacted a similar default speed limit in 2019. Across the UK, many cities and towns already had residential areas with  speed limits. Scotland were considering a similar  default speed limit to Wales.\nShared space\nResearch carried out for the Department for Transport, to provide supporting evidence for Local Transport Note 1/11 on shared space, showed that in all of the ten shared space sites that were studied, that although they all had speed limits of , that the average speeds on them was around .\nTypes of speed limit\nFixed speed limits\nSpeed limit road signs are used to inform road users where speed limits other than the applicable national speed limit apply.\nVariable speed limits\nVariable speed limits are used on some major traffic roads. These can be changed in response to weather, traffic levels, time of day or for other reasons with the currently applicable speed limit displayed using an electronic road sign. Signs with the speed shown in a red circle are compulsory, signs where the speed is not within a red circle are advisory and exceeding these speeds while driving safely within the applicable national speed limit is not in itself an offence. Variable speed limits were introduced on some congested major routes as an element of controlled motorway techniques to improve traffic flows for given prevailing conditions.\nPart-time variable speed limits may also be used outside schools.\nMinimum speed limits\nRarely, minimum speed limits are used, such as through the Mersey Tunnels, to maintain free flow and safe passage through otherwise hazardous or enclosed areas. Circular blue signs with white numbers indicate the start of these limits, and similar signs with a red diagonal line indicate their end. Contrary to popular belief, there is no minimum speed limit on motorways, although certain classes of slow vehicles (as well as those of any class that cannot maintain  on the level whilst unladen) are prohibited on safety grounds and drivers are expected to not cause unnecessary obstruction by driving unusually slowly.\nJustification\nAccording to the government, speed limits are used to help achieve appropriate traffic speeds for safety, and environmental and accessibility reasons. The Department for Transport state that \"speed limits play a fundamental role\" in the effective management of traffic speeds in relation to the safety of both drivers and all other road users.\nSafety\nThe  speed limit in built-up areas was introduced in 1934 in response to high casualty levels. The 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) limit on previously unrestricted roads was introduced in 1965 following a number of serious motorway accidents in fog earlier the same year.\nThe Department for Transport believes that effective speed management involves many components but that speed limits play a 'fundamental role' and are 'a key source of information to road users' particularly as an indicator of the nature and risks posed by that road to both themselves and other motorised and non-motorised road users.\nThe Parliamentary Select Committee for Transport Safety published a report entitled 'The Ending the Scandal of Complacency' in 2007 which highlighted how casualty levels rise with increasing speed and recommended reducing speed limits on streets with high pedestrian populations and on dangerous rural roads. The report highlights that when two cars crash head-on at 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) a driver has a 90% chance of dying which falls to 65% at . While recommending  speed zones the committee noted that these zones 'should not rely on heavy-handed enforcement measures'.\nIn 2008 14% of collisions reported to the police had a speed-related contributory factor (either \"exceeding the speed limit\" or \"travelling too fast for conditions\") reported rising to 24% for fatal accidents and 25% of all road deaths. \"Exceeding the speed limit\" was reported as a contributory factor in 5% of collisions and 14% of fatal collisions. \"Travelling too fast for conditions\" (but within the prevailing speed limit) was recorded as one of the contributory factors in a further 8% of all collisions (and 9% of all fatal, 9% of all serious and 8% of all slight accidents),\nThe UK government publishes Reported Road Casualties Great Britain (RRCGB) each year, based on road traffic casualties data (STATS19) reported to the police, which has been collected since 1949, and with additional data going back to 1926. The highest number of road fatalities recorded in a single year in GB was 9,196 in 1941. The highest number of fatalities during peacetime was 7,985 for 1966, following the introduction of the national 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit in 1965 and the year before the legal drink drive limit and the associated Breathalyzer laws were introduced.\nThe 2009 edition also summarised the characteristics of speed related fatal collisions as typically occurring on unclassified rural 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) speed limit roads, the driver being a male under the age of 30, with the collision types being head-on, lost control or cornering and the cause being loss of control whilst cornering or overtaking and the contributory factors being excess or inappropriate speed, loss of control, aggressive, careless or reckless behaviour or in a hurry.\nEnvironmental and accessibility\nSpeed limits are also used where reduced vehicle speeds are desired to help reduce vehicle emissions and traffic noise, and to improve the accessibility conditions for more vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists and to reduce the perceived traffic risk for local people.\nDuring the 1973 oil crisis a temporary maximum national speed limit of  was introduced on all roads, including motorways to reduce fuel consumption, which was later progressively raised on Motorways (to 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h)) and dual carriageways (to 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h)), before a final change to single and dual carriageway non-motorway roads that produced the current NSL situation.\nEffectiveness\nParliament estimates that \"Most drivers and pedestrians think speeds are generally too high but 95% of all drivers admit to exceeding speed limits\". DfT guidance makes it clear that setting speed limits in isolation, or setting ones that are \"unrealistically low\" may be ineffective and lead to disrespect for the speed limit. Bath and North East Somerset Council say that speed limits on their own do not necessarily reduce traffic speeds and should be supported by enforcement to target \"irresponsible drivers\" or traffic calming.\nCompliance\nIn the UK, in 2017 the average free flow speed for each vehicle type is correlated with the applicable speed limit for that\nroad type and for motorways and national speed limit single carriageway roads, the average free flow speed is below\nthe designated speed limit for each vehicle type, except motorcycles on motorways.\nEnforcement\nSpeed limit enforcement is used to check that road vehicles are complying with the speed limits. Methods used include Fixed speed cameras, Average speed cameras and also police operated LIDAR speed guns and older radar speed guns. In addition Vehicle activated sign and Community Speed Watch groups also encourage compliance. For lower speed limits, physical Traffic Calming is normally required. Fixed speed cameras are controversial with various advocacy groups supporting and opposing their use.\nThe Nottingham Safety Camera Pilot achieved \"virtually complete compliance\" on the major ring road into the city using average speed cameras, and across all Nottinghamshire SPECS installations their KSI figures have fallen by an average of 65%.\nAdvocacy\nSince they have been introduced various groups have campaigned on the subject who either consider them to be irrelevant, set too low or set too high.\nAdvocacy groups include Association of British Drivers, The Automobile Association, Living Streets (The Pedestrians' Association), RAC Foundation, RoadPeace, Royal Automobile Club (originally the Automobile Club), Twenty is Plenty (20's Plenty for Us), Safe Speed and others.\nIn 2024 it emerged Conservative Party politicians in England had been running popular Facebook groups opposed to the  speed limit in Wales.\nHistory\nEarly years\nThe first speed limits in the United Kingdom were set by a series of restrictive Locomotive Acts (in 1861, 1865 and 1878). The 1861 Act introduced a  limit (powered passenger vehicles were then termed \"light locomotives\"). The Locomotives Act 1865 (the 'Red Flag Act') reduced the speed limit to  in the country and  in towns and required a man with a red flag or lantern to walk  ahead of each vehicle, and warn horse riders and horse drawn traffic of the approach of a self-propelled machine. The Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act 1878 (41 & 42 Vict. c. 77) removed the need for the flag and reduced the distance of the escort to .\nFollowing intense advocacy by motor vehicle enthusiasts, including Harry J. Lawson of the Daimler Company the most restrictive parts of the acts were lifted by the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896. which raised the speed limit to  and removed the need for the escort. A celebratory run from London to Brighton was held soon after the act was passed and has been commemorated each year since 1927 by the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.\nThe speed limit for motor cars was raised to  by the Motor Car Act 1903 which stood until 1 January 1931 when all speed limits for cars and motorcycles were abolished under the Road Traffic Act 1930. Lord Buckmaster's opinion at the time was that the speed limit was removed because \"the existing speed limit was so universally disobeyed that its maintenance brought the law into contempt\". Between 1930 and 1935 the number of annual road fatalities dropped from 7,305 to 6,502. The same act also introduced a  speed limits for UK coach services, UK bus services and most HGVs. Buses were not necessarily fitted with speedometers at this stage.\nA 'Road Traffic (Speedometer) Bill' was debated in 1933 relating only to vehicles to which current speed limits applied.\nThe Road Traffic Act 1934 (24 & 25 Geo. 5. c. 50), created by Leslie Hore-Belisha, the then Minister of Transport, introduced a speed limit of  in built-up areas for cars and motorcycles which came into effect on 18 March 1935. The definition of a built-up area was based on the presence of street lighting, which had previously been mandated by the Public Health Act 1875. The re-introduction of a speed limit for cars was in response to concern at increased road casualties. Between 1935 and 1940 the number of annual road fatalities increased from 6,502 to 8,609.\nSpeedometers were made compulsory for new cars in 1937.\nWorld War II\nA  night-time speed limit for built-up areas was introduced in 1940 as an attempt to halt the increase in the number of road casualties occurring during the World War II blackouts. Following the introduction of blackouts fatalities rose on speed-limited roads from 289 in March 1939 to 325 in March 1940. For October 1940 the total number of deaths during daylight (when the speed limit didn't apply) fell, in relation to those for October 1939, from 511 to 462, whereas the figures for the black-out hours (when the speed limit did apply) rose from 501 to 684. The highest number of deaths in any one year in the UK occurred the following year (9,196 people in 1941).\n1945–1969\nOn 1 October 1956, the  speed limit for built-up areas became permanent under the Road Traffic Act 1956. The speed limit, introduced on a trial basis in 1935, had relied on being renewed by Parliament each year. The maximum speed limit for goods vehicles was raised from  in 1957.\nIn addition, around 1958 some  roads had the limit raised to  to improve transit times, an early example being on Croydon Road in Mitcham, Surrey, saving, it was estimated, 33 seconds in journey time across Mitcham Common.\nFollowing a series of serious motorway multiple crashes in the fog in 1965, Tom Fraser, the then Minister of Transport, following consultations in early November with the police and with the National Road Safety Advisory Council (NRSAC), concluded that the crashes were caused by vehicles travelling too fast for the prevailing conditions. The NRSAC advised that a  motorway speed limit should be imposed on motorway stretches affected by fog and that a general speed limit of 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) should be experimentally applied for the winter months.\nOn 25 November 1965 the government announced that a temporary  speed limit would be applied to sections of motorway (there were  of it at that time) affected by fog, ice or snow and that a general maximum speed limit of 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) would be applied to all otherwise unrestricted roads, including motorways, for a trial period of four months starting just before Christmas. The four-month trial 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit on  of previously unrestricted roads and motorways was introduced at noon on 22 December 1965. Also on that day, the power for the police to apply advisory speed limits of  to motorways affected by bad weather was also introduced. The advisory limit was activated by the use of flashing amber lights placed at  intervals along the motorways.\nIn April 1966 Barbara Castle, the new Minister of Transport, decided to extend the experimental 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) limit for a further two months to allow the Road Research Laboratory (RRL) time to collect data as there was still no conclusive evidence of its effectiveness. In May 1966 Barbara Castle extended the experimental period by a further fifteen months to 3 September 1967 as \"the case is not proven\" but there were signs of crash rate reduction.\nIn July 1966 the speed limit for \"public service vehicles\" (notably buses) was raised from . During 1966, the highest number of fatalities during peacetime at 7,985 deaths, was recorded.\nIn July 1967, Castle announced that 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) was to become the permanent maximum speed limit for all roads and motorways. She had accepted RRL evidence that the speed limit had reduced the number of casualties on motorways. She ruled out minimum speed limits for motorways which would also reduce the danger of slow traffic as being too difficult to enforce and likely to increase congestion off the motorways.\nThe two major motoring organisations at the time, The Automobile Association and the R.A.C. welcomed the maximum speed limits for all-purpose roads, but the R.A.C. would have preferred more flexibility for motorways. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents suggested that a lower speed limit would be more appropriate for all-purpose roads and the Pedestrian's Association for Road Safety condemned the new limits as being too high, preferring 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) limits for all roads. Castle's decision and acceptance of the RRL research at face value was controversial. Peter Walker's motion in Parliament to annul the speed limit on motorways was not adopted.\nThe introduction of the 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit\nOn 22 December 1965, a temporary 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit was introduced on previous unrestricted roads and motorways for 4 months. At the end of the trial, speed checks on the M6 in Cheshire suggested that although cars were actually being driven about  faster, they were still usually travelling at speeds below the new limit. The crash rate was lower on the M6 in Staffordshire (the better weather was noted too) and continued to fall on the M5 in Worcestershire as it had before the new limit was imposed, and there was no change in the crash rate on the M6 in Cheshire or on the M1 in Northamptonshire.\nThe trial was extended and then made permanent in 1967. The blanket limit was reduced to 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) on single carriageways in 1977.\nAlthough these 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit road signs are normally not used on motorways (the National Speed Limit road sign is normally used, as it makes it more understandable for motorists their maximum speed on the type of vehicle they're using), they have been used on non-motorway special roads within the UK, and across the motorways within Scotland.\n1973 oil crisis\nDue to the 1973 oil crisis, a temporary maximum national speed limit of  for all roads, including motorways, was introduced on 8 December 1973. The 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) limit was restored on motorways on 29 March 1974 and on all other roads on 8 May 1974.\nAs an initiative to reduce energy consumption, the national speed limits for otherwise unrestricted single-carriageway and dual-carriageway roads were temporarily reduced to  respectively (motorway speed limits were left unchanged at 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h)) from 14 December 1974. In November 1976, the temporary speed limits were extended at least until the end of May 1977. In April 1977, the government announced that the national speed limits for single-carriageway roads was to be increased to 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) and that the 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit was to be restored on dual-carriageways on 1 June 1977.\n1977–present\nA speed limiter requirement for mopeds was introduced in 1977, with the speed cap being progressively redefined from , to , back up to  and finally to  in the late 2000s.\nThe 70&nbsp;mph (112&nbsp;km/h) speed limit was made permanent in 1978.\nThe Road Traffic Regulation Act, which was passed in 1984, includes legislation relating to speed limits. Part VI of the Act defines the default speed limit for 'regularly'-lit roads, gives local authorities powers to create 'speed limit orders', and exempts emergency vehicles from speed limits; the Act also defines speeding offences.\nThe first  speed limits for residential areas were introduced in 1991 and then speed limiters for buses and coaches set at  and also for HGVs set at  in 1994. It was made easier for local authorities to introduce a  limit in 1999.\nIn March 2009, the Government consulted on reducing speed limits on rural roads (on which 52% of fatalities had occurred in the previous year) to . It explained that 'crashes were more likely on rural parts of the road network, upon most of which the national speed limit of 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) applies'. The Conservative opposition party and the AA were both opposed. The president of the AA said that speed limits that are too low can result in a greater number of accidents and that a \"blanket reduction of speed limits would not make roads safer, given that many accidents on rural roads involved only one car\".\nIn February 2010, the Department for Transport undertook a consultation to set a  speed limit for all buses, minibuses and coaches with more than eight passenger seats. These proposals were not taken up.\nIn April 2015, the speed limit for Heavy Goods Vehicles over 7.5 tonnes was increased from  on single carriageways and from  on dual carriageways in England and Wales, but not Scotland except the A9 between Perth and Inverness.\nIn 2022, the Welsh government passed a law to make  the default speed limit for built up areas in an effort to reduce the risk of road accidents. The Restricted Roads (20 mph Speed Limit) (Wales) Order 2022 took effect on 17 September 2023.\nNotes\nReferences\n;Documents referenced from 'Notes' section\n*\n*\n*\n;Other references for article\nFurther reading\n*[https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn00468/ Roads: speed limits] Parliamentary briefing paper (June 2011)"
