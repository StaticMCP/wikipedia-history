Further reform came into effect in July 1855 for all parts of Lower Canada other than Montreal, Quebec City and Saint-Hyacinthe, which included provision for the creation of local councils for parishes and townships, the representation of towns and villages on county councils, and the formation of towns and villages by order in council upon the recommendation of the relevant county council. The municipal law of Lower Canada was consolidated into a single Act in 1860.\nFor more than a century localities changed little. During the 20th century, there were no major reorganizations in the municipal history of Quebec, with the notable exceptions of Montréal (1910), Laval (1965), Bécancour (1965) Gaspé (1971), Mirabel (1971), Percé (1971), Buckingham (1975), Gatineau (1975), La Pêche (1975), Beauport (1976), and La Malbaie (1999).\nMunicipalities written in bold are on their current form.\nPre-20th century\n20th
