In 1820 he entered the dissenting theological academy Manchester College, which was then at York, and which eventually became Harris Manchester College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1825 as the minister of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. In 1828 he moved to the York Street chapel (now Browning Hall) in Walworth, south London. In 1833 the congregation moved to a new chapel in Little Portland Street, off Regent Street. Tagart worked there for a quarter of a century. In 1844 the congregation gave him a set of plate with an inscription by Charles Dickens, who at that time attended his services.\nTagart was foreign secretary, then general secretary 1842–58, of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society, the Geological Society and the Society of Antiquaries. He was a trustee of Dr Williams's foundations 1832–58.\nIn August 1858 Tagart went on an official visit to the Unitarians of Transylvania. On his way home he was taken ill in Brussels and died there.\nPublications\n*Reply to Address in [https://books.google.com/books?id=6d8GAAAAQAAJ The Service at the Settlement of the Rev.
