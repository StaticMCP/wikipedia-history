Though the company had published many cult hits, it was known best to fans as the long-time exclusive North American publisher of the Lunar series. The company was one of the few game publishers that attempted to bridge the cultural gap between the Japanese and American video game industries during the 1990s with an eclectic selection of releases from various genres, and was also one of the earliest American publishers to make use of the CD-ROM format for full, spoken English dialogue in their titles at a time when voice acting was not a common feature in most mainstream games.\nOn December 12, 2005, Victor Ireland, President of Working Designs, announced via the company's message board that it was closing its doors. He later started a new company called Gaijinworks in 2006.\nHistory\nWorking Designs was initially founded as a software company focusing on logging management software for the IBM PC. After lead programmer Todd Mark's death in 1988, Victor Ireland was hired to complete Mark's unfinished work before transitioning the company to a game publisher in 1990.\nWorking Designs published games for the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD due to the appeal of the CD medium, instead of the more popular cartridge-based Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. The company released some of their games with premium packaging for higher prices. They applied foil stamps and extensive artwork to their packaging and supplied games with full color manuals with anime artwork and concept art at a time when many game manuals for Western releases were in greyscale. Also, every manual came with notes describing the translation process and procedure of their games, usually found on the last page of the manual. Every edition of these notes closed with the signature phrase, \"We're nothing without you!\"\nWorking Designs became known for their incorporating quirky, distinctively American humor in their translations. President Victor Ireland maintained that the company has always adhered as closely to the original Japanese text as they could while making it understandable to U.S. audiences, and said the addition of American-style humor was necessary to replace Japanese jokes which most Americans would not be able to understand.\nWhen the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn were released, Working Designs met with Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA, whose president at the time was Bernie Stolar). SCEA said they had no interest in seeing non-action games released for the PlayStation, and as Working Designs published mainly strategy games and RPGs, this led them to begin publishing exclusively for the Sega Saturn. Working Designs had also built a strong working relationship with Sega by this time.\nThe final Sega Saturn game released in the US, Magic Knight Rayearth, was delayed for over two years. Following Stolar's departure from Sony, Working Designs began working on games for the PlayStation, for which they released the most single titles on a console (10 titles) in their history, and continued to branch out by introducing their \"Spaz\" label of arcade-style shoot 'em ups. Following E3 1997, where Ireland complained that Sega of America assigned them an out-of-the-way booth and was giving away information about the upcoming Dreamcast console to the detriment of the Saturn market, Working Designs announced they would publish no more Saturn games beyond the four that were then in progress.\nDue to a series of delays, approval snags, and sagging sales, Working Designs announced on December 12, 2005 that all existing staff had been laid off and the company was effectively defunct. In a public statement posted on the message board hosted at Working Designs' official site, President Victor Ireland, though expressing much gratitude for strong core fan support over the years, stated that a series of complications related to the approval of upcoming games for the PlayStation 2 had created a loss of revenue from which the company would not be able to recover.\nList of Published/Handled Working Designs Games\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:30%\" | Title\n! style=\"width:20%\" | Release date\n! style=\"width:20%\" | System\n! style=\"width:30%\" | Produced/Developed by\n|-\n| Parasol Stars\n|\n| TurboGrafx-16\n| Taito\n|-\n| Cadash\n|\n| TurboGrafx-16\n| Taito\n|-\n| Cosmic Fantasy 2\n|\n| TurboGrafx-CD\n| Telenet Japan\n|-\n| Exile\n|\n| TurboGrafx-CD\n| Telenet Japan\n|-\n| Vasteel\n|\n| TurboGrafx-CD\n| Human Entertainment\n|-\n| Exile: Wicked Phenomenon\n|\n| TurboGrafx-CD\n| Telenet Japan\n|-\n| Dungeon Explorer II(English-Dub Only)\n|\n| TurboGrafx-CD\n| Hudson Soft\n|-\n| Lunar: The Silver Star\n|\n| Sega CD\n| Game Arts\n|-\n| Vay\n|\n| Sega CD\n| SIMS, Hertz\n|-\n| Popful Mail\n|\n| Sega CD\n| Sega, Sega Falcom\n|-\n| Lunar: Eternal Blue\n|\n| Sega CD\n| Game Arts\n|-\n| Iron Storm\n|\n| Sega Saturn\n| Sega\n|-\n| Shining Wisdom\n|\n| Sega Saturn\n| Sega, Sonic!
