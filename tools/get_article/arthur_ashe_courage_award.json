It is named for the American tennis player Arthur Ashe. Although it is a sport-oriented award, it is not limited to sports-related people or actions, as it is presented annually to individuals whose contributions \"transcend sports\". According to ESPN, the organization responsible for giving out the award, \"recipients reflect the spirit of Arthur Ashe, possessing strength in the face of adversity, courage in the face of peril and the willingness to stand up for their beliefs no matter what the cost\". The award was presented as part of the ESPY Awards ceremony at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles from 2008 to 2019. The 2020 ESPYs ceremony was held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Ashe Award being one of the few awards presented, and the 2021 ceremony was held in New York City.\nThe inaugural award, made at the 1993 ESPY Awards, was presented to the American college basketball player, coach, and broadcaster Jim Valvano. In 1993, ESPN partnered with Valvano to create the V Foundation which presents the annual Jimmy V Award to \"a deserving member of the sporting world who has overcome great obstacles through perseverance and determination.\" Suffering from cancer, Valvano gave the inaugural Arthur Ashe Courage Award acceptance speech which \"brought a howling, teary-eyed Madison Square Garden to its feet\". Valvano died two months after receiving the award. Although the award is usually given to individuals, it has been presented to multiple recipients on seven occasions: former athletes on United Airlines Flight 93 (2002), Pat and Kevin Tillman (2003), Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah and Jim MacLaren (2005), Roia Ahmad and Shamila Kohestani (2006), Trevor Ringland and David Cullen (2007), and Tommie Smith, John Carlos (2008), and survivors of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal (2018). The accolade has been presented posthumously on five occasions.\nThe award has not been without controversy: in June 2015, ESPN's announcement of Caitlyn Jenner as the recipient of that year's Arthur Ashe Courage Award led to significant criticism among online commenters and some members of the media, with Bob Costas calling the decision to give Jenner the award a \"crass exploitation play\". Many critics of the Jenner award considered Lauren Hill, who played college basketball despite suffering from a brain tumor that would claim her life only a few months later, a more worthy recipient. Others cited Noah Galloway, an Iraq War double amputee who competes in extreme sports and was also a finalist in the 20th season of Dancing with the Stars in 2015, as a worthy candidate.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n! scope=row style=\"text-align:center\" |\n| Indicates posthumous award\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|+ Arthur Ashe Courage Award recipients\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Image\n! scope=col | Recipient(s)\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Notes\n! scope=col class=unsortable |\n|-\n| 1993\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | American college basketball player, coach, and broadcaster, died from adenocarcinoma\n|\n|-\n| 1994\n| –\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Major League Baseball umpire paralysed from the waist down after attempting to prevent a mugging\n|\n|-\n| 1995\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Journalist, creator of ABC SportsBeat, the first serious investigative sports journalist program\n|\n|-\n| 1996\n| –\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Multi-sports Special Olympics athlete\n|\n|-\n| 1997\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Boxer, an example of racial pride for African Americans and resistance to white domination during the civil rights movement\n|\n|-\n| 1998\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | College basketball coach for 36 years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n|\n|-\n| 1999\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Tennis player, campaigned for equal prize money in both men's and women's tennis\n|\n|-\n| 2000\n| -\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | High school sports coach killed defending students during the Columbine High School massacre\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Track and field athlete, first Indigenous Australian person to become an Olympic Games gold medallist\n|\n|-\n| 2002\n|\n! scope=row |  Todd BeamerMark BinghamTom BurnettJeremy Glick\n| align=left | Athletes onboard United Airlines Flight 93 (National Memorial pictured) who tried to reclaim control from the hijackers\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n|\n! scope=row |  Pat Tillman (pictured)Kevin Tillman\n| align=left | Pat was an American football player who played for the Arizona Cardinals in the NFL, his brother Kevin a Minor League Baseball player; both enlisted, forgoing their sporting careers\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n|\n! scope=row |\n| align=left | Association footballer who became a UN Goodwill Ambassador\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n| –\n! scope=row | Jim MacLaren\n| align=left | Yeboah brought attention to disabled people in Ghana, himself with a deformed leg, by cycling across the country.
