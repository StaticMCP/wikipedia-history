Victoria was called the \"grandmother of Europe\".\nOverview\nVictoria and Albert had 22 granddaughters and 20 grandsons, of whom two (the youngest sons of Prince Alfred and Princess Helena) were stillborn, and two more (Prince Alexander John of Wales and Prince Harald of Schleswig-Holstein) died shortly after birth.\nTheir first grandchild was the future German Emperor Wilhelm II, who was born to their eldest child, Princess Victoria, on 27 January 1859; the youngest was Prince Maurice of Battenberg, born on 3 October 1891 to Princess Beatrice (1857–1944), who was herself the last child born to Victoria and Albert and the last child to die. The last of Victoria and Albert's grandchildren to die (almost exactly 80 years after Queen Victoria herself) was Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (25&nbsp;February 1883 – 3&nbsp;January 1981).\nJust as Victoria and Albert shared one grandfather (Duke Francis of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld) and one grandmother (Countess Augusta Reuss), two pairs of their grandchildren married each other:\n* In 1888, Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine, whose mother was Queen Victoria's daughter Alice, married Prince Henry of Prussia, son of Victoria's daughter Victoria.\n* Another of Alice's children, Grand Duke Ernest Louis of Hesse, married Princess Victoria Melita, daughter of Alice's brother Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1894, but divorced in 1901.\n, Arthur, Prince Albert (the Prince Consort), the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), Leopold (in front of the Prince of Wales), Louise, Queen Victoria with Beatrice, Alfred,  Victoria (the Princess Royal) and Helena .]]\nPrince Albert, the Prince Consort (26 August 1819 – 14 December 1861), lived long enough to see only one of his children married (Victoria, the Princess Royal) and two of his grandchildren born (Wilhelm II, 1859–1941, and his sister Princess Charlotte of Prussia, 1860–1919), while Queen Victoria (24 May 1819 – 22 January 1901) lived long enough to see not only all her grandchildren, but many of her 87 great-grandchildren as well. (Three of Victoria's 56 great-grandsons were stillborn, another died shortly after birth, and one of her 31 great-granddaughters was born out of wedlock).\nVictoria, the Princess Royal and first child of Victoria and Albert (21 November 1840 – 5 August 1901), known as \"Vicky\", was not only the mother to their first grandchild, Wilhelm II; she was also the first of Victoria and Albert's children to become a grandparent, with the birth in 1879 of Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen, who was the daughter of Princess Charlotte (Queen Victoria's first granddaughter). The Princess Royal was also the grandmother of the last of Victoria and Albert's great-granddaughters to die, Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark (4 May 1913 – 2 October 2007), daughter of Vicky's fourth daughter, Queen Sophia of Greece.\nAfter Katherine's death in 2007, the only surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria was Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg (31 October 1916 – 5 May 2012), born to Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, daughter of Victoria and Albert's third son, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn.\nThe death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte marked the end of a generation of royalty that began in 1879 with the birth of Princess Feodora and included the British Kings Edward VIII and George VI, the Norwegian King Olav V, the Romanian King Carol II and the Greek Kings George II, Alexander and Paul—as well as six uncrowned victims of political assassination: Earl Mountbatten of Burma (last Viceroy of India), Tsarevich Alexei of Russia and his sisters, the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.\nQueen Victoria's death in January 1901 was preceded by the deaths of three of her children (Princess Alice in December 1878, Prince Leopold in March 1884, and Prince Alfred in July 1900) and soon followed by the Princess Royal's death in August 1901. Aside from the four boys who died as infants, Queen Victoria had survived seven of her grandchildren:\n# Prince Sigismund of Prussia (1864–1866) died of meningitis.\n# Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine (1870–1873), a haemophiliac, fell from his mother's bedroom window and bled to death a few hours later.\n# Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (1874–1878) died of diphtheria.\n# Prince Waldemar of Prussia (1868–1879) also died of diphtheria.\n# Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864–1892) died of influenza.\n# Prince Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1874–1899) shot himself with a revolver and died soon afterward.\n# Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-Holstein (1867–1900) died of malaria while on active service in South Africa during the Boer War.\nVictoria, Albert and their children\nAncestors of Victoria and Albert\nVictoria and Albert had one pair of grandparents in common, Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf, who were parents both of Albert's father Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and of Victoria's mother (and Ernest I's sister), Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.\nDuke Francis & Countess Augusta → Duke Ernest I → Prince Albert\nDuke Francis & Countess Augusta → Princess Victoria → Queen Victoria\nAnother of Victoria's (but not Albert's) grandfathers was King George III, father of Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent, and his brothers, King George IV and King William IV.\nMarriage of Victoria and Albert\nQueen Victoria (who had ascended to the throne on 20 June 1837 and been crowned on 28 June 1838) was married to Prince Albert on 10&nbsp;February&nbsp;1840 by William Howley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace in Westminster (London). (Albert died nearly fifteen years before Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India on 1 May 1876.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:3px solid goldenrod\"\n| bgcolor=bb88ff align=center colspan=\"5\"|The Marriage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert\n|-bgcolor=lavender align=center\n| width=\"9%\"|&nbsp;\n| width=\"20%\"|Name\n| width=\"11%\"|Birth\n| width=\"12%\"|Death\n| width=\"48%\"|Marriage and children\n|-bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|Victoria,Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,later Empress of India\n|align=center valign=\"top\"| 24 May1819Kensington Palace, London\n|align=center valign=\"top\"| 22 January1901Osborne House,Isle of Wight\n|bgcolor=fefefe rowspan=\"2\"|Married 10 February 1840at St James's Palace, Westminster (London) 4 sons, 5 daughters including\n* British King Edward VII\n* German Empress Victoria\n20 grandsons (of whom 2 were stillborn), 22 granddaughters including\n* British King George V\n* German Emperor Wilhelm II\n* Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia\n* Queen Maud of Norway\n* Queen Sophia of Greece\n* Queen Marie of Romania\n* Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain and\n* Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden\n|-bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gothalater Prince Consort\n|align=center valign=\"top\"| 26 August1819Rosenau Castle,  Coburg (Germany)\n|align=center valign=\"top\"| 14 December1861Windsor Castle,Berkshire\n|}\nChildren of Victoria and Albert\nQueen Victoria, at times, had contentious relations with her children. She had trouble relating to her children when they were young, some of this possibly owing to her isolated childhood. She also, occasionally, resented that they interfered with time that she would prefer to spend with Albert. According to one modern author, both Victoria and Albert weren't above playing favourites with their children, and unfortunately did little to hide their favouritism. Both Vicky and Alfred were the favorites of Albert, and Arthur enjoyed the favouritism of both his parents.\nAccording to one modern author, Victoria was initially jealous of the time that Albert had spent with Vicky, but in her widowhood, Victoria made Vicky something of her confidante, and for her part, Vicky had accrued hundreds of letters from her mother, to the point that shortly before her death, she had them smuggled out of Germany by her brother's secretary, Sir Frederick Ponsonby.\nOf her sons, Victoria had the most trouble with her eldest, Albert Edward, and her youngest, Leopold. Among her daughters, Victoria clashed often with Louise. She also had an awkward relationship with her second-eldest daughter, Alice, whom the queen, despite praising her thoughtfulness, also criticised as being too melancholy and self-absorbed. In her widowhood, Victoria expected Beatrice, who was only 4 when her father died, to remain at home with her, and only permitted her to marry on the condition that she and her husband would remain in England.\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"100%;\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=ccccff|Portrait of Queen Victoria's family in 1846 by Franz Xaver Winterhalter\n|-\n| (from left to right:) Princes Alfred and Albert Edward; The Queen and the Prince Consort; Princesses Alice, Helena and Victoria\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:2px solid gold\"\n|- bgcolor=lavender\n| class=\"unsortable\" width=\"9%\" |&nbsp;\n! width=\"21%\"| Name\n! width=\"11%\"| Birth\n! width=\"11%\"| Death\n! width=\"48%\"| Spouse (dates of birth & death) and children\n|-bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|The Princess Victoria, Princess Royal ||align=center| 184021 November1840||align=center| 19015 August1901 ||Married 1858 (January 25th),  Prince Frederick William of Prussia (1831–1888), later Frederick III, German Emperor and King of Prussia 4 sons, 4 daughters (including German Emperor William II and Sophia, Queen of the Hellenes)\n|-bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|The Prince Albert Edward,  Prince of Wales, later Edward VII ||align=center|18419 November1841||align=center|19106 May1910 ||Married 1863 (March 10th), Princess Alexandra of Denmark (1844–1925); 3 sons, 3 daughters (including George V and Maud, Queen of Norway)\n|-bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|The Princess Alice||align=center| 184325 April1843||align=center|187814 December1878 ||Married 1862 (July 1st), Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (1837–1892); 2 sons, 5 daughters (including Alexandra, the last Empress of All the Russias)\n|-bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|The Prince Alfred,Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Edinburgh; Admiral of the Fleet ||align=center|18446 August1844||align=center|190030 July1900 ||Married 1874 (January 23rd), Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia (1853–1920); 2 sons (1 stillborn), 4 daughters (including Marie, Queen of Romania)\n|-bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|The Princess Helena ||align=center|184625 May1846 ||align=center|19239 June1923 ||Married 1866 (July 5th), Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1831–1917); 4 sons (1 stillborn), 2 daughters\n|-bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|The Princess Louise||align=center|184818 March1848 || align=center|19393 December1939 ||Married 1871 (March 21st), John Campbell (1845–1914),  Marquess of Lorne, later 9th Duke of Argyll and Governor General of Canada (1878–1883); no issue\n|-bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|The Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; Field Marshal'', Governor General of Canada (1911–1916)||align=center|18501 May1850 ||align=center|194216 January1942 ||Married 1879 (March 13th), Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia (1860–1917); 1 son, 2 daughters(including Margaret, Crown Princess of Sweden)\n|-bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|The Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany||align=center|18537 April1853||align=center|188428 March1884||Married 1882 (April 27th), Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont (1861–1922); 1 son, 1 daughter\n|-bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|The Princess Beatrice ||align=center|185714 April1857||align=center|1944 26 October1944 ||Married 1885 (July 23rd), Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858–1896); 3 sons, 1 daughter  (including Victoria Eugenie, Queen of Spain)\n|-\n|}\nChildren and grandchildren of Victoria and Albert\nVictoria, Princess Royal\nThe eldest child of Victoria and Albert was Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal, called \"Vicky\" (1840–1901).

Following Sergei's assassination in February 1905, she eventually became a nun and was killed by the Bolsheviks on 18 July 1918.

He married his first cousin, Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1876-1936), in April 1894, and had one daughter, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse who died of typhoid fever, aged 8. The couple were divorced on 21 December 1901. The Grand Duke married for a second time to Princess Eleonore of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich (1871–1937), and had two sons: Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse who married Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, sister of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and had issue, and Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine.\nPrincess Alix of Hesse, the youngest surviving child of the Grand Ducal pair, became the last Empress of All the Russias through her marriage to Nicholas II of Russia in 1894.

He is the grandfather of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden through his elder daughter, Princess Sibylla.\nQueen Victoria → Prince Leopold → Prince Charles Edward → Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha → King Carl XVI Gustaf\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:2px solid goldenrod\"\n| bgcolor=bb88ff align=center colspan=\"5\"|The Marriage of Leopold, Duke of Albany, and Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n|-bgcolor=lavender\n| width=\"9%\"|&nbsp;\n! width=\"20%\"| Name\n! width=\"11%\"| Birth\n! width=\"11%\"| Death\n! width=\"40%\"| Notes\n|- valign=\"top\" bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany\n|align=center|7 April  1853 Buckingham Palace, Westminster (London)\n|align=center|28 March  1884Cannes, France\n|valign=\"middle\" bgcolor=fefefe rowspan=\"2\"| Married 27 April 1882 in St. George's Chapel of Windsor Castle (Berkshire) 1 son, 1 daughter5 grandsons, 3 granddaughters\n|-valign=\"top\" bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n| Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n|align=center| 17 February  1861 Arolsen, Waldeck(now Hesse, Germany)\n|align=center| 1 September  1922 Hinteriss,Tyrol, Austria\n|-\n|}\nChildren of Leopold, Duke of Albany, and Princess Helena\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"100%;\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=ccccff|Photograph of the Duke of Albany and his daughter in 1883\n|-\n| The Duke of Albany, with Princess Alice seated on his lap\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"9%\"| Picture\n! width=\"20%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Birth\n! width=\"10%\"| Death\n! class=\"unsortable\" width=\"50%\"| Notes\n|-valign=\"top\" bgcolor=fff8f8\n|align=center|\n|Princess Alice of Albanylater Countess of Athlone||align=center|Windsor Castle, Berkshire\n|align=center|Kensington Palace, London\n|Married 1904 Prince Alexander of Teck (1874–1957),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governor-General of South Africa and Governor General of Canada and had issue (2 sons, 1 daughter): Princess May (1906–1994), Prince Rupert (1907–1928) and Prince Maurice (March–September 1910)\n|-valign=\"top\" bgcolor=f0fcff\n|align=center|\n|Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, later Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n|align=center|Claremont House, Surrey\n|align=center|Coburg, Germany\n|Married 1905 Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein (1885–1970) and had issue (3 sons, 2 daughters): Hereditary Prince Johann Leopold (1906–1972), Princess Sibylla (1908–1972), (see above) later a Swedish princess and &nbsp;&nbsp; mother of King Carl XVI Gustaf (acceded 1973) Prince Hubertus (1909–1943), Princess Caroline Mathilde (1912–1983), and Prince Friedrich Josias (1918–1998).¶ Last Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, 1900–1918.
