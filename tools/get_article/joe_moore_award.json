The award is presented by the Joe Moore Foundation for Teamwork, and they state that \"The Joe Moore Award for the Most Outstanding Offensive Line Unit will annually recognize the toughest, most physical offensive line in the country\", making it the only major college football award to honor a unit or group.\nThe award's namesake, Joe Moore, was a long-time offensive line coach at Notre Dame and Pittsburgh. The award was created with the help of former Notre Dame All-American offensive guard Aaron Taylor, who played for Moore.\nThe award was first given after the 2015 college football season. A committee of voters are made up of all 128 FBS offensive line coaches, media members who played offensive line and a “legacy committee,” including colleagues of Moore and players who were coached by him.\nPartnerships\nIn August 2025, [https://www.logisticsplus.com/lp/joe-moore-award/ Logistics Plus, Inc.]  was named the Exclusive Logistics Provider of the Joe Moore Award.
