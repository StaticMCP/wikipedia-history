The awards are often called the \"Oscars of porn\".\nThe award ceremony occurs in early January during the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada. AVN sponsored the first AVN Awards ceremony in February 1984. Since 2008, the show has aired in a form edited for time on Showtime, which is usually broadcast in a 90-minute time slot.\nThe awards are divided into over 100 categories, some of which are analogous to industry awards offered in other film and video genres, and others that are specific to pornographic/erotic film and video.\nAwards for gay adult video were a part of the AVN Awards from the 1987 ceremony through the 1998 ceremony. The increasing number of categories made the show unwieldy. For the 1999 ceremony AVN Magazine began hosting the GayVN Awards, an annual adult movie award event for gay adult video.\nDesign and categories\nAward design\nThe design of the AVN Award changed several times before and is in its present form since 2013 when it was redesigned as part of the 30th anniversary of the awards show. The redesigning was led by Michael Krasun, and supervised by AVN CEO Theo Sapoutzis. Krasun was a veteran with 25-plus years experience in designing, fabricating and building of restaurants, nightclubs, airport facilities and theme fixtures around the world. The makers aimed to create an artifact that represented \"sexual expression, integrity and exotic flair\", and after months of work arrived at a figurine that showcased \"two people in a very erotic embrace, yet without any explicit details of the bodies on display\". The impressive resultant figurine was conferred as the official AVN award going forward. All the trophies are hand-poured and custom mixed containing 40 percent resin and 60 percent ground marble, making them very sturdy. An epoxy coating with mix of bronze powders is applied as final finish. A solid black stone base with award winners details is engraved on front side. The artifact, from inception to fabrication, was accomplished entirely in the US.\nAward categories\n* Best Actor\n* Best Actress\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\n* Male Performer of the Year\n* Female Performer of the Year\n* Male Foreign Performer of the Year\n* Female Foreign Performer of the Year\n* Transgender Performer of the Year\n* Director of the Year\n* Best New Starlet\n* Best Director\n* Best Non-Sex Performance\n* Best Cinematography\n* Best All-Sex Video\n* Best Renting Title of the Year\n* Best Selling Title of the Year\n* Best Film\n* Best Video Feature\n* Best Foreign Feature\n* Best Tease Performance\n* Best All-Girl Sex Scene\n* Best All-Girl Feature\n* Best Newcomer – Gay Video\n* Best Bi-Sexual Video\n* Best Gay Video\n* Best Actor – Gay Video\n* Best Supporting Actor – Gay Video\n* Best Director – Bi-Sexual Video\n* Best Director – Gay Video\n* Best Screenplay – Gay Video\n* Best Sex Scene – Gay Video\n* Best Non-Sexual Performance – Bi, Gay, or Trans Video\n* Best Gay Alternative Video\n* Best Gay Solo Video\n* Best Gay Specialty Release\n* Best Videography – Gay Video\n* Best Alternative Adult Feature Film\n* Most Outrageous Sex Scene\n* Best Sex Comedy\n* Best Trans Newcomer\n* Breakthrough Award\n* Best Performer of the Year – Gay Video\n* Best Male Newcomer\n* Best Director – Foreign Release\n* Best Classic Release\n* Best DVD\n* Best High Definition Production\n* Unsung Starlet of the Year\n* Best High-End All-Sex Release\n* Best All-Sex Release\n* Best MILF Release\n* Best Director – Feature\n* Best Director – Foreign Feature\n* Best Boy/Girl Scene\n* Best All-Girl Couples Sex Scene\n* MILF Performer of the Year\nHonorary award\n* AVN Hall of Fame\nReception and review\nOriginally, the awards show was part of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, but it grew and garnered more attention over time, allowing it to be established as a separate event in the 1990s. The event started out as the \"Adult Software exhibition\" of the show, which attracted as many as 100,000 visitors in addition to those attending CES. When the show became a separate event, it initially moved to Caesars Palace, but it has since moved to other Las Vegas venues.\nA writer from Los Angeles magazine made the claim in 2006 that awards often go to consistent advertisers in AVN magazine. In his article, the writer stated: \"Imagine the editors of Variety choosing the Academy Award nominations—then handing out Oscars to the winners—and you have a pretty good idea of how much manipulation can go on behind the scenes during the run-up to the AVNs. [...] Actresses trying to secure a nomination stop in to schmooze at the magazine's Chatsworth offices. [An agency] client once presented dolls of herself to editors and writers. Another baked cookies\".\nIn 2013, actress Tanya Tate offered some insights into the industry in an interview with the Huffington Post about the 30th AVN Awards at which she was nominated for an award. She stated: \"If you are more popular with the fans, companies are more likely to book you for their production\", \"Being nominated for awards help build your recognition with your fan base. People that win male and female performer of the year are generally solid consistent talent that are open to many 'levels', and some of these performers already have higher basic rates than others\".\nListed winners\nListed below are the winners of the AVN Award in various major categories over the following years:\n* (f) - film\n* (v) - video\n1984–1989\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!1984\n!1985\n!1986\n!1987\n!1988\n!1989\n|-\n!Best New Starlet\n|Rachel Ashley\n|Ginger Lynn\n|Angel\n|Barbara Dare\n|Samantha Strong\n|Aja\n|-\n!Best Actress (f)\n|Sharon Mitchell Sexcapades\n|Pamela Mann X Factor\n|Sheri St. Claire Corporate Assets\n|Colleen Brennan Getting Personal\n|Krista Lane Deep Throat II\n|Ona Zee Portrait of an Affair\n|-\n!Best Actress (v)\n|\n|\n|Ginger Lynn Project Ginger\n|Nina Hartley Debbie Duz Dishes\n|Shanna McCullough Hands Off\n|Barbara Dare Naked Stranger\n|-\n!Best Actor (f)\n|Richard Pacheco Irresistible\n|Eric Edwards X Factor\n|Harry Reems Trashy Lady\n|Mike Horner Sexually Altered States\n|John Leslie Firestorm II\n|Robert Bullock Portrait of an Affair\n|-\n!Best Actor (v)\n|\n|\n|Eric Edwards Dangerous Stuff\n|Buck Adams Rockey X\n|Robert Bullock Romeo and Juliet\n|Jon Martin Case of the Sensuous Sinners\n|-\n!Best Supporting Actress (f)\n|Tiffany Clark Hot Dreams\n|Lisa De Leeuw Dixie Ray, Hollywood Star\n|Lisa De Leeuw Raw Talent\n|Colleen Brennan Star Angel\n|Tish Ambrose Firestorm II\n|Nina Hartley Portrait of an Affair\n|-\n!Best Supporting Actress (v)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Jacqueline Lorains Beauty & the Beast\n|-\n!Best Supporting Actor (f)\n|Richard Pacheco Nothing to Hide\n|John Leslie Firestorm\n|Ron Jeremy Candy Stripers II\n|Joey Silvera ''She's So Fine\n|Michael Gaunt Firestorm II\n|Jamie Gillis Pretty Peaches II\n|-\n!Best Supporting Actor (v)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Richard Pacheco Sensual Escape\n|-\n!Best Non-Sex Performance\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Jose Duval Pillowman\n|-\n!Best Director (f)\n|Cecil Howard Scoundrels\n|Anthony Spinelli Dixie Ray, Hollywood Star\n|Cecil Howard Snake Eyes\n|Cecil Howard Star Angel\n|Richard Pacheco Careful, He May be Watching\n|Alex de Renzy Pretty Peaches 2\n|-\n!Best Director (v)\n|\n|Henri Pachard Long Hard Nights\n|Paul Vatelli Erotic Zones II\n|Jerome Tanner Club Exotica\n|Henri Pachard Talk Dirty to Me, Part V\n|John Leslie Catwoman\n|-\n!Best Cinematography\n|Ken Gibb All American Girls\n|Fred Andes Dixie Ray, Hollywood Star\n|Larry Revene Raw Talent\n|Sandy Beach Star Angel\n|Elroy Brandy Firestorm II\n|Mr. Ed Miami Spice II\n|-\n!Best All-Sex Video\n|C.T.
