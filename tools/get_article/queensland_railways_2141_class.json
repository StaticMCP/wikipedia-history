They differed by having AC alternators instead of DC generators. They were financed by the developers of the Greenvale nickel mine and were initially confined to the  Townsville to Greenvale line. They were initially numbered as the 2200 class, before being renumbered as the 2141 class in May 1982 to make the series available for the 2170 class.\nBetween 2005 and 2007, all were rebuilt as 2250 class locomotives.\nReferences"
