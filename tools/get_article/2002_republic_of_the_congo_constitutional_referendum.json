It had been written in 2001 and approved by a National Transitional Council in 2002 before being put to a referendum. Changes from the old constitution increased presidential terms to seven years and abolished the post of Prime Minister. It established a bicameral legislature and instituted several requirements in order to be able to stand for President.\nThe government described the referendum as paving the way for elections and welcomed the results. However the opposition urged that voters boycott the referendum as they said that the new constitution would give too much power to the President. Human rights groups said that the referendum, which took place without international observers, had seen irregularities.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|-\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||1,113,955||87.83\n|-\n|align=left|Against||154,375||12.17\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||49,908||-\n|-\n|align=left|Total||1,318,238||100\n|-\n|colspan=3|Source: [http://africanelections.tripod.com/cg.html African Elections Database]\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cg_detail.html#2002_Constitutional_Referendum Results by region]"
