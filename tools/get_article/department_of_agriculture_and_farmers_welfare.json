The department is headed by Minister of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.\nHistory\nThe Agriculture sector is vital for the Indian economy. As per the data of the 2011 Census, 54.6% of India's population was engaged in agriculture and it contributed 17.4% to India's Gross Value Added. The importance of the agriculture sector has led the Government of India to launch numerous initiatives. The department  was thus established for sustainable development of  the agriculture sector. The DAC&FW is divided into 27 units and has five attached offices and 21 subordinate offices. The pre-independence India had attached Department of Agriculture, Revenue and Commerce set up in 1871. In 1881 the Department of Revenue and Agriculture was separated from it, further in 1923 the Department of Education and Health were combined in it to form Department of Education, Health and Land. In 1945 three separate department were made out of this, which were Department of Education, Health and Agriculture, respectively. In 1947, the Department of Agriculture was rededicated to the Ministry of Agriculture.\nThe present nomenclature of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare and Department of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare is attributed to the two agencies vide cabinet resolution of 2015.\nInitiatives\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana\nThe Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (National Agriculture Development Programme) was launched in 2007 and has been implemented across two Five Year Plan periods, namely the 11th and 12th Five Year Plans.

It aims to reduce the burden of premium on farmers who take loans for their agricultural operations. The farmers are required to pay 2% premium for all Kharif crops and 1.5% and 5%, respectively, for Rabi and annual horticultural crops. The scheme is enforced under overall coordination of DA&FW and the state governments. The government will pay a balanced premium and there is no upper limit on the government subsidies.

The spouse is also eligible for pension after making a separate contribution under the scheme. Further, if the farmer dies after the retirement  age then the spouse will receive 50% of the pension as family pension. If the farmer dies before completing the retirement age, the spouse is eligible to continue in the scheme after paying the remaining contribution till the retirement age of the deceased farmer. If the spouse does not wish to continue then the total corpus along with the interest will be paid to the spouse. If there is no spouse, the total contribution along with the premium shall be paid to the nominee. In case of death of both farmer and his spouse, the contribution made will be credited back to the pension fund.\nPrime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme\nThe Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme or PM Kisan is a type of basic income scheme under which all farmers (subject to some exclusion criteria) are provided an annual income of Rs. 6000 in three installments of Rs. 2000 each, directly into their bank account.
