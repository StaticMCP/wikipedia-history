The broadcaster ingests the stream through a RTMP server which then encodes and sends the resultant stream to a HLS  (HTTP Live Streaming) URL.  The stream can then be viewed on a number of players and devices including desktops,smartphones and social media sites.\nSome full implementation RTMP servers are:\n* Adobe Flash Media Server\n* FreeSWITCH RTMP media streaming available with mod_rtmp and allow interconnecting with other VoIP protocols (SIP, H.323), etc.\n* Nginx with nginx-rtmp-module\n* Nimble Streamer has RTMP streaming, publishing and re-publishing\n* Helix Universal Server can support RTMP, RTMPT and RTMPS streaming for live and on-demand content. (Discontinued in 2014)\n*Red5 Media Server is a Java open source project.\n*OvenMediaEngine is an open source project that receives RTMP and transmits it with low latency.\n* Wowza Streaming Engine has full support for RTMP streaming for live streams and VOD\n* WebORB Integration Server (RTMP/RTMPT/RTMPS messaging and media streaming available for .NET and Java Enterprise, Community and Cloud editions)\n* Flashphoner Web Call Server – a multi-protocol server (including SIP, RTMP and other)\nClient software\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
