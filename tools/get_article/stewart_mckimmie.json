He played in defence, primarily as a right-back, and also played for Dundee and Dundee United. He later wrote a weekly column in the Evening Express, as well as appearing as a pundit on Northsound 2's Friday Sport.\nClub career\nMcKimmie signed for hometown club Aberdeen in 1983 from Dundee, as a replacement for Stuart Kennedy who had been forced to retire due to injury. He won the European Super Cup shortly after joining, and would go on to win two Scottish League Championships in 1984 and 1985, three Scottish Cups in 1984, 1986 and 1990 and three Scottish League Cups in 1985, 1989 and the last in 1995, as captain of the club, in addition to involvement in several further runners-up finishes in the Premier Division and losing cup finals. He left Aberdeen in 1997, having made 561 appearances for the Dons in all competitions, and finished his career with Dundee United.\nInternational career\nHe won 40 international caps for Scotland, appearing in the 1990 World Cup, the 1992 European Football Championship and 1996 European Football Championship. He scored once for Scotland, the only goal in a friendly game against world champions Argentina prior to the 1990 World Cup.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |Scottish Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Europe\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Dundee\n|1980–81\n|Scottish First Division\n|18\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|18\n|0\n|-\n|1981–82\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Scottish Premier Division\n|16\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|22\n|0\n|-\n|1982–83\n|31\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|6\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|39\n|0\n|-\n|1983–84\n|16\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|8\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|24\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!81\n!0\n!4\n!0\n!18\n!0\n!0\n!0\n!103\n!0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"15\" |Aberdeen\n|1983–84\n| rowspan=\"14\" |Scottish Premier Division\n|18\n|1\n|6\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|29\n|1\n|-\n|1984–85\n|34\n|3\n|5\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|42\n|3\n|-\n|1985–86\n|34\n|3\n|5\n|0\n|6\n|0\n|6\n|0\n|51\n|3\n|-\n|1986–87\n|37\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|45\n|0\n|-\n|1987–88\n|42\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|55\n|0\n|-\n|1988–89\n|35\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|47\n|0\n|-\n|1989–90\n|33\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|45\n|0\n|-\n|1990–91\n|25\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|33\n|1\n|-\n|1991–92\n|39\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|44\n|0\n|-\n|1992–93\n|14\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|20\n|0\n|-\n|1993–94\n|40\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|51\n|0\n|-\n|1994–95\n|36\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|42\n|1\n|-\n|1995–96\n|29\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|37\n|0\n|-\n|1996–97\n|14\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|21\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!430\n!9\n!46\n!0\n!47\n!0\n!39\n!0\n!562\n!9\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Dundee United\n|1996–97\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Scottish Premier Division\n|4\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|-\n|1997–98\n|6\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|9\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!10\n!0\n!1\n!0\n!0\n!0\n!3\n!0\n!14\n!0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!521\n!9\n!51\n!0\n!65\n!0\n!42\n!0\n!679\n!9\n|}\nInternational\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Appearances and goals by national team and year\n!National team\n!Year\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Scotland\n|1989\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|1990\n|7\n|1\n|-\n|1991\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|1992\n|8\n|0\n|-\n|1993\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|1994\n|7\n|0\n|-\n|1995\n|5\n|0\n|-\n|1996\n|4\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!40\n!1\n|}\n''Scores and results list Scotland's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each McKimmie goal''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+List of international goals scored by Stewart McKimmie\n!No.\n!Date\n!Venue\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Result\n!Competition\n|-\n|1\n|28 March 1990\n|Hampden Park, Glasgow, Scotland\n|Argentina\n|1–0\n|1–0\n|Friendly\n|}\nHonours\n* Scottish Premier League: 1983–84, 1984–85\n* Scottish Cup: 1983–84, 1985–86, 1989–90\n* Scottish League Cup: 1985–86, 1989–90, 1995–96\n* European Super Cup: 1983\nSee also\n* List of footballers in Scotland by number of league appearances (500+)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thisisaberdeen.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=158025&command=newPage Evening Express column]\n*\n*\n}}"
