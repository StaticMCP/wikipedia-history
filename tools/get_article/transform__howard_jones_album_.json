It is the first proper studio album from Jones in a decade, and was released on 10 May 2019 on CD and vinyl formats.\nBackground\nTransform was conceived from multiple situations. One being when former Take That frontman Gary Barlow asked Jones to produce songs for the soundtrack to the 2016 movie Eddie the Eagle. Two songs were written for the soundtrack, with one—\"Eagle Will Fly Again\"—being featured on Transform. Jones recalls that after writing the two tracks, he thought about returning to his electronic roots.\nAnother build up was when Jones collaborated with fellow friend and fan BT for three tracks. \"The One to Love You\", the first song on the album, was the first of their endeavours. The final catalyst was, of course, the fans who relentlessly asked for a new synth-based album from the musician. Jones also teamed up again with producer Robbie Bronnimann, who was present on the 2005 album Revolution of the Heart.\nWhen asked about the lyrics in Transform, Jones responded by stating he wanted the music to be relevant to those in his generation when it comes to \"having kids or battling with negative forces\". He continues by adding, \"My lyrics are about how we can work on our own attitude to life to be happier with it. It starts with us. If we stand up and say no we aren’t having it anymore. Then it will change.\"\nJones embarked on a summer tour to promote the album with Men Without Hats and BT and his group All Hail the Silence.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Times\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Cryptic Rock\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Belfast Telegraph\n| rev4score = 8/10\n| rev5 = Classic Pop\n| rev5score =\n}}Transform received mostly positive reviews. Libby Cudmore of Paste felt Transform was both familiar and innovative; saying that Howard Jones had returned stronger than ever. She praised the complexity of the beats and keyboard lines on \"The One to Love You\", \"Take Us Higher\", and \"Tin Man\", while also noting that the lyrics are \"honest\" and \"tailor-made for the montage that plays in your head while...running at the gym...[or] indulging in some much-needed self-care.\"\nAlfie Vera Mella of Cryptic Rock considered the album to be \"another testimony of [Jones'] greatness\" when it comes to adapting to modern music without sacrificing his trademark sound. Vera Mella praised \"Take Us Higher\"'s \"dancey mood\" by comparing it to the likes of 1990's alternative dance bands (The Farm, Pop Will Eat Itself) and early synthpop (The Human League). He also appreciated the melodramatic \"Tin Man\" and passionate ballad \"Mother\", but considered \"Hero in Your Eyes\" to be the album's highlight.\nWyndham Wallace of Classic Pop magazine praised Jones for sticking to his nostalgic roots. He found the album to be full of \"jolly\" and \"nifty\" tracks, but still able to \"successfully...show [Jones'] touchy-feely side\". He gave the album the designation \"Best New Release\" of May 2019.\nTrack listing\n|length1=4:21\n|title2=Take Us Higher\n|writer2=\n|length2=3:38\n|title3=Beating Mr. Neg\n|writer3=\n|length3=5:41\n|title4=Transform\n|writer4=\n|length4=3:39\n|title5=Hero in Your Eyes\n|writer5=\n|length5=4:17\n|title6=Tin Man Song\n|writer6=\n|length6=5:58\n|title7=At the Speed of Love\n|writer7=\n|length7=4:12\n|title8=Eagle Will Fly Again\n|writer8=\n|length8=4:13\n|title9=Mother\n|writer9=\n|length9=4:41\n|title10=Stay with Me\n|writer10=\n|length10=3:55\n}}\nCredits\nMusicians\n* Howard Jones – all vocals and instruments, except\n* Christian Burns – additional backing vocals (1)\n* Aric Johnson – vocal Dolby magic effects (1, 4, 7)\n* Mike DiMattia – vocal comps (1, 4, 7)\n* BT – additional instruments (1, 4, 7)\n* Jonathan Atkinson – drums (8)\n* Robbie Bronnimann – strings (9)\n* Robin Boult – guitars (10)\nProduction\n* BT – producer (1, 4, 7), mixing (1, 4, 7)\n* Robbie Bronnimann – producer (2, 3, 5, 6, 8-10), mixing (2, 3, 5, 6, 8-10)\n* Howard Jones – producer (2, 3, 5, 6, 8-10)\n* Stephen W.
