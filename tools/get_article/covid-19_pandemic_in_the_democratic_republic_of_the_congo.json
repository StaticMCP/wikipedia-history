The virus was confirmed to have reached the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 10 March 2020. The first few confirmed cases were all outside arrivals.\n__TOC__\nBackground\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the poorest countries in the world, and access to health care is limited. The DRC has been battling the Kivu Ebola epidemic since 2018, and this epidemic was still ongoing when the COVID-19 crisis began.\nOn 10 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019.\nThe WHO, through its director general Tedros Adhanom, expressed on 27 February 2020 its \"greatest concern\" for Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the weaknesses of the healthcare systems of most of the region's countries.\nPrevention measures\nForce Intervention Brigade has taken measures to boost hygiene to help slow the spread of the virus.]]\nSchools, bars, restaurants, and places of worship were closed. On 19 March, President Félix Tshisekedi announced flight suspensions. The president imposed a state of emergency and closed the borders.\nTimeline\nMarch 2020\nOn 10 March, the first case was reported in the country. The case was initially reported to be a Belgian national who visited the country and was later quarantined in a hospital in Kinshasa. The Health Minister of the DRC, Eteni Longondo, said that the situation is \"under control\" and that \"there is no need to panic\". The nationality and travel history of the first case turned out to be incorrect. The case was actually a Congolese citizen who had returned from France and contacted health services. The failure to report accurate details on the first case sparked a rebuke from President Félix Tshisekedi who stated in a cabinet meeting that the health ministry had acted in an \"appalling and mediocre\" way.\nThe second case was confirmed to be a Cameroonian national in the country, who returned from France on 8 March. Initially asymptomatic, he later developed symptoms and received treatment in a hospital in Kinshasa. After five more confirmed cases, the first death in the country was reported, following announcements that Angola will be closing the border with the DRC.\nDuring the month there were 109 confirmed cases, eight of whom died while four recovered in March.\nApril to June 2020\nThere were 463 new cases in April, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 572. The death toll rose to 31. The number of recovered patients increased to 65, with 476 active cases at the end of the month. In May there were 2476 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 3048. The death toll more than doubled to 71.\nOn 1 June, a new Ebola outbreak was declared in Mbandaka. In conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Kivu Ebola epidemic, and the world's largest measles outbreak, the situation has been described as a \"perfect storm\" by the Red Cross. On 16 June, a crowd ransacked a coronavirus treatment centre in South Kivu in response to the killing of a young man, rumoured to have been killed by police enforcing a virus curfew. On 29 June 2020, Albert M’peti Biyombo, DRC deputy health minister, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister accusing the cabinet members of colluding with networks within the health ministry to embezzle funds from the government and its aid partners.\nDuring June there were 3990 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 7038. The death toll rose to 169.\nJuly to September 2020\nThere were 2031 new cases in July, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 9069. The death toll rose to 214.

The response included over 40,000 Ebola vaccinations, which like several COVID-19 vaccine candidates need to be stored at super-cold temperatures. The WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, states that the response has provided several lessons for the global fight against COVID and has built local capacity.\nThere were 4886 new cases in December, raising the total number of confirmed cases to 17,658. The death toll rose to 591. The number of recovered patients increased to 14,701, leaving 2366 active cases at the end of the month.

The number of recovered patients increased to 26,250, leaving 2886 active cases at the end of the month.\nBy mid-May, only 5,000 individuals had been given the vaccine, out of a population of 90 million people.\nThere were 1747 new cases in May, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 31,651. The death toll rose to 782. The number of recovered patients increased to 27,665, leaving 3204 active cases at the end of the month.\nIn June the WHO warmed of a surge in cases linked to the Indian (Delta) variant.

During a special meeting of the Council of Ministers on 17 March, the Minister of the National Economy Acacia Bandubola Mbongo began to present symptoms. She and her husband subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, having been contaminated by her brother and cabinet minister Dédié Bandubola upon his return from a trip to France. The latter died a few days later, marking the first death of a Congolese citizen from the virus. Several other government ministers were tested for COVID-19 after having attended the same meeting, but only Minister of Justice Célestin Tunda Ya Kasende made his \"negative\" test result public.\nSeveral other people close to president Félix Tshisekedi tested positive, with some even dying, including his uncle and leader of the civil cabinet Gérard Mulumba Kalemba and Jean-Joseph Mukendi wa Mulumba, Bâtonnier and former political advisor to Étienne Tshisekedi.\nOn 3 April, former health minister and member of the Common Front for Congo Félix Kabange Numbi Mukwampa criticized the government's decision to only confine the Gombe municipality instead of confining all of Kinshasa. He also stated his belief that the government has not been capable of helping the country's poorest populations, saying that he fears their reactions if the number of deaths increases.\nA political crisis began to simmer in the heart of the ruling coalition; the President of the National Assembly Jeannine Mabunda and Senate President Alexis Thambwe Mwamba, both close to former president Joseph Kabila, accused Felix Tshisekedi of having declared a state of emergency without prior parliamentary authorization and attempted to organize a congress to \"correct this irregularity.\" The presidential camp refused, and the Constitutional Court eventually ruled in favor of the chief of state. A vote to extend the state of emergency by two weeks passed on 23 April, putting an end to the political crisis.\nBy 28 May 2021, 32 members of the DRC parliament, making up 5% of the MPs, died due to COVID.\nEconomic\nOn 22 April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced its decision to release 363.27 million dollars in order to help the DRC as a part of its Rapid Credit Facility plan. 27 April, prime minister Sylvestre Ilunga announced that the eleven billion-dollar budget planned for 2020 would not be able to be implemented due to the pandemic. The economic context has indeed been greatly impacted; the DRC, having an outward-oriented economy, is very dependent on its commerce with the rest of the world. This budget, approved in late 2019, was at the time criticized by the IMF, who found it to be \"unrealistic.\"\nIn addition, lockdown measures are difficult to implement and enforce economically, especially in Kinshasa, where a large portion of the population lives in precarious conditions. The movement Lutte pour le changement said it feared a \"humanitarian catastrophe or riots\" when authorities announced the lockdown towards the end of March 2020. The lockdown risks to deprive many residents of their income, even exposing some to the risk of starvation, since preventing people from leaving their home effectively prevents them from being able to earn money to feed themselves. Social distancing and confinement endanger the informal economy that employs more than 77% of the Congolese population and allows many households to survive from day to day.\nSocial\nAn explosion in cases of domestic violence against women was observed during the lockdown, with victims being forced to remain shut away with their abusers. An increase in divorces in Kinshasa was also observed.\nThe rise in the unemployment rate, already underway in Kinshasa before the pandemic, intensified, and a resurgence of banditry (most notably armed robbery) also occurred.\nSee also\n* COVID-19 pandemic in Africa\n* COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory\n* COVID-19 vaccination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://corona-stats.mobi/en/DRC/national.php COVID-19 statistics for Democratic Republic of the Congo] – UCT"
