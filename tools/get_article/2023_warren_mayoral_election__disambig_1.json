Incumbent Mayor James R. Fouts attempted to seek a fifth term, but was barred from doing so by a 2020 amendment to the city charter. Fouts attempted to challenge the legality of the amendment and filed for re-election, but the Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the amendment and disqualified Fouts. Following Fouts's disqualification, six candidates ran to succeed him. In the August 8 primary, George Dimas, the Warren Human Resources Director, and State Representative Lori Stone, placed first and second, respectively, and advanced to the general election. Stone narrowly defeated Dimas, winning 53 percent of the vote to Dimas's 47 percent. Following Stone's resignation from the legislature, the State House was briefly tied, until a special election was held to replace her.\nPrimary election\nCandidates\n* Lori Stone, State Representative\n* George L.
