Produced by Lucasfilm and set to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, the film will be part of the Star Wars franchise. It stars Daisy Ridley as Rey. The film is set 15 years after the events of the film Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) and follows Rey as she rebuilds the Jedi Order.\nLucasfilm hired Damon Lindelof to develop a new Star Wars film by March 2022. Obaid-Chinoy joined by that October, when Lindelof was writing the script with Justin Britt-Gibson. The writers left the project in February 2023 and were replaced by Knight. The film and Ridley's return from the Star Wars sequel trilogy were announced at Star Wars Celebration London in April. Production was expected to begin in April 2024 for a possible December 2026 release date, but the project was delayed by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. Knight left the film by the end of October 2024 and Nolfi took over by January 2025.\nPremise\nThe film is set 15 years after the fall of the First Order during the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019), and follows Rey as she rebuilds the Jedi Order.\nCast\n* Daisy Ridley as Rey: A Jedi who is rebuilding the Jedi Order. Ridley said Rey's approach to training would be different from that of her mentor, Luke Skywalker.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nWriter and Star Wars fan Damon Lindelof said in May 2013 that he would work on the franchise if asked, but he was concerned about potential backlash to his involvement after receiving negative online comments the year before about rumors that he was working on the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). He reiterated this in March 2020, saying he would like to work on the franchise \"a decade from now when I would no longer be blamed for ruining it\". Following the financial failure of the spin-off film Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) and the release of the last film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019), Disney and Lucasfilm reconsidered their film output and began prioritizing series for the streaming service Disney+ instead. Lucasfilm did begin work on several potential new Star Wars films, but were taking their time to get them right.\nLindelof was reported to be developing a new Star Wars film in March 2022. Following Star Wars Celebration Anaheim that May, a writers' room was put together featuring Lindelof; Patrick Somerville, who worked on Lindelof's series The Leftovers (2014–2017); Rayna McClendon, a consulting producer on the Star Wars series Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022); up-and-coming writer Justin Britt-Gibson; and several other writers including Andy Greenwald. The room met for two weeks in July and may have been joined by Dave Filoni, an executive producer on multiple Star Wars television series. After the film's story was outlined by the writers' room, Lindelof and Britt-Gibson began writing the screenplay. By October, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was hired to direct the film. Lucasfilm and Lindelof hired a director, despite the project still being in the writing stage, so she could help align the script with her vision for the film. It was expected to be set after The Rise of Skywalker and had the potential to include characters from the sequel trilogy, but it would not be a continuation of the main \"Skywalker Saga\" film series. It was also being developed as a standalone film, but could be followed by sequels if it was successful. The project was seen to have the most momentum out of all the Star Wars films that Lucasfilm was developing at the time.\npromoting the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Ridley was announced to be reprising her role of Rey for New Jedi Order in April 2023.]]\nAt the Sundance Film Festival in January 2023, Daisy Ridley was asked if she would be reprising her role as Rey from the sequel trilogy in the new film. She said she had not heard anything from Lucasfilm, but was open to returning due to her positive experience making the previous films. Ridley had breakfast with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy after the festival and was offered a role in the film. She agreed to return after hearing the planned story. In March, Variety reported on the state of the in-development Star Wars films. Though some were no longer expected to happen, Lucasfilm was said to be committed to making Obaid-Chinoy's film. Lindelof soon stated that he found working on the film to be very difficult due to his love for the franchise, saying \"it's possible that sometimes when you hold something in such high reverence and esteem, you start to get in the kitchen and you just go, 'Maybe I shouldn't be cooking. Maybe I should just be eating. It was revealed that he and Britt-Gibson left the project after turning in a draft of the screenplay in mid-February, and Lindelof later said he had been asked to leave. Steven Knight was hired to write a new draft by the end of March. At Star Wars Celebration London the next month, Lucasfilm announced that Ridley would star as Rey in the film, which would be set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker and focus on the rebuilding of the Jedi Order. The announcement was planned during a last-minute call between Kennedy and Ridley.\nFollowing the film's announcement, Kennedy said it was unlikely that Mark Hamill would be reprising his Star Wars role as Luke Skywalker in flashbacks or as a Force ghost, but she said the character's legacy would be an important part of Rey's journey. Adam Driver added that he would not be returning as Ben Solo / Kylo Ren from the sequel trilogy, saying \"the character's done\". In June 2023, Lucasfilm scheduled unspecified Star Wars films for release on May 22 and December 18, 2026. One of these was expected to be the Rey film. That November, Ridley said she had not yet read a script for the film, and Filoni revealed that he was now chief creative officer at Lucasfilm and would be directly involved in the planning of future films and series.\nIn January 2024, Obaid-Chinoy—who would be the first woman and person of color to direct a Star Wars film—said it was \"about time that we had a woman come forward to shape a story\" in the franchise. Some online commenters suggested she was bringing an anti-men agenda to the film. They supported this claim with comments Obaid-Chinoy made in 2015 in relation to her documentary work about wanting to make men feel uncomfortable, which the commenters took out of context. Subsequently, rumors began circulating that Obaid-Chinoy had been fired from the film, that Knight had exited over creative differences, and that the film had been delayed indefinitely. The latter was exacerbated when Lucasfilm announced that a different film, The Mandalorian and Grogu—a continuation of the Disney+ series The Mandalorian (2019–2023)—would be released in May 2026 as the first new Star Wars film since The Rise of Skywalker. In response, Gizmodo reported that the Rey-focused film had not been indefinitely delayed and Knight was working on the latest draft. Ridley soon confirmed that Obaid-Chinoy was still attached to the project, and expressed excitement to be working with the director because of her ideas for the film and her past documentary work, not just because Obaid-Chinoy was a woman. Also in January, Ridley was reported to be earning $12.5&nbsp;million for the film.\nIn March 2024, Ridley said the production had planned for filming to start later that year, but she was unsure if that was still the case or if it had been pushed to early 2025 following delays caused by the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike; the film was previously expected to begin filming that April at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Fiona Crombie was hired as production designer. Ridley expected to read a script for the film \"imminently\" and was hopeful it could be released in 2026. She was unable to confirm the film's rumored title of New Jedi Order, and said it was unlikely Rey would have any children of her own in the film. By the end of October, Knight had left the project and Lucasfilm was looking for a new writer. Knight said he turned in several drafts and expected substantial amounts of his work to be in the finished film. Matthew Belloni of Puck said it was unlikely the film would be ready in time for the December 2026 release date, and Adam B. Vary at Variety said production on the film was unlikely to begin until \"well into 2025 at least\". Commentators questioned whether the film would come to fruition following news in November that Simon Kinberg had been hired to write a new trilogy of Star Wars films that could also feature Rey in a mentorship role. Later that month, Disney dropped the December 2026 date from its release calendar. Anthony D'Alessandro of Deadline Hollywood said it was still not certain if that date had been intended for the Rey film. George Nolfi was revealed to be the new writer in January 2025. The film, which was officially being referred to by the working title Star Wars: New Jedi Order, was no longer expected to be the next Star Wars film after The Mandalorian and Grogu due to the delays.\n}}\nExternal links\n*  Star Wars }}\n*  Star Wars }}"
