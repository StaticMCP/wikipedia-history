Universe at War: Earth Assault was intended to be the first game in a planned series of games to be called the Universe at War series.\nOn May 10, 2007, Sega announced that the title was also in development for the Xbox 360, which was released in 2008. Further, on June 27, 2007, Sega announced that the title would allow cross platform multiplayer through Xbox Live and Games for Windows – Live services.\nPlot\nUniverse at War: Earth Assault, begins during year 2012 when an alien species called the ”Hierarchy” enters Earth to strip mine and threaten the planet. Before this alien species has arrived, observatories and scientists on Earth gave warning of aliens but the human race, as a whole, is not able to organize a unified military front against these alien forces. Also, because the Hierarchy has vast military experience from invading and destroying other planets in the universe, the human race is not able to withstand Hierarchy's alleged terror attack threats.\n| Edge_PC = 6/10\n| EuroG_PC = 7/10\n| EuroG_X360 = 4/10\n| GI_PC = 8.25/10\n| GI_X360 = 5/10\n| GamePro_PC =\n| GameRev_PC = B−\n| GSpot_PC = 7.5/10\n| GSpot_X360 = 6.5/10\n| GSpy_PC =\n| GSpy_X360 =\n| GT_X360 = 7.5/10\n| GameZone_PC = 8/10\n| GameZone_X360 = 7.2/10\n| IGN_PC = 8/10\n| IGN_X360 = 6.3/10\n| OXM_X360 = 7.5/10\n| PCGUS_PC = 85%\n| rev1 = The New York Times\n| rev1_PC = (favorable)\n| MC_PC = 77/100\n| MC_X360 = 66/100\n| PCPP_PC = 8/10\n}}\nThe PC version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the Xbox 360 version received \"average\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GamePro described the PC version \"like a breath of fresh air that carries with it the vague stench of something foul. It offers three interesting and diverse sides, great graphics, and some tantalizing strategic elements but it's afflicted by some unfortunate quirks that hold the game back.\" IGN remarked of the same console version, \"What Petroglyph has done is to take the basic framework and use it to create a game with three wildly unique but finely balanced factions that each offer a level of real-time customization that gives players a chance to really adapt to the changing circumstances on the battlefield. Unfortunately, the game's campaign doesn't do justice to the overall design while a number of sticky interface and performance problems add to the frustrations.\"\nAwards\n*ActionTrip: Best strategy game of E3 2007.\n*Kotaku: Best strategy game of E3 2007.\n*CHUD: Sixth of Best of E3 2007, also the number one strategy game on the top ten list.\n*Game Critics Awards nominee.\n*Number 9 on IGN PC Editor's list of most anticipated games.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
