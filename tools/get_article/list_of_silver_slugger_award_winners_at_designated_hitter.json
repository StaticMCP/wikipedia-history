These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners, including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, in addition to \"coaches' and managers' general impressions of a player's overall offensive value\". Managers and coaches are not permitted to vote for players on their own team. The Silver Slugger was first awarded in 1980 and is given by Hillerich & Bradsby, the manufacturer of Louisville Slugger bats. The award is a bat-shaped trophy, 3&nbsp;feet (91&nbsp;cm) tall, engraved with the names of each of the winners from the league and plated with sterling silver.\nFrom 1980 to 2019, and in 2021, a Silver Slugger Award for designated hitters (DH) was only given in the American League, because use of a DH in place of the pitcher in the batting order was prohibited in the National League; a Silver Slugger Award for pitchers was given for the National League instead. In the  season, the National League temporarily allowed use of the designated hitter, and no pitcher was awarded the Silver Slugger Award. An award was given instead to the best designated hitter in the National League. The first NL Silver Slugger Award for designated hitter was given to Marcell Ozuna. Beginning in 2022, the pitcher Silver Slugger Award was retired after MLB announced the full-time implementation of the universal DH rule in both leagues. The Silver Slugger Award for DH is now awarded in both leagues.\nDavid Ortiz has won the most Silver Sluggers as a designated hitter, capturing four consecutively from 2004 to 2007, and winning again in 2011, 2013, and 2016. Three players are tied with four wins. Paul Molitor won the award four times with three different teams: the Milwaukee Brewers in 1987 and 1988; the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, when the team won the World Series; and the Minnesota Twins in 1996. Edgar Martínez won the award four times with the Seattle Mariners (1995, 1997, 2001, 2003). Shohei Ohtani won the award four times with two different teams: the Los Angeles Angels in 2021 and 2023 and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2024 and 2025. Ohtani is also the only player to win the designated hitter Silver Slugger Award in both the American and National League, which he has achieved twice. Don Baylor won the Silver Slugger three times in four years (1983, 1985–1986) as a designated hitter with the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, and Frank Thomas won it twice with the Chicago White Sox (1991, 2000). Harold Baines won the award while playing for two separate teams in the same season; he was traded by the White Sox to the Texas Rangers in the middle of the 1989 season. Ohtani and George Springer are the most recent winners.\nMartínez set the records for the highest batting average and on-base percentage in a designated hitter's winning season with his .356 and .479 marks, respectively, in 1995. Ohtani's slugging percentage of .654 in the 2023 season is the highest among all winners at the designated hitter position. Ohtani also holds the record for the most home runs hit in a Silver Slugger-winning season, with 55 set in 2025. Ortiz and Rafael Palmeiro hold the record for the most runs batted in in a Silver Slugger-winning season, with 148. Palmeiro set his record in 1999, and Ortiz tied it in 2005.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| Year\n| Links to the corresponding Major League Baseball season\n|-\n| AVG\n| Batting average\n|-\n| OBP\n| On-base percentage\n|-\n| SLG\n| Slugging percentage\n|-\n| HR\n| Home runs\n|-\n| RBI\n| Runs batted in\n|-\n| Ref\n| References\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#bbeeff\"| * or **\n| Winner of the most Silver Sluggers in Major League Baseball as a designated hitter (** indicates tie)\n|-\n| †\n| Member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum\n|}\nAmerican League winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
