It occupies a hilltop position in the Chiltern Hills about 2 miles south of Wendover.  Access is by two steep, single-track hillside lanes.\nThe place name is Anglo Saxon in origin, and means literally ''Dunna's moor.\nMuch of the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust and is heavily wooded with beech trees, and bracken.  Due to its elevation the village is occasionally cut off by treacherous road conditions during harsh winters.\nCentral features of the hamlet are the village pond, the village hall and the Church of the Resurrection, Dunsmore. In the past the village supported a shop and two public houses, The Fox and The Black Horse, but these have now closed and been converted into residential dwellings.\nDunsmore is close by to Chequers, the country retreat for the serving prime minister, and the local Second Boer War memorial on Coombe Hill, Buckinghamshire.  The memorial stands above Wendover in the Aylesbury Vale. There are many good, rural walks nearby.\nImage:Dunsmore.jpg|The village pond at Dunsmore.\nImage:BuncefieldFire.jpg|The smoke plume from the 2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire as seen from Dunsmore, Buckinghamshire, about 14 miles (23&nbsp;km) away.\nReferences\nExternal links"
