This treaty was signed months after the Battle of Montlhéry (13 July 1465), where the French dukes of Alençon, Burgundy, Berry, Bourbon and Lorraine fought King Louis to a standstill.\nDetails\nThe dukes forced King Louis to sign the agreement, which officially ended the League of the Public Weal. Based on the terms of the treaty, Normandy was restored to the Duke of Berry and Burgundy reclaimed the Somme towns, Boulogne and Ponthieu. The treaty confirmed female inheritance for Macon, Auxerre, Bar-sur-Seine, Boulogne, and the Somme.\nAftermath\nMonths later, King Louis declared to the Parlement at Paris that the treaties of Conflans and Saint Maur were null and void, having been signed under duress. Consequently, Louis would attempt to avoid the treaty, as well as to split the French dukes by diplomatic means.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061026180812/http://www.b17.com/family/lwp/chronology/1401_1500.html Chronology of More Recent Times 1401 A.D. to 1500 A.D.]\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03068a.htm The Catholic Encyclopedia - Burgundy]"
