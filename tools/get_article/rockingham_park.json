Notable horses to run at Rockingham Park included Seabiscuit, who raced there in 1935 and 1936, and Mom's Command, who ran in her first race and gained her first victory there in 1984.\nHistory\nOn June 28, 1906, a tiny outpost near the Salem train depot began a 21-day tenure as host to a Thoroughbred meet. Over 10,000 people from as far away as New York City flocked to the small New Hampshire town. Their rave reviews proclaimed the site \"the finest racecourse in the world\". Although Alyth, a two-year-old, won the first Thoroughbred race at the site, gambling was still illegal at the time in New Hampshire, and betting was shut down after three days. Underground wagering continued throughout the meet, but the track sat idle for five years after the meet's conclusion; however, these humble beginnings would lead to the formation of a staple of New England culture rich with the history of the \"sport of kings.\"\nIn between its stints as a racecourse, the site served as host to a number of historical occurrences. Before the return of racing, Rockingham Park hosted the first aviation meet in northern New England in 1911, where Lieutenant Milling set a new altitude record of  in his biplane.\nThe track served as the base for the 14th United States Army Corps of Engineers during World War I. The racecourse served as a bivouac for soldiers prior to voyages to France.\nThe New Hampshire Sweepstakes (now New Hampshire Lottery) was originated in 1964 and raced here from 1964 to 1967. The race was brought back in 1984 (though not connected with sweepstakes tickets) and was the feature event of the summer racing meet.\nIn 1973, New Hampshire native and popular local jockey Henry Wajda died as the result of a racing accident at Rockingham Park. Riding Zabush on July 28, 1973, Wajda fell from his mount after his right stirrup broke at the start of a race; he was kicked by the horse, and suffered a punctured lung. He died the next day following surgery in Methuen, Massachusetts.\nThe racetrack was idled again when on July 29, 1980, a fire destroyed the grandstand. The track remained closed until May 26, 1984.\nIn 1991, The Mall at Rockingham Park, which became the largest mall in northern New England, was constructed adjacent to the racetrack; owned and managed by Simon Property Group, it was not affiliated with the racetrack.\nRockingham Park also hosted simulcasting and charity gaming. The last live horse racing at the track occurred in 2009. Rockingham Park closed its doors for good on August 31, 2016, and was sold for redevelopment of the property. The racetrack was demolished in the summer of 2017. It was redeveloped as part of the Tuscan Village project.\nMotor racing venue\nThe establishment also hosted motorized racing. On July 4, 1925, the track was used for a  race with an average speed of . Motorcycle races were also held. With the success of the events, a  board track was built, sanctioned by the AAA, the most recognized sanctioning body of the day. A mechanic was killed in practice for the  Autumn Classic car race, which was staged on October 31, 1925. On August 21, 1926, M. L. \"Curly\" Fredericks, on an Altoona, set the record for the fastest speed () that a motorcycle would attain on an oval board track. In 1928, the track held the final motorcycle national championships to be competed on a board track. With the rotten wood removed, the 1929 Labor Day and Columbus Day auto races held at the restored dirt track drew 45,000 and 52,000 spectators, respectively.\nReferences"
