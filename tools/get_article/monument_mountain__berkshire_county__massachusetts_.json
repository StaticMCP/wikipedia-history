The only official trails on the mountain ascend Peeskawso Peak from a parking lot on Massachusetts Route 7 north of Great Barrington center. There is no fee for members of The Trustees and a parking fee of $6 for non-members. An unnamed waterfall is located to the northeast of Peeskawso Peak along the Hickey Trail.\nViews from Peeskawso Peak include the Housatonic River Valley, The Berkshires, the Taconic Mountains, and the Catskill Mountains of New York.\nThe west side of Monument Mountain drains into the Housatonic River thence into Long Island Sound. The east side of Monument Mountain drains into Konkapot Brook thence into the Housatonic River.\nIn August 1850, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. climbed Monument Mountain together.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://thetrustees.org/place/monument-mountain/ Monument Mountain] The Trustees of Reservations\n* [https://thetrustees.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MonumentMtn_TrailMap_2021.pdf Trail map]"
