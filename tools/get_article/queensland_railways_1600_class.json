Two contracts were let of which the first was for twelve with a follow on contract for another six. The first batch were delivered between December 1962 and June 1963, with the others arriving between October 1963 and January 1964. A lengthy delay occurred before delivery owing to the first four being over the design weight. This resulted in numbers 1604 and 1605 being the first to enter service. All others were delivered after the weight problem had been overcome.\nThey were initially based at Alpha in Central West Queensland and at Roma in South west Queensland. They were also used for shunting at yards around the state. Soon afterwards, all the 1600s were based at Alpha. The 1620 Class followed on from the success of the 1600s, and were used in the central and northern areas of Qld.\nThe class was withdrawn in 1991.\nFive have been preserved:\n*1603 by the Bundaberg Railway Historical Society\n*1604 by the Bellarine Railway, Queenscliff, Victoria\n*1613 by the Longreach Powerhouse Museum\n*1614 by the Australian Railway Historical Society at the Archer Park Rail Museum, Rockhampton\n*1616 by the Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway, Ipswich\nStatus table of preserved locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Number\n!In service\n!Withdrawn\n!Owner\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|1603\n|02/1963\n|1991\n|Bundaberg Railway Historical\nSociety\n|Bundaberg Railway Museum\n|Static  display.
