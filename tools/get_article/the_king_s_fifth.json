The title refers to the one fifth share of spoils expected by the Spanish Crown.\nPlot\nThe story takes place in a time when the Spanish adventurers, known as Conquistadors, colonised the New World of the Americas, in search of the mythical gold treasures of the dethroned Native Americans.\nCharacters:\n* Estéban de Sandoval: a teenage mapmaker to the expedition to Cibola to find the gold.\n* Zia Troyano: a younger teenage Native American guide.\n* Captain Blas de Mendoza (very loosely based on Antonio de Mendoza) - an aristocrat in search of gold.\n* Father Francisco: a priest to the expedition who joined as a missionary and an explorer.\n* Roa and Zuñiga: part of a trio of musicians who are Mendoza's cronies.\nInfluence\nWhile the book is sometimes cited as the inspiration for the cartoon TV series The Mysterious Cities of Gold, that show's creator, Jean Chalopin, has stated that only the names of its primary characters were drawn from the book.\nThe book is also a slight influence in the Choose Your Own Adventure Time Machine's 1987 book Quest for the Cities of Gold, as the reader meets Esteban at different points.\nAwards and nominations\n* Newbery Honor Book, 1967\n* Federal Republic of Germany Jugendbuchpreis, 1970\nReferences"
