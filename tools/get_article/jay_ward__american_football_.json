The Minnesota Vikings selected Ward in the fourth round of the 2023 NFL draft. He played college football for the LSU Tigers.\nEarly life\nWard was born in Moultrie, Georgia. He had two brothers who also played football up to the collegiate level. He attended Colquitt County High School and was one of the school's all-time best defensive backs, recording a career total of 11 interceptions. As a senior, Ward helped the team compile a regular season record of 14–0 before losing in the state championship. He also competed in track and field, winning a regional championship. A three-star prospect, he had initially committed to play college football for the Kentucky Wildcats, but then switched to the LSU Tigers.\nCollege career\nWard saw immediate playing time as a true freshman in 2019, appearing in 13 games during the team's national championship season, mainly on special teams. After being part of a defense that allowed a record-breaking 623 passing yards in the season-opening upset loss to the Mississippi State Bulldogs in 2020, Ward experienced limited action in the subsequent games; however, he rebounded by blocking what would have been a game-tying field goal at the end of regulation by Arkansas in Week 6. He then forced a fumble against Alabama, posted an interception against Florida, and made two interceptions against Ole Miss to conclude the season. By the end of the year, he had played nine games, recorded 29 tackles and scored one touchdown (off an interception against Ole Miss).\nIn 2021, Ward moved from cornerback to safety and started all 11 games, posting 71 tackles, six pass deflections, two interceptions and one forced fumble. In 2022, he saw action at safety, nickel cornerback and outside cornerback. He appeared in a total of 13 games that year, starting nine, and posted 60 tackles, in addition to one interception and a fumble return for a touchdown. After the season, Ward declared for the NFL Draft.\nProfessional career\n}}\nThe Minnesota Vikings drafted Ward in the fourth round, 134th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft. As a rookie, he appeared in all 17 games. He recorded one fumble recovery in the 2023 season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.vikings.com/team/players-roster/jay-ward/ Minnesota Vikings bio]\n*[https://lsusports.net/sports/fb/roster/player/jay-ward/ LSU Tigers bio]"
