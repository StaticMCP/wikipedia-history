Despite the series of defeats, Ukrainian army was reorganized. On 6 of June 1919, Ukrainian forces counterattacked and captured the city of Kamyanets together with Proskuriv and Starokostiantyniv. After the battle, Kamyanets-Podilskyi became the temporary capital of the UPR, on 3 of July, Mohyliv-Podilskyi was captured. Following the defeat in a war with Poland, Ukrainian Galician Army crossed the Zbruch river, which allowed to increase the size of UPR forces. At the end of July, the joint forces of Ukrainian People's Army and Ukrainian Galician army began an offensive with goal of capturing Kiev, which at the time was helt by Bolsheviks.\nBattle\nOn 22 of July, Ukrainian forces began a successful offensive, as a result of which, Vapniarka and the neighbouring cities of Tomashpil and Komarhorod were captured. However, the Bolsheviks counterattacked and recaptured a station later. On 26 of July, Ukrainians during their offensive captured the villages of Tsapivka and Kolodianka, while continuing their advance towards Vapniarka. Despite the fact that Bolshevik forces managed to temporarily halt the Ukrainian offensive, on the same day Ukrainian 7th Blue regiment captured Vapniarka station with a bold attack. Next days, the station has changed hands several times. On a night of 27-28 of July, the Reds began a counterattack, which forced the UPA to retreat. However, on the morning of the same day the station was again recaptured by the Ukrainians. Further Bolshevik attacks on the station continued until July 31 and were unsuccessful.\nAftermath\nThe victory at Vapniarka was a great success for the Ukrainian army, as it managed to significantly defeat the 45th Rifle division and capture the station, which was strategically important point of Ukrainian summer campaign. The 3rd Ukrainian division got it's nickname \"Iron Division\" after the capture of Vapniarka due to their bravery that was shown during the battle.\nReferences"
