The LSD includes the special service area of Oswald Gray.\nOrigin of name\nThe parish's name may be a shortening of King's Clearing, a reference to early clearing of forests in the area.\nHistory\nKingsclear was erected in 1786 as one of the county's original parishes. The parish ran twelve miles back into the country and included the islands in front of it in the Saint John River.\nIn 1845 Madam Keswick Island (Keswick Island and Mitchells Island) was transferred to Douglas Parish.\nIn 1850 the area behind Fredericton was included in the newly erected New Maryland Parish; Merrithews Island (Upper and Lower Shores Islands) was transferred to Douglas; and Kingsclear was extended back to the Charlotte County line.\nIn 1855 the rear of Kingsclear was included in the newly erected Manners Sutton Parish.\nIn 1867 Nevers Island and part of Sugar Island were transferred to Douglas.\nIn 1869 the 1867 changes were repealed.\nIn 1903 the 1867 changes were reinstituted.\nIn 1973 Nevers Island was returned to Kingsclear.\nBoundaries\nKingsclear Parish is bounded:\n* on the north by the Saint John River;\n* on the southeast by a line beginning on the Saint John River about 2.4 kilometres upstream of the Westmorland Street bridge and slightly downstream of Riverside Court, then running south-southwesterly along the prolongation of the western line of the University of New Brunswick Game Refuge and the Refuge itself to the rear line of Fredericton, then running southwesterly about 23 kilometres along the New Maryland Parish-Hanwell boundary to the northeastern line of Manners Sutton Parish;\n*on the southwest by a line running north 45º west, Available as a free ebook from Google Books. when declination in the area was between 19º and 20º west of north.
