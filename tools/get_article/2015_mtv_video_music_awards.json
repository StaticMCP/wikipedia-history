The 32nd installment of the event was held at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California, and hosted by Miley Cyrus. Taylor Swift led the nominations with a total of ten, followed by Ed Sheeran, who had six, bringing his total number of mentions to 13. Swift's \"Wildest Dreams\" music video premiered during the pre-show. Cyrus also announced and released her studio album Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz, right after her performance at the end of the show. During his acceptance speech, Kanye West announced that he would be running in the 2020 United States presidential election. Taylor Swift won the most awards with four, including Video of the Year and Best Female Video. The VMA trophies were redesigned by Jeremy Scott.\nThis 2015 edition was seen by 9.8 million people in the United States during its simulcast across ten Viacom-owned networks. However, the ceremony's airing on the flagship MTV network alone had one of the lowest audience in the ceremony's 31-year history (with the following year's ceremony being the lowest of all time). According to Nielsen, it logged 5.03 million viewers on MTV, 39% less than the previous year, while cumulative viewers drew 9.8 million with the nine other simulcasting networks. The lowest viewed edition since Nielson began tracking in 1994 was in 1996, with 5.07 million viewers. This broadcast, however, broke the \"US Twitter record\", being the most tweeted about non-sports program, with 21.4 million tweets delivered by 2.2 million people. It was also streamed live through the MTV app for authenticated users on mobile devices and television sets via iOS, Android and Chromecast. Through its website, viewers could also get to see un-aired audience shots and backstage coverage. mtvU aired a behind-the-scenes feed and MTV Hits went dark.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n!colspan=3|Pre-show\n|-\n| Walk the Moon\n| \"Shut Up and Dance\"\"Different Colors\"\n|-\n| Todrick Hall\n| Video of the Year nominees' covers (\"Uptown Funk\", \"7/11\", \"Bad Blood\")\n|-\n| Nick Jonas\n| \"Levels\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Main show\n|-\n| Nicki MinajTaylor Swift\n| \"Trini Dem Girls\" (Minaj)\"The Night Is Still Young\"\"Bad Blood\"\n|-\n| Macklemore & Ryan LewisEric NallyMelle MelKool Moe DeeGrandmaster Caz\n| \"Downtown\" (Live from outside The Orpheum Theatre)\n|-\n| The Weeknd\n| \"Can't Feel My Face\"\n|-\n| Demi LovatoIggy Azalea\n| \"Cool for the Summer\" (Live from outside The Orpheum Theatre)\n|-\n| Justin Bieber\n| \"Where Are Ü Now\"\"What Do You Mean?\"\n|-\n| Tori Kelly\n| \"Should've Been Us\"\n|-\n| Pharrell Williams\n| \"Freedom\"(Live from outside The Orpheum Theatre)\n|-\n| Twenty One PilotsASAP Rocky\n| \"Heavydirtysoul\"\"M's\"\"Message Man\"\"Lane Boy\"\"LSD\"\n|-\n| Miley Cyrus\n| \"Dooo It!\"\n|}\nPresenters\nPre-show\n*Sway and Kelly Osbourne – hosts\n*Kelly Osbourne and Jeremy Scott – presented Best Rock Video\n*Carly Aquilino, Charlamagne Tha God, and Vic Mensa – presented Best Pop Video\n*Awkwafina and Nessa – presented Song of Summer\nMain show\n*Nicki Minaj – introduced Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\n*Ike Barinholtz and Andy Samberg – appeared in a pre-taped skit with host Miley Cyrus\n*Britney Spears – presented Best Male Video\n*Jared Leto – introduced The Weeknd\n*Rebel Wilson – presented Best Hip-Hop Video\n*Tyga, Juicy J, Mike Will Made It and Billy Ray Cyrus – appeared in a pre-taped skit with host Miley Cyrus\n*Big Sean and Nick Jonas – presented Best Female Video\n*Hailee Steinfeld – introduced Demi Lovato outside The Orpheum Theatre\n*Serayah and Jussie Smollett – presented Best Video with a Social Message\n*Ne-Yo and Kylie Jenner – introduced Tori Kelly\n*Taylor Swift – presented Video Vanguard Award\n*John Legend – introduced Pharrell Williams outside The Orpheum Theatre\n*Rita Ora and Emily Ratajkowski – presented Artist to Watch\n*Miguel and Gigi Hadid – introduced Twenty One Pilots and ASAP Rocky\n*Ice Cube and O'Shea Jackson, Jr. – presented Video of the Year\n*Happy Hippie Foundation members – introduced Miley Cyrus\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominations were announced on July 21, 2015 via Apple Music's Beats 1.
