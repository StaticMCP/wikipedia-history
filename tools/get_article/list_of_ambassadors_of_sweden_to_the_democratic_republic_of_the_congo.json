Sweden was represented at the establishment of the new state by the head of the political division and a director at the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Sverker Åström, who, during the celebrations on 1 July 1960, in Léopoldville, conveyed the King's congratulations to the new state's president, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Åström also delivered a letter to Congo's Foreign Minister, in which the Swedish government welcomed Congo into the community of free nations and expressed hopes for the development of economic, cultural, and other relations between the two countries.\nSix months later, in January 1961, it was proposed in the government budget bill that the Swedish consulate in Léopoldville be replaced by an embassy. On 8 July 1962, the King in Council announced that Count Axel Lewenhaupt had been appointed as Sweden's ambassador to Léopoldville. In September of the same year, it was announced that an agreement establishing diplomatic relations between the governments of Sweden and the Republic of the Congo had been reached. Lewenhaupt, as Sweden's first ambassador to Congo, presented his credentials in October 1962.\nIn September 1981, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs proposed closing the embassy in Kinshasa. What remained was an embassy office managed by an ambassador based in another location. In November 1982, Ambassador Karl Henrik Andersson was reassigned to the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm while retaining his ambassadorial position for Kinshasa and other accredited posts. The embassy was now managed by a ''chargé d'affaires and an assistant, while the ambassador was stationed in Stockholm.\nIn August 1995, the Swedish government decided to close the embassy in Kinshasa, Zaire. The embassy officially closed on 15 December, as part of cost-saving measures implemented for the foreign service. In its place, an honorary consulate general was established in Kinshasa on 1 November 1995. Two years later, in October 1997, the Swedish government announced plans to reopen a Swedish embassy in Kinshasa. In February 1998, Eva Emnéus was appointed counselor at the embassy in Kinshasa. Her appointment in the spring reinstated the chargé d'affaires'' position, which had been vacant since December 1995. Three years later, a resident ambassador was once again accredited in Kinshasa.\nList of representatives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name||Period||Resident/Non resident||Title||Notes||Ref\n|-\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=6|Republic of the Congo (1960–1971)\n|-\n|Axel Lewenhaupt||1962–1963|| Resident||Ambassador||||\n|-\n|Dag Malm||1964–1967|| Resident||Ambassador||Also accredited to Cameroon, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo (all three from 1965).||\n|-\n|Olof Bjurström||1967–1971|| Resident||Ambassador||Also accredited to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea (from 1969), Gabon, and the People's Republic of the Congo.||\n|-\n|-style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=6|Republic of Zaire (1971–1997)\n|-\n|Henrik Ramel||1971–1976|| Resident||Ambassador||Also accredited to Cameroon (from 1972), Equatorial Guinea (from 1973), Gabon (from 1972), and the People's Republic of the Congo (from 1972).||\n|-\n|Ragnar Petri||1976–1979|| Resident||Ambassador||Also accredited to Cameroon, Gabon, and the People's Republic of the Congo (from three from 1977).||\n|-\n|Karl Henrik Andersson||1979 – November 1982|| Resident||Ambassador||Also accredited to Cameroon (from 1980) and Gabon (from 1980).||\n|-\n|Erik Häggström||1982–1985|| Resident||''Chargé d'affaires''||||\n|-\n|Karl Henrik Andersson||1983–1984|| Non-resident||Ambassador||Resident in Stockholm.
