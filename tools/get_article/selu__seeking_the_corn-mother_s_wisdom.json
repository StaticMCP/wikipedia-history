It uses poems, essays, and drawings to explore themes of unity and diversity.  Awiakta uses the Cherokee story of corn as a \"compass-story\" to keep readers oriented throughout her lessons.\nThe book draws on Cherokee storytelling traditions, the Appalachian landscape, and observations of contemporary society to provide \"tribal-specific, decolonizing lessons\".  She also uses the book to explore connections between her claimed Celtic, Scots-Irish, and Cherokee descent. Despite  self-identifying as having Eastern Band Cherokee heritage, Awiakta is not a citizen of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.\nBasketweaving\nAwiakta draws on Cherokee basket double-weaving traditions throughout the book.\nAdaptations\nSelu was later adapted into a Grammy-nominated audio recording.\nReferences"
