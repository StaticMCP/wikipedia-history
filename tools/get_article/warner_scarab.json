In military service the engine was designated R-420.\nVariants\n;Scarab S-50: A 7-cyl. air-cooled radial engine introduced in 1928.  With a bore and stroke of 4.25 inches and a compression ratio of 5.2:1, the Scarab developed  at 2,050 rpm from  with a dry weight of .\n;Scarab Junior:A 5-cyl. version introduced in 1930 developing  at 2,125 rpm from  with a dry weight of .\nin San Pelagio, Due Carrare, Province of Padua.]]\n;Super Scarab SS-50/50A: Increased cylinder bore to 4.625 inches to develop  at 2,050 rpm from  with a dry weight of .\n;Super Scarab SS-165: Increased compression ratio from 5.2:1 to 6.4:1 to develop  at 2,100 rpm with a dry weight of .\n;Super Scarab SS-185: Increased cylinder bore to 4.875 inches, developing  at 2175 rpm from , with a dry weight of .\n;R-420:Military designation of the Scarab.\n;R-500:Military designation of the Super Scarab 165.\n;R-550:Military designation of the Super Scarab 185.\n;145: Alternative designation for the Warner Super Scarab SS-50/50A .\n;165: Alternative designation for the Warner Super Scarab 165 .\n;185: Alternative designation for the Warner Super Scarab 185 (Primarily a helicopter application).\nApplications\nAmong the many uses for the Scarab, the engine was fitted to the Cessna Airmaster and the Fairchild 24 (UC-61 or Argus). Notably, in 1942, it was put into use powering the Sikorsky R-4, the first helicopter to be put into production.\nMany of these reliable engines soldier on today, still powering the aircraft to which they were originally mounted. The Warner 145 and 165 hp engines are the most commonly seen of the small radials for US-built pre-World War II era aircraft, in large part because of good parts availability due to the engines having been used on World War II Fairchild UC-61s and Meyers OTWs.\nWarner engines are also in demand as realistically sized, though far more powerful, replacement powerplants for many replica or restored World War I era airplanes which were originally fitted with rotary engines.\nApplication list\nSpecifications (Scarab 50)\nJane's all the World's Aircraft 1938\n|type=Seven-cylinder, air-cooled, radial piston engine\n|bore=\n|stroke=\n|displacement=\n|length=\n|diameter=\n|width=\n|height=\n|weight=\n|valvetrain=1 inlet and 1 exhaust valve per cylinder\n|supercharger=\n|turbocharger=\n|fuelsystem=Stromberg NA-5SA carburetor or Holley equivalent\n|fueltype=67 octane Avgas\n|oilsystem=Dry sump\n|coolingsystem=Air-cooled\n|power= at 2,050 rpm\n|specpower=\n|compression=5.15:1\n|fuelcon=\n|specfuelcon=0.55 lb/(hp hr) [0.334 kg/(kW hr)]\n|oilcon=0.025 lb/(hp hr) [0.015 kg/(kW hr)]\n|power/weight=0.43 hp/lb\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.oldengine.org/members/diesel/Duxford/usaero13.htm Oldengine.org - US Aero Engine data page]\n*[http://www.russellw.com/manuals/warner/default.htm Transcribed manual]"
