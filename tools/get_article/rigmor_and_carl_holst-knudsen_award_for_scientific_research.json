It was established in 1956, on the birthday of Carl Holst-Knudsen, who was at that time the chairman of the board at Aarhus University.  Originally worth 10 thousand Danish krones (DKK), it has grown to 100 thousand DKK in monetary value, and is awarded on 28 May annually. It is given without application \"as a mark of respect\", to a researcher who has produced one or more significant results which show promise in future research.\nAward Recipients since 2000\n*2012 : Professor Oluf Borbye Pedersen from The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen; Professor Timo Teräsvirta from CREATES, Department of Economics at Aarhus University\n*2011: Professor Lise Hannestad, Department of Anthropology, Archaeology and Linguistics; Professor Flemming Besenbacher, Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO)\n*2010: Professor Bjarne Stroustrup, Texas A & M University, College of Engineering Chair, Professor in Computer Science; Professor Poul Nissen, Department of Molecular Biology\n*2009: Professor Jens F.
