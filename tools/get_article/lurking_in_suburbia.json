Tyro writer-director Mitchell Altieri's thin, but occasionally engaging pic plods along a path well-trodden by indie filmmakers of the '90s, particularly Whit Stillman and Noah Baumbach, while never amassing the rich characterizations or pointed insights that have distinguished this genre's more memorable efforts.\"  Don R. Lewis of Film Threat rated it 4/5 stars and wrote, \"Lurking in Suburbia isn’t a perfect film, but it's a damn good one.\"  Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 4/5 stars and described it as \"a sly, personal, and low-key indie comedy that manages to become more accessible and likable the longer it goes on.\"  David Johnson of DVD Verdict called it \"an authentic, lighthearted, well-acted look at one guy's struggles with growing up.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
