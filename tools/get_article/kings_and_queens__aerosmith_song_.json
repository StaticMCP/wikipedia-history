It was written by Steven Tyler, Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, and Jack Douglas, their producer, who helped the band write many of the songs on Draw the Line. Douglas also played the mandolin featured in the song. The song first appeared on the album Draw the Line in December 1977 and was released as a single on February 21, 1978. The song was also used as a B-side to Aerosmith's version of The Beatles' \"Come Together\", released to promote the ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band film and soundtrack.\nLyrical meaning\nSteven Tyler said of \"Kings and Queens\" in the liner notes to Pandora's Box:\nReception\nCash Box said it has \"a big production, driving beat and cymbal work, tight vocals, guitars and a piano-bass interlude.\" Record World'' said that \"Steve Tyler's musings on European history make for an enjoyable hard-rock single.\"\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1978)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Canada (RPM100 Top Singles)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|76\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|70\n|-\n|}\nIn concert\nThe song was a staple of Aerosmith concerts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was included on the album Classics Live!. This version was also included on ''Pandora's Box.'' The band brought the song back into the set list during shows in Providence, Rhode Island and Anaheim, California in 2005 and 2006 on the Rockin' the Joint Tour, and in São Paulo, Brazil and Sölvesborg, Sweden in 2010 on the Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock Tour. It was played during the 2014 Jones Beach show.\nCovers and other versions\nThe song was included on the albums ''Aerosmith's Greatest Hits in 1980 and Greatest Hits 1973–1988 in 2004, but was considerably edited, with many of the guitar parts removed. This edited version is sometimes heard on radio, although many rock stations do play the full version.\n\"Kings and Queens\" is a master track in the game Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'' and is unlocked upon beating the last song, \"Train Kept A-Rollin\".\nGlenn Hughes recorded a version of the song in 2011.\nReferences"
