Although meant to be presented annually, there have been years where it was not presented.\nOriginally created by ACTRA in 1968 as a standalone award, the award was named in memory of Canadian actor John Drainie following his death in 1966, and was presented as part of the Canadian Film Awards ceremonies for its first four years. Beginning in 1972 it was presented as part of the expanded ACTRA Awards program.\nThe award was transferred in 1986 to the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television and presented as part of the Gemini Awards; the award was later transferred back to the ACTRA Awards in the 2000s, and presented as part of the Banff Television Festival.\nUnlike other awards which are voted on by the Academy's board of directors, the recipient of the John Drainie Award was selected by a committee of previous winners. Any branch of the Academy's Television Division may put forth nominations to the Drainie Committee for consideration.  The recipient receives a plaque with Drainie's likeness rather than a Gemini statuette. It was presented posthumously on some occasions but current ACTRA policy is to present this award to living people.\nWinners\nThe following people have won the award since 1968.\nCanadian Film Awards\n*1968: Esse Ljungh, W.
