Chaired by C. William Verity Jr. the Task Force included 44 members and 11 committees.  The Committee on Marshalling Human Resources, Frank Pace Jr., chairman, set an agenda to encourage increased commitment, recruitment, placement, and management of volunteers in community service and to enhance the atmosphere for volunteering.  VOLUNTEERS; A VALUABLE RESOURCE was prepared by the committee specifically for the use of policy makers.  The development of the publication was directed by Susan C. Kudlow, on loan from Call For Action, Inc., and was written by Thomazine Shanahan.\nThe task force was terminated 31 Dec 1982, as mandated in the Executive Order which created it.\nReferences\n*Andrew E Busch.
