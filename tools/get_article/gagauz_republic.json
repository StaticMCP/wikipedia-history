Two days later, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Moldavian SSR held an emergency meeting, and a decision was reached to declare the republic illegal and the congress unconstitutional. A detachment of Moldovan volunteers and police units were sent to Gagauzia to quell the dissidence, but the arrival of SSV soldiers prevented bloodshed.\nInitially, the republic was made up of five districts: Comrat, Ceadîr-Lunga, Vulcănești, Basarabeasca, and Taraclia.\nThe Gagauz Republic never declared itself formally independent, and only became a de facto independent state following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nOn 23 December 1994, on the basis of agreements reached by the Gagauz Republic and the Republic of Moldova, a document on the peaceful reintegration of Gagauzia, with rights of autonomy, was signed. It entered into force on 14 January 1995. The reintegration of Gagauzia was carried out from December 1994 to June 1995, when the Gagauz Republic legally dissolved and became the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia.\nArmed forces\nAs the Gagauzia conflict was developing and tensions between the Gagauz and the central government in Chișinău remained high, the Gagauz localities started establishing paramilitary structures such as the Budjak Battalion (; ) for their self-defense.\nSee also\n* Gagauzia\n* Gagauz people\n* Gagauzia conflict\n* List of Chairmen of the Gagauzian People's Assembly\n* Comrat Republic\n* Transnistria\nNotes\nReferences\n}}"
