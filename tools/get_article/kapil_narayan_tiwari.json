In 1965, Tiwari and MP Kishen Pattnaik filed a public interest litigation with the Supreme Court of India, requesting greater resources to deal with a drought in the Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, which forced the government to institute several special developmental projects in the area. Tiwari also organized relief centers for people affected by the drought. In 1974, he created the Rairakhol Bhimabhoi Krushak Sangharsa Samiti, an activist group affiliated with the National Alliance of People's Movements.\nPolitical career\nTiwari made his first run for the Orissa Legislative Assembly in the 1974 election, campaigning for the Khariar constituency as an independent candidate.

Tiwari was regarded as a leader in the socialist movement during his time in the assembly, and he raised awareness of issues such as child trafficking, poverty, starvation, and migration. Tiwari was also recognized for his \"great oratory skill\". At some point during his tenure, Tiwari joined the Indian National Congress (I).\nTiwari stood for re-election in 1980; however, he was defeated by independent candidate , receiving 31% of the vote compared to Deo's 40%. Another independent candidate, Duryodhan Majhi, placed third with 23% of the vote. In the 1985 election, Tiwari ran as an independent candidate in a rematch against Deo and Majhi.
