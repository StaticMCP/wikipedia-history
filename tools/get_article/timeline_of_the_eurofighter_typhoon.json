STOVL requirement dropped and AST-409 lead to the development of Harrier GR5.\n* Mid-1970s\n** France, Germany and the UK initiate the European Combat Aircraft (ECA) programme.\n* 1979\n** Following differing requirements (particularly French requirement for carrier compatibility,) BAe and MBB propose the European Combat Fighter (ECF)\n1980s\n* 1981\n** Development of different national prototypes and continued differences over specification lead to cancellation of ECF programme.\n** Panavia partners (Germany, Italy and UK) launch Agile Combat Aircraft (ACA) programme. Following failure of Germany and Italy to fund development the UK MoD pays £80m prototype, the Experimental Aircraft Programme (EAP).\n* 1983\n** May - contract for production of EAP prototype signed.\n** The UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain launch Future European Fighter Aircraft (F/EFA) programme. Aircraft to have short take off and landing (STOL) and beyond visual range (BVR) capabilities.\n* 1984\n** France reiterates requirement for carrier capable version. The UK, Germany and Italy opt out and establish new EFA programme.\n* 1985\n** France officially withdraws, commences ACX project.\n** 27 October - EAP demonstrator rolled out at BAe Warton.\n* 1986\n** June - Eurofighter GmbH established.\n** 8 August - EAP makes its first flight, piloted by David Eagles. Configuration closely matches final Eurofighter design.\n** Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines, FiatAvio (now Avio) and ITP form EuroJet Turbo GmbH for development of EJ200.\n* 1988\n** 23 November - contracts signed for production of demonstrator engines and airframes.\n1990s\n* 1990\n** EuroRADAR formed for development of ECR-90 (CAPTOR) radar.\n* 1991\n** 1 May - last flight of EAP demonstrator.\n* 1992\n** EuroDASS formed for development of defensive aids sub system (DASS.) Initially only UK and Italy participate. When Eurofighter enters service only RAF aircraft will exploit all capabilities of DASS.\n** July - Germany announces intention to withdraw from the DASS element. Negotiations begin to reduce costs. As a single engine aircraft is ruled out Germany decides to fit cheaper systems, e.g., F/A-18's APG-65 in place of ECR-90, and delay its service entry by two years. Germany eventually participates in all systems.\n** December - renamed Eurofighter 2000.\n* 1994\n** 27 March - maiden flight of first development aircraft, DA1 from DASA at Manching with RB199 engines.\n** 6 April - maiden flight of second development aircraft, DA2 from BAe Warton. DA2 also flew with RB199s.\n* 1995\n** 4 June - maiden flight of Italian DA3, the first with EJ200 engines.\n* 1996\n** 31 August - Spanish DA6 becomes the first two-seater to fly.\n* 1997\n** 27 January - first flight of DA7 from Turin.\n** 24 February - maiden flight of German DA5, first aircraft to be fitted with ECR-90.\n** 14 March - maiden flight of UK's DA4, the second two-seater and last of the seven development aircraft.\n* 1998\n** January - first aerial refuelling trials, involving DA2 and an RAF VC10 tanker.\n** 30 January - NETMA and Eurofighter GmbH sign production and support contracts for 620 aircraft.\n** September - \"Typhoon\" name adopted, announced as strictly for export contracts. There is some controversy as the last aircraft to bear the name was the Hawker Typhoon, a World War II aircraft.\n** 18 December - Tranche 1 contract signed.\n* 1999\n** Eurofighter International established as single contracting-management company to handle all export sales.\n2000s\n* 2000\n** 8 March - first export sale, 60 ordered and 30 options by Greece (but delayed, maybe cancelled).\n** 16 May - UK commits to MBDA Meteor BVRAAM, leading to significant benefits for export prospects.\n** 7 July - DA2 emerges from ten month stand down with latest avionics. Finished in black (see below) to reduce cosmetic effect of 490 pressure transducers applied to airframe.\n* 2002\n** 5 April - Instrumented Production Aircraft (IPA2) makes maiden flight from Turin.\n** 11 April - IPA 3 makes maiden flight from EADS Military Aircraft, Manching, Germany.\n** 15 April - IPA 1 makes maiden flight from BAE Warton.\n** 2 July - Austria announces acquisition of 24 Typhoons, later reduced to 18.\n** 23 July - \"Typhoon\" name officially adopted as in-service name by four partner nations.\n** 21 November - DA6, flying out of Getafe, crashes. Twin engine failure is blamed.\n* 2003\n** 13 February - first series production aircraft, GT001 flies from Manching. This is the first of Germany's 180 aircraft.\n** 14 February - in the space of just over an hour Italy's IT001 and Britain's BT001 make their maiden flights.\n** 17 February - Spain's ST001 flies from EADS Military Aircraft, Getafe, Spain.\n** 30 June - \"type acceptance\" signed, marking formal delivery of aircraft to the partner nations.\n**October - integration of Meteor begins.\n* 2004\n** 27 June - two RAF Typhoon T1s depart UK for Singapore for marketing and training.\n** 15 December - UK confirms purchase of second batch of 89 aircraft, the last nation to commit to \"Tranche 2\" production of 236 aircraft.\n* 2005\n**April - Singapore drops the Typhoon from its shortlist to supply the country's next generation fighter.\n** 16 December - the Aeronautica Militare Italiana (Italian Air Force) declares the Typhoon's initial operational capability and sets it on quick reaction alert from Grosseto Air Base.\n** 21 December - Saudi Arabia agrees to a purchase of an unspecified number of Typhoons with the UK Ministry of Defence.\n* 2006\n**January - first AMI operational squadron formed.\n**February - first operational mission undertaken by the Italian Air Force as Eurofighter Typhoon defends the airspace over Turin during the 2006 Winter Olympics.\n** 31 March - first RAF operational squadron formed.\n** 18 August - announcement of Saudi Arabia signing a contract to buy 72 planes from the UK.\n** 3 October - 100th production aircraft delivered.\n* 2007\n** 12 July - the first Eurofighter for Austria is delivered to the Austrian Air Force.\n* 2008\n** 16 January - the first Tranche 2 Eurofighter Typhoon makes its first flight.\n** 22 October - first flight of Typhoon in Royal Saudi Air Force livery.\n* 2009\n** 12 June - first Saudi Typhoons delivered.\n** 25 November - 200th Typhoon delivered.\n2010s\n* 2010\n** 24 August - a Spanish Eurofighter crashes in Spain, killing a Saudi pilot\n** 22 December - 250th Typhoon delivered.\n* 2012\n** 21 December - Oman orders 12 Eurofighter Typhoons.\n* 2013\n** 4 December - 400th Typhoon delivered.\n* 2014\n** 12 December - First full trial installation of Brimstone missile.\n* 2016\n** 5 April - Kuwait orders 28 Eurofighter Typhoons.\n** 13 July - Flights trials of E-Scan radar begin on Eurofighter Typhoon.\n* 2017\n** 11 April - 500th Typhoon delivered.\n2020s\n* 2020\n** November 2020 - Germany ordered 30 single-seater and 8 twin-seater new Tranche 4 fighters for 5.4 billion euro. The contract for new Tranche 4 versions is to replace Tranche 1 versions currently in service. The latest order from Germany secures production of Eurofighter Typhoon until 2030.\n* 2022-2023\n** Spain ordered 45 new Tranche 4 and 4+ (or Tranche 5 if available upon delivery) under the program Halcón in June 2022 and September 2023 for 6.5 billion euro.\nReferences"
