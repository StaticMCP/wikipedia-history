It was conceived by the Catholic Crosier missionary Frank Trenkenschuh in 1969 as a way to preserve traditional Asmat art as well as provide economic outlets to the Asmat people.  It was built by the Catholic Crosier Diocese of Agats-Asmat, which also owns the museum, and supported by Crosier Fathers and Brothers Bishop Alphonse Sowada, originally from Elmdale, Minnesota, US.\nThe American artist Tobias Schneebaum and Ursula and Gunter Konrad helped in establishing the museum and it officially opened on August 17, 1973.\nThe museum has catalogued approximately 1,200 items to its collection. Over 600 are on display, including over 300 sculptural pieces, ancestor poles, shields, and drums.\nLater, upon retiring to his native St. Cloud, MN, US area, Bishop emeritus Sowada was also instrumental in founding a second Asmat museum, the American Museum of Asmat Art which opened in 1995 at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, where it also appears under the acronyms AMAA and AMAA@UST.\nThe director of the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress, as of 2007, has been Eric Sarkol with John Ohoiwirin as assistant.\nBuilding upon a 1968–1974 United Nations funded Asmat wood carving project, the museum hosts an annual woodcarving competition and auction. The 31st Asmat Culture Festival sponsored by the Museum was scheduled for 8–13 October 2015.\nGallery\nFile:Museum Asmat (48280683281).jpg|Exterior of the museum, 2019\nFile:Spirit Masks (48285842547).jpg|Paper mulberry spirit masks\nFile:Asmat Carving.jpg|Asmat carving\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
