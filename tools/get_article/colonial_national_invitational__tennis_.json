The club hired Tut Bartzen as a tennis pro and made him responsible for hosting the tournament. The inaugural edition in 1962 was an amateur-only event. In 1967 it became a professional tournament, which meant that amateurs could not compete. The total prize money for the tournament that year was $15,000 and the first-prize, won by Rod Laver, was $1,700. The following year, 1968, a women's professional event was added which was won by Ann Haydon Jones. The tournament was part of the WCT Tour from 1971 to 1973 and was held on outdoor hard courts.\nFinals\nSingles\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"width:40px\"|Year\n!style=\"width:200px\"|Champions\n!style=\"width:200px\"|Runners-up\n!style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| 1962 ||  Roy Emerson ||  Chuck McKinley || 4–6, 6–2, 6–3\n|-\n| 1963 ||  Chuck McKinley ||  Ham Richardson || 6–3, 3–6, 10–8\n|-\n| 1964 ||  Rafael Osuna ||  Manuel Santana || 3–6, 6–3, 6–2\n|-\n| 1965 ||  Arthur Ashe ||  Fred Stolle || 6–3, 6–4\n|-\n| 1966 ||  Rafael Osuna ||  Cliff Drysdale || 6–2, 3–6, 6–3\n|-\n| 1967 ||  Rod Laver ||  Dennis Ralston || 8–6, 6–0\n|-\n| 1968 ||  Ken Rosewall ||  Andrés Gimeno || 6–4, 6–3\n|-\n| 1969 ||  Rod Laver ||  Ken Rosewall || 6–3, 6–2\n|-\n| 1970 ||  Rod Laver ||  Roy Emerson || 6–3, 7–5\n|-\n| 1971 ||  Rod Laver ||  Marty Riessen || 2–6, 6–4, 3–6, 7–5, 6–3\n|-\n| 1972 ||  John Newcombe ||  Ken Rosewall || 5–7, 1–6, 7–5, 6–4, 6–4\n|-\n| 1973 ||  Eddie Dibbs ||  Brian Gottfried || 7–5, 6–2, 6–4\n|}\nDoubles\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"width:40px\"|Year\n!style=\"width:200px\"|Champions\n!style=\"width:200px\"|Runners-up\n!style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score\n|-\n| 1962 ||  Rafael Osuna Antonio Palafox ||  Roy Emerson Fred Stolle || 6–1, 6–4\n|-\n| 1963 ||  Rafael Osuna Antonio Palafox ||  Ronnie Fischer   Cliff Buchholz || 6–3, 6–2\n|-\n| 1964 ||  Pierre Darmon Jean-Noël Grinda ||  José Luis Arilla   Manuel Santana || Not played, shared\n|-\n| 1965 ||  Arthur Ashe Ham Richardson ||  Roy Emerson Fred Stolle || 3–6, 14–12, 6–4\n|-\n| 1971 ||  Roy Emerson Rod Laver ||  Tom Okker Marty Riessen || 6–4, 7–5\n|-\n| 1972 ||  Tom Okker Marty Riessen ||  Ken Rosewall Fred Stolle || 6–2, 6–2\n|-\n| 1973 ||  Brian Gottfried Dick Stockton ||  Owen Davidson John Newcombe || 7–6, 6–4\n|}\nReferences"
