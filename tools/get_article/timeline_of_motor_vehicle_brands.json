      "text": "# Timeline of motor vehicle brands\n\nThis is a chronological index for the start year for motor vehicle brands (up to 1969). For manufacturers that went on to produce many models, it represents the start date of the whole brand; for the others, it usually represents the date of appearance of the main (perhaps only) model that was produced.\nThis also gives an idea of what motor vehicles were appearing on the streets in each country around each date (allowing, too, for imports from other countries). Moreover, by showing which models were contemporary, it gives a first indication of how individual designers were being influenced by each other, and a flavor of the entrepreneurial spirit and dynamics of the pioneering days of motor vehicle manufacture.\nWithin each year, and country of origin, the lists are structured according to the type of vehicle first introduced. These include the following types: steam, electric, hybrid electric, internal-combustion, touring car, roadster, tonneau, phaeton, cyclecar, light car, voiturette, runabout, high wheeler, buggy, tricar, motor quadricycle, motor tricycle, motorcycle, coach, bus, fire-engine, truck, tractor, racing car, avant-train.\nVeteran era\nAmédée père designed the Mancelle, which is regarded as the first automobile to be put into series production - 1878\n1852?\nRussia. Motorcycle: Alexander Leutner & Co.\n1860\nThomas Rickett's steam-powered car was particularly notable in the history of motor vehicle production inasmuch as several examples were made, and it was also advertised.\nUK. Steam: Rickett\n1861\nUS. Steam: Ware Steam Wagon\n1873\nThe Bollée family played a significant part in the history of motor vehicle manufacture; the father with his steam car, and one of his sons, in 1895, with an internal-combustion engine design.\nFrance. Steam bus: Amédée Bollée\n1880\nNetherlands: Spyker: carriages, later internal combustion.\n1883\n1885 Benz Tri-Car\nFrance. Steam: De Dion-Bouton (later internal-combustion, with a patent in 1889)\n1884\nFrance. Internal-combustion: Delamare-Deboutteville\n1885\nKarl Benz's vehicle was the first true automobile, entirely designed as such, rather than simply being a motorized stage coach or horse carriage. This is why he was granted his patent, and is regarded as its inventor. His wife and sons became the first true motorists, in 1889, when they took the car out for the specific task of paying a family visit.\nGermany. Internal-combustion: Benz\nUK. Internal-combustion: Butler\nUS. Electric: Armstrong Electric\nPanhard-Levassor (1890-1895). This model was the first automobile to circulate in Portugal\n1887\nUK. Motorcycle: New Imperial\n1889\nThe first Daimler car was a converted carriage, but with innovations that are still adopted today (cushioned engine mountings, fan cooling, finned-radiator water cooling).\nFrance. Steam: Peugeot (later internal-combustion, and the first to be entered in an organised race, albeit for bicycles, Paris–Brest–Paris)\nGermany. Internal-combustion: Daimler (DMG)\nUK. Internal-combustion: Santler\nUS. Internal-combustion rotary engine: Adams-Farwell\n1890\nPanhard and Levassor's design of a front-mounted engine established the layout of the majority of cars since then.\nFrance. Internal-combustion: Panhard-Levassor\n1891\nUS. Steam: Black; steam tractor: Avery; internal-combustion: Buckeye gasoline buggy\n1893\nFrance.

Internal-combustion: Laurin & Klement (later Škoda)\nUS. Electric: Morris & Salom\nUS. Internal-combustion: De La Vergne\n1896\nIn the UK, the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 replaced the hugely restrictive Locomotive Acts of 1861, 1865 and 1878 (the so-called Red Flag acts) thereby finally freeing up the automotive industry in the UK (and, incidentally, was also the origin of the celebrations of the first London to Brighton Veteran Car Run). Knight had been convicted under the old act, the previous year, for not having a man precede his vehicle with a red flag, and Walter Arnold was the first person to be convicted, in January 1896, for exceeding the speed limit. Meanwhile, Serpollet was issued with what was effectively the first driving licence.\n1896 Yakovlev-Frese\nFrance.
