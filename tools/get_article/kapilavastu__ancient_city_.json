King Śuddhodana and Queen Māyā are believed to have lived at Kapilavastu, as did their son Prince Siddartha Gautama (Gautama Buddha) until he left the palace at the age of 29.\nBuddhist texts such as the Pāli Canon say that Kapilavastu was the childhood home of Gautama Buddha, on account of it being the capital of the Shakyas, over whom his father ruled. Kapilavastu is the place where Siddhartha Gautama spent the first 29 years of his life. According to Buddhist sources the name Kapilvatthu means \"tawny area\", due to the abundance of reddish sand in the area. Most foreign accounts from the medieval period, particularly from China, described Kapilavastu as being part of \"Central India\".\nKapilavastu never became a major pilgrimage site like Buddha's birthplace at Lumbini not far away, which would have left unmistakable remains. The settlement was probably never as large as depictions in early Buddhist art suggest, and after the decline of Buddhism in India its location faded into obscurity. There are now two sites near the border between Nepal and India which are claimed as Kapilavastu — Piprahwa in Uttar Pradesh, India and Tilaurakot in Nepal. Finds at the Piprahwa (including a reliquary found inside a mud stupa) indicate Buddhist activity dating to the 5th–4th century BCE, around the time of the death of the Buddha.\nSearch for Kapilavastu\nThe 19th-century search for the historical site of Kapilavastu followed the accounts left by Faxian and later by Xuanzang, who were Chinese Buddhist monks who made early pilgrimages to the site. Some archaeologists have identified present-day Tilaurakot, Nepal, while others have identified present-day Piprahwa, India as the location for the historical site of Kapilavastu, the seat of governance of the Shakya state that would have covered the region. Both sites contain archaeological ruins. Those at Piprahwa show it was a significant early Buddhist site with a stupa and monasteries, and probably relics of the Buddha.\nProposed sites\nSuddhodana Palace-east gate.JPG|Proposed site of Suddhodanda's Palace at Tilaurakot\nFile:Stupas-Original-00020.jpg|Stupa at Piprahwa\nAncient depictions\nFile:Maya's dream Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern gateway.jpg|Maya's dream of an elephant during her conception of the Buddha, an identifier of the city of Kapilavastu.\nFile:Departure_of_the_Buddha_from_Kapilavastu_Sanchi_Stupa_1_Northern_Gate.jpg|The departure of the Buddha from Kapilavastu, Sanchi, Stupa 1, Northern Gate.\nNotable people\n* Puṇṇa Mantānīputta – one of the Buddha's ten principal disciples\n* Anuruddha – among the ten principal disciples and also a cousin of the Buddha\n* Rāhula – the only son of the Buddha\n* Ānanda – primary attendant of the Buddha and among the ten principal disciples\n* Sahajaśrī - 14th century CE Buddhist monk\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
