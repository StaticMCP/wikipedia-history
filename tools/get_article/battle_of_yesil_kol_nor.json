It was commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor of the Chinese Qing dynasty as part of an order of 16 large battle paintings (8 metres wide by 4 metres tall) to commemorate battles that took place in Qurman, in modern-day Tajikistan in February 1759. The battles resulted in the Qing Empire successfully regaining control of Xinjiang from the Turks who had occupied the province following the ousting of the Dzungar people from the region by Qing forces.\nReferences"
