Along with Cuba and Haiti, the Dominican Republic passport is considered the weakest passport in Latin America for traveling.\nControversy\nIn May 2001, Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of then North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il,  was arrested at Narita International Airport, in Tokyo, Japan, travelling on a forged Dominican Republic passport. He was detained by immigration officials and later deported to the People's Republic of China. The incident caused Kim Jong-il to cancel a planned visit to China due to the embarrassment caused by the incident.\nVisa requirements\nAs of 01 November 2025, Dominican Republic citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 72 countries and territories, ranking the Dominican Republic passport 71th (tied with Malawi) in terms of travel freedom, according to the Henley visa restrictions index.\nBiometric Passports\nIn 2023, the Dominican government announced that passports would go biometric by early 2024. Despite several promises by the Government, the Dominican Republic still doesn't have the biometric passport. In June 2024 the Government again promised the beginning of introduction of the biometric passports for February 2025. In January 2025 the president of the Dominican Republic Luis Abinader announced that the first biometric passports are expected to be introduced in August 2025. In May 2025 the Passport's General Directory announced that the biometric passports  will be introduced by the end of 2025. On 3 September 2025 the president of the Dominican republic Luis Abinader again announced that the biometric passports might be introduced by October 2025. As of November 2025 despite multiple promises by the government and the president of the Dominican republic there is no biometric passports available and any possible date of their introduction is unknown.\nSee also\n* Visa requirements for Dominican Republic citizens\n* [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/en/prado-documents/DOM/all/docs-all.html Dominicana passport information] on PRADO\n* List of passports\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.pasaportes.gob.do Dominican Republic's Passport Official Website]\n* http://translate.google.nl/translate?hl=nl&langpair=es|nl&u=http://jeantaveras.host56.com/2009/03/paises-los-que-no-se-requiere-visa-para.html"
