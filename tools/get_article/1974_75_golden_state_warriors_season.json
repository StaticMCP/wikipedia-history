After four seasons of second-place division finishes, the Warriors made various changes. Nate Thurmond was traded to the Chicago Bulls for Clifford Ray, a young defensive center.[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nba/goldst/gswarriors.html Golden State Warriors (1962–Present)] The club drafted Keith Wilkes (later known as Jamaal Wilkes), whose nickname was \"Silk\". Cazzie Russell had played out his option and joined the Los Angeles Lakers, leaving Rick Barry as the team's leader. Coach Al Attles implemented a team-oriented system that drew on the contributions of as many as ten players during a game. Barry scored 30.6 points per game, led the NBA in free throw percentage and steals per game, and was sixth in the league in assists per game.  The Warriors captured the Pacific Division title with a 48–34 record. This was the Warriors’ third championship, and first since they were in Philadelphia in 1956.\nIn the playoffs, the Warriors got to the Western Conference Finals by beating the Seattle SuperSonics in six games. In the Western Finals, the Warriors looked like they were about to lose to former teammate Nate Thurmond. The Warriors found themselves down against the Chicago Bulls 3 games to 2. The Warriors rallied to win Game 6 in Chicago and took the series with an 83–79 Game 7 triumph in Oakland. In the NBA Finals, the Warriors faced off against the Washington Bullets. The Warriors took the series in four straight games, including 1-point wins in Games 2 and 4.}} || F ||  || UCLA\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 29 || Phil Smith || G ||  || San Francisco\n|-
