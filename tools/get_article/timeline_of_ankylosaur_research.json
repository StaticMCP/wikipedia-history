Although formally trained scientists did not begin documenting ankylosaur fossils until the early 19th century, Native Americans had a long history of contact with these remains, which were generally interpreted through a mythological lens. The Delaware people have stories about smoking the bones of ancient monsters in a magic ritual to have wishes granted and ankylosaur fossils are among the local fossils that may have been used like this. The Native Americans of the modern southwestern United States tell stories about an armored monster named Yeitso that may have been influenced by local ankylosaur fossils. Likewise, ankylosaur remains are among the dinosaur bones found along the Red Deer River of Alberta, Canada where the Piegan people believe that the Grandfather of the Buffalo once lived.\nThe first scientifically documented ankylosaur remains were recovered from Early Cretaceous rocks in England and named Hylaeosaurus armatus'' by Gideon Mantell in 1833. However, the Ankylosauria itself would not be named until Henry Fairfield Osborn did so in 1923 nearly a hundred years later. Prior to this, the ankylosaurs had been considered members of the Stegosauria, which included all armored dinosaurs when Othniel Charles Marsh named the group in 1877. It was not until 1927 that Alfred Sherwood Romer implemented the modern use of the name Stegosauria as specifically pertaining to the plate-backed and spike-tailed dinosaurs of the Jurassic that form the ankylosaurs' nearest relatives. The next major revision to ankylosaur taxonomy would not come until Walter Coombs divided the group into the two main families paleontologists still recognize today; the nodosaurids and ankylosaurids. Since then, many new ankylosaur genera and species have been discovered from all over the world and continue to come to light. Many fossil ankylosaur trackways have also been recognized.\nImageSize  = width:1250px height:auto barincrement:15px\nPlotArea   = left:10px bottom:50px top:10px right:10px\nPeriod     = from:1830

returned with a piece of an ancient bone supposedly belonging to a monster that killed humans. One of the village's wise men instructed people to burn bits of the bone in clay spoons with tobacco and make a wish while the concoction was still smoking. This ritual could bestow such favors as success in hunting, long life, and health for one's children. This tale might be inspired by local fossils, which include ankylosaurs, Coelosaurus, Dryptosaurus, and Hadrosaurus.\n* Traditional Navajo creation mythology portrays modern Earth as the most recent of a series of worlds. They believe that the earlier worlds were inhabited by monsters that were killed with lightning bolts wielded by the heroic Monster Slayers. The most terrifying monster of the old worlds was the Big Gray Monster, Yeitso. The Navajo of Arizona feared fossil remains, attributing them to his corpse. They believe that Yeitso's ghost still haunts his remains. Yeitso's flint-like scales may have been inspired by the fossilized armored plates of various prehistoric creatures that once lived in what is now the western US. Ankylosaurs like Ankylosaurus are one such potential candidate for the source of Yeitso's armored hide. Others include non-ankylosaurs like the Permian amphibian Eryops, Triassic phytosaurs and Desmatosuchus, as well as other armored dinosaurs like Scutellosaurus or Stegosaurus.\n* The Piegan people of Alberta attributed the fossils of dinosaurs to the \"grandfather of the buffalo\" they left offerings of cloth and tobacco to this mythical creature near the Red Deer River. Ankylosaur remains are among those preserved in the area that helped inspire this legend and associated practice, as are the remains of ceratopsians, hadrosaurs, and carnivorous theropods.\n19th century\n]]\n1830s\n1832\n* Quarry workers discovered a fossilized partial skeleton. The remains were sent to paleontologist Gideon Mantell, who recognized that they represented a significant scientific discovery.\n* Mantell reported the specimen discovered by quarry workers that would later be formally named Hylaeosaurus to the Geological Society.\n1833\n* Gideon Mantell described the new genus and species Hylaeosaurus armatus. This was the first ankylosaur ever discovered, although the group itself would not be recognized and named for many years.\n1840s\n1842\nEarly April\n* Sir Richard Owen published his second report on British fossil reptiles, wherein he formally named the Dinosauria.

He also described the new genus and species Sauroplites scutiger, and the new genus and species Stegosaurides excavatus.\n1955\n* Nicholas Hotton regarded ankylosaurs as herbivores.\n1956\n* Maleev described the new species Dyoplosaurus giganteus.\n1960s\n1960\n* T. H. Eaton described the new genus and species Silvisaurus condrayi.\n1963\n* F. H. Khakimov discovered a new dinosaur track site in Shirkent National Park, Tajikistan.\n* Zakharov and Khakimov reported the dinosaur track site discovered by the latter to the scientific literature.\n1964\n* Zakharov described the new ichnogenus and species Macropodosaurus gravis. He attributed it to a theropod, but these tracks are more likely to have been produced by ankylosaurs.\n1969\n* Haas interpreted the ankylosaur diet and consisting of soft plants that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws based on their skull and tooth anatomy.\n1970s\n]]\n1970\n* John Ostrom described the new genus and species Sauropelta edwardsorum.\n1971\n* Walter Coombs published landmark research into ankylosaur taxonomy, bringing order to a once \"chaotic and confused\" field of study. He recognized two main groups of ankylosaurs, the Ankylosauridae and Nodosauridae. Coombs interpreted the ankylosaur diet as consisting of soft plants that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws based on their skull and tooth anatomy.\n* Haubold reported the presence of the ichnospecies Metatetrapous valdensis from the Buckeburg Formation of Germany. This ichnospecies is attributed to ankylosaurs.\n1972\n* Coombs observed that Euoplocephalus was so thoroughly armored that there was even a bony plate protecting its eyelids.\n1977\n* Teresa Maryanska described the new genus Tarchia for the species \"Dyoplosaurus\" giganteus. She also named the new species Tarchia kielanae and the new genus and species Saichania chulsanensis. She followed the scheme proposed by Coombs earlier that decade dividing the ankylosaurs into ankylosaurids and nodosaurids. She also made observations regarding ankylosaur limb posture, noting that while the hind limb was nearly straight up and down, the humerus was oriented at an angle downward and toward the rear of the animal. When studying the ankylosaur tail she noted that the centra of the vertebrae near its tip are fused, which would make it hard for the animal to raise the tail club very high.\n1978\n* Kurzanov and Tumanova described the new genus and species Amtosaurus magnus.\n* Coombs published more work on ankylosaur taxonomy. He noted that ankylosaurs were probably completely unable to walk on their hind legs and published further remarks on ankylosaur limb posture. He argued that while some researchers interpreted some aspects of ankylosaur forelimb anatomy as adaptations for digging, their hoof-like toe nails made this interpretation unlikely.\n1979\n* Coombs interpreted the bony tendons near the tip of the ankylosaur tail as a means to convey the forces generated by the tail musculature closer to the animal's body all the way down to its club.\n1980s\nat the National Dinosaur Museum, Canberra]]\n.]]\n1980\n*  Ralph Molnar described the new genus and species Minmi paravertebra.\n* Peter Galton described the new genus and species Dracopelta zbyszewskii.\n1982\n* Delair described the new genus Vectensia.\n1983\n* Tumanova described the new genus and species Shamosaurus scutatus.\n* Campbell reported the presence of dinosaur footprints in the Toro Toro Formation of Bolivia which he attributed to sauropods.\n1984\n* Kenneth Carpenter attributed the ichnogenus Tetrapodosaurus reported by Sternberg from British Columbia in the 1930s to ankylosaurs rather than ceratopsians. He argued that the most likely trackmaker was Sauropelta.\n* Leonardi described the dinosaur footprints reported by Campbell the previous year in detail and named them Ligabuichnium bolivianum. Rather than sauropods, Leonardi argued that these tracks were produced by ankylosaurs or ceratopsians although it was difficult ascertain which of these taxa were responsible due to the poor preservation of the tracks.\n1986\n* Galton interpreted the ankylosaur diet and consisting of soft plants that ankylosaurs chewed with a simple straight-up-and-down movement of the jaws based on their skull and tooth anatomy.\n1987\n* Paul Ensom described dinosaur footprints from the Purbeck Beds of England once thought to have been left by sauropods. They are now thought to have been left by ankylosaurs.\n* Tumanova erected the new genus Maleevus to house the species Syrmosaurus disparoserratus. Tumanova followed the scheme proposed by Coombs earlier that decade dividing the ankylosaurs into ankylosaurids and nodosaurids.\n* Gasparini and others reported ankylosaur remains from Antarctica.\n1988\n* Robert Bakker described the new genus and species Denversaurus schlessmani. He also erected the new genus Chassternbergia for the species \"Edmontonia\" rugosidens.\n1989\n* Currie reported the discovery of a Tetrapodosaurus track from British Columbia. Although he could not confidently identify its stratigraphic origin, the rock preserving the tracks has since been attributed to the Dunvegan Formation.\n* A worker at the Smoky River Coal Mine near Grande Cache, Alberta alerted the Royal Tyrell Museum to the presence of dinosaur footprints in the area. This site would come to be recognized as the most important ankylosaur track site in the world.\n1990s\nat the Wyoming Dinosaur Center]]\n1990\n* Coombs and Maryanska remarked that the boney secondary palate of the ankylosaur skull would have strengthened it by acting as a brace.\n* A well-preserved skeleton of Minmi'' was excavated from the Allaru Formation in Queensland, Australia by the Queensland Museum and catalogued as QM F18101. The skeleton was mostly articulated, including its armor. Since most ankylosaur specimens do not preserve the life arrangement of their armor, QM F18101 represented a rare find. The specimen also preserved the animal's gut contents, the first to be discovered in any armored dinosaur.\n1991\n* Lockley argued that the supposed sauropod tracks reported by Ensom from the Purbeck Beds of Dorset, England were actually made by ankylosaurs.\n* Frank  DeCourten discovered dinosaur tracks preserved in the Cedar Mountain Formation of Utah that were likely produced by ankylosaurs.\n1993\n* Tumanova described the new genus and species Tsagantegia longicranialis.\n* Jerzykiewicz and others reported the presence of borings of unknown cause on the bones of some juvenile Pinacosaurus grangeri from Bayan Mandahu, Inner Mongolia, China.\n* Z. Dong described the new genus and species Tianchisaurus nedegoaperferima.\n* Thulborn proposed that the tail club of ankylosaurs may actually have functioned as a \"false head\" meant to distract predators. However, this hypothesis has not received much support from the paleontological community, and has been criticized as \"dubiou[s]\".\n* Grady published an illustration of an ankylosaur trackway from the \"Mine\" site in the Smoky River Coal Mine at Grande Cache, Alberta.\n1994\n* Kirkland and Carpenter described the new genus and species Mymoorapelta maysi.\n* Psihoyos and Knoebber described a dinosaur track site in the Smoky Hill Coal Mine of Grande Cache, Alberta and reported that the site had been destroyed in a rock slide.\n* Whyte and Romano described the new ichnogenus and species Deltapodus brodericki for dinosaur footprints discovered in the Aalenian-Bajocian Saltwick Formation of Yorkshire, England. The authors attributed the tracks to sauropods, but they may actually have been made by ankylosaurs.\n* Leonardi concluded that the Bolivian Ligabuichnium tracks were made by an ankylosaur after all.\n1995\n* Carpenter, Dilkes, and Weishampel erected the new genus Niobrarasaurus to house the species Hierosaurus coleii.\n* Coombs studied the anatomy of the tail of Euoplocephalus and concluded that its club was held just slightly off the ground rather than dragging or held and a significant height. He reiterated observations previously made in 1977 by Maryanska that the fusion of the vertebral centra near the tip of the animal's tail would make it difficult to raise very high.\n* Coombs described the new genus and species Texasetes pleurohalio.\n1996\n* Lee described the new genus and species Pawpawsaurus campbelli.\n* Molnar reported the existence of a second species of Minmi but did not name it.\nat the North American Museum of Ancient Life]]\n* Blows described the new species Polacanthus rudgwickensis''.\n1997\n* Witmer studied archosaur \"craniofacial pneumaticity\". He concluded that rather than performing a biological function, paranasal sinuses in archosaurs \"are best explained as an optimization of skull architecture\". This cast doubt on various researchers' interpretations of the sometimes complex nasal cavities and sinus systems possessed by ankylosaurs. Past workers had thought that these cavities and sinuses may have given ankylosaurs an improved sense of smell, housed glands, acted as a resonating chamber for loud vocalizations, or helped conserve body heat and moisture.\n1998\n* Carpenter, Miles, and Cloward described the new genus and species Gargoyleosaurus parkpinorum.\n* Kirkland described the new genus and species Gastonia burgei.\n]]\n* Pang and Cheng described the new genus and species Tianzhenosaurus youngi.\n* Barret and others described the new genus and species Shanxia tianzhensis.\n* Sereno defined the ankylosaurs as all eurypods more closely related to Ankylosaurus than to Stegosaurus.\n* McCrea and Currie described the dinosaur tracks discovered in the Smoky River Coal Mine at Grand Cache, Alberta. They noted that this was the most important ankylosaur track site ever discovered.\n* McCrea and others reported the first known ankylosaur skin impression to be preserved in a footprint tracks preserved in the Dunvegan Formation near Pouce Coupe, Alberta.\n1999\n* Godefroit and others described the new species Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus.\n* Sullivan described the new genus and species Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis.\n* Carpenter and others described the new genus and species Animantarx ramaljonesi.\n* Lockley and others described the 1991 possible ankylosaur footprint discovery in Utah.\n* Ishigaki reported possible ankylosaur footprints from the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia.\n21st century\n2000s\n]]\n2000\n* Ford described the new species Edmontonia australis and the new genus and species Glyptodontopelta mimus.\n* Molnar and Clifford reported fossilized gut contents in a specimen of Minmi, which consisted of plant matter.\n2001\n* Rybczynsky and Vickaryous studied the jaws and teeth of Euoplocephalus. Contrary to decades of support for ankylosaurs chewing with a simple straight-up-and-down movement, they noticed visible wear facets and microscopic grooves that could only be explained by relatively complex jaw movements.\n* Barrett reported wear facets on the teeth of Tarchia.\n* Molnar and Clifford described the gut contents preserved in a specimen of the Australian ankylosaur Minmi. This specimen is catalogued by the Queensland Museum as QM F18101 and was excavated by the museum from near the Flinders River in 1990. The stomach contents consisted of plant vascular tissue, fruiting bodies, seeds, and possible fern spores. Molnar and Clifford described it as the most reliable evidence for the diet of an herbivorous dinosaur ever discovered.\n* McCrea, Lockley, and Meyer observed that by this point in the history of ankylosaur research, ankylosaurs track fossils had been reported from North America, South America, Asia, and Europe. Most of these trackways were preserved in moist floodplain habitats where plant life was abundant. They attributed the Metatetrapous valdensis tracks from the Buckeburg Formation of Germany reported by Haubold in 1971 to ankylosaurs. They similarly argued that Macropodosaurus gravis of Tajikistan was produced by an ankylosaur rather than a theropod. The authors reported a single possible ankylosaur footprint from the Dakota Group of Baca County, Colorado. They also proposed that several footprint specimens collected from the Blackhawk Formation of Utah may have been ankylosaurian.\n* Vickaryous and others described the new genus and species Gobisaurus domoculus.\n* Carpenter and others described the new genus and species Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum.\n* Xu, Wang, and You described the new genus and species Liaoningosaurus paradoxus.\n]]\n* Ford and Kirkland described the new genus and species Aletopelta coombsi.\n2002\n* Dong described the new genus and species Crichtonsaurus bohlini.\n* Averianov described the new genus and species Amtosaurus archibaldi.\n2003\n* Garcia and Pereda-Superbiola described the new species Struthiosaurus languedocensis.\n* Vickaryous and Russell described the common ways ankylosaur skulls were distorted after death that could potentially confound anatomical interpretation. They noted a relationship between this tendency to suffer distortion and their unusual cranial traits like the fusion of the skull bones and their \"embossing\" cranial ornamentation.\n2004\n* Averianov, 2002, vide Parish & Barrett, 2004 described the new genus and species Bissektipelta archibaldi.\n]]\n2005\n* Ősi described the new genus and species Hungarosaurus tormai.\n2006\n* Salgado and Gasparini described the new genus and species Antarctopelta oliveroi.\n2007\n* Lü Junchang; Jin Xingsheng; Sheng Yiming; Li Yihong described the new genus and species Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis.\n* Xu and others described the new genus and species Zhongyuansaurus luoyangensis.\n2008\n* Carpenter and others described the new genus and species Peloroplites cedrimontanus\n* Burns synonymizes Edmontonia australis with Glyptodontopelta mimus and confirms the validity of the latter\n]]\n2009\n* Miles and Miles described the new genus and species Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani.\n* Parsons and Parsons described the new genus and species Tatankacephalus cooneyorum.\n* Arbour and others resurrect the genus and species Dyoplosaurus acutosquameus Parks, 1924\n2010s\n2011\n* Burns and Sullivan described the new genus and species Ahshislepelta minor.\n* Burns and others describe new juvenile specimens of Pinacosaurus grangeri\n* Stanford, Weishampel, and DeLeon described the new genus and species Propanoplosaurus marylandicus.\n]]\n2013\n* Chen and others described the new genus and species Dongyangopelta yangyanensis.\n* Kirkland and others described the new genus and species Europelta carbonensis.\n* Penkalski described the new genus and species Oohkotokia horneri.\n* Yang and others described the new genus and species Taohelong jinchengensis.\n2014\n* Han and others described the new genus and species Chuanqilong chaoyangensis.\n*Arbour and Currie described the new genus Crichtonpelta.\n* Victoria M.
