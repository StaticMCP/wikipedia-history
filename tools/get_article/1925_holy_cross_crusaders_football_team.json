In its seventh season under head coach Cleo A. O'Donnell, the team compiled an 8–2 record and defeated Harvard for the first time in school history.\nThis was the first team to be named the \"Holy Cross Crusaders\", as the college adopted its first official team name by a vote of the student body in October 1925. \"Crusaders\" was the overwhelming favorite in a three-way race, with 143 votes, beating \"Chiefs\" (17) and \"Sagamores\" (7). The poll was conducted by The Tomahawk, the student weekly newspaper. Though the Tomahawk noted that this was the college's first official athletic nickname, newspapers had been referring to Holy Cross teams as \"the Purple\" for years.\nThe team played its home games at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n|October 3||St. John's|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 9-6||\n|October 12||Providence|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 22-0||\n|October 17|at|Harvard|Harvard Stadium|Boston, MA|W 7-6|50,000|\n|October 24|at|Vermont|Centennial Field|Burlington, VT|W 47-3||\n|October 31||Bucknell|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 23-7||\n|November 7|at|Fordham|Polo Grounds|New York, NY|L 0-17|25,000|\n|November 14||Rutgers|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 6-0||\n|November 21||Boston University|Fitton Field|Worcester, MA|W 48-7||\n|November 28|at|Boston College|Braves Field|Boston, MA|L 6-17|47,000|\n}}\nReferences"
