Dutch and international participants are judged by an international jury, with winners receiving 25.000€ each to further realise their bioart research projects. The most recent edition of the annual award to date took place in 2024.\nOverview\nThe first bioart and design competition took place in 2010 under the name Designers & Artists 4 Genomics Award (DA4GA) which it kept until 2013. Since then the award has collaborated with various Dutch art and cultural research institutions, including the Netherlands Genomics Initiative, Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Centre for Society & Genomics, ZonMw, NWO, Mu Hybrid Art House, Waag Futurelab, Bio Art Laboratories, and other educational partners.\nThe award matches recent art and design graduates with researchers to create bioart projects that can then be entered and exhibited as part of the competition. After participating in a matchmaking event, teams consisting of both artists and researchers propose their projects to an international jury. The three winning teams receive the price money of 25.000€ and have six months to create their bioart pieces, which are then exhibited at the end of the year.\nScience communication and impact study\nIn 2017, an impact study was conducted on the science communication potential and influence on the artistic and research creations by participants of the award. It uses a mixed methods approach consisting of a survey and interviews with everyone involved in setting up, judging and participating in the competition. The study revealed that participating in the competition as a researcher made them re-evaluate their own approaches to scientific thinking towards a more art-based, interdisciplinary way. Additionally, the collaboration between recently graduated design and art students and life sciences researchers fostered a development of new scientific tools and research methodologies. The study was published again in a book about the award in 2022 by design writer William Myers.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+All recorded winners and projects of the Bioart & Design Award\n!Year\n!Winners\n!Artwork Title\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2010\n|Jalila Essaïdi with Marcel Piët\n|Bulletproof Skin: 2.6g 329m/s\n|-\n|Maurizio Montalti with Prof. Dr. Han Wösten\n|System Synthetics\n|-\n|Matthijs Munnik with Richard de Boer\n|Microscopic Opera\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2011\n|Tiddo Bakker with Henk Jalink & Rob van der Schoor\n|In Vena Verbum\n|-\n|Center for Genomic Gastronomy\n|Eat Less, Live More – and Pray for Beans\n|-\n|Susana Cámara Leret & Mike Thompson with Jan van der Greef\n|Aqua Vita\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2012\n|Charlotte Jarvis with Christine Mummery, Christian Freund & Harold Mikkers\n|Ergo Sum\n|-\n|Haseeb Ahmed with Jos Kleinjans\n|Fish Bone Chapel\n|-\n|Laura Cinti & Howard Boland with Bela Mulder & Tom Shimizu\n|Living Mirror\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2014\n|Studio PSK with Jan Komdeur\n|The Economics of Evolution: The Perfect Pigeon\n|-\n|Špela Petrič with Klaas Timmermans\n|Naval Gazing\n|-\n|Julia Kaisinger & Katharina Unger with Prof. Dr. Han Wösten & Kasia Lukasiewiecz\n|Fungi Mutarium (Growing Food From Toxic Waste)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2015\n|Emma Dorothy Conley with Guus Roeselers\n|MSA: Microbiome Security Agency\n|-\n|Isaac Monté with Toby Kiers\n|The Art of Deception\n|-\n|Agi Haines with Marcel de Jeu & Jos van der Geest\n|Drones with Desires\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2016\n|Lilian van Daal & Roos Meerman with Renée van Amerongen\n|Dynamorphosis, the beauty of inner mechanisms\n|-\n|Pei-Ying Lin with Miranda de Graaf\n|Tame is to Tame\n|-\n|Cecilia Jonsson with Rodrigo Leite de Oliveira\n|Haem\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2017\n|Jiwon Woo with Prof. Dr. Han Wösten\n|Mother’s Hand Taste (Son-mat)\n|-\n|Xandra van der Eijk with Han Lindeboom\n|Seasynthesis\n|-\n|Guo Cheng with Heather Leslie\n|A Felicitous Neo-Past\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2018\n|Baum & Leahy with Stefan Schouten, Julie Lattaud, Laura Schreuder and Gabriella Weiss\n|Microbiocene: Ancient ooze to future myths\n|-\n|Ani Liu with Mario Maas, Matthias Cabri and Onno Baur\n|No regrets for what you haven't been, Be the ghost you want to see in the machine\n|-\n|Yiyun Chen with Patrick Schrauwen & Vera Schrauwen-Hinderling\n|Horizontal Living\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2019\n|Jonathan Ho & Joris Koene\n|Sex Shells\n|-\n|Emma van der Leest, Aneta Schaap-Oziemlak, Paul Verweij & Sybren De Hoog\n|\n|-\n|Michael Sedbon & Raoul Frese\n|CMD: Experiments in Bio-Algorithmic-Politics\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2020\n|Nadine Botha with Henry de Vries\n|The Orders of the Undead\n|-\n|Sissel Marie Tonn with Heather Leslie & Juan Garcia Vallejo\n|Becoming a Sentinel Species\n|-\n|Dasha Tsapenko with Prof. Dr. Han Wösten\n|Fur_tilize\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2022\n|Nonhuman Nonsense with Marte Stoorvogel\n|Mud & Flood: The Return of Nehalennia\n|-\n|Marlot Meyer with Marcel de Jeu & Jos van der Gees\n|Hacking Heuristics\n|-\n|Kuang-Yi Ku with Henry de Vries\n|Filthy Anatomy\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2023\n|Anna Vershinina with Wieger Wamelink\n|ExoGarden 3D-Printed Modular Eco-Habitats for Earth and Space\n|-\n|pamela varela & ella hebendanz with Joris Koene\n|re-c(O)unting: bodies, stories, laboratories\n|-\n|Hung Lu Chan & Floris de Lange\n|Close Encounters with Inner Aliens\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2024\n|Carla Alcalà Badias & Laura Villanueva\n|Microbial Prophetesses\n|-\n|Emilia Tapprest & Samar Khan\n|Ecotonal Beings\n|}\nExternal links\n* [https://www.badaward.nl/ Bio Art & Design Award] - official website\nReferences"
