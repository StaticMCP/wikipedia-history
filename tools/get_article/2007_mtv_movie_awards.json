The ceremony featured performances by Rihanna featuring Jay-Z, who performed \"Umbrella\", and Amy Winehouse, who performed \"Rehab\". It was the first MTV Movie Awards show broadcast live to American audiences, and it was located at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California.\nMark Burnett directed the show and executive produced this year's ceremony. Nominees were announced on April 30, 2007, and the voting for the main categories ran until the end of May.\nA pre-recorded movie parody included Sarah Silverman re-enacting with the characters from Babel, Dreamgirls, The Pursuit of Happyness, The Departed, 300, The Devil Wears Prada, and Transformers.\nSarah Silverman repeatedly made negative jokes towards Paris Hilton, which caused mixed reactions from the general audience. The audience at the Gibson Amphitheatre, however, were cheering after Silverman stated that Paris was going to jail very soon. In 2011, it was reported that Sarah apologized to Paris for joking about her prison time.\nThe pre-show was the subject of a rather vociferous ad campaign for the upcoming summer flick Transformers (distributed by Paramount Pictures, a subsidiary of Viacom, which also owns MTV), which included an extended interview with star Shia LaBeouf, several sneak previews, a \"real-life\" example of a car used in the movie, etc. The focus on the film was further reinforced when the film won in the category \"Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen Yet.\" The pre-show also included Hilton's last interview before entering jail.\nPerformers\n* Rihanna featuring Jay-Z — \"Umbrella\"\n* Amy Winehouse — \"Rehab\"\nPresenters\n* Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Ioan Gruffudd — presented Best Villain\n* Bruce Willis and Justin Long — presented Best Fight\n* Dane Cook — presented Movie Spoof Finalists\n* Chris Tucker and Victoria Beckham — introduced Rihanna and Jay-Z\n* Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Jessica Biel — presented Best Kiss\n* Web Wall Viewer, Kathy — presented Breakthrough Performance\n* Robin Williams, Mandy Moore, and John Krasinski — presented Best Comedic Performance\n* Cameron Diaz —  presented the MTV Generation Award\n* Samuel L.
