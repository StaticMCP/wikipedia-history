Based on the U.S. cable network of the same name, the channel focuses primarily on programming related to nature, science, and technology.\nHistory\nDiscovery is one of five specialty networks that were relaunched by Rogers on January 1, 2025, after the June 2024 announcement that it had acquired the rights to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) factual and lifestyle brands. The channel succeeds a previous iteration of Discovery Channel that was majority-owned by Bell Media; this channel rebranded as USA Network on January 1, transitioning to a general entertainment format that maintains some of the network's previous factual programming.\nReferences"
