While Scherer's army was on a foraging expedition, Urrutia believed that his army was under attack. The Spanish general quickly massed his troops and assaulted the French center, forcing it to withdraw. Bàscara is located  north of Girona, Spain. The fighting occurred during the War of the Pyrenees, part of the War of the First Coalition.\nUnder the command of Catherine-Dominique de Pérignon, the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees won a great victory at Black Mountain and captured two fortresses. However, subsequent operations were not successful and Pérignon was replaced by Schérer. The French government ordered the army to stand on the defensive. Though the French were beaten, Pierre Augereau's right flank division prevented a Spanish pursuit. Not long after the inadvertent action at Bàscara, the Peace of Basel was signed and the war ended.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
