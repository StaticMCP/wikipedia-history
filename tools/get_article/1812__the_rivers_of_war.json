      "text": "# 1812: The Rivers of War\n\n1812: The Rivers of War is a 2005 alternate history novel by American writer Eric Flint.\nThe book was originally published in hardcover as simply The Rivers of War. In 2006, the text was made available at the Baen Free Library.\nPlot\nThe story, which takes place in 1814–15, centers around an alternate historical version of the War of 1812. The point of divergence occurs at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in March 1814, where Sam Houston, who was seriously injured in real history, sustains only a minor injury and is able to continue fighting. This leads to many changes down the line, culminating in the formation of the Confederacy of the Arkansas.\nReception\nPublishers Weekly gave the book a positive review, stating, \"Flint (1632) offers historical figures rarely seen in fiction, such as James Monroe, in pre-Doctrine days, and the British general Robert Ross (not killed outside Baltimore); thorough scholarship in Napoleonic-era warfare; and strong, credible women. Fans will cheer even louder if this outstanding start turns out to be the first of a long saga.\"\nThe first published sequel is 1824: The Arkansas War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sfsite.com/09a/rw207.htm SF Site review]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017105615/http://cms.riversofwar.com/?page_id=4 ericflint.net: \"About the Rivers of War\"] (afterword by Eric Flint)"
