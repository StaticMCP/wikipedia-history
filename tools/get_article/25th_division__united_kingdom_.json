It served on the Western Front for most of the war.\nUnit history\n. The men are from 'A' Company, 11th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment.]]\nThe component units of the division were assembled around Salisbury and moved to Aldershot in May 1915 to complete their training. The division was formed by Major-General Francis Ventris and crossed to France from 25 to 30 September 1915 under the command of Major-General Beauchamp Doran, a former brigade commander in the British Expeditionary Force in the early days of the war. The division comprised the 74th, 75th and 76th Infantry Brigades but the 76th Brigade was posted away on 15 October 1915 and replaced by the 7th Infantry Brigade from the 3rd Division. In June 1916 Major-General Guy Bainbridge took command and the division went on to fight at the Battle of the Somme, at the Battle of Messines, at the Battle of Passchendaele, in the German spring offensive of March–April 1918 and at the Third Battle of the Aisne.\nThe 25th Division was unlucky during the 1918 German Spring Offensives, being attacked three times (sharing its misfortune with the 19th (Western) Division, the 21st Division and the 50th (Northumbrian) Division). It was on the northern flank defences during Operation Michael in March 1918 and was moved north to refit. There it lost more men in the Battle of the Lys in April. Moved south to another quiet area, it was attacked for a third time in the Third Battle of the Aisne.\nAfter suffering severe casualties in June 1918, the division underwent a refit and reorganisation, receiving infantry from divisions then serving in Italy. The reformed division moving back to France in September 1918. The division played a major role in the final few weeks of the war its most noted success was the capture of the village of Beaurevoir on 5–6 October 1918. The war came to an end over a month later with the signing of the armistice of 11 November 1918. The division was demobilised by the end of March 1919, having suffered 48,300 casualties during the war.\nGeneral officers commanding\n{| class=\"wikitable\"width=\n|+GOC\n|-\n!style=|Rank\n!style=|Name\n!style=|Dates\n|-\n| Major-General\n| Francis Ventris\n| 18 September 1914 – 27 May 1915\n|-\n| Major-General\n| Beauchamp Doran\n| 27 May 1915 – 4 June 1916\n|-\n| Major-General\n| Guy Bainbridge\n| 4 June 1916 – 4 August 1918\n|-\n| Major-General\n| Ronald Charles\n| 4 August 1918 – March 1919\n|}\nOrder of battle\nThe following units served in the division.\n;74th Brigade\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (disbanded August 1918)\n* 13th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (disbanded August 1918)\n* 8th (Service) Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (left November 1914)\n* 8th (Service) Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (left October 1915)\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (left June 1918)\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Rifles (joined October 1915, left November 1917)\n* 3rd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment (joined November 1917, left June 1918)\n* 74th Machine Gun Company (joined March 1916, left to move into 25th MG battalion March 1918)\n* 74th Trench Mortar Battery (formed June 1917)\nDuring reconstruction in mid 1918\n* 2/7th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (joined June 1918, disbanded July 1918)\n* 21st (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (Islington) (joined and left June 1918)\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment) (joined September 1918)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) (joined September 1918)\n* 13th (Service) Battalion, Durham Light Infantry (Pioneers) (joined September 1918)\n(the last three battalions joined from the brigades of 23rd Division serving in Italy)\n* 74th Trench Mortar Battery\n;75th Brigade\n* 10th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (left October 1915)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (left June 1918)\n* 8th (Service) Battalion, Border Regiment (left June 1918)\n* 8th (Service) Battalion, Prince of Wales's Volunteers (South Lancashire Regiment) (disbanded February 1918)\n* 2nd Battalion, Prince of Wales's Volunteers (South Lancashire Regiment) (joined October 1915, left June 1918)\n* 75th Machine Gun Company (joined on 15 March 1916, moved into 25 MG Battalion March 1918)\n* 75th Trench Mortar Battery (formed June 1916)\nDuring reconstruction in mid 1918\n* 1/6th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (joined May 1918, left July 1918)\n* 17th (Service) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (1st City) (joined June 1918)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment (joined June 1918)\n* 6th (Service) Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment) (joined June 1918)\n* 13th (Service) Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own (Yorkshire Regiment) (joined June 1918)\n(On 9 September 1918, the Brigade was renumbered as 236th Brigade and was placed under orders for service in North Russia.
