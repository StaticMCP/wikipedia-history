Priced at over $60 million, the renovation included constructing over 300 geothermal wells to offset heating costs, a multipurpose auditorium and arts center (opened in December 2010) separate from the school buildings, expansions to all three existing buildings, refurnishing and refitting all classrooms, and a complete exterior refacing.  The start of the 2011–12 school year was delayed by three weeks due to asbestos found in the old auditorium upon tearing it down. The school complex opened for the 2012–13 school year as a brand new, renovated school.\nThe new school features a dance studio, a state of the art weight room, a greatly expanded quantity of lockers, a lecture hall, a larger cafeteria, a state of the art media center, more class space, and the $27 million arts center.\nNotable alumni\n*James Foley, journalist (1992)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
