It listed individuals and organisations who have raised concerns about Scottish independence, although they have not necessarily expressed outright opposition. During the financial reporting season in early 2014, several companies (including Aggreko, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, Macfarlane Group and Breedon Aggregates) listed Scottish independence as an issue in their risk management sections.\nBusinessmen, including Sir Tom Hunter and Sir Tom Farmer, called for more clarity in the referendum debate to best make a decision.\nIn 2012, the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) published a report called A Just Scotland, which laid out \"challenges for both sides of the debate\", in particular calling on Better Together to \"outline a practical vision of how social and economic justice can be achieved within the union\". The STUC had previously refused an offer to join the Better Together campaign.\nReferences"
