The battle took place from March 16 to March 18, 1948. The Gilgit Scouts, a paramilitary force from northern Pakistan, fought against the Jammu and Kashmir state forces. The Gilgit Scouts were informed of a relief column dispatched from Indian headquarters at Srinagar to reinforce the besieged Skardu garrison of the Jammu and Kashmir state forces. The Scouts established an ambush at Thorgo Pari between Gol and Skardu. When the relief column arrived, the Scouts launched their attack, hurling large rocks, resulting in heavy casualties including the wounding of Brigadier Faqir Singh.\nThe remnants of the defeated relief column retreated to Kargil under Major Coutts, while the wounded Brigadier Faqir Singh was evacuated to the headquarters at Srinagar. Following the defeat of the Indian relief column near Gol, the Gilgit Scouts intensified their efforts against the Skardu garrison. Major Ehsan was informed that additional Indian reinforcements codenamed \"Z Brigade\" were being assembled at Kargil under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Kripal Singh. In response, Major Ehsan split his forces, sending a contingent to Parkutta to intercept the new reinforcements.\nPrelude\nDuring the Siege of Skardu, Colonel Sher Jung Thapa and his Jammu and Kashmir state forces successfully held off the Gilgit Scouts, which were a paramilitary force within the Gilgit-Baltistan region in northern Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. After repeated requests for reinforcement from Colonel Thapa, Indian headquarters in Srinagar dispatched another relief column, codenamed \"Biscuit column,\" led by Brigadier Faqir Singh of the Jammu and Kashmir state forces.\nMajor Ehsan Ali, commander of the Gilgit Scouts, had initially planned to ambush an earlier relief column arriving on February 13 but failed to do so. Upon learning of the new column, he prepared another ambush targeting Brigadier Faqir Singh's forces. According to Mahajan, fighting intensified in the Skardu sector, including a failed attempt by the Skardu garrison to capture Point 8853 from the Scouts.On 15 February, the Skardu garrison spotted a small Gilgit Scout force moving toward the expected relief column route. The next day, a larger force was seen advancing in the same direction.\nColonel Thapa, informed by headquarters at Srinagar that reinforcements would arrive on February 18, recognized these movements as ambush preparations. However, a malfunctioning W/T communication set prevented him from warning the relief forces. Colonel Thapa notified headquarters at Srinagar and requested airstrikes against the Scouts, but the Indians conducted no strikes.\nMeanwhile, the arrival of the relief column greatly concerned Major Ehsan. Orders were given to Brigadier Faqir Singh to secure Thorgo Pari and keep the Indus River path open. As Brigadier Faqir's column approached Parkutta and Gol, he believed that the severe cold would incapacitate the Scouts. However, the Gilgit Scouts split their forces, leaving a smaller contingent at Skardu to continue shelling the garrison, while the majority of troops under Major Ehsan Ali prepared to ambush the relief column.\nBattle\nAmbush and casualties\nThe Gilgit Scouts chose Thorgo Pari near Gol as the site for their ambush. At that location, the road narrowed along the Indus River's left bank, allowing only single-file passage. Captain Nek Alam and his platoon took positions on the northernmost part of Thorgo Hill. Subedar Muhammad Ali and Lieutenant Babar spread their two platoons opposite Nurhbuchung village near the river. Captain Mohammed Khan positioned a mortar and machine gun section at the other end of the Pari, while another machine gun section was stationed at the edge. With these placements, the Scouts were prepared to ambush the Indian relief column.\nOn 17 February, Brigadier Singh and Major Coutts's forces advanced through the narrow pass under the cover of darkness. To the surprise of the Scouts, the column unexpectedly stopped near the ambush site for lunch before resuming their advance. As they entered firing range, the Scouts launched their ambush with combined arms fire and rolling rocks. Despite attempts to regroup, 3-inch and 2-inch mortar bombs caused heavy casualties, including wounding Brigadier Singh in the face and shoulder.Despite the attack, the relief column returned fire and managed to hold their positions, preventing further Scout advances until dusk, though they were forced to leave behind their dead. The bombardment continued with mortar fire and constant shooting, aimed at preventing any regrouping of troops near Brigadier Faqir Singh. Defeated, the remaining forces retreated towards Kargil, spending the night at Totli on 18 March, and the column finally reached Kargil on 21 March. Brigadier Faqir Singh handed over command to Indian military advisor Major Coutts before returning to Srinagar for medical treatment.\nThe ambush of the relief column caused significant confusion and resulted in heavy casualties. Some troops attempted to escape by diving into the water, and abandoning their supplies, which included three mortars, light machine guns, rifles, a Bren gun, a Sten gun, grenades, .303 rounds, and 20 wireless sets, according to Ahmad Hasan Dani. Muhammad Yusuf Saraf reported that the Scouts captured 75,000 rounds of .303 ammunition, along with two or three mortars, medium machine guns, rifles, Sten guns, and various civilian supplies. Out of 350 men, 150 were reported dead on the spot, with only 75 believed to have survived.\nS.N. Prasad provided a different account, stating that the relief column suffered 18 injuries, 26 deaths, and seven missing persons presumed dead. The Scouts captured 27 rifles, five Sten guns, two Vickers Berthier machine guns, 64,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, 84 hand grenades, 51 high-explosive bombs for the 2-inch mortar, and 204 HE bombs for the 3-inch mortar. According to a Government of India publication, Indian casualties included 26 killed, seven missing and presumed dead, and 18 wounded, with their ammunition and baggage looted.\nOn 18 March, Colonel Thapa assembled a small force of two weakened platoons and set out to join Brigadier Faqir Singh, as directed by headquarters at Srinagar. However, Thapa's group was ambushed by Gilgit scouts. Nonetheless, they managed to escape the ambush without any casualties. After advancing a short distance, Thapa's forces were informed by local villagers of the defeat of the relief column.\n| width = 50%\n}}\nAftermath\nAfter the defeat of the relief column and the success of the Gilgit Scouts near Gol, the fleeing Indian troops were pursued by Jamadar Ismail Khan and the Gilgit Scouts. The Pakistanis, including Scouts, also increased pressure on the Skardu garrison. As the retreating forces made their way to Kargil, they were attacked by both the Scouts and local Muslims, resulting in further casualties. The Gilgit Scouts, anticipating that reinforcements for relief of the garrison again might be sent from Srinagar, intensified their efforts to capture Skardu swiftly before such reinforcements could arrive.\nFollowing the engagement, Major Ehsan strengthened his position by recruiting local youths and arming them with supplies captured from the relief force. With this increased strength, Pakistani attacks on the Skardu garrison intensified, as did their shelling of the cantonment. On March 26, the Scouts launched a night attack on the Skardu garrison, resulting in heavy crossfire. The outcome of the attack was inconclusive. When Major Ehsan learned that further reinforcements, designated as Z Brigade and commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Kripal Singh, were being dispatched to consolidate at Kargil, he decided to split his forces and send a contingent to Parkutta to counter this new threat.\nMeantime, A and B Companies of the 7th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, led by Captains Davinder Singh and Durga Singh, were ordered to reinforce the Skardu garrison. They joined Major Coutts and other members of the previous column at Kargil, advancing towards Parkutta to await further reinforcements from the 5th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles. Lieutenant Babar Khan was left in charge of the Skardu siege while Major Ehsan departed for Parkutta on April 29. After Ehsan's departure, Babar Khan moved towards Ladakh, and the siege at Skardu continued under Colonel Mataul of Chitral. The Royal Indian Air Force also began providing support to the besieged forces at Skardu.\nSee also\n* Indo-Pakistani war of 1947–1948\n* Kashmir conflict\n* Siege of Skardu\n* Gilgit-Baltistan\n* 1947 Gilgit rebellion\n* Operations in Ladakh\nSources\nNotes\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n**"
