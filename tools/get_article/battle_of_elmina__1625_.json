It was fought between 1,200 soldiers of the Dutch West India Company (transported by a fleet of 15 ships) who landed and assaulted the Portuguese garrison of the castle. The garrison was reinforced by 200 African allies put in service of the governor Sottomayor by the local caciques.\nThe Dutch opened the battle by bombarding the castle. Then the Dutch began to march to the castle, but they were ambushed by the Portuguese and their African allies from hidden positions and were almost totally massacred. Among the dead were the commander-in-chief and all his officers. The Portuguese had very few casualties and took 15 flags, 15 drums, and more than 1,000 muskets, pikes, pistols, and dresses.\nThe Dutch ships fired over 2,000 cannonballs at the castle before they withdrew.\nSee also\n*Battle of Elmina (1637)\n*History of Elmina\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Glete, Jan, Warfare at Sea, 1500-1650: maritime conflicts and the transformation of Europe (2000).\n*Rodriguez, Junius P., The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery, Volume 1 (1997).\n*Boxer, C.
