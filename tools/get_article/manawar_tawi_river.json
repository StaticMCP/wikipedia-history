The towns along its course include Thana Mandi, Rajouri and Naushera. Towards the end of its course, it flows through the plains of the Jammu district west of Akhnoor close to the  Line of Control dividing the Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Indian-administered Kashmir regions.\nSee also\n* Tawi River\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/16735203#map=10/33.1007/74.4832&layers=C Manawar Tawi], OpenStreetMap, retrieved 21 November 2023."
