COVID-19 vaccination in Democratic Republic of Congo was made possible using COVAX, an international scheme to make safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines worldwide. More than 90% of the doses received are the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. Congo received 1.7 million doses via COVAX. However, DRC administered only around 1000 doses by the end of April, and 1.3 million COVAX doses were returned for redistribution to other African countries before they expire in the end of June. The main reasons for low vaccination rate in Congo are poor healthcare infrastructure, political instability and spread of misinformation.\nHistory\nTimeline\nMay 2021\nBy the end of the month 23,733 vaccine doses had been administered.\nJune 2021\nBy the end of the month 59,733 vaccine doses had been administered.\nJuly 2021\nBy the end of the month 86,170 vaccine doses had been administered.\nAugust 2021\nBy the end of the month 94,890 vaccine doses had been administered.\nSeptember 2021\nBy the end of the month 137,758 vaccine doses had been administered.\nOctober 2021\nBy the end of the month 148,684 vaccine doses had been administered.
