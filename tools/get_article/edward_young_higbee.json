Born in New Jersey in 1812, Higbee was ordained a deacon in 1829, and became rector of Trinity Church in Washington, D.C., in 1834. From 1835 to 1836 he served as Chaplain of the United States Senate before becoming assistant rector of Trinity Church, New York, where he served for the remainder of his career. He married twice, and had four children by his second wife. He died unexpectedly in 1871.⋅\nEarly years\nHigbee was born in 1810 in Mount Holly Township, New Jersey, the son of Rev. Daniel Higbee and his wife Beulah Hollinshead.  He was educated at General Theological Seminary from which he graduated in 1829.\nMinistry\nOn July 9, 1829, he was ordained a deacon, and at once took charge of the parishes of St. John and St. George in Harford County, Maryland, his ministry being based in Havre de Grace.
