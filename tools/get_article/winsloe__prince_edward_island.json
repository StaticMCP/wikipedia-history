The construction of Route 2 during the later part of the 20th century sealed Winsloe's fate as a developing suburb to Charlottetown.\nIts status was upgraded to a village in 1971 and several subdivision developments were created in the community during the 1970s-1990s.  On April 1, 1995 the village was amalgamated into the city of Charlottetown.\nSince 1995 the village of Winsloe has been developing rapidly. The Winsloe soccer club has seen major improvements as well as new neighbourhood development.\nReferences"
