The group is best known for a protest on 10 October 2023, in which a member of the group poured glitter onto Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer at the Labour Party Conference, and is associated with Just Stop Oil.\nViews\nPeople Demand Democracy opposes the House of Lords, and has stated that it wants to replace it with a \"House of Citizens,\" which it states would be a \"permanent citizens' assembly\". A statement on the PDD website reads that:\nFurthermore, the group campaigns for proportional representation in elections, which would replace the United Kingdom's current first-past-the-post system.\nLabour Party Conference protest\nIn September 2023, the group sent open letters to both the Conservative Party and Labour Party, demanding they commit to holding \"new national elections with a proportional voting system\" and to \"set up a House of Citizens within six months of getting into office\", and that if they did not do so by 30 September, the group would \"take proportionate action\". The Labour letter also noted that the party's members had voted in favour of proportional representation in 2022, which had been rejected by Starmer.\nAt 3pm on the day of the protest, the group had only 40 followers on Twitter. On 10 October 2023, during Labour Party leader Keir Starmer's speech at the Labour Party Conference, 28 year-old Yaz Ashmawi, who wore a \"People Demand Democracy\" t-shirt, stormed the stage and poured glitter over Starmer. Ashmawi stated that \"true democracy is citizen-led\" that “politics needs an update, we demand a people’s house,\" and \"we are in crisis - our whole future is in jeopardy.”  Following the action, the protester was removed from the stage by conference security. Starmer stated directly following the incident that \"if he thinks that bothers me, he doesn’t know me. Protest or power, that’s why we changed our party.\" Ashmawi was removed from the conference building through a rear exit by two police officers after shouting \"democracy first.\" He was arrested on suspicion of S39 assault, breach of the peace and causing public nuisance, and was driven away from the site in a police van. Following his speech, Starmer made the decision not to walk off the stage and through the crowd, as was usually the norm for party leader speeches at the conference. The Big Issue noted that Just Stop Oil had distributed information to journalists about the group in a press release.\nSee also\n* Electoral reform in the United Kingdom\n* Reform of the House of Lords\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
