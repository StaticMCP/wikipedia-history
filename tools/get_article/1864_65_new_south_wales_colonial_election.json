This election was for all of the 72 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 52 single-member constituencies, six 2-member constituencies and two 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 10 November 1864 by the Governor, Sir John Young, on the advice of the Premier, James Martin. Suffrage was limited to adult white males.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
