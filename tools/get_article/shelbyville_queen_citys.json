In 1907 and 1908, the Shelbyville Queen Citys played exclusively as members of the Class D level Eastern Illinois League and hosted home games at Forest Park.\nHistory\nMinor league baseball began in Shelbyville, when the 1907 Shelbyville \"Queen Citys\" became charter members of the Eastern Illinois League. The league was formed under the leadership of league president L. A. G. Shoaff as a six-team Class D level league. The 1908 Spalding Guide indicated the league was founded in Pana, Illinois and the league's \"godfather\" was Joe Adams, also known as \"Old Wagon Tongue,\" who would later manage the Shelbyville team. In 1907, Shelbyville and the other league teams had a salary limit of $600 for their rosters. The Centralia White Stockings, Charleston Broom Corn Cutters, Mattoon Giants, Pana Coal Miners and Taylorville Tailors joined Shelbyville as charter members of the league.\nThe use of the \"Queen Citys\" nickname corresponds with Shelbyville being referred to as the \"Queen City\" in the region.\nAfter beginning league play on May 12, 1907, the Shelbyville Queen Citys finished the 1907 Eastern Illinois League season in last place in the six-team league. The Queen Citys finished with a 50–69 record playing under six managers during the season. Bob Higgins, C.S. Walls, Harry Patton, Kling, Pearl Holycross and Edward Doak all served time as managers of the team. Shelbyville ended the season 24.5 games behind the first place Mattoon Giants in the final Eastern Illinois League standings.\nIt was reported by the Associated Press that the Eastern Illinois League teams in Charleston, Mattoon, Pana and Paris were supported, “In great part from saloon interests.” This would soon affect Shelbyville and the other league members, as local prohibition would soon occur in the league cities.\nShelbyville continued play in the 1908 Eastern Illinois League but the team folded during the season.\nAn evangelical movement led by former major league player Billy Sunday promoted a ballot item on April 7, 1908, that sought to abolish alcohol in the region. After the election, six of the Eastern Illinois League’s eight franchise cities voted to become dry and the league began to suffer financially, as Sunday games and support from saloons were eliminated.\nAffected by finances, the Charleston Evangelists and Mattoon Giants folded on June 30, 1908, leaving six teams. On July 17, 1908, the Pana Coal Miners relocated to Linton, Indiana and the Danville Speakers moved to Staunton, Illinois in efforts to remain viable. On August 20, 1908, the Shelbyville franchise folded. Andy Biltz of Shelbyville was leading the league in home runs with 6. Shelbyville had a record of 52–43 under manager Joe Adams when the franchise folded. With five remaining teams, the Eastern Illinois League permanently folded on the same date. Shelbyville was in third place, 14.5 games behind the first place Staunton team when the league permanently folded.\nThe Eastern Illinois League did not return to play in 1909. Shelbyville, Illinois has not hosted another minor league team.\nstructure was built in 1903. National Register of Historic Places.
