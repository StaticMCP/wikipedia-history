The Russell River forms the eastern and south-eastern boundary, while Babinda Creek forms part of the northern boundary. The foothills of Mount Bartle Frere form the western boundary.\nMost of the land in the locality is flat low-lying land (approx 10 metres above sea level) and is used for farming, predominantly growing sugarcane. However, in the western edge of the locality, the land rises to up to 150 metres above sea level heading towards the peaks of Mount Bartle Frere in the adjacent locality of Wooroonooran.\nThe Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway line traverse the locality from south to west, both passing through the town. There is no railway station in the locality, but historically it was served by two now-abandoned stations:\n* Miriwinni railway station, in the town ()\n* Pawngilly railway station, south of the town ()\nThere is a network of tramways that transport the harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mill.\nHistory\nThe town takes its name from the railway station name, first used by the Queensland Railways Department on 18 February 1915, reportedly an Aboriginal word meaning mountain rock.\nMooliba railway station opened in 1912. It was renamed Moolaba railway station in 1917 and renamed Pawngilly railway station in 1926. The name Pawngilly is an Aboriginal word meaning big hill.\nOn 20 April 1916, the Cane Beetles March commenced at Mooliba. It was a snowball march to recruit men into the Australian Imperial Force during World War I at a time when enthusiasm to enlist had waned after the loss of life in the Gallipoli campaign. The march began at Mooliba with 4 men, passing through Babinda, Aloomba, Gordonvale, and Edmonton, and ending in Cairns 60 kilometers later with 29 recruits.\nMiriwinni Provisional School opened on 16 October 1916 and became Miriwinni State School on 1 March 1918. On 9 July 2012, it was renamed Mirriwinni State School.\nMiriwinni Post Office opened on 1 July 1925 (a receiving office had been open from 1915).\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Mirriwinni had a population of 447 people.\nIn the , the locality of Mirriwinni had a population of 492 people.\nEducation\nMirriwinni State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 3 Whitman Street ().
