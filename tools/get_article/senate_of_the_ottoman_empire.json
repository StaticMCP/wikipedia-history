Its members were appointed notables in the Ottoman government who, along with the elected lower house Chamber of Deputies (), made up the General Assembly. It was created in its first incarnation according to the Ottoman constitution of 1876, which sought to reform the Ottoman Empire into a constitutional monarchy.\nMembers of the Senate were selected by the Sultan and their numbers were limited to one-third (1/3) of the membership of the representative Chamber of Deputies. Members and the president of the Senate were designated to be reliable and reputable leaders of the country, required to be at least 40 years old. Furthermore, according to the 62nd clause of the 1876 constitution, government ministers, provincial governors, military commanders, kazaskers, ambassadors, Eastern Orthodox patriarchs, rabbis, and army and navy feriks, if they met certain conditions, could also become Senate members through their offices.\nMembers of both houses, along with the government ministers led by the grand vizier (the de facto prime minister of the Ottoman Empire), met together once a year to discuss and compile a list of things for the sultan to enact in the following year, and to review his actions taken in the previous year. The same day, Senators would swear oaths to stay loyal to the constitution, the sultan, the nation, and their duties.\nBills and budgets passed by the Chamber of Deputies went to the Senate, where they were scrutinized in matters of religion, morality, economics, social issues, and military, and modified as necessary or sent back to the Chamber. The Senate also had the power to create original legislation itself.\nFirst Constitutional Era (1876–1878)\nThe first Senate met on Monday, March 19, 1877. At the time that  served as the Senate president, there were 27 members.\nWhen sultan Abdul Hamid II dissolved the parliament on February 13, 1878, the Senate ceased meeting, but its members continued to be paid government salaries and their status as military and political leaders remained unchanged.\nSecond Constitutional Era (1908–1920)\nAfter the proclamation of the Second Constitutional Era, amendments were made to the 1876 constitution. According to these amendments, the Senate began to assemble every year at the beginning of November, convene at the pleasure of the sultan, and disassemble after four months. The Senate usually convened after the Chamber of Deputies. In extraordinary conditions, at the sultan's request, or after a written appeal signed by the majority of the Chamber of Deputies, the entire parliament could convene earlier in a joint session of the Senate and the Chamber and extend the session.\nOn December 17, 1908, the Senate reconvened for the first time in over 30 years, several of its members changing over time until its end at the end of World War I in 1920, when the Allied occupation of Constantinople forced the de jure closure of the parliament on March 16, 1920. The de facto closure came on April 11, when the sultan, under pressure from the invading Allies, officially proclaimed the parliament dissolved.\nThe successor to the Ottoman Senate, the Senate of the Republic was established after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic.\nMembers\nFirst Constitutional Era (1876–1878)\nSource:\n* Abdul Hamid II – Monarch\n*  – President\n* Ahmed Arifi Pasha – Vice President\n*  – Sultan's messenger\n* Mehmed Namık Pasha – Field Marshal\n*  – Minister of the Navy\n* Abdurrahman Sami Pasha\n*\n*  – governor of Hejaz\n* Dervish Pasha – governor of Ankara\n* Moralı İbrahim Pasha – Minister of the Navy\n* Ahmed Celal Pasha\n*  – Minister of Medical Education\n*\n*  – Fatwa consultant (Fetva emini)\n* Hacı Tahir Efendi – Minister of Civil Service Education\n* M.
