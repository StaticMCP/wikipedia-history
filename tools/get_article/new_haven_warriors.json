They played their home games at Ken Strong Stadium in West Haven, Connecticut.\nThe team was established in 2006 as an AMNRL expansion team. In 2011 they became one of seven clubs that withdrew from the AMNRL to form the new USA Rugby League. The Warriors won the 2008 AMNRL Championship and made playoff appearances every year from 2006 to 2011, advancing to the AMNRL Grand Final in 2010 and the USARL Grand Final in 2011. They were named for the New Zealand professional club the New Zealand Warriors of the National Rugby League.[http://amnrl.com/teams/warriors.html AMNRL – American National Rugby League]\nHistory\nAMNRL\nThe club was founded for the 2006 AMNRL season by Adam Hamon, Blair Wards, Chris Willey and Tony Feasey. The Warriors management later consisted  of Adam Hamon (chairman), Brian Lee (Marketing and Sponsorship), Chris Yergan (Treasurer), Bill West and Ed Reed (IT), and executive committee members Tony Feasey, Siose Muliumu. In their debut AMNRL season the Warriors side had an impressive inaugural year finishing 5th and within the top tier bracket of the competition and qualifying for the playoff series; however, they would eventually be knocked out by the New York Knights in a close encounter that finished 26–22.\nIn 2007 the club again finished 5th and again faced the New York Knights in the playoffs to the final. This time they won 34–8 but were eliminated by their interstate rivals and eventual champions the Connecticut Wildcats in the semifinals 42–18. The Warriors earned the reputation as the most physical side in the AMNRL, and includes several Maori and Polynesian players from New Zealand. In 2008, the club won the Grand Final, beating the Aston Bulls 50–18 at Fort Dix, New Jersey. They advanced through the semifinal by beating the Connecticut Wildcats 40–34.\nUSARL\nOn January 12, 2011, New Haven became one of seven teams to break away from the AMNRL and form the new USA Rugby League. After finishing fourth in the regular season and advancing to the playoffs, the Warriors achieved an upset win over the minor premiers Jacksonville Axemen to secure a championship final berth against the Philadelphia Fight. They were defeated by Philadelphia in the USARL's inaugural Grand Final.\nNew Haven finished seventh of eight teams in 2012, missing the playoffs. They were initially announced as competing in 2013, but withdrew before the season, along with Oneida FC of Boston.\nUSARL season summaries\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|+ C=Champions, R=Runners-Ups, F=Finished first, P=Playoff Appearance, L=Finished Last (Brackets Represent Playoff Games)\n!
