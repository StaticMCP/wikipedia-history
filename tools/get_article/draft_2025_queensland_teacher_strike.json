It was the first time teachers had gone on strike statewide since 2009.\nThe strike involved more than 38,000 members of the union and also involved a march on the Queensland State Parliament building. The strike followed similar strikes in New South Wales earlier in 2021, after the New South Wales Government's negotiations failed after 18 months.\nMotive\nIn their media release statement, the Queensland Teachers' Union cited working conditions and pay as the main reason for the strike. The union states that the Crisafulli government failed to reach \"a meaningful deal\" for teachers. The government offered a pay rise of an annual pay rise of 3 percent for 2025, and a 2.5 percent pay rise for 2026 and 2027.\nIt also included steps to reduce workload which include:\n* An additional pupil-free day from 2026 onwards.\n* A third step to receive the \"Experienced Senior Teacher\" qualification and equalizing progression for graduates.\n* A $400 payment for starting teachers.\n* Increased allowances for school organized camping trip participation.\n* The ability to cash out unused leave in rural areas.\n* Consolidated pay arrangements for community and assistant teachers in Aboriginal communities.\nThe offer was rejected by the union, stating that the offer does not address concerns about workload, violence at work and the equalization of pay when compared to other states. In 2019, the government-ran accident insurance organization WorkCover approved 291 assault and violence claims from teachers statewide, marking a 75 percent increase since 2016, according to the Brisbane Times.\nReferences"
