They were granted feudal lands in Italy, specifically the Duchy of San Pietro in Galatina and the County of Soleto in the Province of Lecce. Gjon Kastrioti II later served in the army of the Duke of Calabria, who was besieging Otranto. Representatives from Himara, the area where the revolt began, called upon him to lead the uprising. Additionally, King Ferdinand I of Naples and Duke Alfonso encouraged him to incite an insurrection in Albania.\nUprising\nIn early 1481, Gjon Kastrioti II set sail for Albania with four Neapolitan ships provided by Ferdinand I of Naples. Accompanied by his cousin, Konstantin Muzaka, Gjon disembarked south of Durrës, while Konstantin continued on to Himara. In his search for allies, Gjon enlisted Krokodeilos Kladas, a military leader from the Peloponnese, and sent him with Albanian-manned galleys to raid Ottoman positions in Morea. In February, Albanian rebels attacked Ottoman and Venetian positions in Albania. Despite the size of his army, Ahmed Pasha was aware of the tenuous Ottoman hold in the region, Ahmed Pasha sent a force to suppress the uprising. However, Gjon Kastrioti II defeated the Ottomans, capturing their weapons and supplies and delaying their plans to sail for Italy.\nDuring the succession conflict between Bayezid II and his brother Cem Sultan, Bayezid summoned grand vizier Gedik Ahmed Pasha and his army for support. Although initially reluctant to abandon his campaign in Italy, Ahmed Pasha complied. However, when attempting to leave Albania, he encountered Albanian rebels blocking the main route with lances. After intense fighting, Ahmed Pasha managed to escape on 1 June 1481, but was forced to leave behind his livestock and supplies. His departure further intensified the Albanian rebellion. After several defeats, Ahmed Pasha was replaced by Suleiman Pasha, who dispatched a sanjak-bey with 2,000 men to expel Gjon Kastrioti II. Upon learning of the approaching Ottoman force, Gjon sent an advance force to confront them, but his troops were defeated with significant losses. Gjon considered retreating to Puglia but ultimately decided to stay. His decision rallied local support, and a force of 6,000 infantry and 400 cavalry gathered around him. With this strengthened force, John successfully defeated a second Ottoman force.\nSiege of Himarë\nThe Albanian rebels in Himarë posed a significant threat to Ottoman control over Vlora. At his cousin's request, Konstantin Muzaka took command of the Himarë rebels and, with the support of Krokodeilos Kladas’ galleys, besieged the coastal cities of Himarë and Sopot by land and sea. As a result, Suleiman Pasha could not send troops to Otranto and knew that, if these cities fell, the Albanians would use them to launch attacks on Vlora and disrupt Ottoman shipping.

The Ottoman army was defeated, with around 1,000 soldiers killed and captured, Suleiman Pasha himself was captured. This decisive victory, followed by the capture of Himarë on 31 August, and later Sopot, solidified Albanian control in the region.\nKrujë campaign\nAfter the success in southern Albania, Gjon, with an army of 7,000, launched an attack on Krujë. Initially, his forces failed to capture the city due to its strong defenses. However, by 1483, Gjon had successfully recaptured Krujë and other lost territories of the Principality of Kastrioti.\nDecline and end of resistance\nIn 1483, a peace agreement was reached between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Naples, in which Naples agreed to cease its support for the Albanian rebels. In response, the Ottomans immediately strengthened their position in Albania and began reconquering lost territories. In January 1484, Gjon Kastrioti defeated an Ottoman army near the Erzen River. However, by the summer of 1484, the Ottomans had reconquered Himara, effectively bringing an end to the Albanian rebellion.\nAftermath\nAfter the fall of Himara, Gjon Kastrioti II was forced into exile once again.\nReferences"
