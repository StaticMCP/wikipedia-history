The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns councillors to Croydon London Borough Council. The ward covers the Woodside area. On 6 May 2021, 5 by-elections were held in Croydon following the resignation of 5 councillors across New Addington North, South Norwood, Kenley, Park Hill and Whitgift and Woodside. Two current councillors were elected in the 2022 London local elections. A by-election, caused by the resignation of Mike Bonello, was held on 2 May 2024.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election\n!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!
