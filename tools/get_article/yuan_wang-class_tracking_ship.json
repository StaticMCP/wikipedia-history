This class is not of a single ship design, but instead is a group of different designs under the same series that share the same name. The ships are all assigned to the China Maritime Satellite Telemetry and Control Department in Jianyin, Jiangsu province.\nDetailed specifications for every ship have not been released by the PLASSF. Yuan Wang 1 and Yuan Wang 2 are thought to have a displacement tonnage of around 21,000&nbsp;tons when fully loaded, with a crew of about 470 and a length of about . Their propulsion is from one Sulzer diesel engine, with a top speed of 20&nbsp;knots (37&nbsp;km/h).\nThe class was first proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1965, and was approved by Mao Zedong in 1968. The first two ships of the class, Yuan Wang&nbsp;1 and Yuan Wang&nbsp;2, were built at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai and put to sea on 31 August 1977 and 1 September 1978 respectively. The general designer of this class is . For the first time, this gave the PRC the ability to track launches and satellites that were not over their territory.\nThe first survey mission of the two ships was during May 1980. After being used for tracking of the launches of indigenously developed communications satellites, Yuan Wang&nbsp;1 and Yuan Wang&nbsp;2 underwent overhauls in 1986, so they could be used for supporting international satellite launches by the PRC.\nTwo further ships of the class have been built. The first was Yuan Wang&nbsp;3, which was commissioned on 20 October 1995. The Yuan Wang&nbsp;4 tracking ship was constructed by China State Shipbuilding Corporation and delivered to the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General on 18 July 1999. It had been converted from the previously used Xiang Yang Hong&nbsp;10 scientific survey ship.\nAnother two Yuan Wang-class vessels were launched in Shanghai in early 2007.\nPictures of Yuan Wang 6 were published, and both Yuan Wang&nbsp;5 and the newly commissioned ship were on duty for the Shenzhou 7 mission.\nDuring the Shenzhou spacecraft flights, the four ships were positioned as follows:\n*Yuan Wang 1 in the Yellow Sea\n*Yuan Wang 2 about 1500&nbsp;km (about 900 statute miles) southwest of French Polynesia\n*Yuan Wang 3 off the Namibian coast\n*Yuan Wang 4 off the coast of Western Australia in the Indian Ocean\nFleet list\n* Yuan Wang 1 - 1977\n* Yuan Wang 2 - 1978\n* Yuan Wang 3 - 1995\n* Yuan Wang 4 - 1999\n* Yuan Wang 5 - 2007\n* Yuan Wang 6 - 2007\n* Yuan Wang 7 - 2016\n* Yuan Wang 8 (Liao Wang 1) - 2024\n* Yuan Wang 21 - Long March 5 transport ship\n* Yuan Wang 22 - Long March 5 transport ship\nType 718\nType 718 tracking ship is the very first design of Yuanwang series, and it consists of two ships, Yuan Wang 1 and Yuan Wang 2, both of which have since retired in the early 2010s. Type 718 can attain speeds of 20 kn.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Number\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Length (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Width (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Draft (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Height (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Displacement (t)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Builder\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Launched\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Commissioned\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Status\n|-\n| Yuan Wang 1\n| 191\n| 22.6\n| 7.5\n| 38\n| 21,157\n| Jiangnan Shipyard\n| 1977 August 31\n| 1978\n| Retired\n|-\n| Yuan Wang 2\n| 192\n| 22.6\n| 7.5\n| 38.5\n| 21,000\n| Jiangnan Shipyard\n| 1977\n| 1978\n| Retired\n|}\nYuan Wang 3\nYuan Wang 3 is the second generation tracking ship of Yuan Wang series, and it can attain speeds up to 20 kt, with a range of 18,000 nautical miles and a cruising speed of 18 kt.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Number\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Length (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Width (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Draft (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Height (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Displacement (t)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Builder\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Launched\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Commissioned\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Status\n|-\n| Yuan Wang 3\n| 180\n| 22.2\n| 8\n| 37.8\n| 17,000\n| Jiangnan Shipyard\n| 1994 April\n| 1995 May\n| Active\n|}\nYuan Wang 4\nYuan Wang 4 was converted from Type 643 research vessel Xiangyanghong 10 (向阳红10), which was originally designed in February 1971, with construction begun in July 1975, and entered service in October 1979. Conversion was completed in August 1998, and the ship is capable of carrying a Changhe Z-8. Conversion work included more than four hundred projects in four major categories. Powered by 9000&nbsp;hp diesel engines, Yuan Wang 4 has an endurance of 100 days and could reach a speed of up to 20 kn, with a range of 18,000 nautical miles cruising at 18 kn.\nWhile in Jiangyin port at 5:10 AM on 5 August 2007, Yuan Wang 4 was hit by a coal carrier Harbor Sea 666 (Gang Hai 666, 港海 666), which caused a massive fire started at the point of collision at 4th fuel tank. The fire was put out after four hours without any casualties, but the equipment on board was severely damaged beyond repair. As a result, Yuan Wang 4 was subsequently converted to a target ship for DF-21 ballistic anti-ship missile to simulate an aircraft carrier target as it entered Jiangyin Shipyard on 15 April 2010 for repair, and eventually destroyed in the latter half of 2010.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Number\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Length (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Width (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Draft (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Height (m)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Displacement (t)\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Builder\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Launched\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Commissioned\n! style=\"background:#079;color:#fff;\" | Status\n|-\n| Yuan Wang 4\n| 152.6\n| 20.6\n| 7.75\n| 39\n| 12,700\n| Jiangyin Chengxi Shipyard\n| 1997 July\n| 1998 August\n| Destroyed as a target\n|}\nYuan Wang 5\nYuan Wang 5 is the third generation tracking ship of Yuan Wang series, and entered service on 29 September 2007.
