The museum was founded in 2005 and the director of the museum since June 6, 2007 has been Joanna Mytkowska. MSN was a cultural institution co-run by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and the city of Warsaw, from 2023 it is a local government cultural institution run by the city of Warsaw.\nIn 2024, the museum opened in its Thomas Phifer-designed venue at Marszałkowska Street. The permanent collection is expected to be presented by February 2025. Before its current location, the museum was located at temporary premises: Museum at Pańska (office spaces at ul. Pańska 3) and the Museum over Vistula pavilion (exhibition space at Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie 22), which was designed by A. Krischanitz and decorated by Sławomir Pawszak.\nThomas Phifer Building\n]]\nIn 2006, the first international architectural competition for the design of the museum was announced. The competition was won in February 2007 by architect C. Kerez. It was chosen from over 100 designs. Eventually however, in May 2012, the City terminated the contract with Christian Kerez. At the same time it was decided that for the next three years the temporary location for the museum would be in Pańska Street, off the nearby main thoroughfare Emilii Plater.\nThe new custom-built museum was designed by the New York City-based architecture studio Thomas Phifer and Partners, chosen in the two-stage tender proceeding in 2013–14. Located on the northern side of Plac Defilad (city center), it was opened on 25 October 2024.\nIn an interview with ARTnews on September 29 2025, the museum director Joanna Mytkowska highlighted that the new building is already an iconic architectural landmark in the centre of Warsaw, reflecting multiple aspects of Polish history including war time destruction, communism era and the post communism transformation period. Mytkowaska said the museum's collection reflect this transformation from local interpretations of art to international audiences.\nCollection and program\n]]The museum presents the achievements and changes in Polish art of the twentieth and twenty-first century in an international context, creates an art collection, presents significant phenomena in the field of visual arts, film, theater and music, as well as supports exceptionally talented artists.\nThe museum has in its collection works by Mirosław Bałka, Yael Bartana, Wojciech Bąkowski, Rafał Bujnowski, Oskar Dawicki, Ion Grigorescu, Aneta Grzeszykowska, KwieKulik, Deimantas Narkevičius, Jadwiga Sawicka, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Andrzej Wróblewski, Artur Żmijewski, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Paweł Althamer, Katarzyna Kozyra, Jarosław Modzelewski, Katarina Šeda, Wilhelm Sasnal, Marek Sobczyk, Monika Sosnowska, Alina Szapocznikow, Piotr Uklański, archives of Eustachy Kossakowski, among others.\nSelected temporary exhibitions\n* Tiger in the Garden – The Art of Maria Prymaczenko (2024)\n* Cruel Tales.
