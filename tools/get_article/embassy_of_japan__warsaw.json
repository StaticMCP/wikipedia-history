The same year, Japan opened a military diplomatic mission, which in 1921 was elevated to the rank of a legation, and in 1921, to a consulate. Originally, it was headquartered at 45 Zielna Street, moving to 2 Róż Avenue in 1921, and to the Przeździecka Palace at 10 Foksal Street in 1923. In 1937, it was elevated to the rank of an embassy. The building burned down in September 1939, during the Siege of Warsaw.\nPoland and Japan renewed and normalized their diplomatic relations in 1957. In 1958, an embassy was opened at the Grand Hotel at 28 Krucza Street, and moved a year later to 7 Willowa Street, where it remained until 1993. Then it moved to 11 Grażyna Street, and in 1996, to the Atrium International Business Center at 23 John Paul Avenue.
