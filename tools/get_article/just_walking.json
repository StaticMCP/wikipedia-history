Its cast includes Ariadna Gil, Diego Luna, Victoria Abril, Pilar López de Ayala, Elena Anaya, and José María Yazpik.\nThe film was nominated for eleven Goya Awards, winning one (Best Cinematography).\nPlot\nAfter a failed jewellery heist, Aurora Rodriguez (Ariadna Gil) is caught and sentenced to eight years in prison, while her three accomplices get away.  Aurora's sister, prostitute Ana (Elena Anaya), meets a powerful Mexican drug lord Felix (José María Yazpik) during a job and agrees to marry him.  While Paloma (Pilar López de Ayala) leverages her connections as a court secretary to influence a judge into reducing Aurora's sentence to four years, Gloria (Victoria Abril) joins Ana in Mexico and discovers that Felix has been brutally abusing Ana.\nJust as Ana reveals to Gloria that she intends to get back at Felix by stealing all his money, Felix viciously beats Ana in a fit of rage. He leaves her barely alive and hospitalized.  Paloma secures Aurora's release from prison and they join Gloria and Ana in Mexico, where the four women set Ana's plan in motion.  Meanwhile, Felix's right-hand man Gabriel (Diego Luna) has spent twenty years waiting to take revenge on his father, currently in prison for beating Gabriel's mother to death.  Though Gabriel begins developing suspicions towards what Aurora and her friends are planning, Felix's violent behavior causes him to question his unwavering loyalty to his childhood friend.\nAwards and nominations\nWon\nCinema Writers Circle Awards\n*Best Actress in a Leading Role (Ariadna Gil)\nGoya Awards\n*Best Cinematography (Paco Femenia)\nNominated\nCinema Writers Circle Awards\n*Best Actor in a Leading Role (Diego Luna)\n*Best Actor in a Supporting Role (José María Yazpik)\n*Best Cinematography (Paco Femenia)\n*Best Director (Agustín Díaz Yanes)\n*Best Film\n*Best Screenplay &ndash; Original (Agustín Díaz Yanes)\nGoya Awards\n*Best Actor in a Leading Role (Diego Luna)\n*Best Actor in a Supporting Role (José María Yazpik)\n*Best Actress in a Leading Role (Ariadna Gil)\n*Best Director (Agustín Díaz Yanes)\n*Best Film\n*Best Editing (José Salcedo)\n*Best Production Supervision (Rafael Cuervo and Mario Pedraza)\n*Best Screenplay &ndash; Original (Agustín Díaz Yanes)\n*Best Sound Pierre Gamet, Patrice Grisolet and Christophe Vingtrinier)\n*Best Visual Effects (Reyes Abades, Rafa Solorzano and Alejandro Vázquez)\nNotes and references\nSee also\n* List of Spanish films of 2008\nExternal links\n*"
