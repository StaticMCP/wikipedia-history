Having earlier played football, he focused on rugby from age 15.\nClub career\nEdinburgh\nEdinburgh signed Kinghorn on a two-year professional contract straight from Edinburgh Academy.\nHe made his professional debut as a 70th-minute substitute in Edinburgh's match against Zebre in the 2015–16 Pro12. He scored his first try for the club the following season against Benetton, going on to score a total of 36 tries for Edinburgh, leaving him currently fourth in the list of most tries scored for the club. In total, Kinghorn scored 327 points for Edinburgh with 19 penalties and 45 conversions to go with his impressive try haul.\nHe had 139 Caps for Edinburgh with a very impressive 86% start rate (122 starts, 17 appearances as a replacement and only 3 not used when selected in the match day 23). He is currently the youngest player to have reached 100 caps for Edinburgh, having achieved this at aged 24 years and 117 days.\nToulouse\nKinghorn left Edinburgh to join Toulouse in December 2023, with his new club paying a six-figure fee to buy out the 26-year-old’s contract which was due to expire in June 2024. Kinghorn scored two tries on his Toulouse debut on 9 December 2023 against Cardiff in the Champions Cup.\nKinghorn performed well for Stade Toulousain, by the 2023/24 Champions Cup Final Kinghorn earned the starting position over teammate and French international Thomas Ramos, as he scored 12 points from the tee and made a crucial tackle to stop a breakaway try, helping Toulouse to their 6th European Title which they won in extra time.\nDuring Kinghorn's time at Toulouse to date, the team have won both the 2023-24 and 2024-25 Top 14 championships.\nInternational career\nYouth\nKinghorn represented Edinburgh at under-17, under-18 and under-20 level and Scotland at under-18 and under-20 level.\nKinghorn was a National Youth League Cup winner with Currie at under-16 level and formerly a member of Heart of Midlothian's Youth Academy.\nHe said: \"When I was younger, football was my main interest, then I started to play rugby at school. Some of my mates went to play for Currie so I went along with them, then things escalated at under-16 level. I began playing for the school first XV and since then it's been my goal to play professionally.\"\nScotland\nIn January 2018 he was called up to the senior Scotland squad for the 2018 Six Nations Championship.\nHe went on to make his debut at Murrayfield in a 25-13 win against England.\nHe then went on to earn his first international start, on the wing, in a 28-8 loss to Ireland. He scored Scotland's only try of the match. He played in all three matches during his first tour with Scotland - to the Americas in the summer of 2018 - scoring tries against the USA and Argentina.\nIn Scotland's 2019 campaign he scored three tries in their first match against Italy. He scored another hat trick against Italy in 2023, also scoring against Wales earlier in the tournament.\nKinghorn was selected in the 31 man squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. In 2023 Kinghorn was selected in the 33 player squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.\nBritish and Irish Lions\nIn May 2025 Kinghorn was selected by Head Coach Andy Farrell for the 2025 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia. Having arrived late for the tour after playing in the Top 14 final victory for Toulouse, he made his debut in the third tour match in Australia, a 10-21 victory over NSW Waratahs, becoming Lion #882. In July 2025, he was replaced in the first half of another warm up fixture, this time, against the Brumbies after sustaining an ankle injury.\nHe was subsequently selected on the bench for the second test. He entered the field as a replacement and contributed strongly to the Lions' comeback victory, which secured an unassailable 2-0 series lead.\nCareer statistics\nList of international tries\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|10 March 2018\n|Aviva Stadium, Dublin, Ireland\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|8–21\n|\n|2018 Six Nations Championship\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|16 June 2018\n|BBVA Compass Stadium, Houston, Texas, United States\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5–0\n|\n|2018 June rugby union tests\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|23 June 2018\n|Estadio Centenario, Resistencia, Argentina\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|12–0\n|\n|2018 June rugby union tests\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2 February 2019\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5–3\n|rowspan=\"3\"\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2019 Six Nations Championship\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10–3\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|24–3\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|6 September 2019\n|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10–3\n|\n|2019 Rugby World Cup warm-up matches\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|23 October 2020\n|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|46–7\n|\n|2020 end-of-year rugby union internationals\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|29 October 2022\n|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10–6\n|\n|2022 end-of-year rugby union internationals\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|11 February 2023\n|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|30–7\n|\n|2023 Six Nations Championship\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|rowspan=\"3\"|18 March 2023\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10–6\n|rowspan=\"3\"\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2023 Six Nations Championship\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|17–6\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|24–14\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|24 September 2023\n|Stade de Nice, Nice, France\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|36–17\n|\n|2023 Rugby World Cup\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|rowspan=\"3\"|8 March 2025\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5-0\n|rowspan=\"3\"\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2025 Six Nations Championship\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|33–7\n|}\nHonours\n; Toulouse\n* European Rugby Champions Cup: 2024\n* Top 14 Winner : 2024, 2025\nPersonal life\nAs of 2025, Kinghorn was engaged to Dina Celina, a nutritionist.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://scottishrugby.org/teams/scotland-men/blair-kinghorn/ Blair Kinghorn] at Scottish Rugby Union\n* [https://www.stadetoulousain.fr/effectif/889-blair-kinghorn Blair Kinghorn] at Stade Toulousain"
