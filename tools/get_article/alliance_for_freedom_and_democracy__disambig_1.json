Another opposition group, UEDF, was once part of it until it left the coalition.\nPeople's Alliance for Freedom and Democracy\nAn overlapping but distinct coalition held its first meeting from 21–25 March 2016 in Asmara, grouping together the OLF, the ONLF, the SNLF, the Gambela People's Liberation Movement, and the Benishangul People's Liberation Movement.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.oromoindex.com/newsreport/oromo.php?misc=search&subaction=showfull&id=1148333625&archive=&cnshow=news&ucat=2&start_from=& Statement announcing the formation of the Alliance for Freedom and Democracy]\n*[http://www.oromoindex.com/newsreport/oromo.php?misc=search&subaction=showfull&id=1148333625&archive=&cnshow=news&ucat=2&start_from=& Ethiopia's largest opposition party has announced it has formed an alliance with four rebel groups.]"
