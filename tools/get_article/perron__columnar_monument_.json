They were primarily built in the so-called Good Cities (Bonnes Villes or Goede Steden) that formed the primary urban settlements in the polity. Many survive, although not in their original form. Perrons were also built in the smaller Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy.\nThe columns came to symbolise civic freedom and autonomy (initially bishopric autonomy, later urban autonomy). This stemmed from their function as places where laws were proclaimed and justice was administered. However, the actual origin of the symbols of the column is unclear, with analogies made with the ancient pillories. In 1467, after recapturing the rebellious city of Liège, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy had the Perron of Liège dismantled and removed to Bruges, not to be returned until after his death. This was \"viewed both as a punishment of the people of Liège and as a clear warning to any Flemish subjects who might be tempted to question the duke's authority\".\nPerrons and the Prince-Bishopric of Liege\n, as a symbol of local autonomy, in 1478 after the end of Burgundian rule.]]\nThe former cities of the Prince-Bishrophic where perrons have been built are nowadays located in multiple regions and provinces of Belgium, in addition to one in the Netherlands (that of Maastricht, which was a condominium of the Prince-Bishopric and the Duchy of Brabant during the Middle Ages).\nLimburg Province (Belgium)\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 15em;\" | Town\n! style=\"width: 66px;\" | Picture\n|-\n! colspan=2| Limburg Province (Belgium)\n|-\n| Bilzen\n|\n|-\n| Borgloon\n|\n|-\n| Bree\n|\n|-\n| Herk-de-Stad\n|\n|-\n| Hamont\n|\n|-\n| Maaseik\n|\n|-\n| Montenaken\n|\n|-\n| Sint-Truiden\n|\n|-\n| Stokkem\n|\n|-\n| Tongeren\n|\n|}\nLiège Province (Belgium)\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 15em;\" | Town\n! style=\"width: 66px;\" | Picture\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Liège Province (Belgium)\n|-\n| Herve\n|\n|-\n| Huy\n|\n|-\n| Liège\n|\n|-\n| Sart-lez-Spa\n|\n|-\n| Stavelot\n|\n|-\n| Theux\n|\n|-\n| Verviers\n|\n|-\n| Villers-l'Évêque\n|\n|-\n| Visé\n|\n|}\nLimburg Province (Netherlands)\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 15em;\" | Town\n! style=\"width: 66px;\" | Picture\n|-\n! colspan=2 | The Netherlands\n|-\n| Maastricht\n|\n|}\nOn coats of arms\nA perron is featured in the coat of arms of the city of Liège and has become a badge of the city.
