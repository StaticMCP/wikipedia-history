The battle was fought on the site of a 1780 encounter in which a Company force was almost completely routed or captured.\nIn the 1781 battle, the company's army was organized into two lines. One line fought against the troops under Tipu Sultan. But Hyder Ali's army faced severe casualties and retreated to Kanchipuram.\nAfter the battle, a shortage of provisions led Coote to move his forces toward Tripassore. Both the sides retreated in a drawn battle and both claimed victory by firing a salute though the British claimed \"dubious victory\".\nBattlefield today\nMuch of the battle site has been altered owing to paddy cultivation. Two obelisks stand in memory of two officers who served in the army of East India Company. They stand on a higher ground than the surroundings and the inscribed text is very light and faded. Colonel George Brown and Captain James Hislop are remembered in the obelisks.\nThe obelisk dedicated to Lieutenant Colonel George Brown bears the following text:\nSacred to the Memory of Lieutenant Colonel George Brown\n'''When Lieutenant of Grenadiers in Draper's Regiment\nhe lost his Right Arm on the storm of Conjevearam Pagoda occupied by Ye French\non  the 18th of April ???? and fell in a general Action fought on this Field between the English\nForces and the Troops of Hyder Ally??? Bahaduer on the 27th of August 1781\nesteemed by every Rank a gallant Soldier, an able Officer, and, an Honest Man.\nThe second obelisk, in memory of Captain James Hislop, displays the following text:\nSacred to the memory of Captain James Hislop\nwho was killed by a Cannon Ball from the Enemy near this Spot,\nThe Field of Battle, 27 August 1781 while serving as Aid de Camp to\nLieut.
