This is for the 1984 season.\nTennessee State was ranked number 1 in the next to last poll of the year and was unranked in the last poll. This was the result of 14 players being declared ineligible prior to the Division I-AA final poll and playoffs. Tennessee State finished 11–0, but was not invited to the post-season.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n|
