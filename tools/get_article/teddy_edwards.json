He learned to play at a very early age, first on alto saxophone and then clarinet.\nHis uncle sent for him to come to Detroit to live because he felt opportunities were better. Due to illness in the family, he went back to Jackson and ventured to Alexandria, Louisiana. He was persuaded by Ernie Fields to join his band after going to Tampa, Florida. Edwards had planned to go to New York City, but Fields convinced him he could get there by way of Washington, D.C., if he worked with his band. Edwards ended up at the \"Club Alabam\" on Central Avenue in Los Angeles, which later became his city of residence.\nEdwards played with many jazz musicians, including his personal friend Charlie Parker, Roy Milton, Wynonie Harris, Vince Guaraldi, Joe Castro and Ernie Andrews. A 1947 recording with Dexter Gordon, The Duel, was an early challenge to another saxophonist, an approach he maintained whenever possible, including a recording with Houston Person. One such duel took place in the 1980s at London's 100 Club with British tenor Dick Morrissey. In 1964, Edwards played with Benny Goodman at Disneyland, and at the 1964 New York World's Fair.\nEdwards performed and recorded with Tom Waits. He toured with him on the Heart Attack and Vine tour, and played to a packed Victoria Apollo in London with Waits and bassist Greg Cohen (the drummer had apparently been left behind after some dispute). The 1991 album, Mississippi Lad, featured two tracks with Waits, and Waits covers the Edwards-written ballad \"Little Man\" on his Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards collection.\nIn 2003, Edwards died at the age of 78 in Los Angeles of prostate cancer, with which he had been diagnosed in 1994.\nDiscography\nAs leader/co-leader\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n|1947\n|The Foremost!\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Onyx\n|With Dexter Gordon.
