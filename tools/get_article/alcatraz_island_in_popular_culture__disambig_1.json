Its appeal in film derives from its picturesque setting, natural beauty, isolation, and its history as a U.S. penitentiary (now a museum) – from which, officially, no prisoner ever successfully escaped.\nPrisoners\nMost appearances of Alcatraz island in popular culture are related to its former status as a federal prison. Both real life and fictional accounts of imprisonment on the island have been popular.\nOne of the best-known of Alcatraz's historic inmates was Robert Franklin Stroud, known as \"The Birdman of Alcatraz\". His biography was written by Thomas E. Gaddis and then adapted into a film in 1962, with Burt Lancaster playing the lead role.\nThe 1995 film Murder in the First depicts a man who spends three years in solitary confinement at the prison.\nOne of the prisoners, Kyle Oberholzer, was charged with rape, murder and fornicating.\nPortrayals in arts, media, and entertainment\nCommon fictional themes\nEscape attempts\nMany films and television series have exploited Alcatraz Island's reputation as a prison from which it was almost impossible to escape. For example:\n* Brute Force (1947), starring Burt Lancaster, although inspired by actual events during the Battle of Alcatraz, is a highly fictionalized account of an attempted prison break. It was unusual at the time for the level of violence it portrayed.\n* Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), starring Burt Lancaster, briefly depicts a largely fictional version of the battle which, from the start, is portrayed as a full-scale riot rather than a discrete escape attempt. Robert Stroud, the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\", is given unwarranted credit for ending the conflict.\n* Don Siegel's thriller Escape from Alcatraz (1979) portrays both the conditions of life in the prison and the difficulty of escaping from it, and chronicles the story of Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin, who escaped from Alcatraz in 1962.\n* Alcatraz — The Whole Shocking Story (1980) is a factually based TV drama of the events of the Battle of Alcatraz, incorporated into a larger narrative of the history of Alcatraz as seen through the eyes of its youngest prisoner, Clarence Carnes.\n* Six Against the Rock (1987), starring David Carradine as Bernard Coy, is based on the semi-fictional book by Clark Howard.\n*Alcatraz (2018), is an independent film depicting the Battle of Alcatraz.\nHostages\nAlcatraz has been used as a location for fictional hostage scenarios:\n*Terrorists use Alcatraz as a hiding-place after taking the Mayor of San Francisco hostage in the third Dirty Harry film, The Enforcer (1976)\n*In The Rock (1996), a group from the United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance holds 81 tourists hostage, demanding monetary reparations; to defeat the hostage-takers, the Navy SEAL team enlists the help of John Patrick Mason, the only inmate of Alcatraz who ever successfully escaped\nSafe haven\nAlcatraz has also been portrayed often as a safe haven or base of operations in post-apocalyptic fiction, such as the film The Book of Eli (2010).\nPortrayals\nMultimedia franchises\n* The Harry Potter franchise features a wizarding island prison called Azkaban which is partly based on Alcatraz.\nFilms\n* Al Capone (1959) ends with the once-powerful crime boss being attacked by other prisoners after being sent to \"The Rock\" for income-tax evasion\n* Alcatraz: The Whole Shocking Story (1980) stars Michael Beck and was directed by Paul Krasny\n*In All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 (1996), Carface turns Alcatraz into the Devil's temple and a prison for angels.\n* Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), starring Burt Lancaster and directed by John Frankenheimer, is based on Thomas E. Gaddis' eponymous 1955 biography of Robert Stroud\n* In Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (2010), Mr. Tinkles was locked up in a hidden prison on Alcatraz Island as a mental patient.\n* Escape from Alcatraz (1979), starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Don Siegel\n* Half Past Dead (2002) action movie starring Steven Seagal, setting of the movie is at a modern Alcatraz\n* King of Alcatraz (1938), starring Gail Patrick and directed by Robert Florey\n* Murder in the First (1995), a drama film about a fictionalized inmate at Alcatraz.\n* Occupation of Alcatraz 1969, a documentary about the protest occupation of (the then defunct) Alcatraz\n* Point Blank (1967).
