      "text": "# Timeline of the Ferdinand Marcos presidency\n\nThis timeline of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines covers three periods of Philippine history in which Marcos wielded political control. First, it covers the period of Marcos' first two terms—1965 to 1969 and 1969 to 1972—under the 1935 Constitution, as well as the antecedent events which brought Marcos to political power. Second, it covers the period in which Proclamation 1081, which put the entirety of the Philippines under Martial Law, was in force—from September 1972 to January 1981. Lastly, it covers the entirety of the period described as the \"Fourth Republic,\" where the Philippines was governed by the 1973 Marcos Constitution after the formal lifting of Proclamation No. 1081.\nThe timeline covers many of the events highlighted in narrations of Philippine history since history-writing often has a slant towards political events. However, numerous historical events—especially typhoons and earthquakes—that took place in the Philippines during the Marcos presidency era are excluded from the list, as they are not primarily political in nature and did not highlight the political involvement of the Marcos administration.\nFirst and second terms, and antecedent events (1965–1972 and earlier)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event || style=\"width:8%\" | Source\n|-\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\" | 1965 || November 9 || Ferdinand Marcos elected President of the Republic of the Philippines. ||\n|-\n| December 30 || Ferdinand Marcos takes his oath of office. ||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1966\n|January 11-22\n| Marcos includes Philippine Navy Commodore Ramon Alcaraz in a broadcast list of officials accused of corruption after Alcaraz refuses Marcos' orders to reduce the navy's antismuggling patrols. Refusing to take Marcos' accusations quietly, Alcaraz rejected the accusation, criticized Marcos' defense policies, and walked out of a session of the House Defense Committee as he announced he was leaving the Navy.
