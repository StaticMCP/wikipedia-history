The Fightin' Blue Hens are a member of the Atlantic Hockey America (AHA) and play their home games at Fred Rust Ice Arena in Newark, Delaware. The team began play during the 2025–26 season.\nHistory\nIn December 2023, it was announced Delaware would add one women's sport due to Title IX considerations. The new women's sport would later be announced as ice hockey, and Delaware was initially announced to be joining College Hockey America (CHA) for its first season of varsity play in 2025–26. However, by that time, CHA had already announced plans to merge with the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association after the 2023–24 season. In March 2024, Allison Coomey was named the inaugural head coach. On April 30, 2024, the merged conference was unveiled as Atlantic Hockey America, with Delaware joining for the 2025–26 season.\nSeason-by-season results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| bgcolor=\"#ffeeaa\" |Won Championship\n| bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |Lost Championship\n| bgcolor=\"#d0e7ff\" |Conference Champions\n| bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\" |League Leader\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#00539F; color:#FFDD31;\"\n|Year\n|Coach\n|W\n|L\n|T\n|Conference\n|Conf.\nW\n|Conf.\nL\n|Conf.\nT\n|Finish\n|Conference Tournament\n|NCAA Tournament\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|2025–26\n|Allison Coomey\n|\n|\n|\n|Atlantic Hockey America\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCurrent roster\nAs of October 6, 2025.\nReferences"
