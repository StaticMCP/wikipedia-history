The revolt was also supported by Emir Khalil ibn Qawsun, the son of former regent Emir Qawsun (d. 1342). Khalil had been promised the throne by Asandamur.\nBattle\nAccording to a contemporary Mamluk chronicler, al-Nuwayri al-Iskandarani, al-Ashraf Sha'ban was significantly assisted by the \"common people\", who killed many of the mamluk rebels, \"making them bite the dust\". The support of the commoners was enlisted by al-Ashraf Sha'ban's loyalist commanders, emirs Asanbugha Ibn al-Abu Bakri and Qushtamur al-Mansuri, both of whom withdrew from the battle in Cairo and left the commoners to fight Asandamur's forces alone. The commoners were able to turn the tide in favor of al-Ashraf Sha'ban's partisans, and the latter's emirs and Royal Mamluks returned to the battle, defeated the rebels and arrested Asandamur.\nAftermath\nBecause of their loyalty and key support during the revolt, al-Ashraf Sha'ban treated the commoners well throughout his reign.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Levanoni, Amalia (1995).
