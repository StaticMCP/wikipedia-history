The battles resulted in a defeat for the insurgents.\nBackground\nReason behind Erik Karlssons rebellion\nThe exact reason for his rebellion is unknown, with some sources stating that Erik Karlsson was thirsty for war, and began his rebellion for this reason. With others saying that it was old loyalists to Jöns Bengtsson Oxenstierna that had risen up again, and another possible reason being that Karl Knutsson had angered the nobility by forbidding them from engaging in piracy.\nBeginning of the rebellion\nThe rebellion began on 13 October 1469, with Erik Karlsson's men marching into Vadstena and kidnapping several of Karl Knutssons advisors, however, their attempt to kidnap Karl Knutsson himself ends in failure, since he had not arrived to Vadstena in time.\nPrelude\nAfter pacifying the population around the Mälaren, Erik went against the population of Dalarna in January 1470. This would turn out to be a disaster.\nBattles\nBattle of Kopparberget\nOn January 10 after marching from Hedemora, Eriks troops were confronted by a Dalecarlian peasant vanguard army around 20 miles from Kopparberget. Erik decided that the terrain was undesirable, and likely after hearing news that the main force was close, he chose to retreat.\nBattle of Opphöga ferry\nOn January 13, during his retreat from Kopparberget, Erik attempted to flee over the Dalälven when his force was intercepted by the main Dalecarlian force, which only consisted of around 105 men under the command of Nils Sture and his brother-in-law Hans Aagessøn Tott, during the battle, Erik suffered a crushing defeat, with the majority of his army being destroyed and 1,500 pieces of armor being taken by the army under Nils Sture and Hans.\nAftermath\nAs a result of the battle at Opphöga, Erik along with other leaders like Trötte Karlsson, and Herr Erik Nilsson were forced to flee to Denmark.\nReferences"
