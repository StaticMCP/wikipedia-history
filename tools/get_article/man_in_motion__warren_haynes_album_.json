The album has sold 80,000 copies in the US as of June 2015.\nCritical reception\n|rev2=PopMatters\n|rev2Score = 7/10\n|rev3=Rolling Stone\n|rev3Score =\n}}\nMan in Motion received generally positive reviews from music critics. David Fricke of Rolling Stone said, \"Before he became an Allman Brother and started Gov't Mule, this power-blues singer-guitarist was a Nashville cat, playing and writing country-soul music. Man in Motion is a swing back to that hardy romanticism, with more Memphis in the mix and a plaintive poise in Haynes' vocals and solos.\" Matt Edsall of PopMatters stated, \"As the title states, Man In Motion showcases a veteran songwriter and legendary guitarist moving in new directions and expanding his already notable career. Don’t worry, though, Deadheads and Mule fanatics. You’ll still get your fill of badass guitar work.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Warren Haynes- electric (lead & rhythm) guitar, lead vocals\n*Ron Holloway- tenor saxophone\n*Ruthie Foster- vocals\n*Ivan Neville- electric organ, clavinet, backing vocals\n*Gordie Johnson- acoustic & electric (rhythm) guitar, producer\n*Ian McLagan- piano, Hammond B-3 organ\n*George Porter, Jr- bass guitar\n*Ray Weber- drums\nGrooveline Horns (\"Man in Motion\" & \"Take a Bullet\")\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
