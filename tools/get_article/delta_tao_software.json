Delta Tao hosted a booth at Mac World Boston in 1990, featuring Color MacCheese and Polly MacBeep.\nDelta Tao uses minimalist software packaging, which has earned them recognition as an eco-friendly software company. A demo version of the company's ''Eric's Ultimate Solitaire program was shipped with each Macintosh at one point.\nBibliography\n*Spaceward Ho!\n*Clan Lord\n*Eric's Ultimate Solitaire\n*Multiple Dark Castle derivatives\n*Strategic Conquest\n*Eric's Cascade\n*Color MacCheese\n*Apprentice\n*Zeus\n*Monet\n*Polly MacBeep\n*WonderPrint''\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060109225045/http://games.ign.com/objects/025/025282.html Delta Tao IGN profile]"
