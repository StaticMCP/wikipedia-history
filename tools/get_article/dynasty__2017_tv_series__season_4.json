Michael heeds Anders's other worldly criticism concerning a lack of guilt over Abbott's demise.  Alexis is pursued around Atlanta by a young British blonde who turns out to be her secret daughter, Amanda (visiting to obtain answers about her true parentage). All comes to a head during Blake's press conference: Fallon and Adam react badly to learning of their new sister; Dom keeps business in the family; a stood-up Liam wins a journalism award and thoughtful attention from Fallon's attractive new assistant, Eva.\n|LineColor       = 57A3B3\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.22\n|ShortSummary    = Amanda is impressive.  She's an Oxford-educated attorney with little tolerance for manipulation.  Blake suspects he may actually be her biological father and squares off against Alexis to confirm it.  Jeff loses his cool during a podcast interview rather than admit to set-backs in ColbyCo's space race.  Kirby's sobriety has her making too many amends to unreceptive Adam and not enough to Sam.  Fallon is matched play by play in an attempted company takeover by a taunting Colin.  Michael brainstorms use of offshore rigs to launch Jeff's rockets. Amanda has choice words for both \"parents\" when swiped DNA reveals her to be a Carrington.

Elsewhere, flash drives from Anders lead Kirby to a dossier on the Carringtons, while Eva and Colin's ploys prompt the newlywed Ridleys to sleep in separate bedrooms.  Dom brokers deals for Jeff and Michael to back Blake's campaign. Amanda's no-nonsense confession of having a career-damaging lesbian affair with a judge causes Fallon to call a humbled truce.  Beto swears revenge when Cristal is put in charge of the Flores cartel.\n|LineColor       = 57A3B3\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.25\n|ShortSummary    = Dominique's ex, Brady Lloyd, shows up at her studio.  He explains he ran out years ago to protect her from his creditors and wins her back.

Adam tampers with a contract Amanda is drafting for Primetime Private Air but she turns the tables on him, joining his hospital's legal team. Fallon numbs her troubles with pot edibles creating a Capra-esque hallucination of the Carringtons if she had no ambition. Guided by Anders, she realizes that a simpler life may not be so wonderful. Jeff learns Dom and Brady never divorced; Blake and Amanda bond; Liam states he's the spouse who needs to change, not Fallon.  He rides off, breaking her heart.\n|LineColor       = 57A3B3\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.30\n|ShortSummary    = Fallon jets to LA to meet with an acclaimed New Age marriage mediator (bringing along Sam to portray an absent Liam and Kirby for distraction).  Enlightenment comes when she accepts Liam truly needs space away from her.  Michael maneuvers Blake to make campaign promises giving aid to communities Carrington Atlantic has harmed.  Jeff's neurotoxin symptoms return as he sells ColbyCo assets to fund Mars flights. Trials for Adam's new drug are stalled when Amanda finds liability issues for the hospital. Cristal intervenes on his behalf, fueling more fire for the siblings' feud. Eva gaslights the lie that Liam wants a divorce, causing Fallon to hook up with Colin for a hot night she will probably regret.\n|LineColor       = 57A3B3\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.21\n|ShortSummary    = Adam is put on the spot when Dr. Larson, biochemist of the drug formula he plagiarized, comes back to claim the research.  Colin advises Fallon to keep their tryst a secret, which proves difficult when she attends a couples retreat with Liam that includes blindfolded wall scaling and truth tents.  Alexis is revealed to be in league with Brady to seize Dominique's business.  Lt. Governor Lipnicki offers Blake the land for PPA's airfield if he drops out of the election.  Kirby shares her diary of Carrington skeletons with Michael. Jeff is off his meds.  Cristal plays on Blake's lust for power (planting rumors of a Presidential appointment) to keep him in the race.  Fallon intends to come clean about Colin but Eva sees to it that Liam learns of the fling first.  The tearful Ridleys seem to part for good.\n|LineColor       = 57A3B3\n}}\n|Viewers         = 0.22\n|ShortSummary    =  The \"Sahara Club Shootout\" frames numerous Carrington cliffhangers.  Fallon gets hip to Eva's schemes when Amanda helps uncover the assistant's history of stalking and obsession with Liam (followed by a knockdown brawl between employer and fired employee).  Dr. Larson has an upper hand until Adam apparently throws him off a balcony.  Jeff suffers a psychotic break and rampages after Brady.  Blake and Cristal curb Beto's efforts to derail the senate race by moving the Flores empire to Atlanta.  Alexis is jailed for Larson's murder in a red designer gown.  Sam emulates Anders's calm demeanor and pulls off an impressive gala for Blake's campaign at the new club until Jeff, Beto, and Eva each show up uninvited with guns.  A shot is fired.  Fallon is struck by the bullet and falls into Liam's arms.\n|LineColor       = 57A3B3\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nwas written off the series in season four.]]\nDevelopment\nDynasty was renewed for a fourth season on January 7, 2020.\nProduction of the third season was suspended in March 2020 as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the filming of only 20 of the 22 ordered episodes of the season had been completed at that time. It was later confirmed that the 20th episode of the season, \"My Hangover's Arrived\", would serve as the season three finale. Showrunner Josh Reims, hoping to use reworked versions of the two unproduced scripts to start the fourth season, said in May 2020 these episodes feature Fallon and Liam's wedding; Blake going to war with Alexis, Jeff and Adam; Sam's new relationship with Ryan; and the return of the Moldavians.\nIt was reported that if production resumed by late fall 2020, season four would be expected to premiere in spring 2021 or later, and The CW's president Mark Pedowitz announced that all of the network's series would be producing \"our normal episodic counts\" for the post-pandemic season which indicates a full season of 22-24 episodes. Production on the fourth season officially began on October 15, 2020. On November 5, 2020, Daniella Alonso revealed on a podcast that she was pregnant with her first child; she further verified her real-life pregnancy would not be affecting Cristal's storyline in any capacity, and she would go on maternity leave a week prior to production shutting down for winter hiatus.\nOn February 3, 2021, ahead of its fourth season premiere, The CW renewed the series for a fifth season.\nOn April 28, 2021, Variety announced Elizabeth Gillies would make her directorial debut during the season. Grant Show directed the sixteenth episode of the season. On September 10, 2021, Gillies made her directorial debut with the eighteenth episode of the season.\nOn June 3, 2021, showrunner Josh Reims described the fourth season as a \"rollercoaster ride\" for Cristal, \"She and Blake have to figure out how to move forward in their marriage after both cheated; her brother Beto will pay a surprise visit, upending her life and bringing out the dark side of Cristal once more; and in her biggest challenge yet, she has to deal with a medical situation that becomes much worse than anyone expected...\"\nCasting\nAlonso had previously been the third Cristal cast in as many seasons. In May 2020, Reims confirmed that she would be back for season four, saying \"I kind of wanted to do this thing—which I still might do—where we pretend at the beginning of the season that we're getting another new Cristal. But I don't want to scare Daniella. She's so great in the role, and I'm so excited that she's coming back.\" In February 2021, the casting of Luke Cook as Oliver, Kirby's Australian ex-boyfriend, was announced. The casting of Kara Royster as Fallon's new assistant, Eva, was announced in May 2021. In June 2021, showrunner Josh Reims revealed that Geovanni Gopradi would return as Cristal's brother, Beto. Michael Fairman also reported Laura Leighton's casting in the guest role of Corinne Simon, an SEC officer. Original cast member Dale's character Anders was killed off in the August 2021 episode  \"Go Rescue Someone Else\", but the actor continues to appear on the series as a fantasy of other characters. The casting of Eliza Bennett as Alexis's secret daughter by Blake, Amanda Carrington, was announced in August 2021.
