EUNIC brings together organizations from all 27 EU member states and adds value through its global network of clusters. By pooling together the resources and expertise of its members and carrying out joint work on common areas of interest, EUNIC is a recognized partner of the European Union and its stakeholders in defining and implementing European policy on culture inside and outside the EU.\nOrganization\nThe overarching purpose of EUNIC is to create effective partnerships and networks between the participating organizations, to improve and promote cultural diversity and understanding between European societies, and to strengthen international dialogue and co-operation with countries outside Europe.\nSince its establishment in 2006, EUNIC has evolved into a strong network delivering transnational collaborative projects worldwide through its 36 members and 103 clusters. Members consist of national cultural institutions or organizations. Clusters are collaboration platforms established where at least 3 local offices of EUNIC members operate together. Clusters can operate nationwide or citywide. A EUNIC cluster represents the whole of EUNIC and not only those members present in a country or location.\nOn 16 May 2017, during the Danish Presidency of EUNIC and the European Union signed an administrative agreement that outlines joint principles, values and objectives for cooperation, as well as practical arrangements for its implementation.\nThe Presidents are supported by the EUNIC Global office team based in Brussels. The EUNIC Global Office in Brussels also supports the work of EUNIC members and clusters around the world.\nManagement\nEUNIC is managed by a bi-annual meeting of the heads of its member organizations, a general assembly. They elect from among themselves a president, vice president, and four ordinary members who together represent the EUNIC board of directors.\nPresidencies\nSource:\n* 2024-2025:  - Romanian Cultural Institute\n* 2022-2023:  - Goethe-Institut\n* 2021-2022:  - Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation\n*2020-2021:  - DutchCulture, centre for international cooperation\n*2019-2020:  - Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)\n*2018-2019:  - French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs\n*2017-2018:  - Flanders Department of Foreign Affairs\n*2016-2017:  - Danish Cultural Institute\n*2015-2016:  - Instituto Cervantes\n*2014-2015:  - Swedish Institute\n*2013-2014:  - Wallonie-Bruxelles International\nDirectors\n2016-2017\nMembers of the board of directors of the Danish presidency: President Michael Metz Morch- Danish Cultural Institute; Vice-President Koen Verlaeckt - Flanders Department of Foreign Affairs; Johannes Ebert - Goethe-Institut; Anne Grillo - French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development; Teresa Indjein - Austrian Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs; Małgorzata Wierzejska - Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Poland\nParticipating members\nMembers within the EU\nMembers of EUNIC, as of June, 2023:\n* - Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs, Österreich Institut GmbH\n* - Wallonie-Bruxelles International, Flemish Department of Foreign Affairs\n* - Bulgarian Ministry of Culture\n* - Croatia House Foundation\n* - Cyprus Ministry of Education & Culture\n* - Czech Centres\n* - Danish Cultural Institute\n* - Estonian Institute\n* - Finnish cultural and academic institutes\n* - Fondation Alliance française, Institut Français, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* - Goethe-Institut, Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations - IFA\n* - Hellenic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hellenic Foundation for Culture\n* - Hungarian Cultural Institute\n* - Culture Ireland\n* - Società Dante Alighieri, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy)\n* - Latvian Institute\n* - Lithuanian Culture Institute\n* - Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Luxembourg)\n* - Arts Council Malta\n* - DutchCulture, centre for international cooperation\n* - Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland\n* - Instituto Camões\n* - Romanian Cultural Institute\n* - Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republik\n* - Slovenian Ministry of Culture\n* - Instituto Cervantes, AECID\n* - Swedish Institute\nMembers outside the EU\nEUNIC members are present in the following European countries:\n*\n* - EUNIC Armenia\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* - British Council\nSee also\n* Culture of Europe\n* European integration\n* Pan-European identity\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
