He bought some mills in Stoneham, Massachusetts, from Elisha S. Converse, which later became a small settlement called Haywardville.\nHe died in Colchester, Connecticut on July 18, 1865.\nHayward's former home in Colchester has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.\nReferences"
