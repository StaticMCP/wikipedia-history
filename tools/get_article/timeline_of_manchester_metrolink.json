Furthermore, as these extra services usually begin to leave the two depots after 6am, and more drivers called in sick, 'minor delays' were experienced on multiple lines from 7am: Altrincham, Oldham and Rochdale, and South Manchester.

The pantograph of tram fleet #3061, which was supposedly bound for Manchester Airport (unknown whether it was a double tram or single tram service) got caught in the tarp upon approaching Market Street. Furthermore, at around 20:00, services through Firswood tram stop operated at a greatly reduced speed due to a fallen tree on the overhead lines. In a similar incident, explosions were seen on overhead wires near Manchester Piccadilly railway station, as well as another fallen tree, and no trains could run through there and Manchester Oxford Road from around 21:00. Yet another fallen tree causes disruption between Hollinwood and Shaw and Crompton stops at around 21:40. These closures cause significant delays on the Pink and Grey routes (East Didsbury–Rochdale and East Didsbury–Shaw respectively).\n2024\n* 7 March 2024: A collision with a tram and a car occurs on Gainsboro Road near Snipe Retail Park and Audenshaw tram stop at around 06:15.\n* 14 April 2024: The Metrolink's highest ever Sunday ridership was recorded at over 175,000 on the day of the Manchester Marathon.
