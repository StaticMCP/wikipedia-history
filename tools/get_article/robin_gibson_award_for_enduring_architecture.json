The award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\nBackground\nThe Enduring Architecture Award recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which have remained important as high quality works of architecture when considered in contemporary cultural, social, economic and environmental contexts in the state of Queensland. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but must provide adequate material and information supporting the nomination for consideration of the jury. The award was initially known as the 25 Year Award from 2003 to 2010, later changed to the Queensland Award for Enduring Architecture from 2011 to 2013 in line with other states and the national awards. In 2014 it became a named award recognising Queensland architect, Robin Gibson , a two timer winner of the award.\nThe average age of the 23 projects recognised to from 2003 to 2025 is 37.5 years from completion of construction to year of award.\nNational Award Winners\nRecipients of the state–based award are eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nAs of 2024 two projects located in Queensland have won the national award. In 2018 the Townsville Courts of Law, Edmund Sheppard Building by Hall, Phillips and Wilson Architects won both the state and national award 43 years after the building was completed in 1975. In 2024 the C House by Donovan Hill was presented the national award.\nMultiple Award Winners\nProjects by architects Geoffery Pie, Robin Gibson and James Birrell have all been presented the award on two occasions each.\nAwards by year\n2023 Award\nThe Robin Gibson Award for Enduring Architecture was awarded to the Sir Kingsford Smith Memorial by Noel Robinson Architects located at Brisbane Airport and completed in 1988. The 35-year-old building houses the plane that was flown by Sir Kingsford Smith  and his crew across the Pacific from San Francisco to Brisbane's Eagle Farm in 1928. The jury declared the project “an exemplary piece of public architecture that protects an important part of Australian history”.\n2024 Award\nThe 2024 Award was presented to the C House by Donovan Hill, commissioned in 1992 and completed in 1998. The residential house is located in Cooparoo, Brisbane. In October 2024, the C House was awarded the National Award for Enduring Architecture, with the jury citation describing the design as \"Internationally recognised as one of the most influential houses of the 20th century, the C House’s impact on architectural discourse and practice cannot be overstated. The C House embodies Donovan Hill’s pioneering exploration of the outdoor room typology, a concept that continues to be redeployed by architects throughout the country...\".\nList of Award recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Robin Gibson Award for Enduring Architecture (reverse order)\n|-\n!
