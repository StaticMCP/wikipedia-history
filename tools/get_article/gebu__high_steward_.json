Inscriptions show that the statue was a gift from an unnamed king and dedicated to the god Amun. The stylistic features put it to the late Twelfth Dynasty or early Thirteenth Dynasty. His title string was jrj-pꜥt; ḥꜣtj-ꜥ (governor); ḫtmw-bjtj; smr-wꜥtj n mrwt; jmj-rꜣ pr-wr (high steward), gbw (Gebu).\nLiterature\n* Mogens Joergensen: Catalogue Egypt I (3000–1550 B.C.): Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek.
