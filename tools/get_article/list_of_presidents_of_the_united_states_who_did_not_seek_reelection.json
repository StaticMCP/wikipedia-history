Since 1951 under the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States no person may serve more than two full terms as president (or one term if they have served over two years of a partial term). Prior to the term limit, all presidents (except Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt nonconsecutively, and Franklin D. Roosevelt consecutively) followed an informal two-term tradition set by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The following presidents were eligible for a second or third full term but chose not to run in the general election, although several sought to run in party primaries:\nBefore 22nd amendment\n* George Washington (in office 1789–1797).\n* Thomas Jefferson (in office 1801–1809).\n* James Madison (in office 1809–1817).\n* James Monroe (in office 1817–1825).\n* Andrew Jackson (in office 1829–1837).\n* John Tyler (in office 1841-1845): withdrew from the race to support Polk.\n* James K. Polk (in office 1845–1849): kept campaign promise to serve only one term.\n* James Buchanan (in office 1857–1861): kept campaign promise to serve only one term.\n* Rutherford B. Hayes (in office 1877–1881): kept campaign promise to serve only one term.\n* Grover Cleveland (in office 1885–1889 / 1893–1897).\n* Woodrow Wilson (in office 1913–1921): Wilson hoped to be nominated at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, but ultimately was not, and decided not to run.\n* Calvin Coolidge (in office 1923–1929): chose not to run after serving one partial term and one full term.\nAfter 22nd amendment\n* Harry S. Truman (in office 1945–1953}}): withdrew from the race after serving one partial term and one full term.\n* Lyndon B.
