Jefferson, is an outdoor monument commemorating William Clark by art professor Michael Florin Dente, installed on the University of Portland campus, in Portland, Oregon, United States.\nHistory\nThe memorial was dedicated on December 11, 1988, and features  bronze sculptures of Clark, York, who was Clark's slave, and an unnamed Native American on a  cement and stone base.\nIn 2020, during the anti-racism protests in the weeks after the police murder of George Floyd, the statue of York was removed.\nSee also\n* 1988 in art\n* Lewis and Clark (sculpture), Salem\nReferences"
