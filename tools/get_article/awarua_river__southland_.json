The river's mouth is at the northern end of Three Mile Beach, the Big Bay beach. One of the rivers that feeds Waiuna Lagoon is the Dry Awarua River.\nThe mouth of the Awarua River is near the western boundary between the West Coast Regional Council area and the Southland Regional Council areas. It was formerly the boundary between Canterbury Province and Otago Province from when they were created in 1853.\nReferences"
