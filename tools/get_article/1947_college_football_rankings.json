Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, did not bestow a national championship, instead that title was bestowed by various agencies.\nThere was one weekly poll that began in the preseason—the Associated Press Poll. The AP Poll did not begin conducting preseason polls until 1950. The United Press Coaches' Poll began operation that same year.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP Poll\nThe final regular season AP Poll was released on December 8, at the end of the 1947 regular season, weeks before the major bowls.

season AP poll, taken in early December before the bowls, had Notre Dame No. 1 (107 first-place votes) and Michigan second, with 25 first-place votes. Michigan won the Rose Bowl 49–0 over USC while Notre Dame did not play in a bowl game. Detroit Free Press sports editor Lyall Smith arranged a special post-bowl poll with only Michigan or Notre Dame as choices, which favored Michigan 226–119. However, it was stated that \"The new ballot does not supersede the Associated Press' regular final season rating of college football teams, released last December 8, which named Notre Dame the mythical National champion with Michigan the runner-up.\"\nLitkenhous Ratings\nThe final Litkenhous Ratings released in December 1947 provided numerical rankings to more than 500 college and military football programs. The top 150 ranked teams were:\n1. Michigan (10–0) - 114.0\n2. Notre Dame (9–0) - 109.4\n3. Texas (10–1) - 103.6\n4. USC (7–2–1) - 100.0\n5. Penn (7–0–1) - 99.6\n6. Army (5–2–2) - 98.2\n7.
