It was located on the coast of the South Sea. Its territory can be traveled around for a month. It met the sea to the south and adjoined Dvaravati's vassal, Tou Yuan, to the east. Bordered the kingdom of Jù Yóu or  Dàn Yóu () to the west and the kingdom of Bō Cì or Bō Là () to the north.\nDuō Miè was not subject to other states, and despite not being an enormous kingdom, it had a large population. There were 30 states under its rule. It has state walls, palaces, towers, and fortresses, all made of tiles and wood. There are 4,000 guards. Although they have bows, arrows, swords, shields, and armor, they do not have battle formations. There are criminal law documents and marriage ceremonies. Religion worships Buddha and other gods. Their king wears clothes made of morning glory fiber and linen. The king's surname is Māgha (; Mó-jiā), his given name is Shili (; Shī-lì), and his royal title is Sī-duō-tí (). Duō Miè established relations with China during the Zhenguan period (627–649 CE) of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty and later sent tribute to the Chinese court in 661 during the reign of Emperor Gaozong.\nIts products include gold, silver, copper, iron, ivory, rhinoceros horn, morning glory clothes, and others. Its animals include rhinoceros, elephants, horses, and cattle, and its fruits include betel nuts. Its peaches, dates, melons, plums, and vegetables and grains are similar to those in China. Gold and silver are used for transactions, and the people pay a twentieth tax. The residents are short in stature, and brothers marry one wife. Women always make horns out of their hair to identify the number of their husbands.\nInterpretation\nNo additional evidence about Duō Miè has been found, and its identification remains disputed. However, since it bordered west of Tou Yuan, if Tou Yuan was on the eastern coast of the Bay of Bangkok as cited by Lawrence P. Briggs, or at Lopburi as said by Tatsuo Hoshino, Duō Miè should be situated on the western Menam Valley in central Thailand. On the other hand, if Tou Yuan was in the upper Tanintharyi Coast,  Duō Miè should be somewhere in the Irrawaddy Delta.\nIf Duō Miè was situated in the western Menam Valley, particularly in the area of Phraek Si Racha, it may have come under the authority of Lavo during the reign of Kalavarnadisharaja (r. 648–700). He is credited with annexing Tou Yuan and founding the Lavo Kingdom in 648. According to the , Lavo’s territorial domain during his reign extended to Kosambi in the northwest, Sukhothai in the north, and  in the northeast. Previously, some scholars believed Duō Miè was a small country on the coast south of Línyì. Some say it was in southern India.\nDuring the decline of Dvaravati, which began in the 8th century, an autonomous state known as Xiū Luó Fēn, likely situated in the Phraek Si Racha region, emerged and sent a tributary mission to the Chinese court. It reportedly maintained close ties with Qiān Zhī Fú of Si Thep, which is believed to have expanded westward into the Menam Valley, where the enlarged realm was referred to by the Chinese as Gē Luó Shě Fēn.\nReferences"
