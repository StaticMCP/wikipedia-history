Introduced in 2018, there have been two editions of the concept. In the first edition, the winners were voted by fans, while for the second, WWE picked the winner themselves. Previously, wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown had been rewarded Slammy Awards between 1986 and 2015.\nWinners and nominees\n2018 awards\nThe 2018 WWE Year-End Awards were revealed on December 23, 2018, on WWE's Instagram Stories.
