The song reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number four in Canada; it peaked within the top five of several European countries including Italy, where the song reached number one.\nChart performance\nFollowing on from the success of previous non-album single, \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\", \"Alive and Kicking\" was released as a single, reaching number 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Top Rock Tracks chart (now called the Mainstream Rock chart). The song also reached number 4 in Canada. In Europe, the song topped the charts in Italy for one week, reached number 2 in Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands, and peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1992, when re-released as a double A-side with \"Love Song\" to promote the band's compilation album Glittering Prize 81/92, it managed to reach a new peak of number 6. Elsewhere, \"Alive and Kicking\" reached number 5 in New Zealand, number 16 in South Africa, and just missed the top 20 in Australia, peaking at number 21.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Alive and Kicking\" was filmed near the town of Hunter, at North–South Lake in the Catskill Mountains of Upstate New York. A portion of the video was filmed on the overlook at the site of the old Catskill Mountain House (previously demolished). It was directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński, who directed the video for \"All the Things She Said\", the third single from the same album.\nTrack listings\n* 7-inch single\n# \"Alive and Kicking\" (Single Version) (4:47)\n# \"Alive and Kicking\" (Instrumental Version) (6:01)\n* 12-inch single\n# \"Alive and Kicking\" (5:26)\n# \"Alive and Kicking\" (Instrumental Version) (6:01)\n* Second 12-inch single\n* Ltd Edition Reflective Gold Sleeve\n# \"Alive and Kicking\" (5:26)\n# \"Alive and Kicking\" (Instrumental Version) (6:01)\n# \"Up on the Catwalk\" (Live) (5:37)\nPersonnel\n* Produced by Jimmy Iovine and Bob Clearmountain\n* Engineered by Moira Marquis and Mark McKenna\n* Engineering assisted by Martin White\n* Words and music by Simple Minds (Kerr, Burchill, MacNeil)\n* \"Up on the Catwalk\" recorded live at Barrowlands, Glasgow, 5 January 1985\n* Backing vocals by Robin Clark\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n\"Alive and Kicking\"\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1985–1986)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n| 21\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hot 100 Singles)\n| 2\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi)\n| 1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n| 16\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\n\"Love Song\" / \"Alive and Kicking\"\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1992)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n| 45\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1985)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders)\n| 20\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n| 43\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n| 22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n| 19\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1986)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n| 17\n|}\nCertifications\nAppearances in media\nIn 1992, \"Alive & Kicking\" provided the soundtrack for a famous promo, entitled \"A whole new ball game\" for BSkyB's launch of the FA Premier League.\nEast Side Beat version\n| recorded      =\n| studio        =\n| venue         =\n| length        = 4:05\n| label         = FFRR\n| writer        = * Jim Kerr\n* Charlie Burchill\n* Mick MacNeil\n| producer      = Phil Kelsey\n| prev_title    = I Didn't Know\n| prev_year     = 1992\n| next_title    = You're My Everything\n| next_year     = 1993\n}}\nIn 1992, Italian dance music group East Side Beat covered \"Alive and Kicking\".
