Vulcan Pass was captured by the Germans on 21 September during the retreat of the Romanians. The retreat occurred after the Romanian army was beaten near the city of Hermannstadt. However, on the following day, the Romanian units were still actively fighting against the advancing German troops. On 22 September, two German battalions stormed the Vulcan Pass. In taking it, the Germans also captured 526 Romanian prisoners.\nReferences"
