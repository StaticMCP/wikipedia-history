The line had been established following the retreat of autumn 1921, after the Battle of Sakarya. The Army of Asia Minor had its headquarters in Smyrna (Izmir) and was commanded by Lieutenant General Georgios Hatzianestis, with Major General Georgios Valettas as his chief of staff. It comprised a force of 220,000 men, of whom 140,000 were situated at the front but only 80,000 were counted as front-line combatants. The Army's equipment comprised 264 field guns, 980 machine guns and 2,592 sub-machine guns, as well as 55 aircraft.\nThe northern sector of the front, from the Marmara Sea to around Eskişehir, was covered by the III Corps, and the southern sector, a wide bulge around Afyonkarahisar, by the I Corps with II Corps as its immediate reserve.
