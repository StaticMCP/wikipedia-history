Four residing Syrian intelligence officials were wounded in the course of action, and although the group warned of forthcoming attacks, little was heard of them since.  It has been suggested that the PRRO was simply a cover for the Lebanese Liberation Front or a splinter faction, but is now considered to be inactive.\nSee also\n* Guardians of the Cedars\n* Lebanese civil war\n* Lebanese Forces (militia)\n* Lebanese Liberation Front\n* Liberation Battalion\n* Sons of the South\nReferences\n*Edgar O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon, 1975-92, Palgrave Macmillan, London 1998.\n* Rex Brynen, Sanctuary and Survival: the PLO in Lebanon, Boulder: Westview Press, Oxford 1990.  – [https://prrn.mcgill.ca/research/papers/brynen2.htm]\n*Robert Fisk, Pity the Nation: Lebanon at War, London: Oxford University Press, (3rd ed. 2001).\nFurther reading\n* Jean Sarkis, Histoire de la guerre du Liban, Presses Universitaires de France - PUF, Paris 1993.
