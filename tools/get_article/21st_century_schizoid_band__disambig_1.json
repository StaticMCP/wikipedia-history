The initial band featured Mel Collins on saxophones, flute and keyboards, Michael Giles on drums, Peter Giles on bass, Ian McDonald on alto saxophone, flute and keyboards, and Jakko Jakszyk on guitar and vocals. All but Jakszyk had previously been members of King Crimson in its early years. Ian Wallace, another former Crimson member from that period, replaced Michael Giles in early 2003 after the band's Japanese tour. Further international touring followed in 2003/04.\nThe band played live with sets concentrating on compositions from King Crimson's first four albums and other works from the band members' back catalogues, including McDonald and Giles. They have released four albums, mostly of live work but including newer and/or recent compositions, such as Ian McDonald's \"Let There Be Light\" (from his solo album ''Driver's Eyes'') and \"Catley's Ashes\", a Jakszyk instrumental which later appeared on his solo album The Bruised Romantic Glee Club (2006).\nThe band has been inactive since 2004; with members based in different countries, touring proved to be logistically and financially difficult. The possibility of performing again in 2005 was considered following offers from festivals, possibly with Guy Evans (of Van der Graaf Generator) on drums to replace Wallace who had other commitments, but the idea was abandoned. Wallace's death in February 2007 would seem to have closed the lid on the band for good.\nJakszyk and Collins went on to record as a trio with founding Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp (and with rhythmic support from fellow members Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison) on the Scarcity of Miracles album in 2011. This was followed in 2013 by the announcement of a new King Crimson formation including all five, plus two additional members.\nAverage setlists\n2002\n# Pictures of a City\n# Cat Food\n# Let There Be Light\n# Progress\n# The Court of the Crimson King\n# Formentera Lady\n# Tomorrow's People\n# If I Was\n# Ladies of the Road\n# I Talk to the Wind\n# Epitaph\n# Birdman\nEncore:\n# 21st Century Schizoid Man\n2003\n# Pictures of a City\n# Cat Food\n# Let There Be Light\n# Cirkus\n# Spend Us Three\n# Cadence and Cascade\n# The Court of the Crimson King\n# Ladies of the Road\n# Catley's Ashes\n# 21st Century Schizoid Man\n# Formentera Lady\n# I Talk to the Wind\n# Epitaph\n# Birdman\nEncore:\n# Starless\n2004\n# Pictures of a City\n# Cat Food\n# Let There Be Light\n# Cirkus\n# Spend Us Three\n# Cadence and Cascade\n# The Court of the Crimson King\n# Ladies of the Road\n# Catley's Ashes\n# Formentera Lady\n# Sailor's Tale\n# I Talk to the Wind\n# Epitaph\n# 21st Century Schizoid Man\n# Birdman\nEncore:\n# Starless\nBand members\n* Jakko Jakszyk – lead vocals, guitar, flute\n* Mel Collins – saxophones, flute, keyboards, backing vocals\n* Ian McDonald – alto saxophone, flute, keyboards, vocals\n* Peter Giles – bass, backing vocals\n* Michael Giles – drums, percussion, vocals\n* Ian Wallace – drums, percussion, vocals\nTimeline\nDiscography\n*Official Bootleg Volume One (2002)\n*Live in Japan (2003, CD and DVD)\n*Live in Italy (2003)\n*Pictures of a City – Live in New York (2006, recorded 2004)\n*Live in Barcelona (2024, recorded 2003)\nAlbums performed members contributed to\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Artist\n! colspan=\"5\" |King Crimson\n!McDonald and Giles\n!Ian McDonald\n!Michael Giles\n!Jakko M.

This title was used by the 1969 lineup of King Crimson, which played the song live before it was recorded for In the Wake of Poseidon. However, \"A Man, a City\" had a different arrangement and lyrics from the album version. The Schizoid Band based their arrangement on the latter, so this article uses that title for consistency.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
