It is an adaptation of the 1930 play Elizabeth the Queen by Maxwell Anderson. The film was directed by George Schaefer.\nCast\nProduction\nIn 1964 George Schaefer said he had decided not to do a production of this or another Maxwell Anderson play, Mary Queen of Scot, because they depended on pageantry, which was hard to do on television.\nSchaefer changed his mind and Judith Anderson signed to star in a production in May 1967. It was her third production for the Hallmark Hall of Fame following Macbeth and The Cradle Song. She had performed in the play the year before in New York and received poor reviews but insisted the production was faulty rather than the play itself. Charlton Heston agreed to co star.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171103164939/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7114ffb3 Elizabeth the Queen] at BFI"
