The novel also has an Audiobook available, narrated by Keith Nobbs.\nPlot\nNo Talking centers around a group of exuberant fifth grade boys and girls at the fictional Laketon Elementary School who engage in a no-talking contest. The competition proves to be more challenging than either team anticipated, as they struggle to remain silent while going about their daily routines.\nThe characters Lynsey and Dave are chosen as the team captains. They agree to a set of rules, where both teams are allowed to speak three words when questioned by teachers. As the competition intensifies, the students discover creative ways to make noises without speaking, leading to many situations and twists.\nThe contest goes on for days, and the fifth grade hall becomes very silent during lunch, leaving the principal in disbelief. She even decides to join the competition herself. As the story unfolds, the students learn valuable lessons about communication, cooperation, and self-control, ultimately coming to a fitting resolution.\nThemes\nThe novel explores several themes. One is the practice of silence, inspired by Gandhi idea of taking a vow of silence for at least one day a week. Various benefits of silence are depicted such as self-reflection, improved communication skills, and increased understanding of others.\nAnother significant theme in the novel is the accommodation made by the school for a particularly noisy and talkative group of fifth grade students. The story raises questions about how schools might accommodate students' diverse learning styles and behaviors while maintaining a productive learning environment.\nAnother key theme in the novel is about gender dynamics in elementary school. The boys and girls are portrayed as equal in their abilities and intelligence, but different in their approach to communication and social interactions. The novel challenges traditional gender roles and stereotypes, encouraging readers to think critically about gender dynamics in society.\nThe novel explores the concept of civil disobedience when the students' right to remain silent is challenged by the school's teachers. The students use creative and peaceful means to protest against the school's rules and regulations, demonstrating the power of nonviolent resistance and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs.\nAwards\nThe book won the 2010 California Young Reader Medal.\nReferences"
