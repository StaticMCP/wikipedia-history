Renamed the 10th Queen's Own Canadian Hussars''' in 1903. It was disbanded on 15 August 1913.\nOn 1 August 1928 the 10th were re-raised, again in Quebec City, but disbanded permanently on 1 February 1936 along with 13 other regiments as part of the 1936 militia reorganization.\nAlthough not sent as a unit to the Second Boer War, some personnel volunteered to serve with the Canadian Mounted Rifles (CMR), which was raised to soldier in that campaign.  Various sources list individuals from the QOCH who were attached to the CMR (First Contingent) such as the following members of \"E\"&nbsp;Company (Montreal):\n*Dynes, E. J.\n*Home, F.\n*Lee, F.\n*Sheehan, M.\n*Tregett, J.\nAmongst the number who volunteered for service against the Boer republics was 29-year-old Richard Turner, who had been commissioned into the QOCH as a lieutenant, rising to the rank of major.  In order to serve overseas he dropped rank to lieutenant and joined the Royal Canadian Dragoons.  During his service there he gained the Victoria Cross along with two other RCD soldiers, Lieutenant Hampden Cockburn and Sergeant Edward Holland. Turner was given command of the 10th QOCH as a lieutenant-colonel.  He was eventually promoted to lieutenant-general during the First World War, although his career finished ignominiously after a friendly fire incident near the town of St. Eloi in September 1916.  This resulted in him being removed from command and given administrative jobs for the rest of his time with the Canadian forces.\nUniform and badge\nThe uniform was similar to that of Imperial hussar regiments: dark blue with gold frogging on the jacket and a double yellow stripe on the trousers. Unlike other Canadian hussar regiments the QOCH also wore a busby similar to their imperial cousins.  The rest of the Canadian hussars (with the exception of the 8th) wore a white pith helmet until they replaced them with busbies in the early 1900s.\nThe badge had a blackened silver maple leaf as the central device and was attached to the main body by two pins.  The rest of the badge is gilded.  The collar dogs (badges worn on the lapel) were all gilt.\nNotable members\n* Lieutenant-General Richard Turner\nSee also\n* List of regiments of cavalry of the Canadian Militia (1900–1920)\n* History of the Canadian Army\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
