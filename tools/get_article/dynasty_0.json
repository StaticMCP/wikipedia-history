Menes is often associated with Narmer, although the latter's successor, Hor-Aha, is also proposed. This era, located at the very end of the Predynastic period, corresponds to the Protodynastic period of ancient Egypt, and the final phase of the archaeological period of the Naqada culture, called Naqada III, and sees the rise of Egyptian royalty, first in Upper Egypt with three identified proto-kingdoms, leading, at some point in the period, to Egyptian unification.\nIn this period, those kings' names were inscribed in the form of serekhs on a variety of surfaces including pottery and tombs. The period was characterized by constant conflict with the people of the Nile Delta, probably for the control of valuable trade routes with the Levant.\nThe Egyptian rulers of the period, attributed to \"Dynasty 0\", and may have ruled over some parts of Upper Egypt. They include rather obscure rulers such as Crocodile, Iry-Hor, Ka, and perhaps by the king Scorpion II, whose name may refer to, or be derived from, the goddess Serket, a special early protector of other deities and the rulers. The period ended with the rise of Narmer, who became the first king of the First Dynasty and the first unifier of Egypt.\nUpper Egypt\nFor Upper Egypt in the south, the following Dynasty 0 rulers have been listed: A, Finger Snail, Fish, Elephant, Stork, Bull, Scorpion I, Crocodile, Iry-Hor, Ka, Scorpion II, Narmer / Menes\nLower Egypt\nFor Lower Egypt in the north, the following Dynasty 0 rulers have been listed: Hedju Hor, Ny-Hor, Ni-Neith, Hat-Hor, Pu, Hsekiu, Khayu, Tiu, Thesh, Neheb, Wazner, Mekh, Double Falcon, Wash\nFile:AbydosSatMap 1stDyn.jpg|Iry-Hor's tomb at the Umm el-Qa'ab comprises two separate chambers B1 and B2, and Ka's tomb is in B7, B8, B9\nFile:Ka vessel.JPG|Vessel found at Tarkhan bearing the serekh of King Ka.
