The hill played a crucial role in the history of the state during the Paraguayan War. Observation points were established on the hill to prevent a potential Paraguayan incursion via the Cuiabá River.\nThe hill is also depicted on the coat of arms of the state. Its grandeur has made it one of the state's postcards.\nThe hill is located along the Palmiro Paes de Barros Highway, with access via a trail that begins about 8&nbsp;km after the Rodovia dos Imigrantes intersection, heading towards Santo Antônio.\nIn June 2006, it was listed as a Historic, Cultural, and Environmental Heritage of Mato Grosso through Law 7,381/00, proposed by then-deputy Carlos Alves de Brito.\nReferences\nExternal links"
