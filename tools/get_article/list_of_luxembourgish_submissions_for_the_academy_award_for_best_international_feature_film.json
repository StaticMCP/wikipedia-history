The Foreign Language Film award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.\nAs of 2025, Luxembourg ha submitted twenty films, but none of them have been nominated.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nBecause of Luxembourg's small size, most submitted films were co-productions with neighboring countries. Pol Cruchten represented the country three times, more than any other Luxembourgian director.\nOf Luxembourg's 18 eligible submissions, two were animated films, and three were documentaries. About half the films were mostly in French, with only five dominantly in the national language, Luxembourgish.\nIn 2006, AMPAS disqualified Your Name is Justine, arguing that Luxembourg did not have sufficient artistic control over the multi-national film, which was directed by a Poland-based Venezuelan director, set in Germany and Poland, shot mostly in Polish and English but funded primarily by Luxembourg. The film was originally considered to represent Poland, but it failed to make Poland's four-film shortlist that year and it was subsequently selected to represent Luxembourg.\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Luxembourg's Oscar Selection Committee met each year and announced that the country would not send a film due to a lack of suitable candidates.\nEver since the controversy of 2006, all of Luxembourg's Oscar submissions have been directed by native-born Luxembourgish directors, with the exception of 2019's Tel Aviv on Fire directed by Sameh Zoabi, a Palestinian director who holds Israeli citizenship, was one of five films shortlisted by Israel but ended up representing Luxembourg when Israel selected Incitement instead. Although set in Israel and the West Bank, it was filmed mostly in Luxembourg with a largely locally based crew and was accepted by AMPAS to represent AMPAS.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Luxembourg for review by the academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"width:98%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n!
