So when the God resides within a forest, the place can be rightly named as Baneshwar. This name is given to the Baneshwar temple which is located in the midst of a dense green patch. The place looked appeared to be quite interesting and appealing when our college group was looking for a place to hang out and have a nice day out as it was our supposedly \"last trip\" of our \"university days\". None had any objection as it was just about 45 kms away from Pune. We all gathered at our main gate of University of Pune, and we moved ahead in one of our classmate's car towards the winding road of Baneshwar. That was our first visit to Baneshwar. The place called me again and again, and I visited two more times with my family and friends. In all the trips Baneshwar was equally inviting and attractive in its own special ways.\nLegend\nBaneshwar temple architecture is from the medieval period. The temple was constructed in 1749 by Balaji Baji Rao, son of Peshwa Bajirao I.The total cost of construction was 11,426 Rupees, 8 Aane, 6 Paise.\nThe temple hosts an important bell which was captured by Chimaji Appa after defeating the Portuguese in the battle of Bassien in 1739. The bell has the year 1683 and a Cross on it, which depicts that the bell belonged to a church and was transported as a token of victory. Same kind of 4 more Portuguese bells can be found at Bhimashankar Temple, Omkareshwar temple- Pune, Shiva temple(Menavali-Wai) and Ramling temple(Shirur)  too.\nSurroundings\nBaneshwar is a conserve forest area and wildlife sanctuary where a variety of birds, flowers, plants can be seen. Baneshwar is worth visiting for jungle lovers and trekkers as well as for pilgrims. This temple is very famous in Pune and people from all around come to visit this temple. The Red-eared slider and soft shell turtle can be seen in the holy pond in the temple.\nThere is a scenic waterfall behind the premises of the Mandir.\nTransportation\nBaneshwar is approximately 37&nbsp;km from Pune and 200&nbsp;km from Mumbai. From Pune Government MSRTC buses are available at a regular frequency.\nVisit period\nThe best time to visit is between August and February. Though any time of the year is good to visit, it is better to avoid visiting during summer. Similarly during monsoon unless one likes trekking, it is better to avoid. That leaves the best period to seven months between August and February.\nReferences\nGallery\nFile:Baneshwar 11.JPG|Baneshwar Temple Entrance\nFile:Baneshwar Entrance.JPG|Baneshwar Temple Entrance\nFile:Baneshwar 12.JPG|Bell at Baneshwar Temple\nFile:Baneshwar Waterfall.jpg|Baneshwar Waterfall\nFile:Baneshwar 03.JPG|Baneshwar Temple\nFile:Baneshwar Jungle.jpg|Baneshwar Jungle around the temple\nFile:Baneshwar Garden.JPG|Baneshwar Garden\nFile:Baneshwar 08.JPG|Baneshwar Temple Entrance\nExternal links"
