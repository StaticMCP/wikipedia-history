As the club did not participate in the 1999 U.S. Open Cup, and did not qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs, they participated only in the MLS regular season.\nSummary\nAt the end of the 1998 season, Walter Zenga made history by becoming the league's fist-ever player-manager. Zenga's Revolution showed their intent to return to the playoffs for the first time since 1997 by signing former United States men's national soccer team captain John Harkes, and 1996 MLS All-Stars Giovanni Savarese and Dan Calichman prior to the 1999 Major League Soccer season. Zenga's Revolution got its first win on April 3. The team made several acquisitions in mid-season, including then-highest-paid MLS player of all time Ariel Graziani, two-time MLS Cup champion Mario Gori, two-time MLS All-Star Leonel Alvarez, and Jeff Baicher, but were unable to make a run, going on a ten-game winless streak from early July to early September, then winning only two of their final six matches to round out the season. On September 30, following a loss to the Dallas Burn, the Revolution made a late-season coaching change (for the second year in a row) as Zenga was relieved of his playing and coaching duties and replaced by Steve Nicol for the team's final two matches.\nDespite poor on-field performance, fan support remained strong for the Revolution. The club's average home attendance of 16,735 was fourth-highest in the league. Joe-Max Moore's 15 goals tied him for fourth-highest total in the league with San Jose's Ronald Cerritos. Moore, Harkes, and Zenga were all named to the 1999 MLS All-Star Game. Despite these accolades, the Revolution would miss the playoffs for the second season in a row, recording a record of 7 wins and 20 losses, placing fifth in the Eastern Conference and 10th in the overall MLS table.\nSquad\nFirst Team Squad\n''The New England Revolution's 1999 roster adapted from the document \"Club History: All-Time Results\"''.\nPlayer Movement\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a; text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | New England Revolution – 1999 Transfers In\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Position\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Method\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Fee\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Previous Club\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Reference\n|-\n| Dan Calichman || D || January 5, 1999 || Trade || N/A || LA Galaxy ||\n|-\n| Giovanni Savarese || F || January 20, 1999 || Trade || N/A || MetroStars ||\n|-\n|  Leighton O’Brien || M || February 7, 1999 || SuperDraft || N/A || San Diego Toreros ||\n|-\n| Chris Fox || D || February 7, 1999 || SuperDraft ||N/A ||Brown University ||\n|-\n| Paulo Dos Santos || M || March 12, 1999 || Free Transfer || N/A ||Rhode Island Stingrays ||\n|-\n| John Harkes || M || March 16, 1999 || Return from Loan || N/A || Nottingham Forest ||\n|-\n| Tony Kuhn || F || April 5, 1999 || Waiver Claim || N/A || Chicago Fire ||\n|-\n|Carlos Parra || M || June 4, 1999 || Trade || N/A || Miami Fusion ||\n|-\n|  Chaka Daley || D || June 14, 1999 || Free Transfer || N/A || Boston Bulldogs ||\n|-\n| Mario Gori || D || June 22, 1999 || Trade || N/A || Miami Fusion ||\n|-\n|| Ariel Graziani || F || July 26, 1999 || Allocation || N/A || Monarcas Morelia ||\n|-\n|| Leonel Alvarez || M || August 13, 1999 || Trade || N/A || Dallas Burn ||\n|-\n|| Jeff Baicher || M || August 13, 1999 || Trade || N/A || San Jose Clash ||\n|-\n|| Eduardo Hurtado || F || December 3, 1999 || Waiver Claim || N/A || MetroStars ||\n|-\n||Mauricio Ramos || M || December 6, 1999 || Trade || N/A || Tampa Bay Mutiny ||\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a; text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | New England Revolution – 1999 Transfers Out\n|-\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Position\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Date\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Method\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Fee\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Next Club\n! style=\"background:#0c1527; color:#fff; border:2px solid #e20e2a;\" scope=\"col\" | Reference\n|-\n|  Ian Feuer || GK || February 24, 1999 || Trade || N/A || Colorado Rapids ||\n|-\n|Chris Fox || M || March 30, 1999 || Waived || N/A || Boston Bulldogs ||\n|-\n| Leighton O'Brien || M || March 30, 1999 || Waived || N/A || San Jose Clash ||\n|-\n| Carlos Rocha || F || March 30, 1999 || Waived || N/A || Boston Bulldogs ||\n|-\n| Tony Kuhn || F || June 4, 1999 || Traded || N/A || Miami Fusion ||\n|-\n| Manny Motajo || D || June 14, 1999 || Waived || N/A || N/A ||\n|-\n| Edwin Gorter || M || June 22, 1999 || Traded || N/A || Miami Fusion ||\n|-\n| Ariel Graziani || F || August 13, 1999 || Traded || N/A || Dallas Burn ||\n|-\n|  Jair || M || August 13, 1999 || Traded || N/A || San Jose Clash ||\n|-\n| Walter Zenga || GK || September 30, 1999 || \"Relieved\" || N/A || N/A ||\n|-\n| Joe-Max More || F || November 11, 1999 || Free Transfer || N/A || Everton F.C. ||\n|-\n| Mario Gori || D || November 22, 1999 || Waived || N/A || Columbus Crew ||\n|-\n| Chaka Daley || D || November 22, 1999 || Waived || N/A || N/A ||\n|-\n| Kris Kelderman || M || December 1, 1999 || Waived || N/A || Milwaukee Wave ||\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nAcquired from LA Galaxy in exchange for a first-round pick in the 1999 MLS Supplemental Draft and a second-round pick in the 1999 MLS College Draft.\n:2.
