Despite this, there are informal connections.\nHistory and modern relations\nBoth nations have an Arab majority. The future founder of Polisario Front, El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed, used to meet Palestinian leaders during 1970s in Lebanon, in which he was influenced by the Israeli occupation. Fearing a future Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara, the Polisario Front was established, in a similar format to the PFLP. The flag of Western Sahara draws from the flag of Palestine. The influence of the Sahrawi independence movement draws a level of sympathy toward Sahrawis among Palestinians.\nGeorge Habash, one of the founders of Palestine's PLO, met with Brahim Ghali in 1979 and indicated solidarity with the Western Saharan cause. Both countries share similar styles of struggling, including conducting guerrilla warfare, against both Israel and Morocco.\nIn 2016, the Palestinian Solidarity Committee with Western Sahara was banned from entering Gaza by Hamas.\n2023 Israel–Hamas war\nOn 10 October 2023, the Polisario Front expressed support for the Palestinian people. On 15 October, Sahrawi Ambassador to Algeria, Abdelkader Taleb Omar, met with the PFLP political representative to Algeria, Nader Qaisi, at the Sahrawi Embassy in Algiers. SADR was among the countries that condemned Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion.\nReferences"
