He went on to University College, Oxford, and took the degree of B.A. on 1 March 1808. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple on 28 June 1811.\nThrough his connection with Jamaica, Dwarris was appointed in 1822 one of the commissioners to inquire into the state of the law in the colonies in the West Indies. An act of parliament was based upon his report (he was the only surviving commissioner), and he was knighted on 2 May 1838. He acted s a member of the commission for examining into the municipal corporations, a master of the Queen's Bench, recorder of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and counsel to the Board of Health. In 1850 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple, and in 1859 he was appointed its treasurer.\nDwarris was a Fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a vice-president of the Archæological Association, and a member of the Archæological Institute.

The opinion of Dwarris was that the Letters of Junius were written by several persons, of whom Sir Philip Francis was the leading light.\n* ‘A Letter to the Fellows of the Royal Society of Antiquaries on the Present Condition and Future Prospects of the Society,’ privately printed, 1852; an argument in favour of a reduction in the rate of subscription and on the necessity for increased energy in the society's operations.\n* ‘A Letter to the Lord Chancellor on his Proposed Scheme for the Consolidation of the Statute Law,’ 1853.\n* ‘The Widow's Rescue,’ ‘Select Eulogies,’ ‘Schooled or Fooled,’ a tale, ‘Collected and Recollected,’ 1855.\nHe wrote also in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association and  Archæologia.\nFamily\nOn 28 February 1811 Dwarris married Alicia, daughter of Robert Brereton, a captain in the army.
