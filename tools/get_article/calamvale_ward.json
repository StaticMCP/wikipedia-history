The ward is currently represented by Emily Kim of the Labor Party.\nCalamvale replaced Parkinson Ward, which itself replaced Acacia Ridge Ward.\nHistory\nA 2015 redistribution created Calamvale Ward, replacing Parkinson Ward while gaining area from the former Karawatha Ward in the east and losing area to Forest Lake and Moorooka Ward in the west. These changes increased the LNP margin from 17.1% to 18.1%. Owen-Taylor went on to win the 2016 election.\nCouncillors for Calamvale Ward\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Angela Owen\n| Liberal National\n| 19 March 2016  – 16 March 2024\n| Formerly known as Angela Owen-Taylor.\nLost re-election.\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Emily Kim\n| Labor\n| 16 March 2024 – present\n| Incumbent\n|}\nElectoral results\n2024\n2020\n2016\nReferences"
