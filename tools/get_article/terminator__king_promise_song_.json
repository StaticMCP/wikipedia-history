He became the first Afrobeats artist to perform in Singapore. In an interview with BET, King Promise explained his reaction to the song's success.  I've had a few number ones, if not a lot, so I could tell where it was going. But, obviously, it's done a lot of things that all those records didn't do. Obviously, it’s different times like when I dropped ‘Commando’ in 2019. Now, it's like TikTok. ‘Terminator’ just took off crazy. Did I expect it that crazy? I didn't think little. I just allowed my imagination to fly like, ‘let's see how far it gets,’ but I couldn't pinpoint it was gonna get there.}}\nRemixes\nOn 14 July 2023, King Promise released a remix to the song, featuring Nigerian singer and producer Young Jonn. By then, the song had already reached 20 million streams. On 8 December 2023, he released another remix to the song, this time featuring Jamaican artist Sean Paul and Nigerian singer Tiwa Savage.\nAccolades\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Awards and nominations for \"Terminator\"\n!Organization\n!Year\n!Category\n!Result\n! class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|3Music Awards\n|2024\n|Song Of The Year\n|\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\" scope=\"row\"|Ghana Music Awards\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2024\n|Most Popular Song\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\"|\n|-\n|International Collaboration of The Year\n|\n|-\n|Best Afropop Song\n|\n|}\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Terminator\"\n!Chart (2023)\n!Peak\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Nigeria (TurnTable Top 100)\n|align=center|6\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class = \"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release history for \"Terminator\"\n!Region\n!Date\n!Format\n!Version\n!Label\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| Various\n|5 May 2023\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|Original\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n|6 July 2023\n|Remix\n|-\n|8 December 2023\n|Remix\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
