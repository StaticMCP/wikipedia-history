He continued to recognize vassal dependence on Abdullah, but by early 1583, the situation had changed. While returning from a campaign in Andijan and Fergana, Tawakkul began to suspect that Abdullah harbored ill intentions toward him. Not wanting to risk the consequences, he left and retreated to Dasht-i-Kipchak.\nHistorical sources do not provide a clear explanation for Tawakkul's decision, but several plausible reasons can be suggested. Abdullah did not ascend to power through traditional succession but rather through military success and political cunning. He not only eliminated his rivals but also ensured their complete eradication, often using others— including Tawakkul himself— to achieve this. Once Abdullah had unified all of Maverannahr and removed all potential challengers from the Shaybanid dynasty, Tawakkul's position became precarious. As a descendant of Jochi, he had a legitimate claim to power in the region, a fact later confirmed by the events of 1598.\nAdditionally, Tawakkul may have grown disillusioned with Abdullah's policies. It is known that Abdullah had promised the Kazakhs four cities in Turkestan but failed to fulfill this promise after securing his rule. This betrayal may have further influenced Tawakkul's decision to sever ties with the ruler.\nCampaign\nIn 1586, Tavakkul began his struggle for control over the cities in the Syr Darya region. He attempted to capture Tashkent, taking advantage of the fact that Abdullah Khan's main forces were concentrated in the south. Tavakkul attacked the northern territories of Mawarannahr, posing a threat to key centers such as Turkestan, Tashkent, and even Samarkand. The hastily assembled Tashkent militia was unable to put up significant resistance and was swiftly defeated by the nomads. The armies clashed in Sharabkhan, located in the Tashkent district. The Kazakh warriors were poorly equipped: \"fur coats and felt cloaks served them as armor and cuirasses.\" Overconfident in their advantage, the Tashkent forces recklessly launched an attack on the steppe warriors but met fierce resistance, were overwhelmed, and suffered a crushing defeat. After defeating the Tashkent militia, he chose not to engage in further battle when Ubaydullah, the brother of Abdullah Khan, marched from Samarkand. As a result, Tavakkul was forced to retreat, and his first attempt to seize Tashkent ended in failure.\nTaukeel Khan, demonstrating outstanding military skills, achieved significant success by securing several important victories. As a result of his campaigns, some cities of Turkestan were incorporated into the Kazakh Khanate.\nReferences"
