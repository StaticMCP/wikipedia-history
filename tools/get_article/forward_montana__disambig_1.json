It is described as a \"non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to training, mobilizing, and electing a new generation of progressive leaders in Montana\".[http://www.westernstatescenter.org/region/montana.html Western States Center]  It was co-founded by Billings-born blogger Matt Singer, along with several members of the Montana Public Interest Research Group and The Associated Students of The University of Montana, in 2006.\nActivities\nForward Montana played a critical role in the 2007 municipal election in Missoula, unseating conservative incumbent Missoula City Council member Don Nicolson in a close race with progressive candidate Pam Walzer.[http://www.newwest.net/city/article/missoula_city_councils_new_progressive_majority/C8/L8/ Missoula City Council’s New Progressive Majority | Missoula | New West Network] The organization used their Pink Bunnies campaign to register young voters and turn them out for the election. The campaign proved interesting enough to warrant Missoula Mayor John Engen to issue a proclamation, making the day before voter registration closed \"Official Pink Bunny Day\" citywide. The campaign registered more than 1,000 voters—more than one-third of all the city's new registrants.\nForward Montana also helped turn out hundreds of voters using candidate forums like Candidates Gone Wild, in which candidate's ideas were presented as a talent show rather than in standard Q&A style forums.[http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2007/10/04/news/local/znews01.txt Missoulian: Eccentric forum provides new outlet for City Council hopefuls]\nAfter two members of Missoula's LGBTQ community were physically assaulted, Forward Montana co-organized the rally \"We Are Missoula... Stand Up, Speak OUT!\" The rally drew over 300 people, with help from groups like Western Montana Gay & Lesbian Community Center and the YWCA of Missoula.[ QSaltLake - Utah's Gay and Lesbian News & Entertainment Magazine - Mont.
