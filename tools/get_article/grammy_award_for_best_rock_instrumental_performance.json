Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nThe award was first presented at the 1980 Grammy Awards to Paul McCartney and Wings for \"Rockestra Theme\". From 1986 to 1989, the category was known as Best Rock Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist). According to the category description guide for the 2010 awards, the award is presented to artists \"for newly recorded rock, hard rock or metal instrumental performances\".\nJeff Beck holds the records for the most wins, with six. Sting has received three awards, twice as a member of The Police—although he had no part in the band's \"Behind My Camel\", the 1982 award winner which he did not write and on which he refused to play.\nTwo-time recipients include Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana (once as a member of the band Santana), The Flaming Lips, Steve Vai, and brothers Jimmie Vaughan and Stevie Ray Vaughan (each once as part of the duo Vaughan Brothers). At the 2009 awards, the tribute act Zappa Plays Zappa (led by Dweezil Zappa, son of Frank Zappa) earned an award for their performance of Frank's instrumental song \"Peaches en Regalia\". Dweezil and Frank have both received multiple nominations and even competed against one another in 1988. Joe Satriani holds the record for the most nominations (as well as the record for the most nominations without a win), with fourteen.\nThe award was discontinued before the 2012 awards due to a major overhaul of Grammy categories. All instrumental performances in the rock category were shifted to either the newly formed Best Rock Performance or Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance categories.\nRecipients\nPaul McCartney with fellow Wings member [[Linda McCartney in 1976]]\nSting (twice as a member of The Police) performing in 2007]]\n1985 award-winning band Yes performing in 1977]]\nSix-time award winner Jeff Beck performing in Sydney, Australia in 2009\n1988 award recipient Frank Zappa in 1977]]\nTwo-time award winner Carlos Santana (once as the leader of the band Santana) performing in 2000\nEric Johnson, 1992 award winner, in 2007]]\nTwo-time award winner Steve Vai in 2005\nTwo-time award recipient Eric Clapton performing in 2008\nWayne Coyne of the two-time award-winning band [[The Flaming Lips performing in 2004]]\n2006 award winner Les Paul in 2008]]\n2008 award winner Bruce Springsteen performing in 2008]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\" | Performing artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Work\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1980\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1981\n| The Police\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1982\n| The Police\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1983\n| A Flock of Seagulls\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1984\n| Sting\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1985\n| Yes\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1986\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1987\n| Art of Noise featuring Duane Eddy\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1988\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1989\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1990\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1991\n| Jimmie Vaughan & Stevie Ray Vaughan\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1992\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1993\n|  & Double Trouble\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1994\n|\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1995\n| Pink Floyd\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1996\n| The Allman Brothers Band\n|\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1997\n| , Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Robert Cray, B.B.
