Coles meets with the two firefighter union leaders, Fire Capt. Peter L. Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association and Kevin E. Gallagher, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, at New York City Hall to discuss the firefighters' unhappiness with the October 31 decision.\n*Night: The unions fax a notice to the New York firefighters to hold a demonstration on Friday morning.\n*Near midnight: Rudy Giuliani calls from Yankee Stadium at the World Series to Fire Commissioner Thomas von Essen about talk of a protest.\nFriday, November 2, 2001\n*Approximately 10:30&nbsp;a.m. EST Emotions spill over into violence at a two-hour protest by several hundred to a thousand firefighters near City Hall, beginning at West and Chambers Streets, to protest Giuliani's October 31st ruling to reduce the number of firefighters permitted at the World Trade Center site from 64 to 25. After firefighter Mike Heffernan, brother of John Heffernan, retired fire captain Bill Butler, father of Tommy Butler, and Kevin E. Gallagher, the president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, speak, the assembled protesters push aside a barricade and begin walking south down West Street. At the next barricade the police move in, punches are thrown, and firefighters handcuffed. Both sides shout for understanding, and the conflict quickly subsides. The firefighters then march out to the applause of construction workers, the protest breaking up around 12:30&nbsp;p.m.\n* 12 firefighters (including four ranking fire officers and one fire marshal) are arrested and taken to the 28th Precinct station house in central Harlem. 5 police officers are injured, two with black eyes and facial trauma, three with neck, shoulder and back injuries.\nMonday, November 12, 2001\n, moments before taking off on its final flight. The crash of Flight 587, which was as a result of pilot error, resulted in renewed fears of terrorist activity.]]\n* Approximately 9:16&nbsp;a.m. EST - American Airlines Flight 587 crashes in Belle Harbor, Queens, New York. 265 people, 260 on the plane, are killed. Originally thought to be terrorism and claimed as a victory by Al-Qaeda, an NTSB investigation finds the cause of the crash to be pilot error as a result of misuse of the aircraft's rudder; the Airbus A300 had taken off moments after a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 had taken off from the same runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which caused the Airbus A300 to be affected by the 747's wake turbulence. In an attempt to fight against the turbulence, the first officer repeatedly and aggressively moved the plane's rudder from extreme left to right, inflicting enough metal fatigue to cause the entire vertical stabiliser to shear off, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. As a precaution, the Empire State Building and UN headquarters are evacuated. Months later, Abderraouf Jdey is named by Al-Qaeda operative Mohammed Jabarah as the person responsible for the disaster, but this cannot be confirmed by any source investigating the crash.\nMonday, November 19, 2001\n* The Transportation Security Administration, also known as TSA, is formed.\nDecember\nSunday, December 16, 2001\n* The last remnants of the North Tower's facade are cut down.\nThursday, December 20, 2001\n* The last fires at the World Trade Center site are extinguished.\n2002\nFebruary\nSunday, February 3, 2002\n* Super Bowl XXXVI is held in New Orleans, becoming the first sporting event designated by the Department of Homeland Security as a National Special Security Event.
