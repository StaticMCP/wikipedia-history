This is a listing of those memorials maintained solely or jointly by the CWGC that commemorate by name the British and Commonwealth dead from the Western Front during World War I whose bodies were not recovered, or whose remains could not be identified. In addition to those listed here, there are numerous CWGC memorials to the missing from other battlefields around the world during the war, which are not listed here, most notably the memorials at Gallipoli, and the memorials to those lost at sea and in the air. There are also memorials to the missing from other combatant nations on the Western Front, especially those of Germany and France, but only the CWGC-maintained memorials are listed here.\nAlthough listing the names of dead soldiers on memorials had started with the Boer Wars, this practice was only systematically adopted after World War I, with the establishment of the Imperial War Graves Commission, which was later renamed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Due to the rapid movement of forces in the early stages of the war, many of the casualties of the initial World War I battles had no known grave, and were instead commemorated after the war on 'memorials to the missing'. In later battles, the intensity of the fighting sometimes meant that bodies could not be recovered or identified until much later. The highest number of casualties occurred on the Western Front in France and Belgium. In total, over 20 separate CWGC or national memorials to the missing of the Western Front were designed and built. They were commissioned and unveiled over a period of around 15 years from the early 1920s to 1938, when the last of the planned memorials was unveiled. The numbers listed on the memorials reduces over time as remains are discovered, identified, and buried in a war grave, with the name removed from the memorial where it was listed, but over 300,000 war dead are still commemorated by these memorials to the missing.\nList of memorials\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: auto auto\"\n|+ Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) World War I memorials in Belgium and France\n!Article and reference!!class=\"unsortable\"|Picture!!Country!!class=\"unsortable\"|Location!!class=\"unsortable\"|Co-ordinates!!Number listed!!class=\"unsortable\"|Description of those listed!!class=\"unsortable\"|Dates covered!!class=\"unsortable\"|Major battles!!Date unveiled!!class=\"unsortable\"|Memorial designer!!class=\"unsortable\"|Memorial unveiled by\n|-\n| Thiepval Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/80800 CWGC]\n|  || France || Thiepval ||  || 72,194 || United Kingdom and South Africa || July 1916 to March 1918 || Somme Offensive ||  || Edwin Lutyens || Edward, Prince of Wales\n|-\n| Menin Gate Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/91800 CWGC]\n|  || Belgium || Ypres ||  || 54,382 || Commonwealth nations, except New Zealand || October 1914 to 16 August 1917 || Ypres Salient ||  || Reginald Blomfield || Lord Plumer\n|-\n| Tyne Cot Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/85900 CWGC]\n|  || Belgium || Ypres ||  || 34,916 || Commonwealth nations || 16 August 1917 to September 1918 || Ypres Salient ||  || Herbert Baker || Sir Gilbert Dyett\n|-\n| Arras Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/82700 CWGC]\n|  || France || Arras ||  || 34,785 || United Kingdom, South Africa and New Zealand || Spring of 1916 to 7 August 1918 || Battle of Arras ||  || Edwin Lutyens || Lord Trenchard\n|-\n| Loos Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/79500 CWGC]\n|  || France || Loos-en-Gohelle ||  || 20,610 || Commonwealth nations except India and Canada || 25 September 1915 to 11 November 1918 || casualties in the area during and after the Battle of Loos ||  || Herbert Baker || Sir Nevil Macready\n|-\n| Pozières Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/87600 CWGC]\n|  || France || Pozières ||  || 14,692 || United Kingdom and South Africa || 21 March 1918 to 7 August 1918 || German spring offensive ||  || William Harrison Cowlishaw || Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien\n|-\n| Le Touret Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/85800 CWGC]\n|  || France || Richebourg-l'Avoué ||  || 13,389 || Commonwealth nations except India and Canada || 1914 to 25 September 1915 || casualties in the area prior to the Battle of Loos ||  || John Reginald Truelove || Lord Tyrrell\n|-\n| Ploegsteert Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/88800 CWGC]\n|  || Belgium || Messines ||  || 11,389 || United Kingdom and South Africa || October 1914 to September 1918 || casualties in and around the Ypres Salient, not major offensives ||  || Harold Chalton Bradshaw || Leopold, Prince of Belgium\n|-\n| Vimy Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/87900 CWGC]\n|  || France || Vimy ||  || 11,169 || Canada || entire war, especially April 1917 || several battles, especially the Battle of Vimy Ridge ||  || Walter Seymour Allward || Edward VIII\n|-\n| Villers-Bretonneux Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/93000 CWGC]\n|  || France || Villers-Bretonneux ||  || 10,773 || Australia || entire war, especially April 1918 || several battles, especially the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux ||  || Edwin Lutyens || King George VI\n|-\n| Vis-en-Artois Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/79200 CWGC]\n|  || France || Vis-en-Artois ||  || 9,843 || United Kingdom and South Africa || 8 August 1918 to 11 November 1918 || Advance to Victory ||  || John Reginald Truelove || Rt.

United Kingdom and South African forces are named on the memorials designated for the areas where they fell. The South African national memorial at Delville Wood has no names inscribed on it, as the names are listed on the battlefield memorials instead. The other Commonwealth nations have national memorials dedicated to their missing who fell on the Western Front: the Neuve-Chapelle Memorial to the forces of India; the Vimy Memorial to the forces of Canada and the Beaumont-Hamel Memorial to the forces of Newfoundland; the Villers-Brettonneux Memorial to the forces of Australia; and the Messines Ridge Memorial to the forces of New Zealand (the latter is one of seven memorials on the Western Front dedicated to New Zealanders). The missing war dead of Ireland, at the time of the war still part of the United Kingdom, are numbered among the UK forces (as were English, Scottish and Welsh troops) and listed with them on the memorials. The main memorials to the Irish war dead, one in France and one in Belgium, are the Ulster Tower and the Island of Ireland Peace Park, unveiled in 1921 and 1998 respectively.\n* Delville Wood Memorial (South Africa)\n* Vimy Memorial (Canada)\n* Villers-Bretonneux Memorial (Australia)\n* Neuve-Chapelle Memorial (India)\n* Beaumont-Hamel Memorial (Newfoundland)\n* Messines Ridge Memorial (New Zealand)\nSee also\n* List of Commonwealth War Graves Commission World War II memorials to the missing\n* Canadian First World War Memorials In Europe (template listing)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.britishwargraves.co.uk/page5.htm World War I memorials to the missing] (www.britishwargraves.co.uk)\n* [http://www.worldwar1.nl/memorials/memorials.html World War I memorials to the missing] (www.worldwar1.nl)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071225143907/http://www.malvernremembers.org.uk/CWGCMemorials.html World War I memorials to the missing] (www.malvernremembers.org.uk)\n* [http://www.remembering.org.uk/memorials_missing_france.htm World War I memorials to the missing] (www.remembering.org.uk)\n* [http://www.geo-animate.com/category/world-war-i/commonwealth-war-graves/ Animation of Commonwealth war casualties during World War I] (www.geo-animate.com)"
