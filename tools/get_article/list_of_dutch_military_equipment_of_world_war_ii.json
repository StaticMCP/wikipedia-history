World War II was a global war that began in 1939 and ended in 1945. On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands, aiming to dominate Europe. The country was fully occupied by 17 May. By 12 March 1942, the Germans and Japanese controlled the Dutch mainland and all their major colonies. Dutch power was not restored until final Axis collapse in 1945. This list covers the equipment of armed elements centered on Royal Netherlands Army and Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, but not the Free Dutch Forces, which was equipped mainly by the Western Allies.\nKnives and bayonets\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
