It was written by M.M. McCormack and produced by The Danzigers.\nPlot\nMan-about-town Tony Evers is engaged to society girl Audrey Page. Audrey breaks their engagement because her domineering mother believes Tony is only after the family money.  When Tony sues Audrey for breach of promise, Mrs Page hires a private investigator to look into Tony's affairs. When Tony is able to account for all the strange things she finds out about his past, and he also discloses that on marriage he is due a large inheritance from his grandfather, Audrey renews the engagement.\nCast\n* Jill Ireland as Audrey Page\n* Francis Matthews as Tony Evers\n* Olaf Pooley as Cranborn\n* Joan Haythorne as Mrs Page\n* Richard Caldicot as judge\n* Neil Hallett as Charles Whiley\n* Michael Beint as Dodson\n* Derek Tansley as Ernest Gabbell\nReception\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Unsubtle romantic comedy in need of more incisive court-room characterisation and less hasty direction. The playing is over-anxious.\"\nKine Weekly wrote: \"The picture, fashioned with TV-like hastiness, has some rough edges, but the overall effect ls not unfunny. Jill Ireland makes a refined and ravishing, Audrey, and Francis Matthews pulls a few rabbits out of the hat as Tony, but Joan Haythorne overdoes it a bit as the suspicious and arrogant Mrs. Page. The rest get by. The dovetailing of the many flashbacks is firm, and the denouement has a showmanlike twist.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
