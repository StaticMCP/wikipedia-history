The two halves function in tandem.  The Intelligence watch floor gathers intelligence and decides how it contributes to the current threats in a given area.  The Law Enforcement Side tracks law enforcement activities across the country that may have a terrorist nexus.  This information from the two halves accurately depicts the nation's threat environment at any moment.\nThrough the National Operations Center, the Office provides real-time situational awareness and monitoring of the homeland, coordinates incidents and response activities, and, in conjunction with the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, issues advisories and bulletins concerning threats to homeland security, as well as specific protective measures.
