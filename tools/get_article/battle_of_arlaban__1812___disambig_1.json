A Spanish force of 3,000–3,500 men led by Francisco Espoz y Mina intercepted a great French convoy (2,000–3,000 regulars and 150 cavalry) of General of Division Caffarelli.\nThe attack was a success, and after one hour, the French were completely defeated. The Spanish casualties were estimated at 30 killed and wounded, and the French lost between 600 and 700 men, and 300 captured. The Spanish also rescued 800 Spanish, British and Portuguese prisoners (five officers), and captured the valuable convoy (weapons and baggage, two colours, letters from Joseph Bonaparte to Napoleon, and a great amount of jewelry, valued between 700,000 and 800,000 francs). Joseph Bonaparte's personal secretary, Jean Deslandes, was killed in this action.\nSee also\n* Battle of Arlabán (1811)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
