Colerain was a small community and the site of a U.S. Indian factory founded by James Seagrove.\nThis treaty affirmed the binding of the Treaty of New York (1790).  The Treaties of Hopewell and the Treaty of Holston (1791) established boundary lines between the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokee, and the U.S. The Treaty of Colerain bound the Creek Nation to acknowledge the boundaries established in those treaties.\nIt also established the boundary line between the Creek Nation and the United States.   At the time of this treaty, the boundaries between Spanish Florida and the U.S. had not yet been established. This treaty formally allowed the Creek chiefs to acknowledge the negotiation for delineating the Georgia-Florida boundary with Spain.\nThe treaty contained a provision that the President of the U.S. may establish a trading or military outpost.\nThe United States demanded that the Creeks give up their American prisoners and also return all \"citizens, white inhabitants, negroes and property\" taken by the Creeks.\nThe treaty describes when it would take effect.  After the treaty had been signed but not yet promulgated, the U.S. Senate requested modification of two articles of the treaty.  The first modification stipulated that the military or trading posts would be under the control of the United States. The second modification stipulated that if the U.S. no longer required the use of those posts, the locations would revert to the Creek people.\nSee also\n*List of United States treaties\nExternal links\n* Text of the 1796 Treaty.
