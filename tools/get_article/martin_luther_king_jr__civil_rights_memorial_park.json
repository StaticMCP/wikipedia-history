The park features Robert Kelly's 30-foot-tall sculpture inspired by King's \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speech, which was gifted to the city by the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Committee in 1991. Surrounding the artwork are hills offering views of Rainier Valley. \"Civil Rights\" was added to the park's name in 2018.\nSee also\n* List of memorials to Martin Luther King Jr.\n* List of parks in Seattle\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=22557 Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Park] at the Historic Marker Database"
