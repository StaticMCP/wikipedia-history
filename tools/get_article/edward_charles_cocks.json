He served with Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular War and was killed at the Siege of Burgos.\nLife\nCocks was the eldest son of John Cocks, 1st Earl Somers, and served as the Member of Parliament for Reigate from 1806 to 1812.\nFrom December 1808 until 1812, he fought in the Peninsular War where, alongside his regular duties, he worked as an \"observing officer\". These were officers tasked with probing deep behind enemy lines to collect military intelligence. He died, with the rank of major, leading his men in an attempt to storm a breach at the Siege of Burgos.\nCocks was a great favourite of his commander Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, who admired him for his bravery and intelligence and was greatly affected by his death. Colonel Frederick Ponsonby recalled his encounter with Wellesley shortly after the event; Wellesley entered Ponsonby's room and paced up and down in total silence, much to his junior officer's consternation, before stating quietly: \"Cocks is dead\". Wellesley subsequently wrote to Cocks' father; \"Your son fell, as he had lived, in the zealous and gallant discharge of his duty... if Providence had spared him to you, [he had] acquirements and qualities to become one of the greatest ornaments of his profession, and to continue an honour to his family, and an advantage to his country\". Cocks is commemorated on a plaque set into the Eastnor Obelisk, raised by his father in 1812.}}\nCocks kept a diary, running to eleven volumes, extracts from which were published in 1986, along with extracts from his collection of 180 letters, all edited by Julia Page, as Intelligence Officer in the Peninsular: Letters and Diaries of Major The Honourable Edward Charles Cocks 1786-1812.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*George Edward Cokayne, ed.
