The King's Cup is an international football competition held in Thailand. This edition featured four teams and reverted to a round robin group stage.\nSweden was initially due to take part in the competition but later withdrew, thus being replaced by North Korea, who also later withdrew. They were replaced by Singapore. The tournament was moved to the North East of Thailand for the first time as the Thai Football Association continue to promote the game around the country. Denmark and Poland, the other two invitees, were represented by the Danish League XI and Polish League XI select squads.\nParticipating nations\n*  Denmark\n*  Poland\n*  Singapore\n*  Thailand\nVenue\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
