It was first awarded in 2000 as one of the seven constituent awards presented during the Laureus World Sports Awards. The awards are presented by the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a global organisation involved in more than 150 charity projects supporting 500,000 young people. The first ceremony was held on 25 May 2000 in Monte Carlo, at which Nelson Mandela gave the keynote speech. , a shortlist of six nominees for the award comes from a panel composed of the \"world's leading sports editors, writers and broadcasters\". The Laureus World Sports Academy then selects the winner who is presented with a Laureus statuette, created by Cartier, at an annual awards ceremony held in various locations around the world. The awards are considered highly prestigious and are frequently referred to as the sporting equivalent of \"Oscars\".\nThe inaugural winner of the award was English football team Manchester United, who had completed an \"historic treble\" by winning the UEFA Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup during the 1998–99 season. Football teams, including both domestic and international sides, have won more awards than any other sport with eleven, followed by rugby union (four) and Formula One teams (three). Teams from France, Germany and Spain have won the award three times, while teams from England and South Africa have won it twice. The 2025 winner of the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year was the Real Madrid.\nList of winners and nominees\nwon three trophies in the 1998–99 season, and earned the inaugural Laureus team award in 2000.|alt=UEFA Champions League trophy, FA Cup trophy and FA Premier League trophy]]\nwon the World Cup in 2003, and won the Laureus team award the following year.|alt=England rugby union team celebrating with the World Cup]]\nscoring Greece's winning goal in the Euro 2004 final – his team received the award in 2005|alt=Greek player ANgelos Charisteas scoring for Greece in 2004]]\n's Formula One team Brawn GP won the award in 2010.|alt=Ross Brawn in 2010]]\nlifting the World Cup trophy in 2014 – the team won the Laureus award in 2015|alt=Germany lift the World Cup in 2014]]\ncelebrating winning the 2016 World Series – they were the 2017 recipients of the Laureus team award.|alt=Chicago Cubs in 2016]]\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n|+ Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year winners and nominees\n! scope=col | Year\n! scope=col | Winner\n! scope=col | Nationality\n! scope=col | Sport\n! scope=col class=unsortable width=20%| Achievement(s)\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Nominees\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Refs\n|-\n| 2000\n! scope=row | Manchester United\n|\n| Association football\n| Won the treble (UEFA Champions League, FA Premier League, FA Cup)\n| align=left | Australia Rugby Union Team () – rugby union  United States Women's Soccer Team () – football\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n! scope=row | France Men's Football Team\n|\n| Association football\n| Won UEFA Euro 2000\n| align=left | Australia Men's Cricket Team () – cricket  Cameroon Olympic Football Team () – football  New York Yankees () – baseball  Real Madrid () – football\n|\n|-\n| 2002\n! scope=row | Australia Men's Cricket Team\n|\n| Cricket\n| Extended their winning streak to 16 Test victories\n| align=left | Bayern Munich () – football  French Davis Cup Team () – tennis  Scuderia Ferrari () – Formula One  Los Angeles Lakers () – basketball\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n! scope=row | Brazil Men's Football Team\n|\n| Association football\n| Won the 2002 FIFA World Cup\n| align=left | Canada Men's Ice Hockey Team () – ice hockey  Europe Ryder Cup Team () – golf  Scuderia Ferrari () – Formula One  Real Madrid () – football\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n! scope=row | England Rugby Union Team\n|\n| Rugby union\n| Won the 2003 Rugby World Cup\n| align=left | AC Milan () – football  Alinghi America's Cup Team () – yachting  Australia Men's Cricket Team () – cricket  Scuderia Ferrari () – Formula One  Germany Women's Football Team () – football\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n! scope=row | Greece Men's Football Team\n|\n| Association football\n| Won UEFA Euro 2004\n| align=left | Argentina Men's Olympic Basketball Team () – basketball  Boston Red Sox () – baseball  Europe Ryder Cup Team () – golf  FC Porto () – football  Scuderia Ferrari () – Formula One\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n! scope=row | Renault Formula One Team\n|\n| Formula One\n| Won the 2005 FIA Formula One World Constructor's Championship\n| align=left | FC Barcelona () – football  Croatia Davis Cup Team () – tennis  Liverpool F.C.
