In the , Barney View had a population of 38 people.\nGeography\nMount Maroon rises to  above sea level in the west of Barney View.  This western section is protected within Mount Barney National Park.  The upper Logan River passes through the west of the locality and marks a portion of the western border.  In the south the terrain rises to more than  along the northern slopes of Mount Giles.\nHistory\nBarney View was originally known as Thulimbah, which was frequently confused with another Queensland district of the same name, Thulimbah near Stanthorpe. The problem was resolved in 1916 by changing the name to Barney View (due to its location beside Mount Barney).\nThulimbah Methodist Church was opened free of debt on 14 June 1908; it was built from timber sourced from local trees. It was renamed Barney View Methodist Church when the district's name changed. Following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, it became Barney View United Church. On 6 November 2016 it closed as a Uniting church closed and was leased to the community as Barney View Community Church.\nBarney View Lutheran church was dedicated on Wednesday 16 November 1910 with sermons in both German and English. The church closed in 1966. In the 1970s the church building was relocated to Rathdowney to extend the Rathdowney Methodist (later Uniting) Church.  The Lutheran Church still owns the land on Barney View Road (now just within the boundaries of Palen Creek, ) and operates it as a campsite called Abode Park. It is named after Pastor Armin Bode who was a Lutheran minister in the Parish of Teviotville (which included Barney View) from 1915 to 1969. A memorial at the park commemorates the former church.\nFollowing the closure of the Readville (Widgee Creek) State School in 1911, it was decided in April 1918 to relocate the building to establish a school at Barney View. Barney View State School opened on 4 October 1918. It had a temporary closure from 1938 to circa 1941 due to low student numbers. It closed permanently in March 1961. It was at 504 Barney View Road ().\nDemographics\nAt the , Barney View had a population of 64 people.
