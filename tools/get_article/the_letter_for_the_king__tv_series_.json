During the final challenge, the novices spend a night of silent contemplation inside the tomb of the Knights of Dagonaut, which is haunted by the spirits of the fallen knights. The vigil is interrupted by a dying Black Knight, who has stolen a sealed letter from Prince Viridian’s Red Riders. The Black Knight makes Tiuri swear to deliver the letter and his ring to King Favian of Unauwen before the next full moon, in 14 days. Tiuri is pursued on horseback by the Red Riders. The Black Knight’s horse, Ardanwen, leaps off a cliff carrying Tuiri into the river below.\n|LineColor       = 14131A\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = With the Red Riders and Novices hot on his trail, Tiuri makes his way to Mistrinaut, where the mayor’s daughter, an adventurous teen named Lavina, reluctantly forced to marry a paranoid, rich boy, discovers his presence. Despite convincing him to trust her, she has him imprisoned for money from bounty hunters. The knight leading the trials is the first to pay for him, but the mayor's daughter, in need of passage out of the town, frees him as the Novices arrive in Mistrinaut. The Novices, the knights, and the Red Riders end up chasing them, and a battle ensues. The lead knight sacrifices himself to distract them from Tiuri and dies of his wounds, but not before telling the Novices to help Tiuri on his quest. As they are considering this, the Novices are captured by the Red Riders.\n|LineColor       = 14131A\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = The Red Riders drive their captives high into the snowy mountains. Caught in a storm, Tiuri and Lavinia take shelter inside an ominous monastery.\n|LineColor       = 14131A\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = On a ship headed toward Unauwen, Tiuri and Lavinia meet a mysterious passenger who seems to know the secret of Tiuri's past — and his destiny.\n|LineColor       = 14131A\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Ardanwen guides the group to an eerily empty town. Lavinia helps Tiuri practice controlling his powers, and in order to get his heart rate up, she kisses him. The two then start a romance. A startling discovery divides the Novices as they enter their kingdom.\n|LineColor       = 14131A\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = As the Blood Moon nears and Viridian prepares for his homecoming, Tiuri and friends wrestle with doubt, betrayal and a daunting final test. In the final battle, the knights and Viridian clash. Viridian unleashes his plan and turns into a demon, but Lavina, directed by Tiuri, defeats him. Jussipo is killed in the ensuing battle, and they bury him before being knighted. Jussipo's brother becomes the youngest knight in Dragonaut, and Tiuri becomes Sir Tiuri the Valiant. The show ends when, as the audience applause, magic returns to the kingdom.\n|LineColor       = 14131A\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn July 2018, it was announced Netflix had ordered an original series based on Tonke Dragt's De brief voor de Koning with Will Davies as showrunner and executive producer. This is the first Netflix adaptation of a Dutch book, although it will be adapted in English; the series is titled after the English translation, which was published in 2014. FilmWave acquired the international rights in a deal with Leopold. Paul Trijbits of FilmWave is executive producing, Chris Clark is producing, and Alex Holmes and Felix Thompson are directing.\nCasting\nThe cast was announced in December 2018 with Amir Wilson in the lead role.\nFilming\nPrincipal photography took place in New Zealand and Prague, Czech Republic.\nMusic\nBrandon Campbell composed the music for the series. \"It’s an orchestral, adventure score, but we wove in a lot of Western elements. There are acoustic guitars, some vocals, the fiddle, and trumpet. Our approach to this project, and our vision as it came together, was a Western that takes place in the middle of this magical adventure,\" he told Awards Daily.\nJussipo uses the score of \"In Hell, I'll Be in Good Company\" from the band \"The Dead South\" as music for his songs, this music is also sung for his burial.\nRelease\nFirst-look promotional pictures were released in January 2020 followed by a teaser and trailer in February.\nReception\nCritical reception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 60% based on reviews from 20 critics, with an average rating of 6.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"The Letter for the King aspires for greatness, but poor pacing stretched across too many episodes hinder what could be an epic journey.\" On Metacritic, the series has a score of 55 out of 100 based on reviews from 6 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nAnglophone reception\nJack Seale of The Guardian, in awarding the series 3 out of 5 stars, wrote: \"But while The Letter for the King doesn’t feel like an adults’ show that kids can get away with watching, it's also not a kids’ show that's fun enough for adults to enjoy, with its bowdlerised fights and romance.\" David Opie of Digital Spy gave it 2 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Unfortunately, The Letter For The King is not the new fantasy smash we were hoping for, so you can toss out any high expectations you might have like a coin to your Witcher. In fact, it's not even that great for fans of the book either.\".\nThe Letter for the King was frequently dubbed as a Game of Thrones for children. Patrick Cremona of Radio Times gave it 2 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"The show is watchable enough, and might serve as a useful way into medieval fantasy for younger audiences who aren’t yet ready for the more adult-orientated series that have recently dominated the genre, which is by no means a bad thing. It seems unlikely, however, that this is the next big fantasy series that Netflix might have hoped for. The hunt for the next Game of Thrones goes on…\".\nDutch reception\nAlthough the series topped the Netflix ratings in the Netherlands, it also received very mixed critical reviews, mostly directed towards the execution of the series based on the book by Dragt. Mark Moorman of De Volkskrant awarded the show 3 out of 5 stars and commented: \"With nice young actors, beautiful cinematography and a strong quest, The Letter for the King is a reasonable success. But it does feel a bit like Netflix has crushed our favourite children's book with a steam engine.\" Belinda van de Graaf of Trouw also awarded the series 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"In their dedication to inclusivity, the creators went even further. Tiuri's most important companion is no longer a boy (Piak) but a girl, Lavinia. And near the end, there is an intimate kiss between two trainees. Sweet, that kiss between two guys, but that scene just appeared out of thin air. The same counts for all the hocus pocus that the creators added. It's understandable why Tonke Dragt prefers talking about literary adaptions of her book, rather than visual adaptions.\"\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!
