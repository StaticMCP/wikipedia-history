The fastest recorded delivery by a South African pacer is ascribed to him, 154 km/h (around 95 mph), that he delivered twice, both in 2001, against India and Australia.\nHe played for Derbyshire until his retirement from all cricket in 2012.\nInternational career\nAt the time of Robinson's article, \"Hayward [was] clearly seen as the successor to Allan Donald as the spearhead of the South African attack.\" However Hayward did not play a Test match after August 2004 or a One Day International after April 2002. Steve Waugh appears to have reached this conclusion in his autobiography, saying that: \"I'm amazed he didn't...become world-class...a collective cheer went up in the Australian camp whenever his unpredictable raw pace was overlooked [by the South African selectors].\"\nIreland career\nHe played for Ireland in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy.\nReferences"
