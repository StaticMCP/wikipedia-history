It was written by Jones and Ilhan Ersahin, and produced by Lee Alexander. The song was released as the lead single from Not Too Late on December 5, 2006, by Blue Note Records.\nIn the US, \"Thinking About You\" reached number 82 on the Billboard Hot 100, while peaking atop the Adult Alternative Songs, on which it became Jones' third consecutive number-one.\nBackground and composition\nJones wrote \"Thinking About You\" in 1999 with Ilhan Ersahin, her then-bandmate in Wax Poetic. She said the song had \"always been in the back of my mind\", but she thought it was too much of a pop song for her and preferred if someone else were to record it.  She recorded a version of it for her second album, Feels like Home (2004), but according to her it sounded \"too country-rock\". According to the producer, she \"found a way to make it work\" during the recording of Not Too Late.\nCritical reception\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic picked the song among the best tracks on the album, calling it a \"wonderful laid-back soul\". Sia Michel from Entertainment Weekly called it a \"safety-net single\", with its sexy, cocktail-party swing, the tune could be her first real radio hit since 'Don't Know Why'.\" Neil Spencer from The Observer commented that the song \"looks like a conscious attempt not to scare the punters.\" Tom Woods called it \"a lovely pop song, with nostalgic lyrics.\" Tyler Fisher from Sputnikmusic commented that the song is \"a western jazz hybrid in the truest sense, with very country-styled melodies from the organ and Wurlitzer, but the jazzy horn section provides great countermelodies.\"\nCommercial performance\nReleased in the United States on December 5, 2006, \"Thinking About You\" was one of the first songs by a major artist to be available for paid digital download in mp3 format. The single entered the US Billboard Hot 100 at number eighty-two in early February 2007, becoming Jones's first chart entry since \"Don't Know Why\" (2002).\nMusic video\nThe music video, directed by Ace Norton, was filmed on a soundstage at Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York with a cast of eight people, including Jones. According to videostatic.com, it contains elements from some of Norton's previous videos—for Peter Walker's \"What Do I Know\" (the \"within the within\" effect), Death Cab for Cutie's \"Someday You Will Be Loved\" (the animated heart) and Death Cab for Cutie's \"Crooked Teeth\" (the Claymation). The video premiered on December 19, 2006.\nCover versions\nIrma Thomas recorded the song for her 2008 album Simply Grand. Jones performed as a guest pianist on the recording.\nTrack listings and formats\nNorth American promotional CD single\n#\"Thinking About You\" &ndash; 3:17\nEuropean CD single\n#\"Thinking About You\" &ndash; 3:17\n#\"2 Men\" &ndash; 2:30\nEuropean maxi CD single\n#\"Thinking About You\" &ndash; 3:17\n#\"2 Men\" &ndash; 2:30\n#\"Wish I Could\" &ndash; 4:18\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2006&ndash;2007 weekly chart performance for \"Thinking About You\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Hot 100 Singles (Billboard)\n| 40\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nAll-time charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ All-time chart performance for \"Thinking About You\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Adult Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n| 82\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release dates and formats for \"Thinking About You\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Label(s)\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United States\n| December 5, 2006\n| Digital download\n| Blue Note\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Germany\n| January 12, 2007\n|\n| EMI\n| }}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom\n| January 22, 2007\n| CD\n| Parlophone\n| }}\n|}\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations"
