It was a victory for Iltutmish, who conquered Bhilsa and raided temples and shrines.\nBackground\nThe Delhi Sultanate during the 12th and 13th century was undergoing a period of expansion during strong Sultans such as Qutb ud-Din Aibak and Iltutmish. Meanwhile, the Paramaras under Devapala were under a period of defensive warfare, with mixed success.\nBattle\nIltutmish raided the Paramara-controlled cities of Bhilsa and Ujjain in 1234–35. Iltutmish's army occupied Bhilsa, and destroyed a temple whose construction - according to Minhaj - had taken three hundred years. At Ujjain, his forces damaged the Mahakaleshwar temple and obtained rich plunder, but made little effort to annex the Paramara territory. The jyotirlinga at the site was dismantled and believed to be thrown into a nearby 'Kotiteerth Kunda' (a pond neighboring the temple) with the Jaladhari (a structure supporting the Lingam) stolen during the invasion.\nAftermath\nDespite his victory over Devapala, Iltutmish could not permanently hold Bhilsa. The Adhipa he put in charge of the city and region was decisively defeated and killed, and Devapala reconquered the region.\nSee also\nSecond battle of Bhilsa\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
