      "text": "# Through the Looking Glass (Toto album)\n\nThrough the Looking Glass is the eleventh studio album (though counted as the 12th album overall — see Toto XIV)  by the American band Toto. It was released in 2002, three years after their last studio release, Mindfields. The album consists of cover versions of songs that had inspired the band.\nReception\n}}\nAllMusic noted that Toto made no attempt to rework the songs they covered for the album, and concluded that \"while it's nice to know that the band has good taste in other people's music, that doesn't explain why anyone needs to hear them copy that music when the originals are so readily available.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;Toto\n*Bobby Kimball: lead vocals , backing vocals , loops\n*Steve Lukather: guitars , lead vocals , backing vocals , keyboards , dobro , loops\n*David Paich: keyboards , lead vocals , backing vocals , piano , Moog bass , Wurlitzer , loops\n*Mike Porcaro: bass guitar , backing vocals , loops\n*Simon Phillips: drums , loops , tambourine , backing vocals , keyboards\n;Additional Musicians\n*Lenny Castro: timbales , percussion , congas , tambourine\n*Brandon Fields: tenor saxophone , alto saxophone , soprano saxophone\n*Walt Fowler: trumpet , flugelhorn\n*Ellis Hall: vocals\n*James Ingram: backing vocals and ad-libs\n*Tippa Irie: DJ\n*Davey Johnstone: backing vocals\n*Monet: backing vocals , ad-libs\n*Nigel Olsson: backing vocals\n*Steve Porcaro: synthesizer programming , synthesizer and sound effects\nProduction\n*Arranged and Produced by Toto\n*Engineered by Simon Phillips\n*Assistant Engineer: John Jessel\n*Tracks #1-5 & 7-11 mixed by Steve MacMillan\n*Track #6 mixed by Simon Phillips\n*Digital Editing by Louie Teran\n*Mastered by Stephen Marcussen\n*Edited and Mastered at Marcussen Mastering (Hollywood, CA).\n*Project Coordination: Anita Heilig\n*Art Direction and Design: Brian Peterson\n*Creative Director: Doug Brown\n*Photography: Resig & Taylor\n*Management: The Fitzgerald Hartley Co.\nSingles\n* Could You Be Loved / House of the Rising Sun\nReferences"
