It is a predominantly mid-rise multifamily residential area, with a smaller presence of low-rise single-family housing in the southwest.\nMost of its area consists of the mid-rise multifamily housing estates of Natolin and Wyżyny. In the southwest is also located the neighbourhood of Moczydło, consisting of low-rise single-family housing. The area also includes the Natolin station of the M1 line of the Warsaw Metro rapid transit underground system. Additionally, the neighbourhood is widely associated with the Natolin Park, that contains Potocki Palace. They are placed just outside its boundaries, within the district of Wilanów.\nBy 1528, the small farming community of Moczydło was present in the area. Between 1780 and 1783, the Potocki Palace, designed in the Neoclassical style, was also constructed nearby. It became a residence of the Czartoryski and, later, Potocki families. The palace was rebuilt in its current form in 1838. In 1879, a horse stable was built in Moczydło, and the village became specialised in breeding horses for the local upper class. In the 1930s, it became a supplier for the newly opened, nearby Służewiec Horse Racing Track, and remained as such until Second World War. The area was incorporated into Warsaw in 1951. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the housing estates of Natolin and Wyżyny, consisting of multifamily residential buildings, were constructed in the neighborhood. In 1995, the Natolin station of the Warsaw Metro opened.\nHistory\nin 2006]]\nBy 1528, in the area was present the settlement of Moczydło. It was a small farming community, located on the road leading to Imielin, within the Catholic St. Catherine Parish. The village was owned and inhabited by a petty nobility. Between 1580 and 1658, the village, and its adjusted farmlands, had an area of around 9 ha, and in 1661, there were 5 houses. It was owned by Dąbrowski family until 1725, when it was sold together with Wolica to Elżbieta Sieniawska, owner of the Wilanów Estate for the price of 60,000 złoties. She has also ordered protection of the nearby Kabaty Woods from deforestation.\nAt the end of the 16th century, within the area of the current Natolin, king John III Sobieski established a designated royal area for animal hunting, as part of the nearby Wilanów Palace complex. In 1730, the estate owners, Maria Zofia Czartoryska and August Aleksander Czartoryski, leased it to king Augustus II the Strong, who turned it into the pheasantry. As such, the area became known as Bażantaria (Polish for pheasantry). It was designed in French Baroque style, with paths braniching out away from the main building, similarly to those in Palace of Versailles. In 1733, the property was returned to its owners.\nIn 1780, August Aleksander Czartoryski begun there the construction of his residence, which later would become known as the Potocki Palace. The Neoclassical palace was designed by a renowned contemporary architect Szymon Bogumił Zug in the while the internal design was prepared by Vincenzo Brenna. It featured a distinctive half-open salon, with a view on the forest below the Warsaw Escarpment. Its construction was finished in 1782, and following Czartoryski's death the same year, it was inherited by his daughter, Elżbieta Izabela Lubomirska. In 1799, it became a wedding gift to her daughter Aleksandra Lubomirska and brother-in-law Stanisław Kostka Potocki, and in 1805, it was inherited by their son Aleksander Stanisław Potocki and his wife Anna Tyszkiewicz. In 1807, following the birth of their daughter, Natalia Potocka, the area was renamed after her to Natolin. The palace was rebuilt in 1808 in accordance to project by Chrystian Piotr Aigner, and again between 1834 and 1838, with project by Enrico Marconi. In 1892, it was inherited by the Branicki family.\nIn 1775, the village of Moczydło had 7 houses, and in 1785, 10 houses. In 1827, it had 10 houses and 80 inhabitants. Between 1850 and 1861, the population of Moczydło fought in court to lower costs of their feudal duties. Following the abolition of serfdom in 1864, the village was incorporated into the municipality of Wilanów. At the time it was inhabited by 131 people and included 360 ha privately owned farmland, and 36 ha of nobility-owned farmland. In 1905, there were 20 houses and 146 inhabitants.\nIn 1879, in Moczydło was built horse stable, owned by count Ludwik Józef Krasiński, and the village became specialised in breeding horses for the local upper class. In the 1930s, it became a supplier for the newly opened nearby Służewiec Horse Racing Track. It operated until the beginning of the Second World War. Following the end of the war, the farmlands of Moczydło were nationalised, and in 1956, they were donated by the state to the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. The ruins of the stable survive to the present day, now with the status of a protected cultural property.\nDuring the Second World War, while Warsaw was under the German occupation, the Natolin Woods near the Potocki Palace became the sight of one of the first war crimes committed by the Nazi Germany officers in the city. Sometime between 13 and 17 November 1939, fifteen Polish men were executed by shooting. The bodies were exhumed in 1971, and in 2022, the tragedy was commemorated with a small monument erected near the palace. During the Warsaw Uprising, and following its end, the palace was devastated and plundered by German forces, together with other wealthy buildings in Natolin.\nIn 1945, Potocki Palace was nationalised, and placed under the administration of the National Museum in Warsaw. It was renovated and turned into the official residence of the President of Poland, Bolesław Bierut. Later it was used by the Council of Ministers Office. In 1991, around 100 ha of the Natolin Park received the status of the nature reserve of the Natolin Woods. In 1992, the palace became the campus of the branch of the College of Europe. Around it were also built several other university buildings.\nOn 14 May 1951, the area, including Natolin and Moczydło, was incorporated into the city of Warsaw.\nBeginning in 1981, throughout the 1980s, between Pileckiego, Stryjeńskich, and Przy Bażantarni Streets, and Komisji Edukacji Narodowej Avenue, was constructed the housing estate of Wyżyny, consisting of large panel system multifamily residential buildings. Later, beginning in 1987, and continuing throughout the 1990s and 2000s, to the south and east were also constructed a series of housing estates of multifamily residential buildings, as part of the development of the neighbourhood of Natolin. It also partially encompassed the nearby neighbourhood of Kabaty. Both developments were designed by Jacek Jan Nowicki.\nIn 1994, the neighbourhood became part of the then-established city district of Ursynów. Natolin Park and Potocki Palace, historically associated with it, became part of Wilanów instead. In 1998, the district of was subdivided into the areas of the City Information System, with Natolin becoming one of them.\nOn 7 April 1995, there was opened the Natolin station of the M1 line of the Warsaw Metro rapid transit underground syststem, placed at the intersection of Belgradzka Street and Komisji Edukacji Narodowej Avenue.\nBetween 1992 and 2002, at 3 Przy Bażantarni Street, was constructed the Catholic Blessed Ladislas of Gielniów Church. Between 1993 and 2003, at 21 Stryjeńskich Street, was also built the Catholic Church of the Presentation of Jesus.\nBetween 2002 and 2004, in the area of 13 Stryjeńskich Street, was constructed a housing estate of VitaParc, consisting of five multifamily residential buildings.\nThroughout 2000s and 2010s, in the area were developed four urban parks. They were the Moczydełko Park opened in 2009, Birch Woods Park in 2010, Przy Bażantarni Park between 2008 and 2013, and Silent Unseen Park in 2016.\nCharacteristics\nin 2021.]]\nThe City Information System area of Natolin is dominated by mid-rise multifamily residential area. Most of it consists of the housing estate of Natolin. Between Pileckiego, Stryjeńskich, and Przy Bażantarni Streets, and Komisji Edukacji Narodowej Avenue is also located the housing estate of Wyżyny, and in the area of 13 Stryjeńskich Street, a small housing estate of VitaParc. In the southwest, to the west of Stryjeńskich Street, is also located the neighbourhood of Moczydło, consisting predominantly of low-rise single-family housing. At the intersection of Belgradzka Street and Komisji Edukacji Narodowej Avenue is placed the Natolin station of the M1 line of the Warsaw Metro rapid transit underground system.\nIn Natolin are present four urban parks. They are the Birch Woods Park, Moczydełko Park, Przy Bażantarni Park, and Silent Unseen Park. Additionally, right outside its boundary, next to Nowoursynowska Street, is placed the Natolin Park, which includes the 19th-century Potocki Palace built in the Neoclassical style, as well as the Natolin Woods nature reserve with the area of around 100 ha. In the eastern part of the neighbourhood are also located three small ponds, known as Moczydło 1, 2 and 3. Near Nowoursynowska Street also grows a pedunculate oak named Mieszko I, which with the age of around 600 years, is one of the oldest trees in Poland.\nWithin the neighbourhood are also located two Catholic churches. They are the Blessed Ladislas of Gielniów Church at 3 Przy Bażantarni Street, and Church of the Presentation of Jesus at 21 Stryjeńskich Street.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
