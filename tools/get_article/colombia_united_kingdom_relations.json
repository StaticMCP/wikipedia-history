Colombian-Anglo relations begin in 1810, and stem from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the service of the British Legions who helped Colombia to win independence through Simón Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada in 1819–1820. However the first known English person to have traveled to modern day Colombia was Sir John Hawkins in 1565.\nBackground\nMajor interest in Colombia for the UK has lain in environmental protection and for Colombia the direct financial investment from the UK, military assistance, and gas production. Bilateral trade currently stands at £1 Billion.\nHistory\nIndependence war\nIn July 1819 during the grueling crossing the Andes through the Paramo Pisba the entire army had lost around 300 men en route, of whom 60 were from the British Legion. At Battle of Vargas Swamp the captain Arthur Sandes was wounded twice and had his horse shot under him. Few days after at battle of Boyaca the colonel James Rooke fought with distinction, as he led his legion in a bayonet charge storming uphill against the Spanish defences. During this action both Rooke and Daniel Florence O'Leary were wounded, with Rooke's being of grave concern which led to the amputation of his left arm. In Angostura Bolivar was proclaimed as President of the Republic of Colombia including present-day Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela, along with parts of northern Peru, northwestern Brazil and Guyana. The British Government on paper however were still in support of Spain in official channels, apart from a number of liberal politicians, but British public favour went with Colombian patriots and favored pressuring the government to open new trade markets with these newly formed Spanish American groups in 1817 and 1818.\nOf Bolívar's force in the Battle of Carabobo between 340 or 350 were men of the British Rangers battalion, the great majority of them of Anglophone origin, commanded by Colonel Thomas Ilderton Ferrier including many former members of the King's German Legion. Though greatly outnumbered and low on supplies, the legion soldiers managed to maintain control of tactically critical hills. By the battle's end, the legionary force had suffered 119 deaths, of which 11 were officers. Col. Ferrier was among the dead. Bolívar later praised the Legion troops and called them the \"Saviors of my Fatherland\", noting that they had distinguished themselves among other armies.\nBy February 29, 1824 the royalist troops under General Monet had regained control of Lima and Bolívar fled to North.  docked at Callao Harbour on June 8, 1824 and the British consul Thomas Edward Rowcroft and his daughter, Leonora Maria, disembarked there for his post at Lima. Having regrouped at North in Trujillo, Bolívar in June led his Army forces south to confront the Spanish under Field Marshal José de Canterac. Bolívar sent some 8,000 soldiers, in a hurry to try to cut the royalist retreat towards Cusco, also with a force 8,000 soldiers. Bolivar also sent out his 1,000-strong cavalry to delay the movement of Spanish troops out of the Plain of Huancayo a marshland at around  above sea level. At Callao Roads, HMS Cambridge, under Captain Thomas Maling, was attacked by Spanish gunboat on July 3.\nThe Colombian state was recognized by the United Kingdom on January 1, 1825 and Manuel José Hurtado was the first South American envoy recognized by a European state\nAssassination attempt\n, target of the September Conspiracy attack.]]\nOn the night of September 25, 1828 about twelve civilians and twenty-five soldiers led by Pedro Carujo broke into the Presidential Palace (Palacio de San Carlos) and killed the guards. Upon learning of the attack, Bolívar managed to jump out of the window while Manuela Saenz entertained and engaged the conspirators. The result of this conspiracy was the death of Colonel William Ferguson, an Irish aide-de-camp that Carujo mistook  for General Bolívar and shot him in the back, mortally wounding him. Vargas's battalion led by Colonel Whittle contributed to the failure of the conspiracy. On September 28, a public funeral was held, and Ferguson was buried in a Catholic cathedral (unusual for a Protestant).  Finally, it was up to Generals Rafael Urdaneta and José María Córdova to put an end to the plot, control the situation in the capital and imprison those involved in this sinister attack.\n]]\nDuring the days that followed, the alleged culprits were arrested and a \"trial\" followed for many of them as Vice president Francisco de Paula Santander and Admiral Padilla.\nDissolution of Gran Colombia\nIn 1829 when the Government in Bogotá learned of the antibolivarian insurrection of general Cordova, it dispatched a division of eight hundred veteran troops. commanded by Irish Colonel Daniel Florencio O'Leary, to put down the insurrection. The two forced clashed near the small town of Santuario. The bloody fight lasted two hours, with rebel forces defeated. Cordova who was wounded took refuge in a small house that had been converted into a hospital. He would be killed there by Colonel Rupert Hand, an Irish mercenary, who struck his head three times with his saber.\nIn 1830  the  Gran Colombia was dissolved due to the political differences that existed between supporters of federalism and centralism, as well as regional tensions among the peoples that made up the republic. It broke into the successor states of New Granada, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Since New Granada State territory corresponded more or less to the original jurisdiction of the former Viceroyalty of New Granada, it also claimed the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, the Mosquito Coast.\nSteamships and steam trains\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, British merchants came to the area for the Coffee which in this century has become an important import once more. Steamships and steam trains began to be invested in the 1870s–1890s by English merchants and the Colombian government to transport goods such as Bananas, tobacco, coffee and European imports, which proved to create a flourishing community of British ex-pats in Colombia and spread out across the South Americas. The British expat community later controlled a portion of the railways in Colombia such as the Cartagena Railway line, the Colombian Northern Railway and the Southern Bogota Railway line by 1906, with all railways returning to Colombian ownership by the 1930s.\nChronology of Colombian–British relations\nConfederation Map]]\nEarly\n* 1565 - The slave trader John Hawkins attempts to trade in enslaved peoples from Sierra Leone with local peoples in Riohacha\n* 1586 - Battle of Cartagena occurs, with Francis Drake capturing the strategic settlement of Cartagena\n* 1595 - Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition for the city El Dorado takes place with the crew travelling the Orinoco River in modern day Venezuela, with two Englishman left behind with local Indian chiefs, to whom he exhibited a portrait of Queen Elizabeth and promised to return and liberate them from Spanish dominion ...
