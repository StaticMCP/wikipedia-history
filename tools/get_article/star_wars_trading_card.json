However a common colloquial reference to trading card can also include reference to stickers, wrappers, or caps (pog) often produced along the same theme.  Usually produced as either promotional or collectible memorabilia relating to Star Wars, the cards can depict anything from screen still imagery to original art.  In addition, there have been various companies that have issued promotional Star Wars trading cards that include reference to or information about that corresponding company.\nAn avid collecting and trading community of these cards and sets exists worldwide.  New cards released commercially are available through most major retailers and wholesalers, however some cards are specially issued as exclusive and only available though a specific source.  A thriving secondary market also exists on eBay in various categories.  Star Wars trading cards are different from the various Star Wars collectible card game cards. A few of the most valuable sets in the Star Wars Trading Cards market are the 1977 Star Wars Series I, The Star Wars Galaxy Series, Star Wars MasterWorks, along with the Star Wars 3D Widevision sets.\nHistory\nStar Wars trading cards were first produced and released by Topps in 1977 to coincide with the first Star Wars movie, and they have remained the official producer of Star Wars trading cards in the United States ever since.  Various manufacturers handle the property around the rest of the world.\nIn 1977, a photograph appeared on a Topps Star Wars trading card in which  appeared to have a prominent phallus. In 2007, the official Star Wars website hypothesized that this was caused by a part of the suit that had fallen into place just as the photograph was taken. However, in 2019 Daniels clarified that the costume had become compromised during 's oil bath in the film; the warm liquid had caused the costume to separate, leading to \"an over-exposure of plastic in that region\".  Topps editor Gary Gerani, who wrote and photo-selected all the Star Wars card sets and pencil-designed the distinctive, often-reused 1977 front design, says he has been asked about this particular card more than any other.\nIn 2015, Topps created the Star Wars Card Trader app for iPhone, iPad and Android. This app allows users to open packs, collect digital cards, and trade them with other users right in the app.\nIn 2019 Topps began to commission original art for the app. It has produced original art card sets by [https://play.toppsapps.com/swcardtrader/article/a71c004b-4ca6-4230-ade1-ec4cb5c8b274 Derek Laufman], [https://play.toppsapps.com/swcardtrader/article/5d2e4583-69a7-4a86-8255-2879d63186f8 Darrin Pepe, Kevin-John], [https://play.toppsapps.com/swcardtrader/article/048723d7-1a24-47c6-b7c6-45701e35ae61 Robert Jimenez], [https://play.toppsapps.com/swcardtrader/article/8e01391b-4286-440a-9ce6-68ff2972af71 Uzuri Art] and others.\nHarry N.
