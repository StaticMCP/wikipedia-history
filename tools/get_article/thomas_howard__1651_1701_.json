      "text": "# Thomas Howard (1651–1701)\n\nSir Thomas Howard (1651–1701) was the only surviving son of Sir Robert Howard of Ashtead, Surrey.\nHe served as a Teller of the Exchequer from 1689 until his death, a position that provided him with a house at Westminster.  He was a Member of Parliament for Castle Rising from 1685 to 1689 and again from 1698 until his death, with his father having held the seat before him. During the intervening period, he sat for Bletchingley in the two periods between sitting for Castle Rising.\nHe married Lady Diana, daughter of Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford, in 1683. Together, they had three sons and a daughter.  Only one son survived him, but he died the year after Thomas, at the age of 14.  His daughter Diana married (in 1703) Edward Ward, 8th Baron Dudley and 3rd Baron Ward, who died in 1704, leaving her pregnant with a posthumous son, who succeeded his father in the Dudley estates, but died in 1731 without issue.\nSir Thomas Howard's grave is located in Ashtead church and was designed by William Stanton.\nReferences\n*David W Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, and Stuart Handley, The House of Commons, 1690-1715 (Cambridge University Press for History of Parliament Trust 2002), 408–9."
