An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Warren borders Detroit to the north, roughly  north of downtown Detroit. The population was 139,387 at the 2020 census, making Warren the largest community in Macomb County, the third-largest city in Michigan, and Detroit's largest suburb.\nThe city is home to a wide variety of businesses, including the General Motors Technical Center, the United States Army Detroit Arsenal, home of the United States Army TACOM Life Cycle Management Command and the Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), and the headquarters of Asset Acceptance.\nHistory\nBeebe's Corners, the original settlement in what would become the city of Warren, was founded in 1830 at the corner of Mound Road and Chicago Road; its first resident was Charles Groesbeck. Beebe's Corners was a carriage stop between Detroit and Utica, and included a distillery, mill, tavern, and trading post. It was not until 1837 that the now-defunct Warren Township was organized around the settlement, first under the name Hickory, then renamed Aba in April 1838, and finally renamed Warren shortly thereafter. It was named for War of 1812 veteran, and frontier cleric, Rev. Abel Warren. However, when it was originally organized the township was named for Rev. Warren, a Methodist Episcopal preacher who left his native New York in 1824 for Shelby Township. He went throughout the present-day Macomb, Lapeer, Oakland, and St. Clair Counties, baptizing, marrying, and burying pioneers of the area, as well as establishing congregations and preaching extensively. He was the first licensed preacher in the State of Michigan.\nAnother version of the source of the city's name claims it was \"named for General Joseph Warren, who fell at the Battle of Bunker Hill.\"\nThe settlement was formally incorporated as the Village of Warren from Warren Township on April 28, 1893, out of one square mile bound by 14 Mile Road and 13 Mile Road to the north and south, and in half-a-mile east and west of Mound Road. The small village grew slowly, and had a population of 582 in 1940 and 727 in 1950, while the larger surrounding township grew at a much quicker pace. Much of this growth was due to the construction of the Chrysler's Truck Assembly plant in 1938, the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in 1940 to support the WW II effort, and the General Motors Technical Center between 1949 and 1956.\nThe Red Run and Bear Creek, just small creeks back in the 1800s, has blossomed into an open major inter-county stormdrain flowing through Warren, into the Clinton River, and onwards to Lake St. Clair.\nThe Village of Warren and most of the surrounding Township of Warren, together with Van Dyke, incorporated as a city in 1957, less the city of Center Line, which had incorporated as a village from Warren Township in 1925 and as a city in 1936. Between 1950 and 1960, Warren's population soared from 42,653 to 89,426. This population explosion was largely fueled by the post-WWII Baby Boom and later, by white flight from its southern neighbor of Detroit in that decade. This change in population continued into the next decade when the city's population doubled again, ultimately reaching a high of 179,000 in 1970.\nHistorically, Warren was a sundown town: an all-white municipality that excluded non-whites through a combination of discriminatory practices, local ordinances, and violence. In 1970, Warren had a population of 180,000, with only 28 minority families, most of whom lived on a U.S. military base. As late as 1974, African Americans were practically nonexistent in Warren, In 2000 Warren had less than 3% Black population, compared to 80% in adjacent Detroit.\nList of mayors in Warren, Michigan\nThe following is a list of the previous mayors of the city.
