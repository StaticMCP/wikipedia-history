It aims at helping young people from HLM housing projects start a career in the arts.\nOverview\nIt was founded by Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, the CEO of FIMALAC, in 2006. The director is Eléanore Ladret de Lacharrière, his daughter.\nIt has an endowment of 15 million euros. It has partnered with the École du Louvre, La Fémis, and the Théâtre du Rond-Point.\nAccording to journalist Évelyne Pieiller, \"the operation is a major success in two respects: it consecrates the intrusion of the private into the public, since the foundation, directed by Éléonore Ladreit de Lacharrière, daughter of the billionaire, relies on a partnership tripartite with the Ministries of National Education and Culture;  and it tends to influence curricula by differentiating school \"publics\"».\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.fondationcultureetdiversite.org/ Official website]\n\n---\n\n## Fondation Culture et Diversite\n\n#REDIRECT Fondation Culture et Diversité"
