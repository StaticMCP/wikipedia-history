Hazing has been enforced and encouraged mainly under the pretext of establishing military discipline and hierarchy. Hazing has resulted in a large number of fragging, shooting spree and suicide cases; such cases of suicide are referred to as non-combat casualties by the military.\nSuch hazing has ranged from physical violence to malicious harassment, sexual violence, verbal abuse, to other forms of abuse, with some even resulting in death. Other forms of hazing have also included being beaten with a heated object and being forced to eat bugs. Such hazing in the South Korean military has led to numerous major incidents, including a series of suicides and gun shootings.\nHistory\nThe Republic of Korea Armed Forces originates from the Korean Liberation Army, formed in response to Japanese occupation and attempts at colonization during World War II. The Ministry of National Defense (South Korea) specifies the roots of its armed forces as the Korean Liberation Army, which organized to liberate Korea from Japanese colonial rule during WWII. However, in the process of establishing the Korean Army under the command of the U.S. military government after liberation from Japanese colonial rule, military generals from Manchukuo Imperial Army and Japanese Army were at the center of the Korean Army. As such, the Japanese military culture was forced onto Korean military culture; normalizing beating, other forms of physical abuse, a strict ranking culture and hierarchy system, and an emphasis on mental perseverance by enduring harsh behavior. The same culture and values have remained as remnants of the Japanese occupation of Korea.\nIn addition, the system of conscription in South Korea which requires male citizens between the ages of 18 and 28 to perform compulsory military service, a lack of transparency from the South Korean military, and a larger culture of hierarchal abuse continue to perpetuate hazing in the South Korean military.\nCritics have also noted that LGBT South Korean soldiers are particularly targeted and vulnerable to hazing and extreme abuse during conscription.\nCurrent situation\nAbout 60 percent of the deaths in the South Korean military are suicides each year. According to the research, it has been confirmed that severe beatings, physical abuse, verbal abuse, and sexual violence have significant effects on the suicidal impulse of the respondent.\nThe following data is an annual comparison of total deaths and suicides in the military from 1994 to 2019.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|1993\n|1994\n|1995\n|1996\n|1997\n|1998\n|1999\n|2000\n|2001\n|2002\n|2003\n|2004\n|2005\n|2006\n|2007\n|2008\n|2009\n|2010\n|2011\n|2012\n|2013\n|2014\n|2015\n|2016\n|2017\n|2018\n|2019\n|-\n|Total death\n|343\n|416\n|330\n|359\n|273\n|248\n|230\n|182\n|164\n|158\n|150\n|135\n|124\n|128\n|121\n|134\n|113\n|129\n|143\n|111\n|117\n|101\n|93\n|81\n|75\n|86\n|86\n|-\n|Suicide\n|129\n|155\n|100\n|103\n|92\n|102\n|101\n|82\n|66\n|79\n|69\n|67\n|64\n|77\n|80\n|75\n|81\n|82\n|97\n|72\n|79\n|67\n|57\n|54\n|51\n|56\n|62\n|}\nWhile the true cause of such high suicide rates among South Korean military soldiers have been debated, research has shown that hazing, anger, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation were positively linked and that hazing is a significant predictor of high levels of anger and depressive symptoms. Others have also argued that rather than the isolation of conscription into the military, a culture of hierarchy in the military and senior soldiers abusing their power are the cause of high suicide rates among South Korean military soldiers.\nGovernment actions\nSouth Korea's Defense Ministry issued a decree in 2011 to root out hazing in the South Korean military. To ensure anonymous reporting, the agency also provides a service called Defense Help Call to receive reports of all possible crimes and violence that could lead to a suicide. The South Korean government also established a military human rights center to further ensure the human rights of South Korean military soldiers.\nRecently, the South Korean government is preparing a policy to lower conscription standards for mental and physical conditions that would previously be considered exempt, as it fears that the nation's low birthrate will lead to fewer conscripts; South Korea had the lowest fertility rate in the world in 2020 and 2021. However, experts warn such actions will eventually lead to even wider problems by recruiting personnel who would not be able to adapt to the closed military.\nHazing in popular culture\nSince 80% of Korean men are conscripted soldiers and as hazing is common in South Korean culture, there have been many references and discussions in South Korean popular culture. Depictions of hazing and a larger culture of abuse and authority in the South Korean military have been presented through films, TV shows, animations, webtoons, and reality TV.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
