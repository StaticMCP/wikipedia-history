In the , the locality of Guluguba had a population of 86 people.\nGeography\nGuluguba is located on the Leichhardt Highway, north of Miles and south of Wandoan.\nThe now-closed Wandoan railway line traversed the locality with the town being served by the Guluguba railway station () with the Giligulgul railway station () at the south of the locality.\nHistory\nThe name Guluguba is thought to be an Aboriginal word meaning squatter pigeon.\nGuluguba Post Office opened by 1916 (a receiving office had been open from 1915).\nGuluguba Provisional School opened on 1 February 1917 on a half-time basis (meaning shared a single teacher) with Downfall Creek Provisional School which opened in March 1917. When the Downfall Creek school closed in 1918, Guluguba became a full-time school.\nThe first stage of the Wandoan railway line opened from Miles to Giligulgul railway station on 20 December 1913. The second stage from Giligulgul to Juandah, including Guluguba railway station, opened on 16 December 1914.\nIn 1931, St John's Lutheran church was opened by a group of German settlers who had moved from South Australia.\nIn 1940 at Downfall Creek, the local Lutheran community established a Lutheran Day School. Meanwhile, Guluguba State School had two temporary closures in 1942 and 1944 due to a lack of teacher accommodation.\nIn 1957, the Queensland Education Department was willing to provide a teacher to Downfall Creek so the Lutheran Church school became Downfall Creek Provisional School once again. It finally closed in 1962.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Guluguba and neighbouring Wandoan had a combined population of 655 people.\nIn the , the locality of Guluguba had a population of 109 people.\nIn the , the locality of Guluguba had a population of 86 people.\nEducation\nGuluguba State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls on Fosters Road ().
