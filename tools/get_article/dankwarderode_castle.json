It was the residence of the Brunswick dukes for centuries and, today, is part of the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum.\nConstruction and history of use\nDankwarderode Castle was built between c. 1160 and 1175 as the Pfalz of Duke Henry the Lion on an island in the river Oker. Next to the castle, the construction of Brunswick Cathedral began in 1173. The castle lost its military significance as a defensive structure early when it became surrounded completely by the growing city.\nDuring the 15th century, the dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel moved their Residenz out of the city and to the nearby town of Wolfenbüttel.  In 1616 the palas was remodelled in the Renaissance style, while the rest of the castle was demolished or left to decay. During the 19th century, the castle keep served as a barrack, plans to demolish it were stopped by public protests in 1873. The present structure was rebuilt in 1887 by Ludwig Winter, based on archaeological investigations. Today the ground floor of Dankwarderode Castle houses the permanent collection of medieval objects from the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum.\nGallery\nImage:Braunschweig Burgplatz.JPG|Castle courtyard\nImage:Burg Dankwarderode (Ludwig Winter).jpg|Dankwarderode Castle c. 1200, artist's impression by Ludwig Winter (1884)\nImage:Dankwarderode J.
