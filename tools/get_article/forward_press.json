Anil Varghese is the current editor-in-chief of the publication. Forward Press started as a monthly print magazine in June 2009. Its management decided to discontinue the print edition in 2016 to convert it into a web-only publication.\nOverview\nForward Press was founded by Silvia Maria Fernandes Kostka and Ivan Kostka in 2009 in New Delhi. They have appointed many correspondents from several states and cities and launched the Bahujan Sahitya Catalogue. Senior journalist Pramod Ranjan served as the magazine's managing editor from 2011 to 2019.\nControversy\nOne of the magazine issues, published an article which was alleged to be derogatory to Hindu Goddess Durga. Some student organizations with political association such as those who were associated with All India Backward Student Federation, and a student union comprising members belonging to Backward Castes and Dalit communities organised 'Mahisasura Sahadat Diwas' at Jawaharlal Nehru University due to the allegations which prompted the Delhi Police to raid the press office on a complaint filed by right-wing student unions of Jawaharlal Nehru University.\nSee also\n* Pramod Ranjan\n* Gail Omvedt\n* A.R.
