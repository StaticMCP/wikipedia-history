Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside's North Carolina expedition during the American Civil War.\nOn June 5, Col. Robert Potter, garrison commander at Washington, North Carolina, ordered a reconnaissance in the direction of Pactolus. The 24th Massachusetts, under Lt. Col. F. A. Osborne, advanced to the bridge over Tranter's Creek, where it encountered the 44th North Carolina, under Col. George Singletary. Unable to force a crossing, Osborne fired his artillery (Companies A&ndash;G, 1st New York Marine Artillery) at the mill buildings in which the Confederates were barricaded. Singletary was killed in the bombardment, and his troops retreated. The Federals did not pursue and returned to their fortifications at Washington.\nGallery\nTranter%27s_Creek_Battlefield_North_Carolina.jpg|Map of Tranter's Creek Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program.\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070817061835/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/nc006.htm National Park Service battle description]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108205114/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/NorthCarolinaBattlefieldProfiles/Monroes%20Cross%20Roads%20to%20Wyse%20Fork.pdf CWSAC Report Update]"
