He left without graduating to work at the law office of Stephen Cambreling in New York City, where he began to study law. Balch was admitted to the New York bar in 1845. Relocating to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the end of 1849, he was admitted to the Philadelphia bar in 1850.\nHe was married to Emily Swift Balch of Philadelphia in 1852. Mrs. Balch was a member of the Acorn Club of Philadelphia, and the Colonial Dames of America. Thomas and Emily Balch had three sons and a daughter.\nIn 1854, Balch was elected to the Philadelphia common council, serving for two years. In 1855, he was admitted as a counsellor before the Supreme Court of the United States. From 1859 to 1873, Balch lived in Europe and resided with his family primarily in Paris. In 1861, he briefly served as U.S. consul in Paris.\nThomas Balch has been called the \"father of international arbitration\" for his work in popularizing this peaceful mechanism of international dispute resolution (see Thomas Balch Library).\nThomas Balch died March 29, 1877, in Philadelphia, and was buried at the Old Trinity Church.\nThomas Balch Library\nIn 1922, a library was constructed in Leesburg, Virginia, as a memorial to Thomas Balch, a Leesburg native, and was named \"The Thomas Balch Library\".
