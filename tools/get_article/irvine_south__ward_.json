Created in 2017, the ward elects three councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 10,887 people.\nThe area has been politically split with each election returning one Scottish National Party (SNP), one Labour and one Conservative councillor.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections. This was the first review after the introduction of the single transferable vote electoral system in 2007. Irvine South was one of three new wards created in North Ayrshire as the total number of councillors was increased to more evenly balance electoral parity in the region. Irvine South, as the name suggests, covers southern parts of the town of Irvine and takes in an area to the west of the River Irvine and south of the Annick Water including Fullarton and the mainly industrial area around Drybridge and Shewalton as well as Broomlands and Dreghorn. These areas were previously part of the Irvine East and Irvine West wards. Following the implementation of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, the boundaries in North Ayrshire were reviewed but this did not affect the Irvine wards.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Christina Larsen(SNP)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Robert Foster(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Margaret George(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Matthew McLean(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\nNotes\nReferences"
