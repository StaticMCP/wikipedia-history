Apparently, he was a son of Idrimi. Also a certain Addu-Nirari is mentioned as son and heir to Idrimi. This makes the order of succession unclear. It is possible that Idrimi was succeeded by Addu-Nirari and then Niqmepa.\nFor signing some of his documents, Niqmepa used the Royal Seal of his ancestor Abba-El II as a dynastic seal. Abba-El II was the king of Halab (formerly Yamhad) in the 16th century BC.\nVassalage of Mitanni\nThe Kingdom of Mukish (Alalakh IV) was a vassal of the Mitanni Empire. Niqmepa appears to have been subject to the Mitanni king Shaushtatar as his overlord. Mitanni was competing with Egypt for dominance in Syria (contemporary kings Thutmose III, Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV).\nA dispute between king Sunassura of Kizzuwatna and Niqmepa of Alalakh was adjudicated by Shaushtatar. This is recorded on two tablets (AIT 13 and AIT 14) that were found at Alalakh. They provide an important synchronism for establishing the timelines of these ruling dynasties.\nAttestations\nEvidence for the reign of King Niqmepa is based on clay cuneiform tablets excavated at Tell Atchana by Charles Leonard Woolley.\nA treaty between Ir-Teššob of Tunip and Niqmepa of Alalaḫ is also preserved (AlT 2).\nThe relationship between Halab (Aleppo) and Alalakh at the time of Niqmepa is illuminated by five texts found at Level IV of Alalakh. Among them is the text AlT 101, which is a receipt showing that Niqmepa of Alalah's returned some fugitives from Aleppo to Wantaraššura, who was probably the ruler of Aleppo at that time. This indicates that Niqmepa was recognizing Halab as a significant regional power.\nSee also\n*Yamhad dynasty\nReferences"
