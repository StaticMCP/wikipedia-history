It toured the country of Canada for two years (1978–1980) with the purpose to help the Canadian people learn about their history.\nThe ~20 car red and white train toured the width and breadth of Canada. Fifteen of the cars had been used for the similar American Freedom Train in the United States from 1975–1976, before being bought by National Museums of Canada. The showcase cars from the Freedom Train were converted to tunnel cars.\nTo make such a train a reality took the cooperation of many organizations. The Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railroads handled the train free of charge. The Royal Bank of Canada, Labatt Breweries, General Motors of Canada, and the Great-West Life Assurance Company each donated C$400,000. Gifts totalling C$684,500 also came from The Devonian Group, The Richard Ivey Foundation, and the MacDonald Stewart Foundation. There was also a C$100,000 anonymous gift.\nRichard Williams Studios made an advert film for the train.\nHundreds of thousands of Canadians rediscovered their country as they toured the train on its three-year journey\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.themetrains.com/discovery-train-main.htm The Story of the 1978-1980 Canadian Discovery Train at ThemeTrains.com]\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/nippon_newfie/sets/72157607272738110/with/2854121917/ Photos of the Discovery Train]\n*The Discovery Train, [https://canadamodern.org/the-discovery-train-tm69/ Canada Modern Museum]\n*\"Once upon a Train: The Discovery Train, Year One\", [https://collection.nfb.ca/film/once-upon-a-train-the-discovery-train-year-one National Film Board of Canada]"
