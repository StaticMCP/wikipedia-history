In December 2011, he met with Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, along with other civil society delegates.\nEarly life\nShwe Nya War Sayadaw was born on 14 May 1965 in Phayagon village, Mandalay Division, to U Htun Yin and Daw Hla Tot.\nMonkhood career\nIn February 2012, Shwenyawa Sayadaw, the abbot of the Sadhu Pariyatti Monastery, was evicted from his monastery by the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee for alleged disobedience, by holding a sermon at the Mandalay office of the National League for Democracy in September, where he had publicly called for the release of political prisoners and the end of ongoing civil wars.\nShwenyawa Sayadaw was known to be a controversial and outspoken figure. He criticised many of his peers in the Buddhist clergy for corruption and failure to live up to their religious obligations, as well as speaking out against the government and the military. Most notably he was known for his strong opposition to the nationalistic and anti-Muslim 969 movement. Shwenyawa Saydaw urged calm and restraint during the 2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots.\nIn the wake of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état on 1 February, he was detained by the Myanmar Armed Forces.\nDeath\nOn 10 July 2025, Shwe Nya War Sayadaw died from liver disease at Asia Royal Hospital in Yangon. He was 60.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002056/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20111216-316692.html new.asiaone.com]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16198935 BBC Asia]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxGICCfRDAU&feature=player_embedded#at=182 Shwe Nya War Sayadaw said broke media ethics ]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFMh4SYf0to Shwe Nya War Sayadaw and 99% Buddhist monks agreed and recommended on 969 campaign].
