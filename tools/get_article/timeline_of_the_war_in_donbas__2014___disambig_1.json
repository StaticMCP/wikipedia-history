The militants took control of the SBU armoury and armed themselves with automatic weapons, while other supporters brought bricks and debris to erect barricades. They initially numbered 1,000, but subsequently thinned. In an address on the Ukrainian national television channel, interim President Oleksandr Turchynov stated that the current unrest in eastern Ukraine was \"the second wave\" of a Russian operation to destabilise Ukraine, overthrow the government and disrupt planned elections and represented an attempt by Russia to \"dismember\" Ukraine.
