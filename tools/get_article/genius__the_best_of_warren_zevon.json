This does exactly that over the course of a generous, sharply selected 22 tracks. Given the space, it's inevitable that some great songs are missing.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Warren Zevon –  synthesizer, harmonica, piano, keyboards, electric piano, vocals, synthesizer strings\n*Bill Berry –  drums\n*Charlie Bisharat –  violin\n*Roy Bittan –  piano\n*Jackson Browne –  harmony vocals\n*Peter Buck –  guitar\n*Lindsey Buckingham –  harmony vocals\n*Linda Ronstadt –  harmony vocals\n*Rosemary Butler –  harmony vocals\n*Jorge Calderón –  bass guitar, guitar, harmony vocals\n*Mike Campbell –  guitar\n*Larry Corbett –  cello\n*Joel Derouin –  violin\n*Kenny Edwards –  harmony vocals\n*Don Felder –  guitar\n*Anton Fig –  drums\n*Mick Fleetwood –  drums\n*Glenn Frey –  rhythm guitar, harmony vocals\n*Bob Glaub –  bass\n*Richard Hayward –  drums\n*Don Henley –  harmony vocals\n*Jim Horn –  saxophone\n*Jim Keltner –  drums\n*Bobby Keyes –  saxophone\n*Larry Klein –  bass\n*Craig Krampf –  drums\n*Russ Kunkel –  drums\n*Kipp Lennon –  harmony vocals\n*Mark Lennon –  harmony vocals\n*Michael Lennon –  harmony vocals\n*David Lindley –  fiddle, guitar, slide guitar, lap steel guitar\n*Rick Marotta –  drums, harmony vocals\n*John McVie –  bass\n*Mike Mills –  bass\n*Graham Nash –  harmony vocals\n*Jeff Porcaro –  drums\n*The Sid Sharp Strings –  strings\n*Leland Sklar –  bass\n*JD Souther –  harmony vocals\n*Benmont Tench –  organ\n*Waddy Wachtel –  guitar, harmony vocals, 12 string acoustic guitar\n*Jennifer Warnes –  harmony vocals\n*Winston Watson –  drums\n*Evan Wilson –  viola\n*Jai Winding –  piano\n*Neil Young –  harmony vocals\n*Larry Zack –  drums\n*Jordan Zevon –  harmony vocals\nTechnical\n*Warren Zevon – compilation producer, producer, mixing, string arrangements, art direction, phtogoraphy\n*Gary Peterson – compilation producer\n*Duncan Aldrich – producer, engineer, mixing\n*Niko Bolas – producer, engineer\n* Jackson Browne – producer\n*Paul Q.
