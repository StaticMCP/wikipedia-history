They began their ministry from a 'cottage on the shores of Cleveland Bay'.\nIn 1882, Rockhampton was declared a Diocese and the Townsville group was governed from there until 1901, when the group became self-governing with the formation of a Townsville Congregation. Thirteen Sisters were foundation members made up of Sisters from the Brisbane and Rockhampton Congregations who chose to stay in the North.\nOver the years the number of Sisters grew and their ministries diversified. Care of sick people was a well-established tradition among Sisters of Mercy, and in keeping with that, the decision was made in 1945 to establish a Catholic hospital in Townsville.\nA small private hospital in Stagpole Street, known as 'The Lister', was purchased and the Townsville Sisters of Mercy moved formally into Health Care ministry. The hospital was renamed the 'Mater Misericordiae' (Mother of Mercy), the title given to all hospitals operated by the Sisters of Mercy.\nWhen this hospital was found to be inadequate to meet the demands of modern health care, a property was purchased in Fulham Road and a new 50-bed hospital was opened in 1962. The transfer to the new hospital was made possible by the support given to the Sisters of Mercy by local fund raisers.\nThe Mater Hospital Pimlico from the inner courtyard\nHospitals\nMater Hospital Pimlico is an acute Medical/Surgical facility with a bed capacity of 158.
