Incumbent President Václav Havel participated in the first ballot held on 3 July 1992. He ran unopposed but failed to receive enough votes from Slovak MPs to be re-elected. Havel resigned on 17 July due to his failure.\nResult\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate !! rowspan=\"2\" |Party !! colspan=\"2\" |1st ballot !! colspan=\"2\" |2nd ballot !! colspan=\"2\" |3rd ballot !! rowspan=\"2\" |4th ballot\n|-\n! 1st round !! 2nd round !! 1st round !! 2nd round !! 1st round !! 2nd round\n|-\n| Václav Havel || Independent || SL:79SN:69 || SL:80SN:63 || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A\n|-\n| Miroslav Sládek || Rally for the Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || SL:32SN:26 || SL:33SN:27 || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A\n|-\n| Zdeněk Viktor Procházka || Rally for the Republic – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || SL:4SN:3 || SL:5SN:0 || colspan=\"2\" |N/A\n|-\n| Zdeněk Pinta || Rally for the Republic  – Republican Party of Czechoslovakia || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || SL:4SN:4 || SL:1SN:2 || colspan=\"2\" |N/A\n|-\n| Marie Kristková || Liberal-Social Union|| colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || SL:29SN:36 || SL:33SN:37 || colspan=\"2\" |N/A\n|-\n| Jiří Kotas || Liberal-Social Union || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || colspan=\"2\" |N/A || SL:16SN:24\n|}\nReferences"
