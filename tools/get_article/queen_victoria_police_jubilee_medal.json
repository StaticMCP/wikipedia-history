Those in possession of the earlier Golden Jubilee Police Medal who again qualified, received a dated clasp to be fixed to their existing medal.\nAward\nBelow are the number of medals awarded, the wording of the service being that inscribed on the medal:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!Service inscribed on medal|| 1887: medals || 1897: medals || 1897: clasps\n|-\n|align=center| Metropolitan Police ||align=center| 14,000 ||align=center| 7,481 ||align=center| 8,708\n|-\n|align=center| City of London Police ||align=center| 900||align=center| 535 ||align=center|  485\n|-\n|align=center| London County Council Metropolitan Fire Brigade ||align=center| – ||align=center| 950 ||align=center| –\n|-\n|align=center| St John Ambulance Brigade ||align=center| – ||align=center| 910 ||align=center| –\n|-\n|align=center| Police Ambulance ||align=center| – ||align=center| 210 ||align=center| –\n|-\n|align=center| Total ||align=center| 14,900 ||align=center| 10,086 ||align=center| 9,193\n|}\nDescription\nThe medal and ribbon were identical for the 1887 and 1897 medal, with the exception of the year inscribed on the reverse.\nThe medal is of bronze,  in diameter and has a plain straight ribbon bar.\n* Obverse: A left-facing bust of the Queen, designed by L.
