The award has been sponsored by Jujamcyn Amusement Corporation, one of the three principal organizations involved in Broadway theatre in New York.  The award has included a cash prize that has varied from $50,000 to $100,000.  The former owner of Jujamcyn, James H. Binger, was a primary sponsor of the award up to his death in 2004.
