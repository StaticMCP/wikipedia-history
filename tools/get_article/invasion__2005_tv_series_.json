It originally aired on ABC from September 21, 2005, through May 17, 2006. Somewhat similar to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the show told the story of the aftermath of a hurricane in which water-based creatures infiltrate a small Florida town and begin to take over the bodies of the town's inhabitants through a cloning process (by first merging with, then replacing them). It stars an ensemble cast featuring William Fichtner, Eddie Cibrian, Kari Matchett, Lisa Sheridan, Tyler Labine, Alexis Dziena, Evan Peters and Ariel Gade. The show was produced by Shaun Cassidy Productions and Warner Bros. Television.\nDue to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the aftermath in the southern United States, early on-air promotions were quickly pulled by ABC. The advertising then switched emphasis completely to the alien invasion aspect of the series, while the hurricane received no mention. The premiere was also preceded with a warning that the show featured images of a fictional hurricane, to which viewers could be sensitive.\nInvasion received critical acclaim, with praise for its acting, writing, direction, and the musical score. Originally conceived for 5 seasons, the series was canceled on May 17, 2006. Since then, the show has appeared in numerous lists of shows that were \"cancelled too soon\", including lists by Entertainment Weekly and The Huffington Post.\nPlot\nThe series took place in Southern Florida and involved a string of mysterious occurrences that take place in a small town in the aftermath of a violent hurricane. Invoking thematic elements from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the series centered on park ranger Russell Varon (Eddie Cibrian) and his family and his efforts to uncover the truth about a conspiracy involving water-breathing extraterrestrials creating human clones from the bodies of the dead.\nCast and characters\n* William Fichtner as Sheriff Tom Underlay\n* Eddie Cibrian as Russell Varon\n* Kari Matchett as Dr. Mariel Underlay\n* Lisa Sheridan as Larkin Groves\n* Tyler Labine as Dave Groves\n* Alexis Dziena as Kira Underlay\n* Evan Peters as Jesse Varon\n* Nathan Baesel as Lewis Sirk (recurring guest star)\n* David Huynh as Sun Kim (recurring guest star)\n* Ariel Gade as Rose Varon\n* Aisha Hinds as Mona Gomez\n* Edwin Hodge as Brett\n* James Frain as Eli Szura (recurring guest star)\n* Elisabeth Moss as Christina (recurring guest star)\nEpisodes\n| ProdCode = 475281\n| ShortSummary = Hurricane Eve strikes the town of Homestead.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an 80% approval rating with an average rating of 8.8/10 based on 10 reviews. Metacritic gave the season a score of 72, making it generally favorable.\nThe show was nominated on the 32nd Saturn Awards for Best Network TV Series and Best Television Actor for William Fichtner. Stephen King also\npraised the series.\nThe Cast’s Fond Memories\nMany actors, including Eddie Cibrian, Ariel Gade, Kari Matchett, Evan Peters, Lisa Sheridan, Nathan Baesal and Tyler Labine, have expressed fond memories of working on Invasion, often citing it as one of their favorite projects. Cibrian highlighted the fun he had with co-stars Tyler Labine and Evan Peters, while Peters, reflecting on his early career, admitted he was still learning but appreciated the opportunity to work alongside William Fichtner. Matchett, who played Mariel, loved her role and praised the creative team, especially Shaun Cassidy and Thomas Schlamme. Gade also shared that the experience was unique, noting how the long shooting schedule allowed the cast to grow close.\nWilliam Fichtner’s Reservations\nOn the other hand, William Fichtner, despite his respect for the show's potential, has been less enthusiastic about Invasion. He noted the show's low ratings and eventual cancellation but also recognized the character of Sheriff Tom Underlay as one that had much more untapped potential. Fichtner expressed disappointment that Underlay was framed more as a \"dark evil\" character, missing an opportunity to explore a more mysterious and morally ambiguous side, which could have added depth to the series. While he still gets asked about the show, he admitted it wasn’t one of the highlights of his career. Fichtner has been open about how he felt a sense of relief when Invasion was cancelled, admitting that he had never experienced such a strong desire to leave a project before. He even remarked that the cancellation was \"a deliverance\" for him, and he was genuinely pleased to move on. He also acknowledged that without the series, he wouldn't have landed roles in other projects, like Prison Break, which he clearly preferred.\nIn an interview for the Prison Break with Sarah & Paul podcast released in May 2025, William Fichtner talked about the series:\n\"It was not what was shared with me about how it was going to go, and I was upfront about that after a few episodes of the first season. I was very clear about saying, ‘Wait, hold on a second, where are you going with this now? Because you told me this, and now you’re going in this direction. It’s your show, but I also want to remind you of the deep conversations we had about this.’ It did not end up being a pleasant thing. I remember saying to my agent at the time that the producers of the show and the creators of the show are very lucky because I’m not a phone-in guy, and I’ll always put my best foot forward, and that was a tough one because I wanted to go.\"\nTyler Labine’s Frustration\nTyler Labine, like many of his co-stars, has repeatedly expressed his frustration over the cancellation of Invasion, stating that despite strong ratings, critical acclaim, and a dedicated fanbase, the series was axed due to \"purely politics.\" He remains puzzled by the decision, commenting, \"I still to this day don’t know why that show got canceled,\" and believed the show had the potential to become a major hit, comparing it to Lost with its \"crazy plot and twists.\" Labine reflected on his disappointment that he never got to see those twists unfold, describing it as \"a big hit that got cancelled for some reason that nobody understands.\" He also highlighted the positive aspects of the show, particularly how it gave him the chance to play a dramatic role, which was a rewarding challenge. Labine praised Shaun Cassidy as \"a mad genius\" and concluded by pointing out the \"full circle\" moment with Cassidy's later work on New Amsterdam.\nShaun Cassidy’s Reflections\nShaun Cassidy made a similar statement about the show's cancellation: \"I think there were unrealistic expectations that any show following Lost should do better. But no show after ours ever DID do better, so I suspect some of the execs may have regretted taking our show off the air.\" To the question \"Of all the shows you’ve created that were canceled far too soon, which hurt the most ... and why?\", Cassidy personally picked Invasion because \"it was the most surprising\". In 2020, writer Carlos Coto also blamed the time slot for the show's cancellation, explaining: \"They put us on after Lost. It made sense on paper, but audiences weren't up for two mythology-rich shows at once. Lost was awesome, but exhausting -- in a good way (and so were we)\".\nPost-Cancellation Praise: A Cult Following\n“One of the challenges when I was starting to write TV series, like American Gothic and Invasion, they did not want anything serialized on network. They wanted closed-ended [episodes], because they couldn't sell [serialized shows] internationally, or they had some argument why they didn't repeat well or something. It was so frustrating, because I liked shows that felt like novels, and I still do. And now that is au courant, which is great.“ - Shaun Cassidy\nAfter the series' cancellation and over the years, Invasion has gained growing appreciation, with its complex themes and deep characters now considered major strengths. Initially criticized for its bad timing, airing right after Lost, it struggled to capture and retain an audience. As noted by Entertainment Weekly, “Invasion was rather high-concept” and “lost in the buzz surrounding the second season of the equally high-concept Lost,” which overshadowed it. Jason Hughes from HuffPost TV explains that, despite its impressive 17 million viewer debut, Invasion couldn’t recover when ratings slipped, partly due to its hurricane-themed premise, which felt too soon after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Screen Rant further emphasized that the real-life aftermath of Katrina forced ABC to halt promotion for the show, despite its critical acclaim and loyal fanbase. However, the show’s unique premise—a small Florida town overtaken by alien creatures following a storm—captured the imagination of critics. MovieWeb praised the series as a \"wonderful homage\" to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, noting the mindbending alien takeover plot and William Fichtner’s standout performance. The show's cinematography, which beautifully captured Florida's destruction, was also widely praised. David Churchill, in Critic At Large, calls Invasion a \"completely brilliant show,\" pointing out its rich exploration of societal fears, such as “the dangerous post-9/11 world where terror can come from abroad, above or your next-door neighbor.” The show’s deep connection to family was also noted in the 2009 article 2000s: 15 Sci-Fi Series That Deserved A Longer Run, which praised Invasion for being “at its heart, a show about family” and lamented the mysteries Cassidy had planned to expand on in future seasons, which were left unresolved due to its untimely cancellation. As Brad LaCour noted in Collider’s retrospective on shows turning 20, Invasion holds a special place in viewers' memories as \"one of the best sci-fi shows that was canceled far too soon.\" He praised the series for its gothic horror influence and unique atmosphere, citing the talented ensemble cast, including William Fichtner, Evan Peters, and Tyler Labine, which made the show stand out. Over time, the series' ability to combine family drama with science fiction has become more apparent, with WhatCulture observing that it created a \"mystery\" that kept viewers engaged, peeling back layers of complexity episode by episode. The show’s cinematography, praised by Collider for capturing both the \"beauty and destruction\" of Florida, added to its atmospheric depth. Critics also highlighted the psychological tension, with A.V. Club noting how Invasion gradually shifted from a simple alien-invasion story to a \"slow burn\" that asked, “Who’s real and who isn’t?”\nAdditionally, D.S. Watson’s article, “Does Anyone Remember…Invasion (2005)? The Best Sci-Fi Show No One Watched,” underscores the show’s lasting impact. Watson argues that Invasion is a \"hidden gem\" and praises it for its unique combination of psychological horror and sci-fi, with a gripping narrative, strong performances (especially from William Fichtner), and stunning production values. He notes that it was ahead of its time, and despite being unfairly canceled, it remains a standout in the sci-fi genre, deserving more recognition for its cinematic quality and depth.\nFor Shaun Cassidy, Invasion was a chance to explore themes that were deeply personal. In a 2024 interview, he explained, \"It's always about family, usually some hidden version of my own or my own experiences.\" He went on to describe how Invasion was marketed as an alien invasion story, but for him, it was about \"the invasion of a new father in my children's house\" and the challenges of co-parenting after divorce. Cassidy noted that, much like in his earlier series American Gothic, he was exploring dysfunctional family dynamics and the emotional complexities of blended families in the midst of extraordinary circumstances.\nBroadcast history\nThe series premiered on ABC  on September 21, 2005, and aired for one season. The series included twenty-two episodes, which aired Wednesday evening at 10:00pm. After the show's cancellation there were reports of a possible move to The CW, however, a deal never came to fruition.  The final episode aired on May 17, 2006. On August 22, 2006, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released the complete first season as a six-disc DVD box set.\nIn the UK, the show premiered as a double bill on Channel 4, with the third episode shown shortly afterwards on 4's digital sister channel E4. In Bulgaria, Invasion premiered on February 21, 2007, on Nova Television and in Romania it premiered on March 10, 2009, on Pro Cinema movie channel. In Australia, the series premiered on the Nine Network in March 2006.\nRatings troubles\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, the series premiere garnered 17 million viewers airing after Lost. By the November 30, 2005 episode, the show was only garnering 10 million viewers.\nFor the episodes shown on January 11, 18, and 25 the Nielsen Ratings only reached 9.7 million, 9 million and 9.3 million, respectively. It had lost nearly half of the first episode's audience, far behind CBS's CSI: NY, which had 13.7 million, 15.5 million and 14.9 million, for the same period. The show was then put on hiatus for the second time, during which time it was replaced with The Evidence.\nFuture plotlines\nIn the \"August 14–20, 2006\" issue of TV Guide, actor Tyler Labine relayed what creator Shaun Cassidy had planned for the following season, saying that Cassidy had said: \"Shaun told me Larkin was going to [be presumed dead]. I was going to get all militant and shave my head, and Russell and I were going to join forces against Tom. Tom was going to find out that his first wife was actually alive, and she was running this whole military operation, and she was Szura’s boss.\" William Fichtner also relayed that storyline: \"There was something in there that I thought that was so good. I discovered who it really was who was orchestrating [everything]. I didn't even see it coming from a million miles away. It was my [first wife, Grace], who got on the plane with me. Two people lived after that [1996] plane crash, not just one. She went in another direction altogether. It's amazing. It was, 'Ah, what you could have done with that.'\"\nIn an 2010 interview, during the promotion of Tucker & Dale vs. Evil, Tyler Labine revealed that the overall concept of the series was to depict humanity facing an evolutionary change they couldn’t stop. The \"invasion\" seen in the show wasn’t meant to be a traditional invasion, but rather an evolutionary step marking the end of humanity as we knew it. According to him, Shaun Cassidy had planned for the show to span five seasons, exploring the desperate struggle of humans fighting an irreversible process. It was a battle that humans could never win, ultimately leading to \"the end of human nature.\" He also mentioned that Larkin was supposed to return in a more evolved, antagonist role, stronger than the hybrids, and that he and Russell would have joined a militia in an attempt to kill her. Ultimately, the show would have explored humanity's end through a forced evolutionary step, and the overall theme was that, no matter what, \"we're all dead\" because humanity was destined to disappear in the face of this new evolutionary phase.\nSoundtrack\nInvasion features an orchestral score performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra and composed by Jon Ehrlich and Jason Derlatka, incorporating many recurring themes and dramatic melodies. Their music was well received.  The soundtrack of the show became available on October 21, 2008 at moviescoremedia.com. The album features more than 60 minutes of carefully selected tracks from the series.\nInvasion is one of Ehrlich and Derlatka's favorite works saying: \"Its always a treat working with a great orchestra. We love working with Shaun Cassidy.\"\nDVD releases\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0px 8px\" rowspan=\"2\"| DVD name\n! style=\"padding: 0px 8px\" rowspan=\"2\"| Episodes\n! colspan=\"3\"| DVD release dates\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"padding: 0px 8px\"| Discs\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0px 8px\"| Region 1\n! style=\"padding: 0px 8px\"| Region 2\n! style=\"padding: 0px 8px\"| Region 4\n|-\n| The Complete Series\n| 22\n|\n|\n|\n| 6\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
