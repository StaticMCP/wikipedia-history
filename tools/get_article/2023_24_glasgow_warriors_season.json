The 6pm kick off was chosen so as not to clash with the Scotland versus Romania match. Zebre provided cap numbers with their player line-ups.\nWith 16 players at the World Cup, the Warriors fielded an experimental side with a host of academy players involved. In addition, the 22 year old scrum half Jamie Dobie was named as captain. The Warriors head coach Franco Smith explained:\nTomorrow sees us take the next step in our pre-season preparations, as we take on a Zebre Parma team that will test us across the field. The players have worked hard since returning to Scotstoun, and everyone is looking forward to getting back out there.\nWe’re also pleased to give an opportunity to some of our academy players, who have earned their opportunity with their efforts in pre-season so far. The growth of our squad and Scottish rugby overall is a priority for us, so we’re excited to give these young players their chance.\nIt's good to work with players we might not have the opportunity to work with so closely over the rest of the season. So it's a huge opportunity to work with these young players, the next generation of Scottish players and Glasgow Warriors players, and expose them to our environment. We’re excited about getting back out there - the players more than I am. Everybody is ready for the next step.\n[Jamie Dobie] leads more by example, which we always appreciate more than just someone leading by his voice. The leadership qualities that he's presented over the last year have been extraordinary, so he's been rewarded for his manner, the way he goes about his business, and influencing the players around him. Through his contribution he merits this chance - he's definitely part of our leadership group going forward.\nFranco Smith was happy with the run out for Glasgow Warriors. He was also pleased to see his son play well from the bench for Zebre.\nKyle Rowe has shown tonight that there's some class about him. I think he's definitely going to be important for us. But all of these players are going to be important.\nWe'll have this big group coming back from the World Cup who will need to be managed physically, emotionally and mentally. So to keep everybody at their best we’re going to have to look to our depth and that's what we are working hard on at this stage.\nIt was fantastic to see [Franco Jnr.] and he did well. He can be happy with what he brought to it in the second half.\nThe away fixture to Cavan to play Ulster proved just too much for the young Warriors side. Franco Smith was nevertheless happy with what he saw from the players:\nI think without the ball we were really good. We probably made between 220 and 230 tackles which is what is necessary from a fitness perspective, from a character perspective, from a team-building perspective.\nIn that regard I'm really happy with the players attitude.\nI'm obviously disappointed we didn't get anything going in attack. I think Ulster deprived us well of ball at the breakdown specifically so there's a lot of work to do but that's in our DNA so I don't have too much concern about that.\nLook, again, there's a young bunch of players, players that didn't get the opportunity last season that have worked hard in preseason.\nMatch 1\n|score = 33 - 29\n|report = [https://glasgowwarriors.org/dobie-to-captain-glasgow-warriors-in-pre-season-opener/ Preview][https://glasgowwarriors.org/glasgow-warriors-33-29-zebre-parma/ Report][https://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/match/011810.php Report][https://www.theoffsideline.com/glasgow-warriors-v-zebre-franco-smiths-men-survive-late-italian-flurry-to-record-friendly-win/ Report]\n|away =   Zebre Parma\n|try1 = Jamie DobieKyle Rowe x 2Sebastián CancelliereLuca Bardelli\n|con1 = Ross Thompson x 4\n|pen1=\n|try2 = Jacopo Trulla x 2Giovanni Quattrini x 2\n|con2 = Giacomo FerrariTiff Eden x 2\n|pen2= Giovanni Montemauri\n|stadium = Scotstoun Stadium\n|attendance =\n|referee = Ruairidh Campbell (SRU)\n}}\nGlasgow Warriors: 1.

George Horne became a club centurion from the bench. The first of five away defeats this season in the league came playing Connacht. “We’re not happy with our performance at all.” said Henco Venter.\nScotstoun remained a fortress throughout the league season. Teams came and were conquered, one by one. The most visiting teams could do were to prevent a bonus point victory for Glasgow Warriors. The Stormers, Edinburgh in the first 1872 Cup match, Cardiff and the Sharks managed this feat in the regular season. Every other visiting URC team failed.\nThe Glasgow Warriors away form was decent but there were 4 other away losses in the league. A defeat by Munster at Thomond Park still left Warriors with a try bonus point. A loss at Murrayfield by Edinburgh couldn't prevent Glasgow taking the 1872 Cup home. And late in the season 2 losses to the Bulls and the Lions at altitude proved costly, although the Warriors got close to the Bulls; winning the second half and getting 2 bonus points in the loss.\nGlasgow Warriors were looking handsome at the top of the league before those away South African losses. At the end of the regular season, those losses meant the chasing teams caught up with Glasgow, despite the Warriors winning a bonus point victory against Zebre in the final match. Instead of finishing first, the Glasgow Warriors finished fourth in a congested top 4. Only 3 points stood between Munster in first and Glasgow in fourth.\nFinishing fourth meant a home quarter final against Stormers. Like before in the season, the visiting South Africans were dispatched; aided in this by Manie Libbok's poor kicking in windy conditions. This set up an away semi-final at Thomond Park. Munster advertising a home final at Thomond Park between them and the Bulls before the match gave Glasgow extra incentive to win. This was a match that Glasgow out-fought Munster and they were deserved winners with tries by Kyle Steyn and Sebastian Cancelliere.\nThe final against the Bulls at their home in Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria was at 1350 metres above sea level. It was difficult for the Warriors to book flights for everyone in the squad together in such short notice, so parties were split into batches and travelled at different days. It also meant that very few of the Warrior Nation could travel to Pretoria for the final, and the stadium was almost sold out by expectant Bulls fans. However Franco Smith promised no excuses for the team. The Bulls at their home were heavy favourites and bookmakers gave Glasgow long odds for winning.\nIn the match, Glasgow matched the Bulls physicality in the first half, and outshone them in the second half. The Bulls raced to a 13–0 lead before the Warriors converted a try by Scott Cummings at the end of the half. And like the last match against the Bulls, Glasgow Warriors knew that they could win the second half. Tries followed by George Turner and Huw Jones. The Bulls could only score a further penalty in the entire game. A controversial disallowed try from Jack Dempsey gave the Bulls a chink of hope at the end of the game. Glasgow's defence was stout and despite Tom Jordan being yellow carded two minutes from time, the Warriors held out for a famous victory by 21 points to 16.\nLeague table\nResults\nRound 1\n|score=
