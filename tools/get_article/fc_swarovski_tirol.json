With manager Ernst Happel it won the Austrian football championship of 1989 and 1990 as well as the Austrian Cup in 1989. It nevertheless was dissolved in 1992 and the license fell back to FC Wacker, only to change over again to the newly established FC Tirol Innsbruck one year later.\nHonours\n* Austrian Championship (2): 1988–89, 1989–90\n* Austrian Championship Runners-up (1): 1990–91\n* Austrian Cup (1): 1988–89\n* Austrian Cup Runners-up (2): 1986–87, 1987–88\n* Austrian Supercup Runners-up (3): 1987, 1989, 1990\nEuropean Cup history\n*Q = Qualifying QF = Quarterfinal SF = Semifinal\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
