After completing his military service, he moved west into Upper Canada, which had been created as a separate colony in 1791.\nAn early settler in the Lower Thames River Valley, Ward received land through the Crown’s grant system in 1794 His property stood in the Long Woods at the junction of Paint Creek and a long-established Indigenous trail , where he was authorized to operate a waystation known as Ward’s Station.\nWard’s presence is documented from 1794 onward through a series of Crown land certificates and petitions.\nWard’s Station\nIn the early nineteenth century, colonial authorities improved the Indigenous trail into the Longwoods Road. It became the only overland route between the military base of Fort Malden and the adminitrative base of London. Situated roughly midway between these two sites, Ward’s Station became a regular stopping place for travellers and military traffic, including during the War of 1812.\nWar of 1812\nWard had four sons: William (1794–1851), James (1795–1812), Alexander Daniel (1802-1876), and Talbot St John (1804–1878).\nThe two eldest, William and James, served in the War of 1812 under Captain John McGregor in the Loyal Kent Militia. James died from illness contracted while stationed at Burlington Heights in 1812. William Ward took part in the Battle of Longwoods on March 4, 1814.\nAlexander, still a child during the war, later recalled running with his younger brother, Talbot, through an encampment of Tecumseh and his warriors shortly before the Battle of the Thames on October 5, 1813.\nDuring the American advance following the Battle of the Thames, buildings along the Longwoods Road were burned by American forces. Contemporary accounts record that Ward’s house and waystation were among those destroyed during the retreat.\nDeath and commemoration\nGeorge Ward died in 1837 in Wardsville, Ontario. He is buried in the Wardsville Municipal Cemetery, where the family monument records that he and his wife Margaret were “the first settlers in this district and from whom the village derives its name.”\nThe Historic Military Establishments of Upper Canada later recognized George—and his sons William and James—for their service in the War of 1812 with a commemorative plaque placed in the Wardsville Municipal Cemetery.\nWardsville and family legacy\nThe stopping place established by Ward at Paint Creek grew to become the community known as Wardsville. It is not a permanent village in Middlesex County.\nMisidentification\nGeorge Ward—the founder of Wardsville—has been erroneously confused with men of the same name who served in other military units during the Revolutionary era. [His British Army service record has not yet been located in surviving archival sources.]\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Goodspeed, W.A. History of the County of Middlesex, Canada.
