The ward boundaries were changed in 1953 and in 1973 was merged into the Central, Everton, Netherfield ward before being re-established in 1980. The boundaries were again changed in 2004 and the ward was split into three parts in 2023.\n1980 boundaries\nA report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England published in November 1978 set out proposals for changes to the wards of Liverpool City Council, maintaining the number of councillors at 99 representing 33 wards. Croxteth ward was represented by three councillors.\nThe report describes the boundaries as \"Commencing at a point where the western boundary of the City meets the\nsouthern boundary of Vauxhall Ward, thence generally eastwards along said ward boundary and northwards and eastwards along the eastern boundary of said ward to the western boundary of Breckfield Ward, thence generally southeastwards along said boundary and eastwards along the southern boundary of said ward to the western boundary of Kensington Ward, thence southeastwards and southwestwards along said boundary and continuing southwestwards along West -Derby Road and Brunswick Road to Moss Street, thence southwards along said street and Daulby Street to Pembroke Place, thence northwestwards along said place and London Road to Seymour Street, thence southeastwards along said street to Copperas Hill, thence southwestwards along said Hill and Ranelagh Street to Church Street, thence generally westwards along said street and Lord Street to Derby Square, thence generally southwestwards along the eastern and southeastern side of said square to Redcross Street, thence continuing southwestwards along said street to Strand Street, thence due southwestwards to the western boundary of the City, thence northwestwards along said boundary to the point of commencement.\nIn 2004 the ward was distributed into the new Everton ward, Central ward, and Kirkdale ward.\n2004 boundaries\nA review by the Boundary Committee for England recommended that the council was formed of a reduced number of 90 members elected from 30 wards. Everton ward was formed from the former Breckfield and Everton wards, with small parts of the former Kensington and Vauxhall wards.\nThe ward boundaries followed Everton Valley, Walton Breck Road, Oakfield Road, Belmont Road, West Derby Road, Brunswick Road, New Islington, Hunter Street, Byrom Street, Scotland Road, and Kirkdale Road.\nThe population of the ward at the 2021 Census was 17,454.\n2023 election\nThe ward was dissolved in 2023 where it was distributed into the new Everton East, Everton North, Everton West, and Vauxhall wards.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| 2004\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2006\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2007\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2008\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2010\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2011\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2012\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2014\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2015\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2016\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| John McIntosh (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2018\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Ian Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#C0C0C0\"| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2019\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ian Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Frank Prendergast (Lab)\n|-\n| 2021\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Ian Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Alfie Hincks (Lab)\n|-\n| 2022\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Ellie Byrne (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|| Jane Corbett (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|| Alfie Hincks (Lab)\n|-\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\n*Cllr Frank Prendergast (elected Labour, 2016), left the Labour Party and sat as an Independent member of the council in 2018 until he unsuccessfully stood for re-election in 2021.\n*Cllr Ian Byrne (Labour, 2018) stood down as a councillor in 2022, three years after being elected as the Member of Parliament for Liverpool West Derby.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n3.37\n}}\n14.08\n}}\n1.84\n}}\n2.81\n}}\nn/a\n}}\n2.08\n}}\n16.89\n}}\n10.30\n}}\n1.83\n}}\n10.84\n}}\n}}\n23.81\n}}\nn/a\n}}\n1.37\n}}\n3.25\n}}\n0.99\n}}\n0.45\n}}\n25.74\n}}\n1.91\n}}\n1.16\n}}\nElections of the 2010s\n}}\n2.54\n}}\n5.03\n}}\n1.97\n}}\n2.15\n}}\n0.54\n}}\n1.13\n}}\n2.77\n}}\n0.98\n}}\n}}\n5.21\n}}\n1.44\n}}\n4.22\n}}\n4.78\n}}\n8.18\n}}\n0.95\n}}\n}}\n0.63\n}}\n5.02\n}}\n5.12\n}}\n0.39\n}}\n0.24\n}}\n32.89\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nElections of the 2000s\n}}\n}}\n}}\nAfter the boundary change of 2004 the whole of Liverpool City Council faced election.
