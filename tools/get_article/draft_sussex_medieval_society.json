The society specialises in portraying both military and civilian life in the early medieval period, from the Norman Conquest of 1066 through to approximately 1267 and the end of the 2nd Baron's War.\nHistory\nThe Sussex Medieval Society was established in 2021 as a volunteer organisation dedicated to increasing public engagement with medieval history. The group grew out of the reenactment and heritage movement in southern England, where local castles, museums, and community festivals provided venues for immersive educational events.\nThe society’s starting point, the Battle of Hastings in 1066, was a decisive event that led to the end of Anglo-Saxon rule and the beginning of Norman control under William the Conqueror. The conquest introduced new systems of governance, including the widespread use of castles, the feudal hierarchy, and significant changes in landholding. Sussex itself was central to these developments, as the location of the battle and early Norman fortifications such as Pevensey Castle, Lewes Castle, and Arundel Castle.\nThe following century witnessed the consolidation of Norman rule, the growth of towns, and the spread of Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. Everyday life included a mix of Anglo-Saxon traditions and Norman innovations in law, language, and culture. The society’s portrayals of civilian life during this period highlight activities such as farming, textile production, cookery, and religious observance, all of which were central to the identity of medieval communities. The end of the period covered by the society, around 1267, coincides with the conclusion of the Second Barons’ War, a conflict between King Henry III and rebellious nobles led by Simon de Montfort. Sussex again played a role in these events, most notably in the Battle of Lewes (1264), where de Montfort’s forces defeated the king’s army and established a form of early parliamentary government.  This makes the county a particularly rich landscape for reenactment and education about medieval history.\nBy focusing on this two-hundred-year span, the Sussex Medieval Society is able to interpret both the martial and domestic aspects of medieval life, illustrating the evolution of English society from conquest through to the emergence of early representative institutions.\nActivities\nLiving history\nThe Sussex Medieval Society maintains a strong focus on domestic and cultural aspects of daily life between the Norman Conquest and the mid-13th century. Members demonstrate crafts such as textile production, leatherwork, maillework , and woodwork using historically informed methods. Food preparation is also a key feature, with open-hearth cookery and demonstrations of medieval diet  presented at public events. Re-enactors also portray aspects of religion, medicine, and storytelling, helping to illustrate the wider cultural identity of medieval communities.\nMilitary displays\nThe society stages battle reenactments, weapons demonstrations, and armour displays that highlight the evolution of medieval warfare. Members portray Norman knights, men-at-arms, and levied soldiers, showing how armies were equipped and organised in the 11th–13th centuries. Combat displays include sword and shield techniques, archery demonstrations, and coordinated group drills. The group also explains the social and political role of warfare, placing military activity within the broader context of feudal society and the defence of castles such as Pevensey, Lewes, and Arundel.\nPublic engagement\nThe Sussex Medieval Society participates in heritage festivals, museum open days, and community events across East and West Sussex. Its members regularly appear at large gatherings such as The East Sussex Living History Festival in East Sussex and at commemorations of the Battle of Lewes. The society also engages younger audiences through interactive talks, handling sessions with replica objects, and educational workshops aimed at schools and local history groups. In addition, the group maintains a strong online presence through videos and social media updates that broaden its reach beyond live events.\nOrganisation\nThe society is run by a volunteer committee, with a chairman and supporting officers overseeing activities, membership, and safety standards.\nExternal links\n* [https://sussexmedieval.co.uk/ Official website]\nReferences"
