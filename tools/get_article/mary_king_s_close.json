It took its name from one Mary King, a merchant burgess who resided on the Close in the 17th century. The close was partially demolished and buried due to the building of the Royal Exchange in the year 1753, and later closed to the public for many years. The area became shrouded in myths and urban legends; tales of hauntings and murders abounded. In 1897, Andrew Chesney, the last resident remaining in Mary King's close, was given a compulsory purchase order for £400 and he left the close in 1902.\nThe close is currently operated as a tourist attraction by Continuum Attractions.\nHauntings\nMary King's Close has had a reputation for hauntings since at least the 17th century, with several paranormal investigations taking place.
