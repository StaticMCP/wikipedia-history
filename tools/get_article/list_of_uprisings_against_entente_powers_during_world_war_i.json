It formed a powerful counterweight to the Central Powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Ottoman Empire. The conquest of many of these regions created resentment against the Entente colonial governments. Many of these regions had former uprisings or were in a constant state of rebellion.\nWhen World War I broke out in late 1914 many communities saw it as their chance to overthrow the local colonial Entente governments. This was encouraged on 14 November 1914 when the religious leaders of the Ottoman Empire declared a holy war or jihad against the Entente powers.\nAustralia\n|\n|\n|Suppressed\n|\n|}}}\nAfrica\nSouth African Republic}}\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Ovambo Uprising\n|Portuguese Angola\n| Ovambo\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Chilembwe uprising\n|Nyasaland (now Malawi)\n|Chilembwe and his followers\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Bussa rebellion\n|Bussa, Nigeria\n| Supporters of Sabukki, a local prince of the Borgu Emirate\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Adubi War\n|Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria\n| Egba rebels\n|\n|  June–July 1918\n|\n| Suppressed\n|-\n|Volta–Bani War\n|Burkina Faso, Mali\n|Marka, Bwa, Lela, Nuna, and Bobo peoples\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|}}}\nNorth Africa\n|\n|\n|Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Senussi campaign\n|\n* Egypt\n* Libya\n| Senussi\n|\n*\n*\n|\n|\n|Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Zaian War\n|French protectorate of Morocco\n|Zaian Confederation\n|\n|1914\n|1921\n|Suppressed\n|\n|}}}\nBritish India\n|1915\n|1915\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Operations against the Mahsuds\n| North-West Frontier Province, British India\n| Mahsuds\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Mohmand blockade\n|Mohmand border along North-West Frontier Province, British India\n| Mohmands\n|\n|1915\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|-\n|Operations in the Tochi\n|Tochi River, North-West Frontier Province, British India\n|Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|}}}\nEurope\nIrish nationalist forces\n|\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|}}}\nMiddle East\n|\n|\n| Suppressed\n|\n|}}}\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*"
