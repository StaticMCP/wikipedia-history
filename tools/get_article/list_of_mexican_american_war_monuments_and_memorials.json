One of the most significant is the Mexico City National Cemetery, one of the first U.S. national cemeteries. The U.S. did not start its official system of national cemeteries until an 1862 act of Congress authorized U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to proceed. However, on September 28, 1850, an American military cemetery was established in Mexico City in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War.\nOther monuments and memorials in Mexico commemorate those lost in the Mexican side of the conflict, particularly the Niños Héroes, seven army cadets who lost their lives defending Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City.  There are other monuments in Mexico City, and in Monterrey, Nogales, Puebla, San Miguel de Cozumel, and Toluca de Lerdo.\nIn the United States, \"conspicuously missing\" is any memorial to the Mexican–American War on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.  But there are monuments in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah.\nMexico\nHelen Escobedo in the book Mexican Monuments: Strange Encounters notes:\nLiterally hundreds of monuments commemorate the Niños Héroes, the seven boys who defended the castle of Chapultepec alone against the American invasion in 1847.  According to legend the last one alive wrapped himself in the Mexican flag and jumped off the parapet rather than surrender.\nMexico City\n*Mexico City National Cemetery, a U.S. national cemetery located in Colonia San Rafael, created by purchase of land in 1850, \"still stands as the only significant effort made by the federal government to recover the remains of any soldiers who lost their lives during the war with Mexico and to memorialize them. Today, this cemetery (reduced in size to a single acre in 1976) forms a tiny oasis of calm in the heart of Mexico City.\" The purchase was authorized by a September 28, 1850 act of the U.S. Congress, which led to actual purchase on June 21, 1851, of two acres for $3,000. An additional $1734.34 funding to add walls and ditching to the property was appropriated by U.S. Congress on July 21, 1852. A white stone monument's inscription recognizes approximately 750 Americans there who died in the war, mostly nearby, whose bones were reinterred to there.  Also in the cemetery are graves of veterans who died and were buried there later, up to 1923.  Dead were reinterred from shallow battlefield graves in the region.  The cemetery remains under responsibility of the American Battle Monuments Commission.\n*Obelisco a los Niños Héroes, a monument to the Niños Héroes  This or another Mexico City monument to the Niños Héroes was visited by Harry S.
