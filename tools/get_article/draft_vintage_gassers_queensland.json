The group organises and promotes nostalgia-style drag racing events featuring period-correct “gassers,” a style of hot rod built in the tradition of 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s drag racing.\nHistory\nVintage Gassers Queensland was formed to celebrate and recreate the spirit of the golden era of drag racing. The association emphasises cars that adhere to the look and build styles of traditional gassers: lightweight, high-riding hot rods running on gasoline, often with exposed engines and a nose-high stance.\nVGQ events began appearing on Queensland dragway calendars in early 2024. The group now regularly races at venues including Warwick Dragway, Ironbark Raceway, Benaraby Dragway, and Willowbank Raceway. The series has attracted both local competitors and international attention for its dedication to authenticity and nostalgia.\nEvents and activities\nVGQ organises its calendar at drag strips, where vintage-styled gassers compete and race. The focus is as much on showmanship and preserving history as on competition. Cars are typically V8-powered, running carburettors, blowers, or injection systems that reflect mid-20th-century drag racing technology.\nThe group maintains an active presence on social media, with a Facebook community and an Instagram page followed by enthusiasts worldwide. VGQ has also featured in Australian and international motorsport media.\nMedia coverage\nVintage Gassers Queensland has received coverage in several independent media outlets:\n* Warwick Today published feature articles on VGQ events in:\n** September 2024 – \"Gassers Roar Through\"\n** August 2025 – \"Gassers Roar Back into Warwick\"\n* Gasser Magazine (United States) included VGQ in its July 2025 issue, recognising its role in Australia's nostalgia drag racing scene.\n* Drag News featured VGQ as part of its national coverage of the Willowbank Nostalgias.\n* Community station 4ZZZ has made on-air mentions of VGQ during motorsport segments.\nVGQ has also been listed in event calendars for Benaraby Dragway and promoted through Ironbark Raceway’s public Facebook page.\nYouTube channels including Gasser TV and muscle_cars have also showcased VGQ vehicles and events.\nSignificance\nVintage gasser drag racing declined worldwide in the early 1980s but has experienced renewed interest in the 2020s. VGQ plays a role in revitalising the class by supporting builders, drivers, and enthusiasts who recreate traditional drag racing practices. The group contributes to preserving the cultural and mechanical heritage of classic gasser drag racing and has helped position Queensland and Australian gasser drag racing within the global nostalgia drag racing movement.\nReferences\n:Category:Drag racing organizations\n:Category:Motorsport in Queensland\n:Category:Automotive culture in Australia"
