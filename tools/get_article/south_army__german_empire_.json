It was formed on 11 January 1915 to fight against Russia and served exclusively on the Eastern Front. It was dissolved on 25 January 1918.\nHistory\nThe South Army was formed in Breslau, on 11 January 1915, by the transformation of II Corps for the Hungarian Carpathian Front.

In his place, General der Infanterie Felix Graf von Bothmer of II Bavarian Reserve Corps took command of the South Army. With the Russians withdrawing from the war (Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and the run down of German forces on the Eastern Front, the army was dissolved on 25 January 1918.\nThe headquarters of the army was located in Mukachevo (from 11 January 1915), Stryi (from 5 June 1915), Berezhany (from 4 September 1915), Khodoriv (from 15 November 1916) and Chortkiv (from 4 August 1917).\nCommanders\nThe South Army had the following commanders during its existence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+8th Army\n!
