The Crusaders were badly defeated by the Turks, who captured and executed the Count of Tripoli.\nHistory\nOn March 1137, the Burid military commander, Bazawash, launched a raid against the County of Tripoli. Bazawahs led the Damascene troops that raided as far as the Citadel of Tripoli. This was the farthest place a Muslim army reached since its capture by the Crusaders. The local Christians held no loyalty to the Frankish lords and secretly guided the Turks into the passes of Lebanon to the coastal plains. The ruler of Tripoli, Pons initially took refuge behind the walls of Tripoli, hoping this was a mere raid by the Turks. After seeing the Turks advancing into Tripoli itself, he launched a sally with his army against them.\nThe Crusade army was already in desperation and weakness. The following battle ended disastrously for the Crusaders. Few of the nobility fell, but a large number of infantry were killed. Pons managed to escape from the battlefield and hide in the mountains; however, he was captured by local Christians, who handed him over to Bazawash, who ordered his execution, and so he did. Among the captured was the bishop of Tripoli, Gerald. He was released in the end, as the Turks failed to recognize it was the bishop himself since he was wearing military garb. The Turks did not dare to attack Tripoli and retreated with their loot to Damascus.\nThe battle seriously weakened the County of Tripoli, which lost many men and had its lands devastated. The successor of Pons, Raymond II, took reprisals against the traitors, who were taken to Tripoli and executed.\nReferences\nSources\n*Kevin James Lewis (2017), The Counts of Tripoli and Lebanon in the Twelfth Century, Sons of Saint-Gilles.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/The_Counts_of_Tripoli_and_Lebanon_in_the/dQu9DgAAQBAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Pons+captured+1137&pg=PT136&printsec=frontcover]\n*Steven Runciman (1987), A History of the Crusades, Vol II.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/A_History_of_the_Crusades/QL88AAAAIAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Pons+captured+1137&pg=PA203&printsec=frontcover]\n*Jean Richard (1999), The Crusades, C.1071-c.1291.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/The_Crusades_C_1071_c_1291/a0LO9u6xKvcC?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Pons+captured+1137&pg=PA148&printsec=frontcover]"
