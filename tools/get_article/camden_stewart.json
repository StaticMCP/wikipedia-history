      "text": "# Camden Stewart\n\nCamden Stewart (born 2004) is a British composer, pianist, and operatic tenor. His music combines piano and operatic voice, drawing on contemporary classical influences. He first came to public attention through videos of his performances shared on social media.\nEarly life and education\nStewart grew up in London and sang for about ten years with the Libera boys' choir before studying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. During this time, he took private piano lessons while training as a boy soprano, later developing an interest in composition and performance. He was later appointed a Young Ambassador of the Lang Lang International Music Foundation, supporting its mission to encourage musical education and creativity among young people.\nCareer\nStewart's first public performance took place at a piano in London's St Pancras railway station while he was preparing for his Grade 8 piano examination, after being encouraged by his mother to perform in public. He has said that his first piece there was ''Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp minor, and that regular performances helped him gain confidence. He went on to share videos of his performances online, where his posts on TikTok and other social media platforms garnered him an initial audience.\nHis performances, which combine classical piano improvisation with operatic singing, have been described by Classic FM'' as \"blending contemporary classical piano with licks of operatic vocal\". Stewart has spoken about his interest in using public performance to make classical music more accessible, saying that \"public spaces erode the barrier between the performer and the listener\". He has also expressed the view that classical music \"is for all\", encouraging younger musicians to experiment with the genre and to \"blend the traditional with the contemporary\".\nIn March 2025, several media outlets reported on a viral video showing Stewart being verbally accosted while performing at a public piano. The video was widely shared and prompted public discussion about classical performance in public spaces.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://camdenstewart.com/ Official website]\n*"
