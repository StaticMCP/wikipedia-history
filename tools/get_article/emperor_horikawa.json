He was also known as Yoshihito-tennō.\nHorikawa was the son of Emperor Shirakawa.  His mother was Fujiwara no Kenshi (藤原賢子), adopted daughter of Fujiwara Morozane (藤原師実). His wet nurse was a different namesake Fujiwara no Kenshi (藤原兼子).\nEmpresses, consorts, and issue\n*Empress (Chūgū): Imperial Princess Tokushi (篤子内親王), Emperor Go-Sanjo’s daughter\n*Consort (Nyōgo): Fujiwara no Ishi (藤原苡子; 1076-1103), Fujiwara no Sanesue’s daughter\n** Imperial Prince Munehito (宗仁親王) later Emperor Toba\n*Lady-in-waiting (Naishi): Princess Jinshi (仁子女王; d.1126), Prince Yasusuke’s daughter\n** Imperial Princess Soshi (悰子内親王, 1099–1162)\n*Lady-in-waiting (Naishi): Fujiwara Muneko (藤原宗子; d.1129), Fujiwara Takamune’s daughter\n** Kangyō (寛暁; 1103–1159)\n*Lady-in-waiting (Naishi): Fujiwara Tokitsune’s daughter\n** Imperial Prince Priest Saiun (最雲法親王; 1105–1162) head priest of the Tendai sect\n* Mother Unknown\n** Imperial Princess Kishi (喜子内親王)\n** Imperial Princess Kaishi (懐子内親王)\nRule\nAfter becoming crown prince, he acceded to the throne upon the abdication of his father Emperor Shirakawa on January 3, 1087 (Ōtoku 3). His father's kampaku Fujiwara Morozane became regent, and Horikawa's reign was overshadowed by the cloistered rule of his father. Horikawa filled his reign with scholarship, poetry, and music.\nWhen Horikawa's empress-consort Fujiwara no Ishi (藤原苡子) died in 1103, his son the Imperial Prince Munehito was taken to be raised by the retired Emperor Shirakawa. This son later succeeded Horikawa to the throne and was later known as Emperor Toba.\nHorikawa died at the age of 28 on August 9, 1107 (Kajō 2). He is among the seven emperors entombed near Ryōan-ji in Kyoto. He is traditionally venerated at the Nochi no Yenkyō-ji no misasagi  memorial Shinto shrine;  this site has been designated as Horikawa's mausoleum by the Imperial Household Agency.\nEras\nThe years of Horikawa's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Ōtoku (1084–1087)\n* Kanji (1087–1094)\n* Kahō (1094–1096)\n* Eichō (1096–1097)\n* Jōtoku (1097–1099)\n* Kōwa (1099–1104)\n* Chōji (1104–1106)\n* Kajō (1106–1108)\nKugyō\nDuring Horikawa's reign, the high-ranking kugyō of the imperial court included:\n* Sesshō/Daijō-daijin Fujiwara Morozane (1043–1101)\n* Kampaku/Nidaijin Fujiwara Moromichi (1062–1099)\n* Kampaku/Udaijin/Dainagon Fujiwara Tadazane\nAncestry\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Brown, Delmer M. and Ichirō Ishida, eds.
