He was baptised in Leicester on 15 September 1775.\nHe received a classical education. He shared his father's practical abilities and trained as a printer, being apprenticed to John Nichols. However shortly following the completion of his apprenticeship the opportunity for him to take up a post with the Sierra Leone Company (SLC) arose, and he moved to their colony in Africa.\nHaving previously served on the Council of the SLC, he subsequently rose to become governor, fulfilling the role three times: May 1799 – 1800, 28 August 1803 – January 1805 and 1806 – 27 July 1808.\nOn 19 November 1807, Ludlam arrested the American slave ship Triton, enacting the newly established Slave Trade Act 1807.\nHe died on board  on 25 July 1810.\nReferences\nPlatts, Charles,  2004, \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-17160 Ludlam, William (bap. 1717, d. 1788), mathematician and writer on theology]\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.
