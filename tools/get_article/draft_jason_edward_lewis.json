He is Professor of Computation Arts at Concordia University, where he founded the Obx Laboratory for Experimental Media and co-directs the Indigenous Futures Research Centre, both of which focus on the intersection of Indigenous knowledge and digital media.\nLewis completed undergraduate degrees in Symbolic Systems (B.Sc.) and German Studies (B.A.) at Stanford University and earned a Master of Philosophy in Design from the Royal College of Art.\nCareer and research\nLewis develops scholarly and artistic projects that draw on digital media and Indigenous cultural principles. He is a lead researcher on the multi-year Abundant Intelligences program, which reframes artificial intelligence through Indigenous knowledge systems.\nIndependent media describe the project as “making space for Indigenous AI,” highlighting Lewis’s leadership and vision for ethical, culturally grounded AI.\nEarlier, Lewis co-organized the Indigenous Protocol and AI workshops and contributed to its widely cited position paper on ethical AI development. He also established Obx Labs and co-founded Aboriginal Territories in Cyberspace (AbTeC), collaborative initiatives that combine art, storytelling, and software design to support Indigenous community-building in digital environments.\nLewis’s creative works—ranging from poetic mobile applications to immersive installations—have been showcased at major international venues such as Ars Electronica, ISEA, Elektra, SIGGRAPH, and the Hawaiian International Film Festival.\nRecognition\nLewis’s contributions have earned wide scholarly and critical recognition. He received the inaugural Robert Coover Award for Best Work of Electronic Literature, two Honorable Mentions from Prix Ars Electronica, and multiple awards from ImagineNative Film and Media Arts Festival.\nHe is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and has held fellowships with the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and the MIT Open Documentary Lab.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://jasonlewis.org/ Official website]\n* [https://www.obxlabs.net/ Obx Laboratory for Experimental Media]\n* [https://www.ifrc.ca/ Indigenous Futures Research Centre]"
