It agreed with anti-Jackson beliefs, in support of the Whig Party.\nDescription\nThe cartoon depicts the 7th United States president, Andrew Jackson, as a monarch, standing before a throne in a reminiscent of a playing-card king. He is holding a paper with veto written on it in his left hand and a scepter in his right. The Constitution and the arms of Pennsylvania (the United States Bank was located in Philadelphia) lie in tatters under his feet. A book labeled \"Judiciary of the United States\" is nearby. Around the border of the picture there are the words \"Born to Command\", \"Of Veto Memory\", and \"Had I Been Consulted\".\nPurpose\nKing Andrew the First was first shown in 1832 in the Library of Congress and was a response to Jackson's veto against the United States national bank deposits in September. No one knows who the artist exactly was. He is depicted as a monarch because opposers often viewed Jackson as an abuser of his presidential powers; not obeying the laws.\nHistorical usage\nDuring the 1832 presidential election, \"King Andrew the First\" was used to support presidential campaigns opposing Jackson. The drawing asks the popular question \"Shall he reign over us, or shall the people rule?\", that supported the anti-Jackson Whig Party.\nSee also\n* Amphitheatrum Johnsonianum\nReferences"
