It was a steel base containing a glass monolith with motifs of mountains and prairies.  For the 10th anniversary of the awards in 2007 she redesigned it replacing the steel base with powder coated aluminum and increased the contrast in the tone and texture of the awards metal and glass.\nThe Award received its most recent design update in 2014 when the Overes design was replaced with a multi-colour teardrop-shaped glass sculpture created by a local glass blowing collective, Bee Kingdom Glass. Each one is unique, as they are hand-blown.\nSee also\n* Black Theatre Workshop\n* Dora Mavor Moore Award\n* Elizabeth Sterling Haynes Award\n* Floyd S.
