A recipient of the award, a National Living Treasure or Manlilikha ng Bayan  is \"a Filipino citizen or group of Filipino citizens engaged in any traditional art uniquely Filipino, whose distinctive skills have reached such a high level of technical and artistic excellence and have been passed on to and widely practiced by the present generations in their community with the same degree of technical and artistic competence.\"\nHistory\nIn 1988, the National Folk Artists Award was organized by the Rotary Club of Makati-Ayala. The distinctions were given by the organization until it was replaced by the GAMABA Law in 1992. The recipients of the National Folk Artists from 1988–1992 are not recognized by the government as the award was given by a private organization.\nThe National Living Treasures Award (Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan) was institutionalized in 1992 through Republic Act No. 7355. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts, which is the highest policy-making and coordinating body of the Philippines for culture and the arts, was tasked with the implementation and awarding. This is in line with UNESCO's criteria of Living National Treasures.\nCriteria\nTo become a National Living Treasure, the candidate must possess the following qualifications:\n#is an inhabitant of an indigenous/traditional cultural community anywhere in the Philippines that has preserved indigenous customs, beliefs, rituals and traditions and/or has syncretized whatever external elements that have influenced it.\n#must have engaged in a folk art tradition that has been in existence and documented for at least 50 years.\n#must have consistently performed or produced over a significant period, works of superior and distinctive quality.\n#must possess a mastery of tools and materials needed by the art, and must have an established reputation in the art as master and maker of works of extraordinary technical quality.\n#must have passed on and/or will pass on to other members of the community their skills in the folk art for which the community is traditionally known.\nA traditional artist who possesses all the qualities of a Manlilikha ng Bayan candidate, but due to age or infirmity has left them incapable of teaching further their craft, may still be recognized if:\n#had created a significant body of works and/or has consistently displayed excellence in the practice of their art, thus achieving important contributions for its development.\n#has been instrumental in the revitalization of their community's artistic tradition.\n#has passed on to the other members of the community skills in the folk art for which the community is traditionally known.\n#community has recognized them as master and teacher of their craft.\nAwards and Incentives\nThe Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan recipients, as exemplified in Republic Act No. 7355 shall receive a plaque or medal bearing the logo of the award. A duplicate of this is to be donated to and permanently displayed in the pertinent provincial museum or largest cultural center.\nAn initial grant of One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000.00) and Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) a month thereafter for life.\nCategories\nThe categories are, but not limited to, the following categories of traditional folk arts:\n* ethnomedicine\n* folk architecture\n* maritime transport\n* weaving\n* carving\n* performing arts\n* literature\n* graphic and plastic arts\n* ornament\n* textile or fiber arts\n* pottery.\n* architecture\nOther artistic expressions of traditional culture may be added, such as the case of the ethnomedicine category, which was added only in 2020.\nRecipients\nAs defined by UNESCO, the bearers of intangible cultural heritage are to be known internationally as Living Human Treasures. The Filipino counterparts of this title are the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA) awardees.\nThere are currently twenty-five declared GAMABA awardees, all of which have exemplified the highest standard in their respective field of expertise.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Image\n!Name\n!Category / declaration\n!Ethnic group / community\n!Native of\n!Proclamation\n!Year of
