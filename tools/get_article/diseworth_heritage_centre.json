The centre is housed in a redundant Baptist chapel building, which was restored by the Diseworth Heritage Trust with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and other supporters. The chapel is a Grade II listed building. In 2022 the centre recorded a total of 20 visitors, making it the least-visited tourist attraction in England.\nHistory\nThe Diseworth Local History Society suggests a date for the establishment of the chapel of 1752, but Historic England's listing record indicates a date of 1773 is more probable. The chapel continued as a place of worship in the Baptist tradition until 2000, but was subject to regular flooding which finally led to its closure. It was then purchased by local enthusiasts and re-opened as a heritage centre in 2009.\nIn 2022 the centre recorded a total of 20 visitors, making it the least-visited tourist attraction in England.}}\nArchitecture and description\nThe chapel was constructed of brick, with a slate roof. It was expanded in 1824 to provide a two-storey school room. The interior is simple, with furnishings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The chapel is a Grade II listed building.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.diseworthcentre.org Diseworth Heritage Centre]\n*"
