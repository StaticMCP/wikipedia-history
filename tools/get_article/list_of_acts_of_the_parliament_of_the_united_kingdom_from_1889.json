For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n52 & 53 Vict.\nThe fourth session of the 24th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 21 February 1889 until 30 August 1889.\nPublic general acts\n|\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  and the Acts amending the same.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and the Passengers Act Amendment Act, 1863.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the '''Children's Charter|public|44|26-08-1889|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for the Prevention of Cruelty to, and better Protection of, Children.}}\n|\n|  and the Acts amending the same.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  as respects Light Gold Coins.}}\n|  with regard to Leaseholders.}}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n| or Balfour's Act|public|66|30-08-1889|archived=n|An Act to facilitate the Construction of Light Railways in Ireland.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nand the Acts amending the same relating to the Tramore River Drainage District, county Cork.|po1=Tramore River Drainage (Cork) Order 1889|}}\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  to enable the School Boards for Acton, Chiswick, and Liverpool to put in force the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, and the Acts amending the same.|po1=Acton Order 1889|\n|po2=Chiswick Order 1889|\n|po3=Liverpool Order 1889|}}\n|  and 1837; and to make further provisions in relation to the Laws and Regulations and to the Capital of the Society; and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to Boscombe, Clacton-on-Sea, Keppel, Port Ness, Woodda, and Wexford.|po1=Boscombe Pier Order 1889|\n|po2=Clacton-on-Sea Pier Order 1889|\n|po3=Keppel Pier Order 1889|\n|po4=Port Ness Harbour Order 1889|\n|po5=Woodda Bay Pier Order 1889|\n|po6=Wexford Harbour Order 1889|}}\n|\n|  relating to lands in the Parishes of St. Giles, Camberwell, St. Marylebone, and St. John, Wapping.|note4=|po1=Provisional Order made by the Secretary of State under the Metropolitan Police Act, 1886.|po1short=n}}\n|\n|  relating to Goole Fields Improvements, situate in the Township of Goole, in the Parish of Snaith, in the county of York.|po1=Goole Order 1889|}}\n|  relating to Cork, Devonport, Dover, Milford-on-Sea, and Worthing.|po1=Cork Harbour Order 1889|\n|po2=Devonport Landing Pier and Breakwater Order 1889|\n|po3=Dover Promenade Pier Order 1889|\n|po4=Milford-on-Sea (Hants.)
