On 4 July 1962, the RC established the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), the country's only legal political party which Donald M. Seekins claims was modelled along the lines of a Marxist–Leninist revolutionary party. From 1962 to 1971, BSPP transitioned from a cadre party (consisting of elite RC affiliated members) into a mass party. In the First Congress, the party had 344,226 members. By 1981, BSPP had 1.5 million members.\nLeadership\nThe Revolutionary Council was led by Ne Win, its chairman and 16 senior officers.\nThe founding members of the First Revolutionary Council, all of whom were military officers, are:\n#General Ne Win BC-3502 (Chief of General Staff)\n#Brigadier General Aung Gyi BC-5458 (Vice-Chief of General Staff) (Army)\n#Commodore Than Pe (died 1962) (Vice-Chief of General Staff) (Navy)\n#Brigadier General Thomas 'Tommy' Cliff (Vice-Chief of General Staff) (Air Force) (resigned 1964)\n#Brigadier General Tin Pe (resigned 1970) BC-3508 (Quartermaster General)\n#Colonel Than Sein BC-3574 (Colonel-General Staff)\n#Colonel Kyaw Soe (retired 1974) BC-3526 (Military Appointment General)\n#Colonel Chit Myaing (dismissed 1964) BC-3520 (Vice-Quartermaster General)\n#Colonel Khin Nyo (dismissed 1965) BC-3537 (Director General of Directorate of Military Training)\n#Colonel Hla Han (Director General of Directorate of Medical Services)\n#Brigadier General San Yu BC-3569 (Commander of Northern Military Command)\n#Brigadier General Sein Win BC-3525 (Commander of Central Military Command)\n#Colonel Thaung Kyi BC-3523 (Commander of Southeast Military Command)\n#Colonel Kyi Maung (sacked 1963) BC-3516 (Commander of Southwest Military Command)\n#Colonel Maung Shwe (resigned 1972) BC-3575 (Commander of Eastern Military Command)\n#Colonel Saw Myint (sacked 1964) BC-3518 (Administrator of Border Regions)\n#Colonel Tan Yu Sai (resigned 1968) BC-5090 (Vice-Commissioner of General of People's Police)\nRevolutionary Government\nThe government formed by the Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma was named Revolutionary Government of the Union of Burma () or simply Revolutionary Government ().\nAs wiping out the monarchist terms, a Ministry was called as a Department () and a Minister was called as a Person in-charge of Department () during the time of the Revolutionary Government.\nThe terms Ministry and Minister were restored when the Council of Ministers was formed on 8 May 1974.\nCouncil member terms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma\n|-\n!cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\" | Name and Rank ||! cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\" | Military Position || ! cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\" | RC Position || ! cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center\" | Date\n|-\n| General Ne Win BC 3502 || Chief of Staff of Armed Forces || Chairman || 2 March 1962 to 1 March 1974\n|-\n| Brigadier General Aung Gyi BC 5458 || Vice Chief of Staff (Army) || Member || 2 March 1962 to 7 February 1963\n|-\n| Brigadier General Than Phay || Vice Chief of Staff (Navy) || Member || 2 March 1962 to 22 May 1962\n|-\n| Brigadier General Tin Phay BC 3508|| Chairman of Forestry || Member || 2 March 1962 to 14 November 1970\n|-\n| Brigadier General Tommy Clift || Vice Chief of Staff (Air) || Member || 2 March 1962 to 2 November 1964\n|-\n| Brigadier General San Yu BC 3569 || North Western Regional Military Command || Member || 2 March 1962 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Brigadier General Sein Win BC 3525|| Central Regional Military Command || Member || 2 March 1962 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Colonel Kyi Maung BC 3516|| South Western Regional Military Command || Member || 2 March 1962 to 12 March 1963\n|-\n| Colonel Maung Shwe BC 3575|| Eastern Regional Military Command || Member || 2 March 1962 to 22 September 1972\n|-\n| Colonel Thaung Kyi BC 3523|| South Eastern Regional Military Command || Member || 2 March 1962 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Colonel Than Sein BC 3574|| Colonel General Staff || Member || 2 March 1962 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Colonel Kyaw Soe BC 3526|| Military Appointment Secretary || Member || 2 March 1962 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Colonel Saw Myint BC 3518|| Director – Border Troops || Member || 2 March 1962 to 17 August 1964\n|-\n| Colonel Chit Myaing BC 3520|| || Member || 2 March 1962 to 31 March 1964\n|-\n| Colonel Khin Nyo BC 3537|| Director – Military Training || Member || 2 March 1962 to 9 June 1965\n|-\n| Colonel Tan Yu Saing BC 5090|| || Member || 2 March 1962 to 6 October 1970\n|-\n| Colonel Lun Tin BC 3610|| Commander – No. 7 Infantry Brigade || Member || 5 July 1962 to 9 July 1971\n|-\n| Colonel Maung Lwin || || Member || 12 September 1964 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Colonel Tin Oo BC 3651 || South Western Regional Command || Member || 12 September 1964 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| U Ba Nyein || || Member || 9 July 1971 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Dr. Maung Maung || || Member || 9 July 1971 to 2 March 1974\n|-\n| Mahn Thar Myaing || || Member || 9 July 1971 to 2 March 1974\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
