It is hosted by Anita Anand and William Dalrymple. The series is produced by Goalhanger Podcasts.\nBackground\nIn 2022, Anita Anand collaborated with historian William Dalrymple to create the podcast Empire, which examines the British East India Company, British Empire, and British involvement and influence on India. The pair had previously worked together on the book ''Koh-i-Noor: The History of the World's Most Infamous Diamond.\nLater seasons of Empire dealt with the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire.\nReception\nRahul Dravid, the coach of the Indian national cricket team, is a fan of the podcast and has made the team listen to it as well. The Times said the podcast had an \"unbeatable formula\" and the \"best podcast on the British Empire\". The Australian described the podcast as \"ambitious\". Arifa Noor on the Dawn wrote \"Empire is more of a meandering, leisurely walk through a historical period, with detours and gentle rests and a pace which can be brisk or slow''\".\nReferences"
