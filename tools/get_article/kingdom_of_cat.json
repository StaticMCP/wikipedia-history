It was centered in what is now Caithness in northern Scotland. It was, according to Pictish legend, founded by Caitt (or Cat), one of the seven sons of the ancestor figure Cruithne. The territory of Cait covered not only modern Caithness, but also southeast Sutherland.\nThe place name Caithness derives from Cait, which is also preserved in the Gaelic name for Sutherland (), in several specific names within that county and in the earliest recorded name for Shetland (, meaning \"islands of the Cat people\").\nWilliam J. Watson compared this usage with the early Irish  (islands of the boars) for Orkney and concluded that these are tribal names based on animals.\nHistory\nDuring the 6th century, the Gaels from Ireland began to assert dominance over the Picts. By the mid-500s, the Gaels had taken control of Caithness and established the kingdom of Dál Riata, which stretched from Caithness to the Isle of Man. Dál Riata played a significant role in the development of Scottish culture.\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, Norse influence became prominent in Caithness. Norse raiders and settlers established a significant presence along the coast, leading to Caithness becoming part of the Norse Earldom of Orkney. The earls, often from the powerful Orkneyinga dynasty, and exerted control over the region during this period.\nSee also\n*Fortriu\n*Kingdom of Ce\n*Scotland in the Early Middle Ages\nReferences"
