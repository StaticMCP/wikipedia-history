A dedication ceremony took place in August 1966.\nWarren Municipal Airport covers an area of 167 acres (68 ha) at an elevation of 888 feet (271 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 12/30 is 3,199 by 75 feet (975 x 23 m) with an asphalt surface and 4/22 is 2,578 by 200 feet (786 x 61 m) with a turf surface.\nFor the 12-month period ending August 25, 2010, the airport had 19,000 general aviation aircraft operations, an average of 52 per day. At that time there were six aircraft based at this airport, all single-engine.  General aviation traffic is from agricultural aircraft during the summer growing season, and from training activity from the University of North Dakota.\nSee also\n*List of airports in Minnesota\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dot.state.mn.us/aero/avoffice/ops/airdir/pdf/warren.pdf Warren Municipal Airport (D37)]  at Minnesota DOT Airport Directory\n* [http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=1&s=11&lat=48.1912&lon=-96.7113&w=500&h=500&lp=---+None+--- Aerial image as of April 1991] from USGS The National Map\n*\n*"
