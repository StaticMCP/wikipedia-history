      "text": "# List of smoking bans in the United States\n\n*Many localities impose stricter rules than state law*Map only reflects bans in indoor spaces\n}}\nSmoking bans are public policies, including criminal laws and occupational safety and health regulations, that prohibit tobacco smoking in certain spaces. The United States Congress has not attempted to enact any type of nationwide federal smoking ban in workplaces and public places. Therefore, such policies are entirely a product of state and local laws.\nUtah was the first state to enact a comprehensive statewide ban on smoking in public places, with the state Legislature passing the Utah Indoor Clean Air Act in 1994. Similarly, California enacted a statewide smoking ban for restaurants that went into effect in 1995. Throughout the early to mid-2000s, especially between 2004 and 2007, an increasing number of states enacted a statewide smoking ban of some kind. As of 2018, the most recent statewide smoking ban is Alaska's, which was signed into law on July 18 and went into effect on October 1.\nAs further detailed in this list, smoking laws vary widely throughout the United States. Some places in the United States do not generally regulate smoking at all, some ban smoking in certain areas and not others, and some ban smoking nearly everywhere, even in outdoor areas (no state bans smoking in all public outdoor areas, but some local jurisdictions do). As of October 1, 2021, according to the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, 82.1% of the U.S. population lives under a ban on smoking in \"workplaces, and/or restaurants, and/or bars, by either a state, commonwealth, or local law\", and 62.3% live under a ban covering all workplaces, restaurants, and bars. A smoking ban (either state or local) has been enacted covering all bars and restaurants in each of the 60 most populated cities in the United States except these ten: Henderson, Jacksonville, Las Vegas, Memphis (no smoking in restaurants, government buildings and most indoor public places), Miami, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Tampa, Tulsa, and Virginia Beach.\nOverview\nStatewide bans on smoking in all enclosed public places\nAs of July 2018, 29 states have enacted statewide bans on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including all bars and restaurants: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Ten other states have enacted statewide smoking bans but have carved out an exception for certain establishments and workplaces: Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.\nHowever, these states exempt a variety of places from their respective smoking bans. All except seven (California, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Washington) exempt tobacconists. All except six (Alaska, Michigan, Indiana, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin) allow hotels and motels to designate a certain percentage of smoking rooms. Many also exempt or do not cover casinos (10), private clubs (8), cigar bars (14), or certain small workplaces (8). The following is a table of common exemptions from these 28 states' smoking bans:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! States that exempt tobacconists\n! States that exempt cigar bars\n! States that exempt private clubs\n! States that exempt casinos\n! States that exempt small workplaces\n|-\n| AK, AZ, CA, CO, CT, HI, KS, IL, IA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OH, OR, RI, SC, SD, TN, WI\n| AK, CA, CO, CT, MA, MI, NE, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, SD, TN, WI\n| AK, AZ, CT, IA, KS, MA, NY, OH, TN\n| CT, IA, KS, ME, TN (OTB parlors, beano and bingo halls), MI, MN, NJ (including OTB parlors), NV, NM, RI (including OTB parlors), WI\n| CO & TN (three or fewer employees), ID (five or fewer employees), ND (one employee), NM (one employee), OH (family owned and operated), UT (one employee), VT (one employee)\n|}\nIn Connecticut, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin, the state law preempts local governments from enacting stricter smoking bans than the state, though some cities and counties in some of those states have enacted local versions of the state's smoking ban. In the other 23 states with a statewide general smoking ban, some cities and counties have enacted stricter local smoking bans to varying degrees. In California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont, usage of e-cigarettes is prohibited indoors. The strictest smoking ban in the United States is in Calabasas, California, where smoking anywhere a non-smoker could congregate, including public sidewalks and apartment complexes, is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of at least $250.\nStatewide smoking bans exempting adult-only venues\nAs of July 2017, five states ban smoking in most enclosed public places, but permit adult venues such as bars (and casinos, if applicable) to allow smoking if they choose: Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, and Nevada. In Florida, state law preempts local governments from enacting stricter smoking bans than the state, though in Idaho, Indiana, and Louisiana, some cities and counties have enacted stricter local smoking bans to varying degrees, in some cases banning it in all enclosed workplaces. See individual state listings below for details.\nUnique statewide smoking bans\nAs of July 2018, four states have enacted smoking bans in particular places that do not fit in the other categories:\n*Alaska bans smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants, but allows smoking in private clubs that were in existence prior to January 1, 2017, and allows for certain localities such as villages to opt out of the law; local governments in Alaska can regulate smoking more strictly than the state.\n*Nevada generally bans smoking in all public places and places of employment, but exempts bars, casinos, strip clubs, brothels, and retail tobacco stores, and restaurants that do not allow patrons under 21 years of age. In all other restaurants, smoking is relegated to separately ventilated designated smoking areas. Local governments in Nevada may regulate smoking more strictly than the state.\n*New Hampshire bans smoking in restaurants and some bars (those besides cigar bars and private clubs), schools, and certain common areas open to the public, but not anywhere else, and state law prohibits local governments from enacting local smoking bans.\n*North Carolina bans smoking in all restaurants and bars (excluding cigar bars and private clubs), as well as government buildings and vehicles, but does not regulate smoking anywhere else. Local governments may regulate smoking more strictly than the state, except in cigar bars, private clubs, tobacco shops, private residences/vehicles, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, and theatrical performances involving smoking.\nUnique municipal smoking bans\nIn 2024, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld a 2020 bylaw passed by the town of Brookline, which enforces a lifetime ban on the sale of tobacco products to anyone born on or after January 1, 2000, the first of its kind in the United States.\nAs of November 2025, nineteen Massachusetts towns and cities, totaling over 586,000 people, have adopted Nicotine Free Generation regulations. These regulations prohibit the sale of nicotine products to people born after a specific date, such as those born after January 1, 2004. The communities include Brookline, Belchertown, Chelsea, Concord, Conway, Dover, Hopkinton, Malden, Manchester-by-the-Sea, Melrose, Needham, Newton, Pelham, Reading, Somerville, Stoneham, South Hadley, Wakefield, and Winchester.\nStates with no statewide smoking ban\nAs of July 2018, twelve states have not enacted any general statewide ban on smoking in workplaces, bars or restaurants: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Instead, laws in most of these states (see individual state listings below for further information) require proprietors of certain places to designate smoking and non-smoking areas and post warning signage.\nIn Oklahoma and Virginia, state laws prohibit local governments from regulating smoking more strictly than the state, making those states among the fewest in the nation without any legislated smoking bans. In the other ten states, cities and counties have enacted stricter smoking laws than the state, in some cases banning smoking in all enclosed workplaces. In Alabama and Mississippi, the state smoking law expressly allows all local governments to do so. In Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia, a court has ruled that certain local governments have the power to do so. See the individual state listings below for details.\nSmoking laws and non-states\nIn the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, including bars and restaurants. Guam prohibits smoking in restaurants, but the ban does not extend to workplaces or any other businesses. The Northern Mariana Islands prohibits smoking in most workplaces and restaurants, but not in bars.\nSmoking laws and the U.S. federal government\nbuilding]]\nAlthough Congress has not attempted to enact a nationwide federal smoking ban in workplaces, several federal regulations do concern indoor smoking. Effective April 1998, inflight smoking is banned by the United States Department of Transportation on all commercial passenger flights in the United States or by American air carriers. On August 9, 1997, President Bill Clinton issued , banning smoking in all interior spaces owned, rented, or leased by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, as well as in any outdoor areas under executive branch control near air intake ducts.\nOn 3 February 2017, a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rule instituting smoke-free public housing took effect. The rule requires that public housing agencies prohibit the use of lit tobacco products in all living units, indoor common areas, and administrative office buildings, as well as any outdoor area within 25 feet of such buildings. On 30 July 2018, the ruling was required to be fully implementation.\nLaws by state or territory\nAlabama\n*No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Alabama's 2003 statewide smoking law, the Alabama Clean Indoor Air Act, generally prohibits smoking in public places and public meetings unless a smoking area is designated that in certain places must be \"enclosed and well ventilated\". Warning signs must be posted appropriately. Bars, lounges, retail tobacco stores, limousines under private hire, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, and psychiatric facilities are entirely exempt from the Act's regulation. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals reiterated this in August 2009.\n*Localities in Alabama with smoking bans that include all bars and restaurants (36 total):\n**Albertville, November 12, 2010, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Anniston, July 1, 2013, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Atmore, November 13, 2008, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Auburn, November 15, 2006, banned in bars and restaurants, but not other workplaces\n**Bayou La Batre, August 31, 2007, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Birmingham, April 27, 2012, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants;

Local governments may regulate smoking more strictly than the state. A judge has ruled that a bar sharing common indoor space with a tobacco shop is also exempt from the ban.\nConnecticut\n*Statewide smoking ban: On October 1, 2003, the Clean Indoor Air Act went into effect, banning smoking statewide in bars and restaurants (bars, cafes, and bowling alleys were exempt until April 1, 2004).

the word \"bar\" is defined in the Act as also including taverns, night clubs, cocktail lounges, and casinos. The act exempts private residences not used as a daycare facility or healthcare facility, private motor vehicles, tobacco demonstrations in schools, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, and American Indian religious and cultural activities. Local governments are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act.\nNebraska\n* Statewide smoking ban: On June 1, 2009, the Nebraska Clean Indoor Air Act passed in February 2008 went into effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Nebraska, including all bars and restaurants.

The act passed by voters initially included all restaurants as well as bars that serve food. The Act permits smoking without limitation in areas within casinos where minors are already prohibited, stand-alone bars that do not serve food, strip clubs and brothels, retail tobacco stores, and private residences (including those that serve as an office workplace, unless used as a childcare, adult daycare, or healthcare facility). Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act, though no city or county in Nevada has chosen to do so. In 2009 Nevada partially repealed the ban to allow smoking in tobacco-related trade conventions. The ban was further amended in 2011 to allow smoking in taverns that serve alcohol and food as long as patrons under 21 are not allowed in. Smoking is also now allowed in designated areas of family restaurants if the smoking area is physically enclosed and separated from the non-smoking area and minors are prohibited inside.\nNew Hampshire\n*Statewide ban on smoking in bars, restaurants, and some other workplaces: On September 17, 2007, the Indoor Smoking Act went into effect, banning smoking in schools, child daycare facilities, grocery stores, elevators and public conveyances (except when rented for private purposes), restaurants, bars, and private clubs when open to the public. Private clubs and religious and fraternal organizations (including bars and restaurants inside these places), hotel and motel rooms, rented halls and rooms under control of the renter, college dormitory rooms, public housing, nursing homes, areas designated by hospitals, and alcohol/drug rehabilitation facilities are exempt from smoking regulation and can allow smoking indoors freely. All other places must designate smoking and nonsmoking areas and post appropriate signs. On January 1, 2010, House Bill 392 went into effect. It established an on-premises cigar, beverage, and liquor license and allowed for cigar smoking at public cigar bars. Towns only can regulate smoking more strictly with regard to fire safety and sanitation. In 2003, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled that this means state law preempts towns from enacting stricter local smoking bans for health reasons.\nNew Jersey\n*Statewide smoking ban: On April 15, 2006, the New Jersey Smoke-Free Air Act went into effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in New Jersey, including all bars and restaurants, strip clubs, hospitals, psychiatric facilities, as well as outside portions of school grounds. The Act exempts cigar bars, tobacco retail stores, tobacco manufacturing facilities, private residences and private automobiles, off-track betting parlors, and designated hotel/motel smoking rooms. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act. On January 16, 2019, smoking was outlawed on all public beaches and in state parks. Violating the Act can result in a fine of between $250 and $1,000, depending how many violations one has incurred within a year.\n*Atlantic City, banned on 75% of casino gaming floors.\n*Pequannock, banned in public parks with ball-fields or playgrounds in July 2011 through ordinance introduced by Mayor Rich Phelan.\nNew Mexico\n*Statewide smoking ban: On June 15, 2007, the Dee Johnson Clean Indoor Air Act went into effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in New Mexico, including all bars and restaurants, as well as within a \"reasonable distance\" of the entrances to those places.

The law exempts (1) private homes and automobiles, (2) hotel/motel rooms, (3) retail tobacco businesses, (4) private clubs, (5) cigar bars (A cigar bar that makes 10 percent of its gross income from the on-site sale of tobacco products and the rental of on-site humidors, not including vending machines sales are exempt from the ban), (6) outdoor areas of bars and restaurants, and (7) enclosed rooms in restaurants, bars, convention halls, etc., when hosting private functions organized for the promotion and sampling of tobacco products. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state law. Breaking the state law can result in a fine of between $200 and $2,000, depending how many violations one has had within a year.\n**Albany, On January 1, 2015, the following ordinance took effect. \"No person shall smoke within the City's parks, sport fields, swimming pools, or playgrounds. For purposes of this section, to 'smoke' means to burn a lighted cigar, cigarette, or pipe or to use any other substance which contains tobacco.\"\n**Great Neck, Adopted January 4, 2011, smoking was banned on sidewalks in front of commercial buildings, Village Green park, and the Housing Authority.\n**New York City, Effective May 23, 2011, smoking was banned in all parks, boardwalks, beaches, recreation centers, swimming pools and pedestrian plazas.

Shortly after, on July 24, 2003, the statewide smoking ban came into effect. New York City may suspend or revoke a business's license if it has been found guilty of violating this law three times within 12 months. In 2021, the New York State Clean Indoor Air Act was amended to include the prohibition of smoking and vaping cannabis in all locations where smoking and vaping tobacco products are prohibited.\nNorth Carolina\n*Statewide smoking ban in bars and restaurants: On January 2, 2010, after being signed into law by Governor Bev Perdue on May 19, 2009, North Carolina Session Law 2009-27 went into effect, banning smoking statewide in all bars and restaurants in North Carolina, as well as in government buildings and vehicles. The law exempts cigar bars, private clubs that are not-for-profit (including country clubs), designated hotel/motel smoking areas, offices, retail stores not subjected to state sanitation codes, and medical research facilities studying tobacco. The law generally allows local governments to regulate smoking more strictly beginning July 5, 2009 (as long as it is approved by the county, too), but preempts local governments from regulating smoking in cigar bars, retail tobacco shops, tobacco manufacturer facilities, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, private clubs (including country clubs), theatrical productions involving smoking, private residences, or private vehicles.\n*Other local smoking regulations in North Carolina:\n**North Carolina Department of Correction, January 2006, banned in all state prisons.\n**Orange County, January 1, 2012, banned on all sidewalks owned, operated, or maintained by the municipalities incorporated within the county.\n**UNC Hospitals, August 2007, banned on all hospital grounds.\n**Waynesville, May 23, 2015, banned on sidewalks, public parks, parking lots, greenways, city vehicles and the area in and surrounding town buildings\n**Durham County, January 1, 2016, ban on smoking, including the use of e-cigarettes in public outdoor spaces.\n***Includes Parks, Trails, Public Sidewalks, Bus stops, Public areas of retail establishments, and childcare facilities.\n**Duke University Health System, July 2007, banned on all hospital grounds.\n***As of July 1, 2020, smoke free policy expanded to include the use of all tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, hookah, e-cigarettes (vapes), chewing tobacco, snuff, snus, and IQOS.\n***This includes all employees, faculty, patients, visitors, volunteers, students, and vendors on any Duke owned or leased properties.\n**Duke University, July 1, 2020, ban on all tobacco products on campus, including in University residence halls.

The ban exempts only (1) private residences except when operating as a childcare or adult day care facility, (2) outdoor areas except within 20 feet of the entrance to a public place or place of employment, (3) businesses not open to the public with no employees besides the owner, and (4) American Indian religious and cultural rituals. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state. As noted above, North Dakota is one of only six states that ban smoking in tobacco stores and is one of only four that prohibit hotels and motels from designating a certain percentage of rooms for smoking.\nNorthern Mariana Islands\n*Partial territory-wide smoking ban. Since September 29, 2009, smoking has been banned for most workplaces and restaurants, but not bars.\nOhio\n*Statewide smoking ban: On December 7, 2006, after passage by Ohio voters on November 7, 2006, Chapter 3794 (titled \"Smoking Ban\") of the Ohio Revised Code went into effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Ohio, including bars and restaurants. The law exempts (1) private residences except when being used as a business when employees other than the owner are present, (2) designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, (3) family-owned and operated businesses not open to the public where all employees are related to the owner, (4) designated smoking areas in nursing homes, (5) retail tobacco stores, (6) outdoor patios, (7) private clubs with no employees.

Smoking areas may be designated at the mayor's discretion.\n* Oberlin, June 2010, banned smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco in city parks.\nOklahoma\n*No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Oklahoma's statewide smoking law prohibits smoking in any indoor workplaces&nbsp;– including restaurants and hotels&nbsp;– unless a separate ventilation system under negative pressure is installed for ventilating the smoking area, but permits smoking without limitation in bars, private clubs, bingo halls, retail tobacco stores, small family-owned workplaces, workplaces occupied exclusively by smokers, veterans' halls, and designated employee smoking areas. The Oklahoma law expressly preempts local governments from enacting any local smoking regulations that are not exactly the same as the state law.\nOregon\n*Statewide smoking ban: Effective January 1, 2009, after being signed into law on June 26, 2007, the 1981 Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act (as previously amended in 2001) was amended to ban smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Oregon, including bars and restaurants, as well as within  of the entrances, exits, open windows, or intake vents of such places. The Act exempts (1) private residences except when serving as a childcare or adult care facility, (2) designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, (3) spaces designated for traditional American Indian religious and cultural ceremonies, (4) retail tobacco shops, and (5) cigar bars. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act; and the Oregon Court of Appeals reiterated this in 2000. Effective January 1, 2014, smoking is banned in vehicles with passengers under 18 inside.\nPennsylvania\n* Statewide smoking ban excluding some bars. Effective September 11, 2008, after being signed into law by Governor Ed Rendell on June 13, 2008, Pennsylvania's 1988 Clean Indoor Air Act was amended to ban smoking statewide in all restaurants and other enclosed workplaces in Pennsylvania, except as exempted. The Act exempts (1) eating/drinking establishments where 20% or less of sales come from food AND persons under 18 are not allowed, (2) private homes and vehicles, except those used as a child daycare or adult care facility, (3) designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, (4) full service truck stops, (5) retail tobacco shops, (6) workplaces of tobacco manufacturers and wholesalers, (7) nursing homes, (8) designated smoking areas in day treatment facilities, psychiatric facilities, and healthcare facilities, (9) private clubs when public events are not being held, including volunteer fire, ambulance, and rescue stations, (10) tobacco-related fundraisers, (11) places rented for tobacco exhibitions, (12) cigar bars, (13) 25% of a casino gaming floor, and (14) outdoor areas. Local governments except Philadelphia are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act. However, exempt drinking establishments, cigar bars, and such must apply for an exemption with documentation and be approved before allowing smoking. As a result, most bars are not exempt and smoking is banned in most bars and restaurants in Pennsylvania and almost all bars in Philadelphia by local ordinance. From 2009 to 2019, the number of exempt drinking establishments in the state dropped from 2,900 to 1,200.\n:Philadelphia's smoking ordinance, which went into effect on January 8, 2007, bans smoking in all restaurants, exempting bars where food accounts for less than 10% of sales and alcohol accounts for more than 90% of sales, and persons under 18 are prohibited. As with the state ban, to receive exemption bars must apply for and receive the exemption. Philadelphia's ordinance is the only local smoking ban in Pennsylvania. On April 29, 2014, Mayor Michael Nutter passed an executive order banning smoking in all city parks.\n* ''''Smoke-Free Beaches' Program:''' Pennsylvania's 'Smoke-Free Beaches' program was initiated by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. This program places smoking constraints at designated parks to eliminate smoking on beaches and swimming areas. For visitors who smoke and still want to use these beaches, designated areas adjacent to the beach are provided. The restriction includes cigarettes, pipes, cigars and the increasingly popular e-cigarettes. Staff at newly affected parks have been preparing for the change by purchasing and installing butt disposal units; installing new signage; establishing designated smoking areas with seating; and informing park user and support groups.\n** In 2016, 12 state parks initiated new \"Smoke Free Beaches\". They were: Hills Creek, Tioga County; Lyman Run, Potter County; R.B. Winter, Union; Presque Isle, Erie; Pymatuning, Crawford, Laurel Hill, Somerset County; Whipple Dam, Huntingdon County; Gifford Pinchot, York County; Cowans Gap, Fulton County; Gouldsboro, Monroe County; Ricketts Glen, Luzerne County; and Worlds End, Sullivan.\nPuerto Rico\n*Territory-wide smoking ban: Effective March 2, 2007, smoking is banned territory-wide in all enclosed workplaces in Puerto Rico, including bars and restaurants, as well as private vehicles when either a minor in a car seat or a child under 13 is present.

Local governments may regulate smoking more strictly than the Act, though as of April 2009 none have chosen to do so.\nSouth Carolina\n* No statewide smoking ban. Instead, South Carolina's 1990 statewide smoking law, the Clean Indoor Air Law, generally prohibits smoking only in (1) public schools, excluding offices and teacher lounges (unless a local school board says otherwise), (2) childcare facilities, (3) healthcare facilities, except in designated employee smoking areas (unless the facilities chooses to be smoke-free), (4) government buildings, except in designated employee smoking areas (and except the State Capitol and legislative office buildings), (5) elevators, (6) public transportation vehicles, and (7) public theatres and arenas, except in designated smoking areas in common areas, and in any such designated smoking area warning signs must be appropriately posted. The Act covers no other places. On March 31, 2008, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that local governments generally may regulate smoking more stringently than the Act. On September 8, 2008, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the maximum fine a city or town constitutionally can impose for breaking a local smoking ban is $25.\n*Localities in South Carolina with smoking bans that include all bars and restaurants (63 total as of April 1, 2019):\n**Aiken, July 14, 2008, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Aiken County, September 16, 2008, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Atlantic Beach, May 2, 2011, prohibited in all bars and restaurants, but not in all other workplaces\n**Beaufort, May 27, 2008, prohibited in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Beaufort County, January 10, 2007, prohibited in all workplaces, including bars and restaurants, within unincorporated areas of Beaufort County\n**Blacksburg, September 12, 2017, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Blackville, September 19, 2018, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Camden, September 22, 2008, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Cayce, June 1, 2010, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Chapin, August 3, 2010, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Charleston, July 23, 2007, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants;

The bill bans smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in South Dakota, including bars and restaurants, exempting only private residences unless used for child daycare, cigar bars, retail tobacco shops, and a percentage of hotel and motel rooms. The bill was passed in the South Dakota State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Mike Rounds. It was scheduled to take effect in July 2009, but on June 22, 2009, a group of casino and video lottery operators presented the Secretary of State with a petition for a referendum over H.B. 1240 that they claimed to bear 25,000 valid signatures. On June 25, 2009, the Secretary of State certified that the petition indeed bore at least the required 16,776 valid signatures, putting H.B. 1240 to the November 2010 public referendum. On July 24, 2009, the Secretary of State declared that after further review, the number of valid signatures on the petition fell short of the required number to put the issue on the ballot. On November 13, 2009, however, Circuit Judge Kathleen Trandahl ruled that the petition did have enough valid signatures, and ordered the Secretary of State to put the issue to a public vote on November 2, 2010, which ultimately passed. H.B. 1240 is silent as to whether local governments may regulate smoking more stringently, though as of November 2010 no local governments in South Dakota have done so.\nTennessee\n*Statewide smoking ban excluding bars and some restaurants. Tennessee's 2007 statewide smoking law, the Non-Smoker Protection Act, prohibits smoking statewide in all public places in Tennessee, except as exempted; (1) any business, including a bar or restaurant, that does not serve persons under 21, (2) designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, (3) tobacco industry-related facilities, (4) outdoor areas and areas with an open garage door, (5) nursing homes, (6) designated smoking areas not accessible to the general public in businesses with three or fewer employees, (7) private clubs, (8) private residences and vehicles unless it is being used for child care, daycare, or public transportation of children, (9) retail tobacco stores, and (10) commercial vehicles occupied solely by the operator. Local governments in counties with more than 180,000 residents may regulate smoking more strictly than the state.\n*Nashville, March 1, 2023, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\nTexas\n*No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Texas' 1997 statewide smoking law only prohibits smoking in activities of public schools on or off school property, elevators, theatres, libraries, museums, hospitals, buses, airplanes, and trains, as long as these areas are open to the general public, unless the proprietor designates the place for smoking and posts appropriate warning signs. Violation of this law is a class C misdemeanor. Texas law is silent as to whether local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state, and on December 9, 2004, the Texas Court of Appeals upheld El Paso's municipal ban on smoking in all bars and restaurants. As of April 1, 2018, 133 cities in Texas have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees.\n*Localities in Texas with a smoking ban including all bars and restaurants (112 total):\n**Abilene, January 3, 2007, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Alamo, August 10, 2017, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Alton, April 1, 2008, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Anthony, October 23, 2017, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Arlington, May 19, 2017, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants\n**Austin, September 1, 2005, after passage by 52% of voters, banned in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants; exempts bingo halls, fraternities, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, separately ventilated smoking rooms in bars and restaurants constructed before September 2005, and nursing homes.

Since the state law supersedes any ordinances passed by political subdivisions of the state (i.e., cities, counties, school districts, agencies, etc.), such political subdivisions are preempted from regulating indoor smoking any more or less stringently than the Act. Utah is one of the few states with a statewide smoking ban that does not exempt tobacconists.\n**Local outdoor smoking bans: Notwithstanding the preemption against political subdivisions modifying the restrictions on indoor smoking, the Act expressly allows such political subdivisions to regulate \"smoking in outdoor places of public access which are owned or operated by\" (emphasis added) a political subdivision (specifically including state institutions of public or higher education). Accordingly, some political subdivisions have enacted local ordinances prohibiting smoking in certain outdoor areas such as schools, parks, and public transit facilities.\nVermont\n*Statewide smoking ban: Effective September 1, 2005, smoking is banned in all enclosed workplaces in Vermont, including all bars and restaurants, except in private residences (unless if it is being used as a childcare facility or it smoking is banned under the landlord's request) as well as areas of owner-operated businesses with no employees that are not open to the public, although separately ventilated designated smoking areas in businesses where employees are not required to be were exempt until July 1, 2009. Designated unenclosed smoking areas in businesses where the layout of the workplace is such that smoking would not be a physical irritation to any nonsmoking employee and three-fourths of the employees agreed were also exempt until July 1, 2009. The Vermont Veterans Home in Bennington is the only non-owner-operated workplace in the state permitted to allow smoking. Vermont is one of the few states with a statewide smoking ban that does not expressly exempt tobacconists, and is one of four states that does not allow the designation of hotel/motel smoking rooms. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the state law.\nVirginia\n*No statewide smoking ban. Instead, Virginia's 2009 statewide smoking law, the 2009 Indoor Clean Air Act prohibits smoking statewide in enclosed public elevators, public school buses, primary and secondary schools, hospital emergency rooms, health department offices, polling places, indoor service lines and cashier lines, public restrooms in government buildings and hospitals, child daycare centers except where located in a private home, and public restrooms of health care facilities, and relegating smoking in restaurants (including bars) to separately ventilated designated smoking rooms that are structurally separated from the rest of the establishment. The Act exempts private clubs, retail tobacco stores, tobacco warehouses, tobacco manufacturing facilities, prisons, designated smoking areas in government offices, food preparation facilities for catering services, restaurants located on the premises of tobacco manufacturers, rented private rooms in restaurants; requires the reasonable designation of non-smoking areas in educational facilities where smoking is not banned, hospitals, retail stores bigger than , and recreational facilities.\nLocal governments are preempted from regulating smoking more stringently than the Act. Since 2006, smoking in state offices, vehicles, and buildings (except for correctional facilities) has been banned by executive order issued by the Governor of Virginia. A law which came into effect on July 1, 2016, banned smoking in private cars with any occupants who are 8 years or younger.\nWashington\n*Statewide smoking ban: On December 8, 2005, after ratification by a majority of Washington voters in a statewide initiative referendum, an amendment to Washington's 1985 Clean Indoor Air Act became effective banning smoking statewide in all public places and places of employment in Washington (except 25% of hotel/motel rooms), as well as within  of doors, windows, or ventilation intakes to such places. The act exempts private enclosed workplaces and private residences except when being used to provide licensed childcare, foster care, adult care, or other similar social service care. Washington does not provide exemptions for tobacconists or businesses whose sole purpose is to provide an environment for smoking (e.g. hookah lounges, cigar bars). However, private clubs in enclosed spaces with no employees, and businesses on tribal lands, are exempt. Local governments may regulate smoking more stringently than the act, and local health boards are authorized to enforce the act locally.\nWest Virginia\n*No statewide smoking ban. Instead, West Virginia's statewide smoking laws generally prohibit smoking in (1) public transportation vehicles where a \"no smoking\" sign is posted, (2) areas of public school except teacher's lounges not accessible to students (unless a local education board rules differently), (3) workplaces where a \"no smoking\" sign is posted, (4) areas near surface magazines for explosives used in mining, (5) mines and structures around mines, (6) nonsmoking sections in bingo halls, and (7) nonsmoking areas in nursing homes. No West Virginia law requires the designation of nonsmoking areas generally in enclosed workplaces. In 2003, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia ruled that county health boards may regulate smoking more stringently than the state, except in bingo halls and retirement homes. As of April 2009, 51 of the 55 counties and two cities in West Virginia have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees.\n*Localities in West Virginia with a smoking ban that includes all bars and

S.B. 181 (2009 Wisconsin Act 12) took effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Wisconsin, including bars, restaurants, lodging establishments, and private clubs, as well as outdoors within a \"reasonable distance\" of any such place, except in bar/restaurant patios. The Act exempts cigar bars or retail tobacco stores already in existence, private homes, and rooms in nursing homes where occupants agree to allow smoking. It also exempts bars and restaurants consisting of two or more walls with openings that allow air in from the outside and cover at least 25% of each wall's surface area. It does not include casinos run by American Indian tribes, as those casinos are in the tribes' sovereign territory. Local governments may not regulate smoking more strictly than the Act. Prior to this law taking effect, several localities in Wisconsin had local smoking bans in effect.\nWyoming\n* No statewide smoking ban.
