The department oversees school meal programs, distributes surplus food from federal programs, oversees soil and water resources, maintains farmland for agricultural uses, assists in development of overseas markets for New Jersey products from its farms and fisheries, and administers agricultural education programs.\nEd Wengryn was named New Jersey secretary of agriculture in March 2024.\nOrganization\nThe department is jointly managed by the secretary of agriculture and the State Board of Agriculture. The secretary is responsible for managing and directing the work of the department. In addition, the secretary is the department’s executive officer, serves as secretary to the State Board of Agriculture and is a member of the governor's cabinet. The secretary is appointed by the State Board of Agriculture and is approved by the governor.  New Jersey is the only state in the nation where the farmer constituents of the Department of Agriculture set policy and actively manage the department and select its secretary.\nThe State Board of Agriculture, an eight-member body created by statute in 1887, serves as the policy-making and general head of the department. The board is charged with setting policies which direct the secretary and the department in carrying out its duties and responsibilities. Each member serves a four-year term, with two members replaced annually by new members elected at the State Agricultural Convention and appointed by the governor with the approval of the State Senate. By law, at least four of the members must represent the top four commodity groups in the state based on a two-year average of the gross value of production.\n*State Board of Agriculture\n*Secretary of Agriculture\n**Office of the Secretary\n**Agricultural and Natural Resources Division\n**Animal Health Division\n**Food and Nutrition Division\n**Marketing and Development Division\n**Plant Industry Division\nAgricultural Education\nAlso found at the New Jersey Department of Agriculture is the Agricultural Education Division, led by Mrs. Nancy Trivette.
