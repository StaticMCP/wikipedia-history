Tom T. Hall dubbed King the \"Bluegrass Storyteller\", for his ability to infuse his story songs with emotion and authenticity.\nEarly life\nKing was raised in Cana, Virginia, in Carroll County. His father Jim King had appeared on Roanoke television with Don Reno and Red Smiley as tenor vocalist and guitarist for the Country Cousins. His father and his uncle Joe Edd King had played with Ted Lundy of the Southern Mountain Boys.\nIn 1974, King heard the Stanley Brothers and fell in love with their bluegrass music. King began his career at age 16 playing gospel music at his Pentecostal Holiness church. He left Cana at age 19.\nRalph Stanley\nAfter a stint in the United States Marine Corps, King relocated to Wilmington, Delaware where he started a band with Lundy's sons T.J. and Bobby. In 1986, bluegrass deejay Ray Davis introduced King to Ralph Stanley, with whom he recorded two albums: Stanley Brothers Classics and Reunion with George Shuffler on Davis's Wango label. Stanley named King an honorary member of his Clinch Mountain Boys.\nSolo recordings\nIn July 1988, King recorded his first album under his own name on the Webco label: ''It's a Cold, Cold World (reissued in 1996 as Webco Classics, Volume Two.\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, King was a member of Big Country Bluegrass. Dudley Connell of the Johnson Mountain Boys brought King to the attention of Ken Irwin at Rounder Records. King signed to Rounder Records in 1992 and released his album These Old Pictures in 1993.\nOn Lonesome and Then Some in 1995, King was backed by Connell (guitar, vocals), Tom Adams (banjo), David McLaughlin (guitar, vocals), and Marshall Wilborn (bass).\nKing formed the James King Band, which was named Emerging Artist of the Year by the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) in 1997.  In 1998 Bed by the Window'' was the recording debut of the James King Band, and its title track was nominated for IBMA's Song of the Year in 1999.\nIn 2002, 30 Years of Farming featured the James King Band as supporting instrumentalists.\nKing released The Bluegrass Storyteller in 2005 with Kevin Prater (mandolin), Bernie Green (banjo), Jerry McNeely (bass), and Adam Haynes (fiddle).\nIn 2013, King released what would be his final album, the Grammy-nominated Three Chords and the Truth, recorded over a five-year period. King selected country music songs and arranged them for bluegrass. He was assisted by Connell, Don Rigsby, Jimmy Mattingly (fiddle), Ronnie Stewart (banjo), Jesse Brock (mandolin), Jason Moore (bass), and Josh Williams (guitar).\nLongview\nFormed in 1997, Longview brought together King, Connell, Rigsby, Willborn, Glen Duncan, and Joe Mullins. For later recordings, Connell, Mullins, and Duncan were replaced by J. D. Crowe, Ron Stewart, and Lou Reid. Longview recorded four albums. Their self-titled 1997 debut was named Recorded Event of the Year by the IBMA. This was followed by High Lonesome in 1999, Lessons in Stone in 2002, and Deep in the Mountains in 2008.\nLater life and death\nKing was a recovering alcoholic, and in recent years had struggled with liver issues. He died on May 19, 2016, surrounded by family and friends.\nHonors, awards, and distinctions\nKing won 12 Bluegrass Music awards, a Grammy Award nomination for Three Chords & the Truth, and was inducted into the Virginia Music Hall of Fame in 2014.
