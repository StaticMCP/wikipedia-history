One famous example is David and Goliath, an event where David and Goliath would face each other, then David quickly threw a stone with his sling, causing the stone to hit Goliath in the forehead, which made him fall to the ground.\nStart of the war\nWhen Joshua was old, God told him the land of the Philistines as one of the areas that still remained to be defeated by Israel (Joshua 13:1–3). Because the Philistines were not completely removed, Israel faced them as perennial enemy.\nWhen Saul was thirty years old, he became the king of Israel; Saul bring about three thousand men to begin his invasion of Philistia. Two thousand men were with Saul while a thousand men were with his son Jonathan.\nReferences"
