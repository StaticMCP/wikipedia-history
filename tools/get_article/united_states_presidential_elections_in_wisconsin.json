In 1924, Robert M. La Follette became the only third-party presidential candidate to win in Wisconsin, taking 53.96% of the popular vote. Since 1988, Wisconsin has leaned towards the Democratic Party in presidential elections, although Republican Donald Trump won the state by a margin of 0.77 percentage points. Wisconsin is tied with Michigan and Pennsylvania for the longest active streak of voting for the winning candidate, last voting for a losing candidate in 2004.\nIn the 2020 presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden won Wisconsin, defeating Trump by 0.62 percentage points. During the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count, 36 members of the House of Representatives objected to the certification of Wisconsin's electoral votes because of unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, but the objection failed because it was not joined by a senator.\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Republican candidate Donald Trump won Wisconsin by 0.87 percentage points over Kamala Harris.\nElections\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:62em\"\n!
