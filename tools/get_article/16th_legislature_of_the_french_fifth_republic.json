It was preceded by the 15th legislature. On 9 June 2024, following a defeat in the 2024 European Parliament Elections, President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly, as per article 12 of the Constitution of the Fifth French Republic, }} and called for snap elections on 30 June (1st round) and 7 July (2nd round).\nComposition of the executive\n* President of France: Emmanuel Macron (LREM), since 14 May 2017\nMembership\nFor the first time since the 1988 legislative election, the incumbent President of France failed to earn a parliamentary majority in the National Assembly. The 2022 legislative election was widely seen as a severe blow for Emmanuel Macron. Both the outgoing President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand and leader of the La République En Marche! party in the National Assembly Christophe Castaner lost their seats. The position of Élisabeth Borne as Prime Minister was put into question following the election result. On 21 June 2022, she offered her resignation to President Macron, who refused to accept it.\nOn 28 June 2022, Yaël Braun-Pivet was elected to succeed Ferrand as President of the National Assembly.\nHemicycle Elections Juin 2022.svg|Composition of the National Assembly following the 2022 election according to Ministry of the Interior candidate labels\nXVI French NA with all parties.svg|Composition of the National Assembly with all parties shown separately\nChanges\nSee also\n* Election results of Cabinet Ministers during the 2022 French legislative election\n* List of MPs who lost their seat in the 2022 French legislative election\n* Results of the 2022 French legislative election by constituency\nNotes\nReferences"
