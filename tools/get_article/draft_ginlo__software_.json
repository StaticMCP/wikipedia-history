It allows account registration without cell phone number.\nThe name is an anagram of the word login. The servers are hosted in Germany.\nHistory\nGinlo was founded by the founder of GMX in 2017 under the name Brabbler. In 2019, the company bought the messenger Simsme from Deutsche Post. They later ran out of money and Brabbler cofounder Karsten Schramm bought it in 2020 and renamed it to Ginlo.\nFeatures\nGinlo has a private and a business edition.\nThe private version is free while the business version is paid. The app contains no ads and is completely financed by the business version revenue.\nBoth versions can communicate with each other.\nReferences"
