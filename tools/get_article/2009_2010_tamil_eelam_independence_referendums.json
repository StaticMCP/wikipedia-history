The Government of Sri Lanka and its supporters allegedly attempted to prevent referendums from being held, according to TamilNet.\nAlthough over 99% voted in favour of independence, the results of the referendums were not recognized by the Government of Sri Lanka.\nBackground\nProcedure\nThe referendums, although organised by Tamil groups, were conducted by independent organisations with independent observers. Voters were asked their opinion on the following statement:\n\"I aspire for the formation of the independent and sovereign state of Tamil Eelam in the north and east territory of the island of Sri Lanka on the basis that the Tamils in the island of Sri Lanka make a distinct nation, have a traditional homeland and have the right to self-determination.\"\nNorway\nVoting took place on 10 May 2009 at 14 locations throughout Norway.
