In private settings, this kind of disposable products has proven very popular with consumers who prefer easy and quick cleanup after parties, etc.\nThe market for disposable tableware is huge, with an estimated $7.5 billion in 2012 in the US alone.\nKulhar\nclay bowl with dahi (curd)]]\nA kulhar  is a traditional handle-less clay cup from South Asia that is typically unpainted and unglazed, and meant to be disposable. Since kulhars are made by firing in a kiln and are almost never reused, they are inherently sterile and hygienic. Bazaars and food stalls in the Indian subcontinent traditionally served hot beverages, such as tea, in kuhlars, which suffused the beverage with an \"earthy aroma\" that was often considered appealing. Yoghurt, hot milk with sugar as well as some regional desserts, such as kulfi'' (traditional ice-cream), are also served in kulhars. Kulhars have gradually given way to polystyrene and coated paper cups, because the latter are lighter to carry in bulk and cheaper.⁠⁠\nEnvironmental impacts\nAs is the case for disposable cups, materials used are usually paper, plastic (including expanded polystyrene foam), or plastic-coated paper. Recycling rates are especially low for paper-based products, especially when soiled with (wet and / or oily) scraps due to diminished recyclate quality. The waste problem is aggravated by the fact that most of the utilities themselves come in plastic and thus disposable packaging.\nEfforts are made to introduce biodegradable materials like sugarcane, bamboo, wheat straw, palm leaves, or various types of flours (rice, wheat and sorghum). Nevertheless, biodegradable and composable plastics often do not break down in landfill environments.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
