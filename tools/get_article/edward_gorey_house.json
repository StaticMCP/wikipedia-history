The house currently serves as a museum celebrating Gorey's life and work.\nGorey had a respect and passion for animals, cats in particular. The activities of the house, from art education to interactive exhibits, reflect Gorey's support of animal welfare.\nDescription\nGorey collected all sorts of objects; some of them discarded objects found at the side of the road. He arranged and displayed such items on his porch and in the rooms of the house. He also had a large collection of books and an overflowing library.\nElephant House is also notable for the presence of a large southern magnolia tree in its yard, a species not usually found so far north.\nGallery\nThe Museum has a display of the Edward Gorey binding project.\nFile:Elephant House Cape Cod.jpg\nFile:One of his beloved cats The Edward Gorey House 2007 C is for cats who played with his ink.jpg|alt=\nFile:F is for furs in which he looked quite trim The Edward Gorey House 2007.jpg|alt=\nFile:The house with a clock in its wall The Edward Gorey House 2007.jpg|alt=\nFile:The Edward Gorey Elephant House 2007.jpg|alt=\nPreservation\nA 2002 grant from the Highland Street Foundation allowed the house to be purchased and the museum to be established.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090514021208/http://www.hsoy.org/historic/gorey.htm Information from The Historical Society of Old Yarmouth]"
