It was a decisive victory for Jayasimha, who recovered numerous territories.\nBackground\nThe Western Chalukya king Jayasimha II was fighting numerous wars between the Paramaras under Bhoja, the Kalachuris of Tripuri under Gangeyadeva and the Cholas under Rajendra Chola. During this period, Rajendra Chola was not only exerting control over the Vengi kingdom of the Eastern Chalukyas, he was also constantly trying to expand their kingdom northwards into the Western Chalukya territory. For a while the Cholas were preoccupied with their invasion of Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka) and with their territorial issues with the Pandyan Dynasty of Madurai, and the rulers of Kerala.\nTaking advantage of this confusion and with an intent of reducing Chola power in Vengi, Jayasimha II interfered in Vengi after the death of its incumbent King Vimaladitya and decided to install Vimaladitya's son of his choice, Vijayaditya II on the throne. Jayasimha II conquered Vijayawada Fort after defeating Cholas in the Battle of Vijayawada (1037 AD). He conquered Vengi in 1037 AD and placed Vijayaditya on Vengi throne. Vijayaditya initially did well with this support. This was against the plans of the Rajendra Chola who wanted Rajaraja Narendra, a prince born to Vimaladitya's queen from the Chola clan. To further strengthen himself, Jayasimha II had marched south of the Tungabhadra river and occupied Bellary, the Raichur Doab and perhaps part of Gangavadi (modern south-east Karnataka) as well.\nAfter being victorious at the battle of Maski, Jayasimha  II reconquered Gangawadi and Raichur from Cholas. Rajendra Chola employed a two-pronged attack. One army going into the Vengi kingdom to successfully assist Rajaraja Narendra over his claims over the Vengi throne, and the other into the Western Chalukya kingdom itself. But the Chola army could not proceed any further and the Tungabhadra river remained the tacit border between the two empires.\nBattle\nRajendra had assembled a confederacy of kings with Bhoja and his feudatory, Gangeyadeva. Together, they marched to the Godavari river against Jayasimha II. However, Jayasimha, with the help of Bachiraja, an officer under him, defeated the coalition and reconquered several territories.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Jayasimha II defeated the Cholas at the battle of Kalindi and put Vijayaditya VII on the throne of the Eastern Chalukya throne and at the battle of Ededore, defeated the Cholas and reconquered the province.\nSee also\nChola-Chalukya wars\nReferences"
