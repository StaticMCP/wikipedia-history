Gumdale has several new development sites consisting of less than 5% of housing, the other 95% are acreages.  It is Brisbane's nearest acreage suburb to the CBD.\nHistory\nThe Grassdale Land Company Limited formed on 8 January 1885 to acquire the property known as Grassdale Paddocks, in the parish of Tingalpa, with registered shareholders holding 80 shares of 250 pounds each. This area is spread across the Brisbane suburbs of Gumdale, Belmont and Chandler. The company offered the land for auction in the Grassdale Estate later in 1885. The allotments were situated along Grassdale Road, London Road, Boston Road, Old Cleveland Road, Archer Street and four unnamed roads (later called Belmont Road, Stanborough Road, Tilley Road and New Cleveland Road). Prior to the sale extensive publicity was published in the Brisbane newspapers, calling for \"the attention of the investor, capitalist, farmer, merchant, artizan [sic], and mechanic, and is only one hour's drive from Brisbane, and as it has been decided to run the Cleveland Railway through the Estate, it will be brought within a few minutes' ride of the heart of the city\". The results of the public auction on 28 November 1885 were reported in the Telegraph newspaper with \"forty-two lots were disposed of, comprising an area of 144 acres...\" The Grassdale Land Company Limited later produced a plan of divisions of unsold land into 45 lots, listing the size and value of the lots at the time.\nGrassdale State School opened on 26 August 1935.
