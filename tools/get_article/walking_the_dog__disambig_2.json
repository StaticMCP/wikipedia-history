It was released on his 1963 album Walking the Dog. It was his signature hit and also his biggest, reaching number 10 on the Billboard'' Hot 100 in December 1963 and remaining on the chart for 14 weeks.\nBackground\nThe start of the Rufus Thomas version quotes the first 14 notes of the Wedding March from Mendelssohn's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''. This version is noted for Rufus whistling and calling out for his dog, to go walking with him. The lyrics also reference children's nursery rhymes, especially Mary Mack.\nThe Dennisons recording\nThe only hit version in the UK was by the Dennisons, whose recording reached number 36 on the UK Singles Chart in 1964.\nReleases\nThe song was recorded several months later by the Rolling Stones in 1964. Unlike most Stones' recordings, the song features harmony vocals on the chorus solely by Brian Jones (most early Stones songs feature Jones and Bill Wyman on backing vocals, with Keith Richards replacing the two not long after), which makes their recording of the song unique in their catalogue.\nMany other artists have recorded the song, including Aerosmith, Johnny Rivers, John Cale, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, Roger Daltrey, Green Day, Hans Theessink, the Flamin' Groovies, The Kingsmen, The Sonics, The Lincolns, Ace Cannon, Jackie Shane, The Trashmen, Luv'd Ones, Bob Paisley and the Southern Grass, and Ratt. It was performed live occasionally by the Grateful Dead in 1966, 1970 and the mid-1980s.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"vertical-align:middle; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:60pt;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:200pt;\"|Artist\n! style=\"width:300pt;\"|Album\n|-\n|\n| Rufus Thomas\n| Walking the Dog\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| The Rolling Stones\n| The Rolling Stones\n|-\n| The Excels\n| 45 only\n|-\n| Johnny Rivers\n| At the Whisky à Go Go\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| The Kingsmen\n| The Kingsmen Volume II\n|-\n| The Sonics\n| Here Are the Sonics\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels\n| Breakout...!!!\n|-\n| The Everly Brothers\n| Beat & Soul\n|-\n| Davy Graham\n| Midnight Man\n|-\n|\n| Ace Cannon\n| Memphis Golden Hits\n|-\n|\n| Sandie Shaw\n| Reviewing the Situation\n|-\n|\n| The Flamin' Groovies\n| Teenage Head\n|-\n|\n| Aerosmith\n| Aerosmith\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n| Rick Derringer\n| Spring Fever\n|-\n| Roger Daltrey\n| Ride a Rock Horse\n|-\n| Michel Pagliaro\n| Pagliaro I (and Pagliaro, \"Faire le trottoir\" in French)\n|-\n| Spirit\n| ''Spirit of '76\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" |\n| Dr. Feelgood\n| Stupidity\n|-\n|\n|Hurriganes\n|Domestic release: Tsugu Way (International: Use No Hooks)\n|-\n|\n|The New Mickey Mouse Club\n| The All New Mickey Mouse Club Original TV Cast Album\n|-\n|\n| John Cale\n| Sabotage/Live\n|-\n|\n| Ratt\n| Ratt\n|-\n|\n| The Lincolns\n|-\n|\n| Dave Stewart & Barbara Gaskin\n| Spin\n|-\n|\n| Green Day\n| Demos tape for Dookie\n|-\n|\n| Run C&W\n| Into the Twangy-First Century\n|-\n|\n| Kidsongs\n| Boppin' with the Biggles\n|-\n|\n| Jason & the Scorchers\n| Midnight Roads & Stages Seen\n|-\n|\n| The Trashmen\n| Bird Call!: The Twin City Stomp of the Trashmen\n|-\n|\n|Tony Spinner\n|Rollin' & Tumblin'\n|-\n|\n| American Dog & Fin\n| Dogatized'' (song's title changed to \"Rocking the Dog\")\n|-\n|\n| Schizophrenic Spacers\n| Live version from \"Macumba: Live at Last\"\n|-\n|\n| Jackie Shane\n| Any Other Way\n|}\nReferences"
