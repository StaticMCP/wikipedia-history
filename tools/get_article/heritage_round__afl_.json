Before joining the AFL, Port Adelaide used a Magpie moniker and wore a black and white guernsey with six vertical stripes and one horizontal stripe. This guernsey is similar to  which wears a black and white guernsey with three stripes of black and white and has been a part of the VFL/AFL since 1897. When Port Adelaide joined the AFL they adopted a new moniker, Power and added two new colours to their palette, teal and silver. During the 2006 Heritage Round which adopted a 1980s theme Port Adelaide was prevented by the AFL from taking part. During the 1980s Port Adelaide won four SANFL premierships (1980, 1981, 1988, 1989) wearing it's Prison Bar' guernsey. The following year Port Adelaide, Collingwood and the AFL came to an agreement that Port Adelaide would be able to use their 'Prison Bar' guernsey in future Heritage Rounds. However, after this agreement was reached the AFL ceased sanctioning official Heritage Rounds. In 2021 Eddie McGuire noted that he knew at the time of signing the agreement with Port Adelaide that Heritage Rounds would ceased to be officially sanctioned by the AFL in the future.\nSee also\n*NRL Heritage Round\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.footyjumpers.com/ Footy Jumpers], website covering the history of AFL/VFL jumpers"
