The peak is the third peak in the range and the fourth tallest in Wyoming. The summit is located in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness of Shoshone National Forest and rises above several glaciers, the best known being Dinwoody Glacier which is immediately north of the summit tower. The mountain abuts, but is not within, either Bridger National Forest or Sublette County, Wyoming.\nHazards\nEncountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.\nImportantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mountainmancountry.com/attractions/destinations/wind-river-mountians.html General Information on the Wind River Range]\n* [https://www.summitpost.org/wind-river-range/171223 Climbing the Wind River Range] ([https://www.climbingwyoming.com/ more])\n* [https://www.sublette.com/examiner/v5n23/v5n23s3.htm Glaciers in the Wind River Range]\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/shoshone/ Shoshone National Forest Federal website]\n* [https://www.continentaldividetrail.org/ Continental Divide Trail information]"
