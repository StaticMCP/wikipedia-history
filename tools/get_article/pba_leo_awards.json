The winners are awarded with The Leo, named in honor of the league's first commissioner, Leo Prieto.\nSince the 2017–18 season, the Leo awards is held before the opening ceremonies of the new season. Before the 2017-18 season, the ceremony is usually held before the start of Game 4 of the best-of-seven finals series of the third conference of the season. If the finals series is a best-of-five affair, it is held before Game 3 of the series.\nThe Leo\nJimmy Alapag holds The Leo representing his Most Valuable Player award during the 2003 PBA Annual Awards\nThe Leo is a statuette given by the Philippine Basketball Association to its seasonal awardees.\nIntroduced in 2003, it became the standard trophy of all awards given by the league for its season awards such as the Most Valuable Player, Mythical Team and others.\nThe statuette features a three-dimensional representation of the player depicted in the league's official logo.
