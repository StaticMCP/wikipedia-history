Fire is in the Avesta as Atash or Atar, in Pahlavi literature atour or atakhsh; or in Persian literature, fire is known as azar or athash. The guardian angel of fire is known as Atouryast in Pahlavi literature, and in Persian literature Azarizad (Azar + Izad, which means Fire + Goddess). Due to the importance of the position, the Angel has been called the son of Ahura Mazda refer the  Khordeh Avesta- Atash Niyash, litany to fire where Atash is called the son of Ahura Mazda. In ancient Iranian ritual, in order to appease the fire angel, fragrant woods or sandalwood were constantly applied in fire temples and fires in homes, this is done to this day, in over 300 consecrated Fire Temples like Udvada Atash Behram by Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians.  In the religion of Zoroastrianism, fire is a sign of purity and truth, and Ardibehesht (in New Persian the second month of the Zoroastrian calendar) is its guardian. Ancient Iranian legends attribute the discovery of lighting a fire with two stones to King Hushang of Pishdadian dynasty. The tradition also survives in Sadeh celebration, which still makes it popular.\nEarly history\nFire commemoration and worship has a long history among the Indo-Iranians, perhaps going back to the Proto-Indo-European religion. The Indo-Iranians believed that fire was the essence of life and existence.   The tradition remains among Muslim Iranians in later periods to ignite candles or turn on the light on the graves of the dead, and yet this is a common event. However, amongst Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians as explained above, consecrated Fire Temples where fire by complex consecration rituals see Atash Behram is installed and kept ever burning to this day.\nReport of Greek historians\nAncient Greek historians refer to the Persians' attention to the gods of the sun, moon, earth, water and fire. Strabo's Geographica, Book XV, Chapter 3:\nAnother historian, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis, writes that Iranians are sworn in front of the sacred fire, and such oaths are very important.\nSee also\n* Agni: Indo-Aryan god of fire\n* Ancient Persia\n* Fire Celebrations\n* Homa (ritual)\nReferences"
