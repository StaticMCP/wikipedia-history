In 1870, returning from London after paying his respects to Queen Victoria, the 20-year-old Maharajah Rajaram II died from a febrile illness in his hotel room in the \"La Pace Hotel\". His courtiers asked to conduct a cremation, or Antyesti ceremony, at the confluence of two rivers. They were able to perform a ceremony at the confluence of the Arno and stream of the Mugnone, near this site in the park. The events and the ceremony elicited a great deal of curiosity in the public.\nThe act of cremation, banned in Florence, led to a fierce argument among doctors and scientists as to the merits and morals of the funeral technique. The costs of the monument were financed by the British government,partly by The Regency Council of Kolhapur who employed the sculptor Charles Francis Fuller, Charles Mant was the architect who used an Indian form in a version of Indo-Saracenic architecture. The base has inscriptions in English, Italian, and Marathi.\nIn 1972, a modern bridge was built near the site and takes the name of Ponte all'Indiano.\nReferences"
