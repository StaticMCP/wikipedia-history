He is best known for his criticism of film and popular culture for Commentary and The Partisan Review.\nLife\nBorn in New York City and raised in its Bronx borough, Warshow graduated from the University of Michigan in 1938. He briefly wrote for The New Leader before being stationed in Washington, D.C. as a member of the Army Signal Corps during World War II. He was managing editor of Commentary from 1946 until his death.\nWarshow died of a heart attack at the age of 37.\nWorks\nAmong the articles published in Warshow's lifetime were \"The Westerner\" and \"The Gangster as Tragic Hero\", analyses of the Western movie and the gangster movie genre from a cultural standpoint. The opening sentence of \"The Westerner\" reads \"The two most successful creations of American movies are the gangster and the Westerner: men with guns.\"\nWarshow also penned essays praising playwright Clifford Odets as well as George Herriman's newspaper comic strip Krazy Kat. \"The 'Idealism' of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg\" showed the executed American Stalinists in a brutally honest light. In a critique of The Crucible Warshow argued that Arthur Miller was not as competent a dramatist as was perceived. After Fredric Wertham and Gershon Legman, Warshow was the first serious critic to write about EC Comics and its Mad magazine, albeit from a measured and equivocal perspective.\nMost of his published work was collected in the book The Immediate Experience in 1962. An expanded edition was released by Harvard University Press in 2001.\nSee also\n* Gilbert Seldes\n* Otis Ferguson\n* Manny Farber\n* James Agee\n* Andrew Sarris\n* Pauline Kael\nBooks\n* Robert Warshow: Immediate Experience.
