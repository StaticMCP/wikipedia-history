The last award was presented by the newly formed Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) in the inaugural AACTA Awards in 2011.\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of AACTA in 2011, the award was presented by AFI at the annual Australian Film Institute Awards (more commonly known as the AFI Awards) from 2009–2010. The award is presented at the AACTA Awards Luncheon, a black tie event which celebrates achievements in film production, television, documentaries and short films.\nThe name was still used at the inaugural AACTA Awards in 2011, but was dropped in the 2nd edition of the new awards.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, winners are listed first, in boldface and highlighted in gold; those listed below the winner that are not in boldface or highlighted are the nominees.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"19%\" | Film\n! width=\"19%\" | Producer(s)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| Samson and Delilah\n| Kath Shelper'\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 2009(51st)\n| Australia\n| Baz Luhrmann, G.
