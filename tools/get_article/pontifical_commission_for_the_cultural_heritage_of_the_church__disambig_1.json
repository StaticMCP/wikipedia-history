It was the direct heir of the Pontifical commission for religious art, erected in 1924, initially only for Italy, with an important role for the preservation of art during World War II.\nBy the Apostolic Letter given Motu Proprio Inde a pontificatus (25 March 1993), Pope John Paul II renamed it the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and established it as an autonomous body independent of the Congregation for the Clergy, with its own President who was to be a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture so as to ensure a proper coordination of the activities of the two bodies.\nBy his Apostolic Letter given Motu Proprio Pulchritudinis fidei (30 July 2012), Pope Benedict XVI recognised the convergence of the role and functions of these two bodies and suppressed the commission, transferring its former objectives, faculties and activities to the Pontifical Council for Culture.\nPresidents of the Pontifical Commission\n*Antonio Innocenti (8 Oct 1988 - 1 Jul 1991)\n*Francesco Marchisano (4 May 1993 - 13 Oct 2003)\n*Mauro Piacenza (13 Oct 2003 - 7 May 2007)\n*Gianfranco Ravasi (3 Sep 2007 - 30 June 2012)\nSee also\n*Pontifical Commission\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_commissions/pcchc/index.htm Commission official website]"
