The pub sign had Queen Victoria on one side and a young Queen Alexandra on the other.\nIn 1996, it became a theme pub, with an African zoo motif, and some of its notable regular customers, Kingsley Amis, Robert Stephens and Peter Quennell, were said to be \"horrified\".\nIt is part of the Young's pub chain.\nReferences\nExternal links"
