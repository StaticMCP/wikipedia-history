According to Anoushiravan Ehteshami, \"little separated the candidates from each other\" and \"real choices and real alternatives\" were absent. Out of 128 candidates who registered to run, only 4 were approved.  The voter turnout was roughly half of all registered voters at 16,796,787.  Discontent with the economic situation and voter apathy are the other reasons cited for the relatively low turnout in the election.\nUnited Press International reported an independent survey have found \"the bulk of those who stayed away did so because they were displeased with the clergy or did not believe their vote would make any difference to the government.\"\nCampaign\nNone of the candidates enjoyed comparable stature to the incumbent president.\nEconomic situation was the main issue in the elections. Rafsanjani, whose economic liberalization and privatisation policies were ongoing, said he will concentrate on economics and 'reconstruction effort', despite the deteriorated situation. Economist Ahmad Tavakkoli also ran on a platform of economic reform and more benefits for the working-class.\nThe Freedom Movement and the Nation Party, called  to boycott the election due to \"lack of fundamental freedoms and the denial of official recognition to most political parties\".\nCandidates\nDisqualified candidates\nThe Guardian Council disqualified some candidates who enrolled to run for president, including:\n* Ebrahim Yazdi,  Head of Political Bureau of Freedom Movement of Iran\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | 1993 Iranian presidential election\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Party\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\"| Nohen et al\n! colspan=\"2\"|ISSDP\n! colspan=\"2\"|UPI / IRNA\n|-\n!
