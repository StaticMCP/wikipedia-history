The hamlet is in the civil parish of Apley, and is  east from the city of Lincoln and  south from the market town of Market Rasen. It sits on the B1202 road from Wragby to Bardney, and  to the east from the parish village of Apley.\nKingthorp is one of five 'villages' represented in the Bardney Group Parish Council.\nThe hamlet contains two Grade II listed late 18th-century brick farmhouses: Kingthorpe Farmhouse and Manor Farmhouse.\nHistory\nIn the Domesday account Kingthorpe is written as \"Chinetorp\", in the Wraggoe Hundred of the South Riding of Lindsey. In 1086 it consisted of 10 villagers, 15 households, land for 1.9 ploughlands, with 1 lord's plough team and 1 men's plough team. There was  of meadow and  of woodland. In 1066 lordship of the manor was held by Bergthorr and Thorulf, being transferred to Odo in 1086 with Ivo Taillebois as Tenant-in-chief. The Lincolnshire Domesday and the Lindsey Survey transcribed the Domesday entry as: \"In Chinetorp (Kingthorpe(Wraggoe)] Bertoe and  Thorald (Torul) had 7.5 bovates and the third part of half a bovate [assessed] to the geld. There is arable land for twice as many teams and oxen. Odo, Ivo's man, has one team there in demesne, and 10 villeins with one team, and 15 acres of meadow, and 80 acres of woodland for pannage throughout the territory[...]  it was worth 50 shillings ; now 40 shillings.\"\nAccording to 19th- and 20th-century trade directories Kingthorpe is a centre for growing wheat, barley, and oats. There were two farmers in 1855, with Kingthorpe described as 'a farm'. The lord of the manor and principal landowner was T. T. Drake (1817-1888), son to the late Thomas Tyrwhitt-Drake MP. At the time Kingthorpe Station on the Louth and Lincoln branch railway was extant but, according to ''Kelly's,  by 1933 it had disappeared. In 1933 there were four farmers.\nKingthorpe railway station was on a line opened in 1876, and closed in 1956; there is no remaining evidence of the station which was situated  east from the hamlet.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.genuki.org.uk/cgi-bin/gazplace?CCC=LIN,GR=TF100750,PLACE=KINGTHORPE,ID=79599 \"Kingthorpe Apley\"], Genuki, Retrieved 19 March 2016\n*[http://www.bardneygroup-pc.gov.uk/ Bardney Group Parish Council]"
