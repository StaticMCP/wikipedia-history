      "text": "# Union for the Republic (Italy)\n\nThe Union for the Republic (, UpR) was a centrist political party in Italy.\nIt was formed by Francesco Cossiga and his followers after the break-up of the Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR) in November 1999.\nThe UpR formed a short-lived centrist alliance called The Clover with the Italian Democratic Socialists (SDI) and Italian Republican Party (PRI), which was responsible for the fall of the D'Alema I Cabinet on 18 December. Consequently, the UpR did not enter in D'Alema II Cabinet.\nMost of UpR members, with the notable exception of Carlo Scognamiglio, joined Forza Italia prior to the 2001 general election.\nReferences"
