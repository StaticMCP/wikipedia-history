Goodenough Award is run biennially by the Royal Society of Chemistry and awards contributions to the field of materials chemistry. The prize winner, chosen by the Materials Chemistry Division Awards Committee, receives a monetary reward, a medal, a certificate and completes a UK lecture tour.\nAward history\nThe award, which was originally referred to as the Materials Chemistry Forum Lifetime Award, was set up in 2008. It was named after the materials scientist John Bannister Goodenough, who has made significant contributions to the development of the first random access memory and in the field of Li-ion rechargeable batteries.\nPrevious winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
