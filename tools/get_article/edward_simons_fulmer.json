At the time of his death Fulmer was one of the only four living knights of the very exclusive Military Order of William, the highest honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nBiography\nBorn on 16 April 1919 in East Syracuse, Fulmer has been a lifelong resident of the area.\nDuring World War II second lieutenant Fulmer served as a pilot of the United States Army Air Forces with the 43d Troop Carrier Squadron, 315th Troop Carrier Group, 9th Air Force.\nOn 18 September 1944, during the battles of the 82nd Airborne Division in Operation Market Garden, he was the second pilot on a Douglas C-47 Skytrain, carrying an entire unit of British parachute troops and an amount of explosive substances, planned to descend with gliders to the area around Ede. Over ’s-Hertogenbosch the airplane was heavily damaged by defensive fire from the Wehrmacht, which caused the pilot to lose consciousness and produced a heavy fire on board. Taking over control of the aircraft, Fulmer made sure the troops and the rest of the crew could save themselves by parachute. In the meantime he suffered serious burns to the face, neck, back, and arms. Nonetheless, he managed to crash land the airplane in an heroic attempt to also save the life of the unconscious pilot. Upon landing, the plane burst into uncontrollable flames and Fulmer was able to escape through a side window. He was then taken care of by Dutch resistance fighters.\nAfter the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1945.\nIn 1946 Fulmer was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, receiving the fourth class knighthood in the Military Order of William (RMWO). This order is the highest and oldest order of chivalry of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, bestowed for \"performing excellent acts of bravery, leadership and loyalty in battle\".\nFulmer and his wife  of 73 years, Lucille White Fulmer had three children: Edward, Randy and Linda.\nHe died at the VA Hospital in Syracuse, New York on 31 December 2017 at the age of 98.\nAirmen of the Royal Netherlands Air Force kept watch during a vigil and the commemoration ceremony was attended by Major Gijs Tuinman RMWO, the Dutch Ambassador to the United States and the chairman of the Chancellery of the Orders of the Netherlands, Major-General (Ret) Henk Morsink. On this occasion, Morsink said:  \"I had the honor to meet him three times in recent years, and I would like to repeat the words of General Patton: We should not cry for the loss of this man, but we may thank God for the honor and privilege of this great man, Edward Simons Fulmer. We will never forget Ed.\"\nHonors and awards\nBadges and awards\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"|Army Air Forces pilot wings\n|-\n|Distinguished Service Cross\n|Purple Heart\n|Air Medal\n|N.Y.

The plane was badly damaged by enemy fire and the pilot rendered unconscious. Taking over the controls, Lieutenant Fulmer remained at his post until the paratroopers jumped to safety. Despite severe burns on his face, neck, back and arms, he managed to land the aircraft in an heroic effort to save the unconscious pilot's life. Upon landing, the plane burst into uncontrollable flames and Lieutenant Fulmer was able to escape through a side window.Second Lieutenant Fulmer's unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself and the United States Army Air Forces.}}\nLiterature\n*\nReferences"
