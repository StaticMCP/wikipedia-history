He had scored three goals in five games for Wroxham in the Eastern Counties Football League during the abandoned 2020–21 season. In March 2021, a deal was agreed \"in principle\" for him to sign his first professional contract with Ipswich Town the following season. He made his first-team debut on 27 November 2022, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute for Gassan Ahadme in a 4–0 win over Buxton in the FA Cup.\nFollowing a loan spell with Irish side, Derry City in early 2023, Ward joined National League South side, Braintree Town in November that same year. On 9 February 2024, Ward was recalled from his loan a month earlier than originally expected.\nOn 17 August 2024, Ward signed for National League club Woking following his departure from Ipswich Town. On the same day, he made his debut for the club during a 2–0 home defeat to Gateshead, replacing Charley Kendall in the 61st minute. A week later, he scored his first goal for Woking in their 3–0 away victory at Ebbsfleet United, curling an effort past Mark Cousins in the 93rd minute. Ward went onto impress during the duration of the season, picking up player of the month awards in September and November. He went onto feature 42 times, scoring 6 goals in his debut season with the club before signing a new two-year deal in May 2025.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Wroxham\n|2020–21\n|Eastern Counties League Premier Division\n|5||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||5||3\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Ipswich Town\n|2021–22\n|League One\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|League One\n|0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|2023–24\n|Championship\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0\n|-\n|Derry City (loan)\n|2023\n|LOI Premier Division\n|3||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||4||1\n|-\n|Braintree Town (loan)\n|2023–24\n|National League South\n|13||3||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||14||3\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Woking\n|2024–25\n|National League\n|34||4||2||0||colspan=2|—||6||2||42||6\n|-\n|2025–26\n|National League\n|9||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||14||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!43||4||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||9||2||56||6\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!64!!11!!5!!0!!0!!0!!11!!2!!80!!13\n|}\nReferences"
