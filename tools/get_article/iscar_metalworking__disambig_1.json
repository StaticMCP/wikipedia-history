ISCAR and the IMC Group were acquired by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in 2006, becoming one of its largest non-insurance companies.\nHistory\nISCAR was founded in 1952 by Stef Wertheimer, an Israeli metalworker in his backyard. It was originally located in Nahariya. In 1982, it moved to Migdal Tefen (Tefen industrial zone) near Kfar Vradim in the Upper Galilee. Since its inception, ISCAR has expanded from a single-marketing and manufacturing facility to a multinational company with representation in over 50 countries.\nIn 2006, Berkshire Hathaway, chaired by American investor Warren Buffett, purchased ISCAR and the IMC Group, making it the company's first international acquisition outside the United States. In 2008, Buffett called the acquisition of the IMC Group a \"dream deal\" that surpassed all his expectations.  In a letter to shareholders, managers were described as \"brilliant strategists and operators,\" and Buffett praised the sales growth and performance of the company as \"unique in its industry.\"\nMr. Ilan Geri is the CEO of ISCAR, and Mr. Jacob Harpaz is the Chairman of the Board of the IMC Group.\nSee also\n*Economy of Israel\n*Science and technology in Israel\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.iscar.com/ ISCAR Global Companies]"
