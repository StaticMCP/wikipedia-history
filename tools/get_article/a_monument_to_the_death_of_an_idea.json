Rock and metal magazine Powerplay, dubbed it \"excellent stuff\" and \"a little bit of musical magic\". Classic Rock Magazine were equally impressed saying \"If you like your prog full of planet splitting drama...Enochian Theory are the band for you\".\nIn April 2007 the band signed a distribution deal with Plastic Head Media Distribution for the download single release of \"Namyamka\". This was released to rock and internet radio stations and was accompanied by a professionally shot promotional video for the song, which was made available for request on rock channels Kerrang! TV, Scuzz and Rockworld TV.\nReviews of the single were in the same vein as the EP's reviews, with comments such as \"Enochian Theory perform soaring, atmospheric, progressive, modern rock of the quality that seems to have been missing from the UK scene for many years\" from Rock3Music.com and \"Enochian Theory are about to explode and there's nothing we can do about it\" from Black Velvet.\nThe combination of the two releases lead to the band's first successful U.K tour, which was booked for them by SaN PR.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Ben Harris Hayes&nbsp;– Vocals and Keyboards\n* Shaun Rayment&nbsp;– Bass guitar\n* Sam Street&nbsp;– Drums and percussion\n* Scott Ware&nbsp;– Guitar\nReferences\n* [http://rockmidgets.com/releases.php?p=true&q=enochian+theory&id=2188 On-line review of Namyamka single]\n* [http://www.rock3music.com/rock-music-reviews/1726-enochian-theory-namyamka.html On-line review of Namyamka single]\n* [http://www.enochiantheory.co.uk Enochian Theory Website]\n* [https://www.myspace.com/enochiantheoryband Enochian Theory MySpace]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090228110039/http://www.anomalouszmusicrecords.co.uk/ Anomalousz music records website]\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006034711/http://www.enochiantheory.co.uk/frame.php?p=media&c=video Namyamka video clip]"
