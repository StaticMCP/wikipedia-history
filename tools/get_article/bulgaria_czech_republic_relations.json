Diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia were established on 27 September 1920, after ratification of Neuilly treaty. They were severed on 1 June 1939 and were restored on 10 October 1945. Interwar relations were deeply influenced by Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakian ally, but Bulgarian rival. Czechoslovakia had to balance between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important aspect of Bulgaria–Czechoslovakia relationship was trade. The Czechoslovakian interwar export to Bulgaria varied between 3% and 11% of the Bulgarian import. Otherwise it was about 0.5%. Czechoslovakian export was slowly forced out by Germany in the late thirties, but not as much as France or United Kingdom.\nOn 23 December 1992, Bulgaria recognised the Czech Republic and established diplomatic relations with it at the level of embassies as of 1 January 1993. In 2020, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic celebrated 100 years of diplomatic relations.[https://www.president.bg/news5224/bulgaria-and-the-czech-republic-will-deepen-their-cooperation-to-defend-common-stances-in-the-european-union.html?lang=en&skipMobile=1]\nBulgaria has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Prague.
