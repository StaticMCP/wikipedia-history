Though born to Ghanaian parents from Agona Odoben in the Central Region of Ghana, he is widely recognized in Togo due to his use of the Kotokoli (Tem) language in his music.\nEarly life and education\nKing Bala was born to Ghanaian parents in Agona Odoben, Central Region, Ghana. He began his schooling at Odoben Islamic School, but was later transferred by his father to Agona Nyakrom Holy Quran School to gain more Islamic knowledge and education. He excelled in both Islamic and English studies.\nKing Bala was also passionate about football and played for the Holy Quran School soccer team from primary to junior high school. Due to his dribbling skills, he earned the nickname \"Ortega\" and won several trophies with Nyakrom Holy Quran Primary and JHS.\nAs a child, he showed interest in music by gathering rubber materials and using sticks to play drums on the street while singing. During his youth, he worked as a trotro driver in Agona Odoben while pursuing music. His lyrics often reflect his roots; in his song Journey to the Moon, he raps: \"From Agona Odoben Zongo, we hit the street we digging for Gold.\"\nCareer\nKing Bala began releasing songs in Ghana, with his first track titled Wasilla. He later released other singles including Ghetto Life, This is My Life, and Felila.\nRelocation to Togo\nKing Bala moved to Togo to reach wider audiences who speak Kotokoli (Tem). This relocation helped him gain recognition as a Togolese artist, a title he has embraced.\nInterviews and media coverage\nHe has discussed his upbringing and career journey in interviews with Awesome Africa TV, TVT Togo, and Akanoyo TV.\nMusical style and influences\nKing Bala’s music is rooted in Kotokoli (Tem) language and culture, blended with Afrobeat, hiplife, and Afro-pop rhythms.
