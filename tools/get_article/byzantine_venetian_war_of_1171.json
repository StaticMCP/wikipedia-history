Despite Doge Michiel's apparent will to pursue a peaceful solution, outrage in Venice itself swung popular opinion in the favour of full scale war against Byzantium. Doge Michiel had no choice but to set out for war, which he did in mid-late 1171.\nBackground\nAlthough trade was very important for the Byzantine economy, political relations with Italian merchants soured at times. Local merchants also resented the Italian merchants advantageous terms of trade. Tensions rose in 1171; Manuel I ordered attacks on Venetian merchants, property and ships.\nCourse of the War\nAftermath\nThe disastrous defeat of Venice in this war was one of the greatest military blunders in the city-state's history, and permanently altered Venice's position on foreign affairs. A formal truce between the two empires would not be ratified until 1177, with minor skirmishes continuing until then.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nSee also\n*Byzantine–Venetian War (1296–1302)\n*Venetian–Genoese wars"
