Although his career was plagued by severe tarsal tunnel syndrome (a trapped nerve in his take off foot), he achieved relative success early in his track life.\nAfter winning a silver medal at the European Junior Championships in Birmingham in 1987, he went on to represent Great Britain at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, where he just missed reaching the final. The following year he established himself as No. 6 in the Track and Field News IAAF Long Jump World Merit rankings. He represented England in the long jump event, at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand.\nHe was a five-times British long jump champion after winning the British AAA Championships title at the 1988 AAA Championships,1989 AAA Championships and 1990 AAA Championships, and UK Athletics Championships in 1987 and 1992.\nDespite the premature end to his international career, Faulkner was described as an exceptional and precocious talent and still holds national records in the junior indoor and under-23 indoor categories.\nReferences"
