All presidents so far speak English and Russian. Václav Klaus is the president who is proficient in the most languages.\nVáclav Havel\nVáclav Havel spoke some English and used it repeatedly during his tenure as president as he was reading several speeches in English. Havel most notably used his English when he gave a speech to a Joint session of the United States Congress on 21 February 1990, which he started in English but continued in Czech after a few sentences, and the speech was translated by Michael Žantovský, then spokesman of Občanské fórum. Žantovský later jokingly claimed that Havel made his famous speech only to him and it was him, Žantovský, who actually spoke to US Congress. Havel also knew Russian, which he learned at school.\nVáclav Klaus\nVáclav Klaus is fluent in English, Russian, German, French and Italian. He published a number of publications in English and German languages. Klaus stated that his proficiency with foreign languages was helped by studies of international trade at the Prague University of Economics and Business, where he was required to learn at least three foreign languages.\nMiloš Zeman\nMiloš Zeman speaks some English, Russian, and German. He used English and Russian during his tenure while talking to foreign politicians.\nPetr Pavel\nPetr Pavel is fluent in English, Russian, and French. Pavel reportedly has known English well since his youth, which helped his career in the army as only few people there knew the language. Pavel learned French during an intelligence course in 1988–89.\nSee also\n*List of rulers of Czechs\n*List of presidents of Czechoslovakia\n*List of prime ministers of Czechoslovakia\n*List of prime ministers of the Czech Socialist Republic\n*List of rulers of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia\n*List of prime ministers of the Czech Republic\n*Lists of incumbents\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081220003426/http://www.hrad.cz/en/ustava_cr/index.shtml The Czech constitution.] Articles 54-66 are particularly relevant to the presidency.\n*[http://www.hrad.cz/en/ The official site of Prague Castle]"
