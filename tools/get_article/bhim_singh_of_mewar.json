He was the second son of Maharana Ari Singh II and younger brother of his predecessor Maharana Hamir Singh II.\nAt ten years of age Maharana Bhim Singh succeeded his brother Maharana Hamir Singh II who had untimely died at the age of 16 from a wound when a rifle burst in his hand. Maharana Hamir Singh II had ruled an unstable state with an empty treasury under a regency by Maharaj Bagh Singh and Arjun Singh his grand-uncles and widowed mother Jhaliji Sardar Kanwarji.Maharana Bhim Singh inherited this unstable state after its unpaid Maratha soldiers had looted Mewar's former capital Chittor. The soldiers' depredations continued and more territory was lost during Bhim Singh's rule. Another significant event in his reign was his daughter Krishna Kumari had died by drinking poison at the age of 16 to save his dynasty and prevent a massive civil war among the rajput houses of Rajputana in 1810.\nMaharana Bhim Singh was unable to lead his house of Mewar as a political power in Rajputana unlike his illustrious and effectual ancestors. Mewar had once been considered the strongest Rajput house because of its lengthy resistance to the foreign emperors but by 13 January 1818, Maharana Bhim Singh had to sign a treaty with the British East India Company accepting their protection.\nOn the birth of his heir Yuvraj Amar Singh by his queen Rathorji Gulab Kanwarji, Bhim Singh along with his nobles travelled on foot to visit the Eklingji temple where he had an inscription engraved in the temple promulgating orders to abolish certain taxes from Charanas and Brahmins.\nUpon his death in the year 1828, his four queens and four concubines committed sati as the prevalent Rajput tradition dictated.\nNotes\nReferences"
