It was produced by J. R. Rotem. The song was co-written by Kingston, Rotem, Evan \"Kidd\" Bogart, Rock City, and Eric Bluebaum. The song is about Kingston taking his girlfriend on a date to the West Indies, particularly his native Jamaica. As he told noted UK urban writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul in June 2007: \"In 'Take You There' I'm basically telling a girl 'Let me take you to where I'm from - to Jamaica, to the paradise and to the slums!'. Because, while many people just think of the tropical beaches, there is definitely another, rugged side to the island too!\" The song was originally supposed to be Kingston's debut single in early May of 2007, but \"Beautiful Girls\" became his debut single on May 26, 2007.\nOn the issue date of November 17, 2007, the single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 81 and eventually peaked at number 7.\nMusic video\nThe video (directed Gil Green) was shot in Miami, and features cameos by Rick Ross, J. R. Rotem, DJ Khaled and Gunplay. Kingston's girlfriend is played by fashion model Kirby Griffin. In the music video version, \"sip piña coladas\" is censored because of the reference to alcohol, while left intact on radio stations.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Charts (2007–2008)\n!align=\"center\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Romania (Romanian Top 100)\n|align=\"center\"|73\n|-\n| Russia Airplay (TopHit)\n|align=\"center\"| 28\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Charts (2008)\n!Position\n|-\n|Canada (Canadian Hot 100)\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 41\n|-\n| CIS (Tophit)\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 78\n|-\n| Russia Airplay (TopHit)\n| style=\"text-align:center\"| 87\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 34\n|-\n|US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard)\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 31\n|-\n|US Rhythmic (Billboard)\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 36\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
