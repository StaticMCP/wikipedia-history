The award recognises significant, long lasting and innovative architecture with usually more than 25 years passed since the completion of construction.\nBackground\nThe Award recognises achievement for the design of buildings of outstanding merit, which have remained important as high quality works of architecture when considered in contemporary cultural, social, economic and environmental contexts in the state of Western Australia. Nominations for the award can be made by AIA members, non–members and non–architects, but they must provide adequate material and information supporting the nomination for consideration of the jury. The Award also provides opportunity to recognise buildings that were not previously submitted into annual AIA awards programs.\nThe average age of the 11 projects recognised between 2015 and 2025 is 51.1 years from completion of construction to year of award.\nNaming of award\nThe inaugural award presented in 2015 was known as the Enduring Architecture Award in line with other states. In 2016 it became a 'named award' in recognition of 19th century colonial architect Richard Roach Jewell.\nNational Award winners\nRecipients of the state–based award are eligible for consideration for the National Award for Enduring Architecture presented later in the same year, as part of the Australian National Architecture Awards.\nOnly one project located in Western Australia has won the national award. In 2015 the restored Council House won both the state and national award, 52 years after the building was completed in 1963.\nMultiple Award winners\nTwo Perth based firms, Howlett and Bailey Architects and Cameron Chisholm Nicol have both won the award on two occasions.\nAward recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Richard Roach Jewell Award for Enduring Architecture (reverse order)\n|-\n!
