After a 2008 referendum, Kosovo declared Independence on 17 February 2008. Despite this, Serbia still refuses to recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state, disapproving of the nation's partial international recognition as an independent state, a stance backed by Russia, India and China, among others. After the controversy, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on 22 July 2010 that Kosovo’s independence was not in violation of international law.\nSee also\n*Statehood Day (Serbia)\n*Independence Day (Albania)\n*International recognition of Kosovo\nReferences"
