It was built in 1877, and is a three-story, Second Empire style frame dwelling with a two-story rear wing.  It features a steeply pitched mansard roof with segmental arch dormers and a front porch with decorative brackets.  The house was renovated about 1900, and some Colonial Revival style design elements were added to the interior. The house was sold to the State of New York in 1898, and has been used for various purposes by the State University of New York at Brockport and its predecessors.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.\nReferences"
