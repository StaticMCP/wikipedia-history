The committee is a \"General Purpose Standing Committee\" governed by Standing Order 215. It consists of nine members, five government members and four non-government members (three members of the official opposition and one member of the crossbench). The chair is appointed by the Prime Minister and the deputy chair by the Leader of the Opposition under Standing Order 232.\nHistory\nWhile General Purpose Standing Committees of the House of Representatives were first established in 1987, Agriculture or Primary Industries were not explicitly called out until the amendment of Standing order 28B following the election of the Howard Government in 1996. The committee has been regularly renamed since; some recent names include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Committee Name\n! Parliament(s)\n!
