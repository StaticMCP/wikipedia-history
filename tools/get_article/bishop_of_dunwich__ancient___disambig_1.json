The title takes its name after Dunwich in the English county of Suffolk. Previously a significant port, this town has now largely been lost to the sea.\nIn about 630 or 631 a diocese was established by St. Felix for the Kingdom of the East Angles, with his episcopal seat initially, briefly established at Soham before being transferred to Dunwich on the Suffolk coast.  There is a possibility the unidentified Dommoc may be Dunwich, but this is yet to be proved.  In 672 the diocese was divided into the sees of Dunwich and Elmham by St. Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThe line of bishops of Dunwich continued until it was interrupted by the Danish Viking invasions in the late ninth and early tenth centuries.  By the mid 950s the sees of Dunwich and Elmham were reunited under one bishop, with the episcopal see at Elmham.\nList of bishops\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of the East Angles (purportedly established at Soham)\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | c.630\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | c.630\n| Felix of Burgundy\n| Also known as St Felix\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of the East Angles (established at Dunwich or translated from Soham)\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 630 x 631\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 647 x 648\n| Felix of Burgundy\n| Also known as St Felix.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 647 x 648\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 652 x 653\n| Thomas\n| Deacon.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 652 x 653\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 669 x 670\n| Brigilsus\n| Also recorded as Beorhtgils, Berhtgils, and Boniface (Bonifatius).\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 669 x 670\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 672\n| Bifus\n| Resigned in 672; also recorded as Bisi.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| colspan=\"4\" | In 672, the diocese was divided into the sees of Dunwich and Elmham\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of Dunwich\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB;\" | From\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB;\" | Until\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB;\" | Incumbent\n! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB;\" | Notes.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 672 x ?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | ?\n| Acca\n| Also recorded as Æcce and Æcci.\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | ?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | ?\n| Ascwulf\n|\n|- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | ?

The earlier 2nd edition mentioned two others: Alric, probably bishop of Dunwich and Husa, bishop of Dunwich or Elmham. These two are no longer considered to have been bishops and as such are not listed in the 3rd edition.\nReferences\nExternal links"
