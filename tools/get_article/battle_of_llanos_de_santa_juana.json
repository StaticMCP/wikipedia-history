The battle was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire. The Mexican insurgents were commanded by General José Calixto Martínez y Moreno and the Spanish by Colonel Manuel del Río. The battle resulted in a victory for the Spanish royalists.\nThe battle\nThe insurgents, commanded by General José Calixto Martínez y Moreno (also known as Cadenas), were routed by the royalist forces of Manuel del Rio. The rebel forces suffered 300 soldiers killed out of 1,000, the majority of these being local villagers who were armed, but not generally trained to fight.\nAftermath\nAlmost immediately following this defeat, however, on 16 July 1811, the rebel forces operating in Colima, under the command of Ignacio Sandoval and Miguel Gallaga, were able to seize the state for the rebel cause, making the loss at Llanos de Santa Juana of less tactical importance.\nSee also\n* Mexican War of Independence\nReferences\n* The information on this page has been translated from its Spanish equivalent.\nBibliography\n*"
