The band released two full-length albums. The first album, titled Peach, was released in 2016 on 6131 Records. In 2018, Culture Abuse signed to Epitaph Records and released their second full-length album titled Bay Dream. That year, the band added drummer Anaiah Lei.\nBesides their music, the band is notable for their lead singer, David Kelling, having cerebral palsy. Kelling sought to fight the media narrative of \"a normal human, then you have a disabled person\" and show parents that \"their kid can be a hero too\".\nCulture Abuse disbanded as of July 2020 after lead singer David Kelling admitted to sexual misconduct allegations.\nIn 2021, their song \"So Busted\" was featured at the end of The Suicide Squad.\nAfter Culture Abuse's breakup, drummer Anaiah Lei focused on his project Zulu, which became a full-lineup band. However, Zulu parted ways with him and ultimately went inactive in 2025 after Anaiah was accused of domestic violence and abuse.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n*Peach (2016, 6131 Records)\n*Bay Dream (2018, Epitaph Records)\nReferences"
