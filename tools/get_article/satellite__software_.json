It allows system administrators to deploy and manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) hosts.\nA Satellite server registers with Red Hat Subscription Management, mirrors all relevant software like security errata and bug fixes, and provides this together with locally added software and configuration to the attached servers.\nThe managed hosts register against the local Satellite server and access the provided resources like software packages, patches, configuration, etc. while they also provide information about the current health state of the server to the Satellite\nAs of March 2017:\n* The latest version is Red Hat Satellite 6, based on Foreman. This article focuses on Red Hat Satellite 6\n* The previous version was Red Hat Satellite 5. Based on Spacewalk, it is still in widespread use despite being in the sunset of its lifecycle\nArchitecture\nSource:\nRed Hat Satellite Server\nThe Red Hat Satellite Server enables planning and management of the content life cycle and the configuration of Capsule Servers and hosts through GUI, CLI (Hammer), or API (RESTful API).\nCapsule Servers\nCapsule Servers mirror content from the Satellite Server to establish content sources in different geographical locations, they are analogous to the Red Hat Satellite 5 Proxy Server.\nManaged Client Systems\nAs well as Supported Managed Hosts  Red Hat Satellite 6 also has some deployment and management capability on certain other hosts though Red Hat Support for these will be limited.\nConnection to Red Hat Customer Portal and External Content Sources\nSatellite generally operates in \"connected\" mode, registering directly with the RHN and downloading relevant software into Satellite's software channels. The organisation's hosts then register against the local Satellite server, instead of directly against Red Hat Network.\nFor secure deployments, Satellite can operate in a \"Disconnected\" mode, where updates are downloaded directly from Red Hat via an Internet connected machine and then uploaded into Satellite or a local offline RHN proxy.\nBoth modes allow the organisation to control which versions of software it makes available for its hosts, as well as making additional software available within the local network.\nRed Hat Satellite 6 components\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=left|Component\n!align=left|Details\n|-\n|align=left|The Foreman\n|align=left|Provision and Life Cycle Management of physical and virtual systems\n|-\n|align=left|Katello\n|align=left|Foreman Plug-in for Subscription and Repository Management\n|-\n|align=left|Candlepin\n|align=left|Service in Katello to handle subscription management\n|-\n|align=left|Pulp\n|align=left|Service in Katello to handle repository and content management\n|-\n|align=left|Hammer\n|align=left|CLI tool providing command line and shell equivalents of most WEB UI functions\n|-\n|align=left|REST API\n|align=left|RESTful API service for System Administrators and Developers to write custom scripts and third party interface applications\n|-\n|align=left|Apache Tomcat\n|align=left|Embedded Tomcat server for Web UI and API service connections\n|-\n|align=left|Puppet\n|align=left|A Puppet Master server installed as part of a Red Hat Satellite 6 Master Server or Capsule server\n|-\n|align=left|Hiera\n|align=left|A Key-Value database that is part of Puppet and helps keep site specific data out of manifests\n|}\nMajor modules\nSource:\nProvision\nSatellite offers numerous methods for deploying hosts, including simple kickstart, bare metal install and re-imaging. Current versions of Satellite support kickstart using Cobbler as an underlying framework. PXE Boot, and Koan are methods that can be used to implement bare metal installs and re-imaging of hosts.\nManage\nSatellite assists in remotely managing hosts in several areas: software, operational management, and configuration. The 3 main mechanisms for managing hosts are:\n* Software Channel\n* Configuration Channels\n* Activation Keys\nMonitor\nSatellite can provide monitoring of software and systems via probes. These probes periodically explore the target host and send alerts if the probes do not get the correct replies, or if the replies fall outside of some specified range.\nHistory and Lifecycle\nA primary purpose of earlier versions of Satellite was to  allow organizations to utilize the benefits of Red Hat Network (RHN) without having to provide public Internet access to their servers or other client systems.  Later version of the tool have developed increased functionality.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Satelliteversion !! Release date !! End of Full Support !! Last minor !!

When viewed in August 2019, Red Hat didn't indicate any date for end of support.\nRed Hat Satellite 5\nFor Red Hat Satellite version 5 the Satellite Application was implemented by a toolset named Project Spacewalk.\nRed Hat announced in June 2008 Project Spacewalk was to be made open source under the GPLv2 License\nSatellite 5.3 was the first version to be based on upstream Spacewalk code.\nIn the Spacewalk FAQ issued in 2015 after the release of Red Hat Satellite 6:\n* Red Hat formally released Spacewalk as open source(GPLv2) in June 2008.\n* Red Hat would continue to sponsor and support Spacewalk as the upstream Red Hat Satellite 5. however that participation is anticipated to diminish as Red Hat Satellite 5 enters the final phases of its lifecycle.  Spacewalk is not and can never be upstream for Red Hat Satellite 6 released in September 2014.  due to it being a ground up rebuild with a different toolset.\nFuture of Red Hat Satellite 5\nThe Lifecycle of Red Hat Satellite 5 is recorded at the Red Hat Satellite and Proxy Server Life Cycle which is updated as required, with future events on a bona fide basis.  When viewed in March 2017 Red Hat indicated:\n* Red Hat Satellite 5 is in the final Production 3 phase.\n* The current releases, 5.6 and 5.7, would remain supported through January 2019.\n* A further minor release 5.8 will be the only release supported in a supplementary Extended Life Phase from February 2019 through to EOL in May 2020.\nSatellite minor release 5.8 is in available in beta.\nSee also\n* Landscape (software)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/#knowledge Red Hat Satellite Information Knowledge]\n*[https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/ Redhat Satellite Product Documentation]\n*[https://access.redhat.com/articles/1365633 Red Hat Satellite Release Dates]\n*[https://www.redhat.com/red_hat_network/ RHN]\n*[https://www.theforeman.org/ The Foreman - official website]"
