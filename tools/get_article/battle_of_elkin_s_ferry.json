During the Camden expedition, Federal forces had to ford the Little Missouri River because all of the bridges were impassable.\nBattle\nWith all the bridges across the river destroyed, Steele ordered Brigadier-General Frederick Salomon, commanding the Third Division, to take and hold a ford known as Elkin's Ferry on the afternoon of April 2, 1864.  The 43rd Indiana was tasked with this objective, supported by elements of the 36th Iowa Infantry and the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery.  Following a forced march, the 43rd arrived at the crossing after dark that evening, crossed the river, and set up defensive positions while awaiting the rest of Steele's army.\nOpposing the Federal advance was a division of three cavalry brigades under Marmaduke&mdash;about 7500 troopers altogether.  Marmaduke ordered Brigadier-General Joseph Shelby to attack the 43rd and take back the ford.  Federal Colonel William McLean states what happened next:\nAftermath\nLosses on both sides in the Battle of Elkin's Ferry were light, with 18 Confederate soldiers killed and 50 wounded, and with 30 Union soldiers wounded. On the evening of April 4, Shelby's brigade joined Marmaduke, and together they withdrew 16 miles south to Prairie D'Ane the following morning.\nBattlefield preservation\nThe American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 442 acres at the Elkin's Ferry Battlefield.\nSee also\n*List of American Civil War battles\n*Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1864\nNotes\nReferences\n* McLean, William E., Forty-Third Regiment Indiana Volunteers: An Historic Sketch of Its Career and Services (Terre Haute, C.W.
