The station was originally built by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) for use by the Royal Air Force (RAF). Like other RAF schools in Canada, it was subject to RCAF administrative and operational control.\nHistory\nNo. 31 Service Flying Training School (SFTS) was the first British Service Flying Training school to be established in Canada and the first flying training school at Kingston. The school was originally No. 7 Service Flying School based in Peterborough, England.   Its main purpose was to train pilots for the Fleet Air Arm, but in the beginning the school's first students were British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) trainees selected for service with the RCAF and RAF. Naval trainees, however, made up the majority of the trainees by the end of December 1940. Pilots were trained on Fairey Battles, which were shipped from England, and later, Harvards.\nIn 1942, the school formally became part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. In 1944 No. 31 SFTS was merged with the RCAF's No. 14 SFTS when this school was transferred to Kingston from RCAF Station Aylmer. Aircraft used by No. 14 SFTS included Harvards, Yales and Ansons. No. 14 SFTS closed down in September 1945. Relief landing fields were located at Gananoque and Sandhurst, Ontario.\nThe aerodrome has been improved over the years and is now the Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport.\nAerodrome information\nThe airfield was constructed in a typical BCATP wartime pattern, with six runways formed in an overlaid triangle.\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed at  with a Var. 14 degrees W and elevation of .  Six runways were listed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Runway Name\n! Length\n! Width\n!
