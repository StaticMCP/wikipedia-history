It is one of two stations that were added to the line when it was upgraded prior to being reopened as the Johnsonville Branch. It is one of four stations on the line located on a curve.\nElectric multiple unit trains are operated under the Metlink brand through this station in both directions to Johnsonville (to the north) and Wellington (to the south).\nHistory\nAs part of the upgrade of the section of the old Wellington and Manawatu Railway between Wellington and Johnsonville, two new stations were constructed, Awarua Street and Simla Crescent. The newly electrified Johnsonville Branch officially opened on 2 July 1938, with services to all stations from Monday 4 July. The two new stations had been used by some steam trains from 10 January 1938.\nOver the summer of 2008/09, the platform of the station was entirely demolished to be replaced by a brand new platform that could accommodate six carriages, as opposed to four. The replaced platform is twice the length of the old platform.\nServices\nTrains run in both directions through this station, departing at half-hourly intervals, supplemented by a 13/13/26 schedule at peak times on week days.\nThe closest bus route is #26, which passes by the end of Awarua Street along Ottawa Road.\nFile:Awarua Street railway station 01.JPG|Pedestrian access from Awarua Street\nFile:Awarua Street railway station 02.JPG|Rail overbridge at the southern end of the station\nFile:Awarua street station upgrade.JPG|Awarua Street Station is entirely overhauled during maintenance to extend the platform to six carriage length, as seen from the northern end of the station\nFacilities\nThe station has a single side platform and passenger shelter.  Pedestrian access to the station is via a walkway from Awarua Street near the rail bridge over Awarua Street, or from a long flight of steps down from Fox Street to the north end of the platform.  There is no dedicated station car park available.\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n* Train timetables from [https://www.metlink.org.nz/#timetables Metlink].\n*"
