He served with the China Inland Mission from 1896 to 1900, when he returned to England with his two children after his wife and youngest daughter died during their flight from the Boxer Rebellion.\nHis memoir A Thousand Miles of Miracle in China was published in 1904 and was widely read in the United States. It went through 22 printings  and, according to Andrew T. Kaiser, \"colored and even defined the Boxer events for generations of Western readers.\"\nBibliography\n*\n* Pat Barr, To China with Love: The Lives and Times of Protestant Missionaries in China, 1860-1900 (1972)\n* A.
