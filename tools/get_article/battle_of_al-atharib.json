Zengi invaded and raided the territories of Antioch; in the Spring of 1130, he laid siege to al-Atharib.\nWhen the Franks and King Baldwin, who was in command of a Latin army, advanced to relieve the city, the officers of Zengi advised him to retreat; however, Baldwin scorned their advice. A battle followed and Zengi emerged victorious. After conquering the citadel of al-Atharib, Zengi destroyed it and razed it to the ground.\nZengi then advanced on the fortress of Harim but its inhabitants persuaded him to abandon his siege in return for half of the districts revenues. A truce was concluded and Zengi returned to his territories.\nReferences"
