The game received mixed reviews upon release, with praise for its large sprite graphics but criticism towards its gameplay.\nThe game was ported to mobile phones and the Hudson Channel for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Japan with redone graphics, audio, and gameplay. The PC Engine version was also released for the Wii's, Nintendo 3DS's, and Wii U's Virtual Console and on the Japanese PlayStation Store.\nPlot\nA Chinese martial artist named , whose style resembles that of Bruce Lee, embarks on a mission to bring down opposing enemies and the Dark Emperor, who stands atop the castle  in China.\nGameplay\nThe object of the game is to walk through each stage while throwing punches and kicks at enemies and objects, which also can be done in midair. There are four levels which are broken down into three stages each, for a total of twelve stages. When Wang gets knocked out, the game starts over at the beginning of the stage in which he got knocked out. Players can memorize the object/enemy pattern in order to get through the stage more easily whenever Wang gets knocked out. At the end of each level, there is a boss fight.\nThe gameplay and controls are similar to Irem's arcade game Kung-Fu Master (1984), with gameplay also similar to Taito's Gladiator (1986) without the sword or shield held in hand. 76%\n| EGM = 4/10, 4/10, 5/10, 5/10\n| EuroG = 1/10\n| GI = 3.5/10\n| GSpot = 1.5/10\n| IGN = 1.5/10\n| NLife = 2/10\n| TGM = 63%\n| rev1 = Game Zone\n| rev1Score = 3/5\n| rev2 =\n| rev2Score = 45%\n| rev3 = Power Play\n| rev3Score = 67/100|issue=7|publisher=Markt & Technik|date=October 1988|pages=54–55|language=de}}|issue=8|publisher=Markt & Technik|date=November 1988|page=10|language=de}}\n}}\nChina Warrior received a 16.68/30 score in a 1993 readers' poll conducted by PC Engine Fan, ranking among PC Engine titles at the number 474 spot. The game garnered generally unfavorable reviews from critics.\nComputer and Video Games reviewed Drunken Master for the PC Engine, giving it a 58% score. They praised the \"giant-sized sprites\" as \"very impressive on this horizontally scrolling kung-fu game\" but said \"only three moves result in the game becoming ultimately dull\". Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized its simple gameplay and Bruceploitation but praised for the large character sprites.\nUpon its release for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, IGN denounced the game for its overly limiting gameplay, forcing the player to constantly move right. In addition, while the graphical advancements of the game were prominent, many felt that they were not substantial enough to pardon the game's critical flaws. In the game's review for Wii's Virtual Console, IGN and GameSpot gave the game an abysmal review, citing bad graphics and repetitive gameplay, among other things. The game was also featured in 1UPs \"Broken Pixels\", a show dedicated to mocking bad video games. Michael Plasket of Hardcore Gaming 101 said it is \"probably best treated as little more than a tech demo for the potential of the TurboGrafx-16 instead of a legitimately entertaining game\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080325101030/http://www.hudson.co.jp/mobile/imode/iapp/pce/kangfu.html Official mobile phone version's webpage (archived 2008)] from Hudson"
