It ended in 2022.\nThe Parents' Choice Awards were established in 1978 by Diana Huss Green, who was then the president of the Parents' Choice Foundation. The mission was to provide guidance to parents on children’s books and toys. The award recipients were determined by a committee of educators, scientists, performing artists, librarians, parents and children. One of six award commendations were given to award winners: Classic, Gold, Silver, Recommended, Approved or \"Fun Stuff.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.parents-choice.org/ Parents' Choice Foundation]\n\n---\n\n## Parents’ Choice Award\n\n#REDIRECT Parents' Choice Award"
