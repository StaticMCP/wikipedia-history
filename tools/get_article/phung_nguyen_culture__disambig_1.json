It was during this period that rice cultivation was introduced into the Red River region by northern Dai people. The first Phùng Nguyên culture excavation was in 1959, known as Co Nhue. The sites of Phùng Nguyên culture are usually several meters higher than the surrounding terrain and near rivers or streams. The most typical artifacts are pediform adzes of polished stone.\nGallery\nFile:Phung Nguyen Culture Pottery.jpg|Phùng Nguyên culture pots\nFile:Phung Nguyen Culture Tripod Pottery Pot.jpg|Phùng Nguyên culture tripod pot\nFile:Phung Nguyen Culture Pots and Cooking Pots.jpg|Phùng Nguyên culture pots, 3,500-4,000 years B.P.\nFile:Phung Nguyen Culture Stone Spear.jpg|Phùng Nguyên stone spear\nSee also\n*Mán Bạc\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Phung Nguyen culture\n\n#REDIRECT Phùng Nguyên culture"
