The Daily Times of Nigeria later reported that the album would be released in September 2014. Alade collaborated with producers such as Selebobo, Sizzle Pro, Shady Bizniz, Philkeyz, Young D, GospelOnDeBeatz, DIL, OJB Jezreel, Mr Chidoo, Fliptyce, EL Mcee and Beat Nation. The album features guest appearances and skits from Bovi, R2Bees, Phyno, Chidinma, DIL, Selebobo and Diamond Platnumz. Alade promoted the album by touring several African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. The album's deluxe edition was released in November 2014 and contains French renditions of songs originally performed in English. Its cover art was unveiled on 21 October 2014. According to the music platform A Nation of Billions, King of Queens sold over 100,000 copies.\nThe Selebobo-produced track \"Johnny\", which was released on 14 October 2013, serves as the album's lead single. The music video for the song was uploaded to Alade's Vevo channel on 3 March 2014. It was filmed in Ogun State by Clarence Peters and features cameo appearances from Bovi, Alexx Ekubo and Beverly Osu. The French version of \"Johnny\" debuted on May 20, 2014 and appeared as a bonus track on the album. At the time of the song's release, Alade became the first Nigerian artist to release a song performed entirely in French.\nOn 14 April 2014, Alade released the album's second single \"Tangerine\", which was also produced by Selebobo. The song's music video was also filmed by Peters and uploaded to Vevo on 8 July 2014. Prior to releasing the video, Effyzzie Music Group unveiled footage from the video shoot. The album's third single, \"Kissing\", was released on 10 September 2014. It was produced by Fliptyce and is considered a groovy mid-tempo love song. On 16 October 2014, Effyzzie Music Group released the music video for \"Kissing\", which was directed by Sesan in London.\n\"Taking Over Me\" was released as the album's fourth single. Its music video was directed by Justin Campos and Taiye Aliyu. On 13 March 2015, Alade released the album's fifth single \"Temperature\", which features vocals by British-Nigerian singer DIL. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Ovié Étseyatsé. \"Duro Timi\" was released as the album's sixth single; its music video was recorded in London by Ova.\nComposition\nKing of Queens is a mixture of Afropop, reggae and R&B. In the slow-tempo reggae track \"Why\", Alade explores her versatility and infuses her personality on the record \"Pose\". \"Duro Timi\" is an R&B song with a pop undertone. In the slow cuddle song \"Catch You\", Alade creates sexual rhythm and raps towards the end. \"Money\" is a reincarnation of \"Johnny\". Hausa vibes are included on \"I Like\". \"Sugar\" is an electro pop song, while \"Fall in Love\" is a ballad that pays tribute to R&B of the 1980s.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = TooXclusive\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nKing of Queens received generally mixed reviews from music critics.
