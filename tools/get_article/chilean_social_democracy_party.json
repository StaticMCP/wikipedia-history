The congress declared that the Radicals discard bourgeois democracy as an instrument of capitalist domination and the Radical Party is now a socialist party, that subscribes to class struggle and historical materialism. Disquieted by the Marxist influence, on 3 August, the Senators Bossay, Baltra, Acuña, Juliet and Aguirre and deputies Ibáñez, Magalhaes, Naudón, Basso, Clavel, Sharpe and Muñoz Barra left the Radical Party. They founded a new party of radicals with more moderate political views, though paradoxically called Partido Izquierda Radical – Party of Radical Left. The new party initially remained part of the Unidad Popular.\nIn March 1972, Allende and the Christian Democrats tried to forge a compromise. The Radical Left Party represented the UP coalition in negotiations. The radical minister of justice Manuel Sanhueza held talks with the Christian Democratic Party over regulations of nationalized firms, but ultimately failed, as the socialist minister of economy Pedro Vuskovic boycotted the negotiations and carried out legally dubious expropriations. As a result, the Radical Left quit the UP coalition.\nThe party then participated in the 1973 election within the centre-right opposition bloc CODE. In 1983, it was a founder of the Democratic Alliance. The party split in 1988. One faction called for a Yes vote on the referendum (for Pinochet), and formed a new ephemeral Chilean Social Democrat Party that soon merged with the Progressive Union of the Centrist Centre. The other faction called for a No vote and joined the opposition cartel Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia, and eventually merged with the Radical Party to form the Social Democrat Radical Party.\nPresidential candidates\nThe following is a list of the presidential candidates supported by the Party of Social Democracy.
