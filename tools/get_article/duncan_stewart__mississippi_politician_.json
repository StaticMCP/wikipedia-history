He holds the very rare distinction of having served three separate states state legislatures over his life, in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi.\nEarly life\nDuncan Stewart was born January 16, 1761. He was the son of William Stewart, a Scottish immigrant. His mother was Janet Stewart, née McDougal. He was a 14th generation descendant of Robert the Bruce.\nDuring the American Revolution, Stewart entered the Continental Army as a private, eventually being promoted to the rank of colonel of North Carolina troops.\nStewart was married to Penelope Jones. Their children were, William, who died in infancy; Tignal J. (1800-1855), a member of the Mississippi Legislature who married Sarah, a daughter of Judge Peter Randolph; James A. (1811-1883), who married Juliana, another daughter of Judge Randolph; Charles Duncan (1812/3-1886), a planter who married a daughter of U. S. Senator John Black; Catherine (1804-1829), who married Judge Harry Cage; and Eliza (died 1870), who married Colonel W. S. Hamilton and was the mother of State Senator Jones S. Hamilton.\nPolitical career\nIn the early 1790s he represented Bladen County, North Carolina in the North Carolina General Assembly. From 1790 to 1792 he represented Bladen County in the House of Commons (then the name of the state House of Representatives), and in the State Senate from 1793 to 1794.\nAfter he moved to Tennessee, he served as Tennessee state senator for the fourth, fifth, and sixth General Assemblies. He represented Montgomery and Robertson Counties fourth and fifth General Assemblies, and  he represented Montgomery, Robertson, Dickson, and Stewart Counties in the sixth General Assembly. Stewart County was carved out from the western part of Montgomery County, and is named after him. It was formed on November 3, 1803.\nIn 1811, he moved to Woodville, Mississippi where he began cotton farming. After Mississippi achieved statehood, he was elected both as a Mississippi state senator and as the inaugural Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi. He was elected President Pro Tempore of the Mississippi Senate. Alongside Governor David Holmes, Stewart served as Lieutenant Governor from October 7, 1817, to January 5, 1820.\nIn 1812, he had Holly Grove built.\nDeath\nDuncan Stewart died on November 26, 1820, at his plantation home, and was buried next to his twin brother James. The two are buried at the Stewart Two cemetery with four other people out in the woods in southern Mississippi.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* North Carolina, Marriage Bonds, 1741-1868\n* North Carolina, 1780-1781: being a history of the invasion of the Carolinas by the British Army under Lord Cornwallis in 1780\n* Colonial State Records, North Carolina, Vol 21, p193-195, V22, p36, 465\n* Stewart Clan Magazine, Page: Tome G, Vol. 34, No. 7 (Jan 1957), p.&nbsp;184"
