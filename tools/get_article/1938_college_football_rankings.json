Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, did not itself bestow a national championship.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nChampions (by ranking)\nThe AP Poll and three other major rankings consider TCU as the season's champion. Eight major rankings consider Tennessee the season's champion. The Dickinson System considers Notre Dame the season's champion:\n*AP poll: TCU\n*Berryman QPRS: Tennessee\n*Billingsley Report: Tennessee\n*Boand System: Tennessee\n*College Football Researchers Association: Tennessee\n*Dickinson System: Notre Dame\n*Dunkel System: Tennessee\n*Helms Athletic Foundation: TCU\n*Houlgate System: Tennessee\n*Litkenhous Ratings: Tennessee\n*National Championship Foundation: TCU\n*Poling System: Tennessee\n*Sagarin Ratings Elo chess method: Tennessee\n*Sagarin Ratings Predictor method: Tennessee\n*Williamson System: TCU\nNote: AP poll, Boand System, Dickinson System, Dunkel System, Houlgate System, Litkenhous Ratings, Poling System, and Williamson System were given contemporarily. All other methods were given retroactively.\nAP Poll\nThe scheduled final AP Poll was released on November 29, with Notre Dame No. 1, prior to their season-end game against Southern California.\nThe poll was extended for one week due to the \"select quality of last Saturday's games, three of which had a direct bearing on the ranking\".\nThe revised final AP Poll was released on December
