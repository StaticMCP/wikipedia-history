This expedition began on 1 December 2009 when the Expedition 21 crew departed. For a period of three weeks, there were only two crew members; it was the first time that had occurred since STS-114. Commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Maksim Surayev were joined by the rest of their crew on 22 December 2009, making the Expedition 22 a crew of five.\nThe expedition had ended when Soyuz TMA-16 undocked on 18 March 2010, and was immediately followed by the start of Expedition 23.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First Part(1 – 22 December 2009)\n!Second Part(22 December 2009 – 18 March 2010)\n|-\n!Commander\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jeffrey N.
