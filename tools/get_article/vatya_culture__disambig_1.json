The culture developed from the Nagyrév culture with influences from the Kisapostag culture. It is primarily known for its fortified settlements, cremation burial sites, and bronze production. The Vatya culture was eventually succeeded by the Urnfield culture.\nSzázhalombatta-Földvár, situated along the Danube River in Hungary, was a significant fortified settlement of the Vatya culture, with occupation layers reaching up to 6 meters deep.\nfortified settlement site, Hungary|260x260px]]\nGenetic  profile\nGenetic analysis of six individuals from the Százhalombatta-Földvár and Erd sites revealed Y-DNA haplogroup I in one individual, with two others belonging to the derived clades I2a2a1 and I2a2a1a2a.
