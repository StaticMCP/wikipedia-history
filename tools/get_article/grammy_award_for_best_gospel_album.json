Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nThe Best Gospel Album award was one of the new categories created after a major overhaul of the Grammy Awards categories for 2012. This award combines recordings that were previously submitted for the Best Contemporary R&B Gospel Album, Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album and Best Traditional Gospel Album.\nThe Recording Academy decided to make a distinction between Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) and Gospel music after determining that there were \"two distinct wings to the gospel house: Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) and Urban or Soul Gospel. Additionally, it was determined that the word \"Gospel\" tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and not CCM. With this in mind, it was decided not only to rename each of the categories, but also the entire [genre] field. [It] was determined that album and songwriting categories are of highest importance; Gospel and CCM each now have one category for each\". As a result, the previous gospel album categories were combined into Best Gospel Album (for traditional or contemporary/R&B gospel music) and Best Contemporary Christian Music Album.\nRecipients\n.]]\n.]]\n.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"7%\" | Year\n! width=\"25%\" | Performing artist(s)\n! width=\"25%\" | Work\n! width=\"35%\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! width=\"5%\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2012\n| Kirk Franklin\n| Hello Fear\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2013\n| Lecrae\n| Gravity\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2014\n| Tye Tribbett\n| Greater Than (Live)\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2015\n| Erica Campbell\n| Help\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n| Israel & New Breed\n| Covered: Alive in Asia (Live Deluxe)\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2017\n| Kirk Franklin\n| Losing My Religion\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018\n| CeCe Winans\n| Let Them Fall In Love\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2019\n| Tori Kelly\n| Hiding Place\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020\n| Kirk Franklin\n| Long Live Love\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2021\n| PJ Morton\n| Gospel According to PJ: From the Songbook of PJ Morton\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n!2022\n| CeCe Winans\n| Believe for It\n|\n|\n|-\n!2023\n| Maverick City Music & Kirk Franklin\n| Kingdom Book One\n|\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|Tye Tribbett\n|All Things New: Live in Orlando\n|\n* Erica Campbell - I Love You\n* Tasha Cobbs Leonard - Hymns (Live)\n* Maverick City Music - The Maverick Way\n* Jonathan McReynolds - My Truth\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|CeCe Winans\n|More Than This\n|\n* Melvin Crispell III - Covered Vol. 1\n* Ricky Dillard - Choirmaster II (Live)\n* Kirk Franklin - ''Father's Day\n* Karen Clark Sheard - Still Karen\n|\n|-\n!2026\n|Winner TBA on 1 February 2026\n|\n|\n* Yolanda Adams - Sunny Days\n* Tasha Cobbs Leonard - Tasha\n* Tamela Mann - Live Breathe Fight\n* Tye Tribbett - Only On The Road (Live)\n* Darrell Walls & PJ Morton - Heart of Mine''\n|\n|}\n* Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\nSee also\n*Grammy Award for Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance\n*Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com/ Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
