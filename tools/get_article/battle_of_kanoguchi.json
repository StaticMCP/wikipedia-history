Nobuhide, who was the father of the famous Oda Nobunaga, ended in defeat, with the loss of two of his very close relatives. Following Nobuhide's defeat, Dōsan's name greatly spread throughout Japan.\nPeace was reached between the two clans when they made a deal for Nobunaga to marry Nōhime, Dōsan's daughter.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
