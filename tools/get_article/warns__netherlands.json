It is located in the municipality of Súdwest-Fryslân, Friesland. It had a population of around 720 in January 2017.\nWarns is best known for the Battle of Warns. In 1345, count William IV of Holland tried to invade Friesland. A battle took place at the Roode Klif (Red Cliff), a nine metre high clay ridge, on the former Zuiderzee (nowadays: IJsselmeer) where the invasion was stopped. Almost the entire army of Holland including count William were killed during the battle.\nHistory\nThe village was first mentioned in 1245 as Warlesle, and probably means \"settlement of the people of Wardilo (person)\". Warns is a stretched out village which developed on the higher clay ridge of Gaasterland in the middle ages. It is located near the former Zuiderzee (nowadays: IJsselmeer). Warns has two village centres: Warnser Noordburen and Warnser Zuidburen.\nWarns used to be both an agricultural community as well as a fishing village and has a rather large harbour for its size, and several commander's house.\nOn 26 September 1345, the Battle of Warns took place between Holland and Friesland. Count William IV of Holland had planned to attack Stavoren from the back, however its army was destroyed at the Roode Klif (Red Cliff). Since 1500, there is an annual remembrance of the battle at Warns on 26 September. The Sytzama Stins was an estate near Warns were a battle took place between the Vetkopers and Schieringers in the late 15th century.\nThe tower of the Dutch Reformed church dates from the 12th century and received its current spire in 1729. The current church was constructed in 1682. The Reformed Church was built in 1892. In 1999, it was put up for sale. A dozen villagers bought the former church and have transformed it into a multiple purpose cultural centre for the village.\nWarns was home to 252 people in 1840. Before 2011, the village was part of the Nijefurd municipality and before 1984 it belonged to Hemelumer Oldeferd municipality.\nGallery\nFile:Warns, het monument ter herdenking aan de slag bij Warns IMG 2286 2018-04-18 11.58.jpg|Memorial to the battle at Warns\nFile:Warns, het dorps- en cultuurhuis De Spylder in straatzicht IMG 2290 2018-04-18 12.18.jpg|Village house (De Spylder) in the street\nFile:Warns, de doopsgezinde kerk in straatzicht IMG 2302 2018-04-18 12.30.jpg|Reformed church in the street\nSee also\n*Battle of Warns\nReferences\nExternal links"
