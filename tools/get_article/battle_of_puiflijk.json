The latter, the Allies, consisted of troops from Great Britain and a French Armée des émigrés force under the Prince of Rohan. They were led by the British commander-in-chief, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany.\nThe Allies had fortified themselves in outposts behind the Oude Wetering canal and the dykes of the Maas and Waal rivers. On 18 October 1794, the French crossed the Maas from Teeffelen (near Lithoijen) to Alphen. On 19 October, they attacked the Coalition outposts in three locations: near Appeltern (Blauwe Sluis), Altforst and the Waal dyke near Druten (Puiflijk).\nAt Blauwe Sluis, Rohan's forces were pushed back after heavy fighting. In this action, 19 'émigrés' were captured. They were brought before a French military court in Ravenstein on 21 October 1794, where they were condemned to death and executed for treason. The British forces were driven back in great disorder; in the action on the Waal dyke, the standard of the British 37th Regiment of Foot was captured by the sans-culottes.\nRe-enactment\nOn 10 August 2017, the Battle of Puiflijk was re-enacted on a small scale by a team of actors with the help of the citizens of Puiflijk. It was part of a broader event of Omroep Gelderland's television programme Zomer in Gelderland to put the village on the map.\nReferences\nSources\n* F.H.A.
