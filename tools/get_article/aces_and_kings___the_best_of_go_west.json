It contains most of the band's singles, taken from their studio albums Go West (1985), Dancing on the Couch (1987) and Indian Summer (1992), plus tracks from the remix album Bangs & Crashes (1986) and several tracks that Go West contributed to film soundtracks. Also included are two new songs that were released as singles from the album: a cover of The Miracles' \"The Tracks of My Tears\", which reached number 16 in the UK Singles Chart, and a remix of Go West's debut hit single, \"We Close Our Eyes\", which went on to reach number 40.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Peter Cox and Richard Drummie, except where noted.\n| extra2          = Indian Summer / Pretty Woman soundtrack\n| length2         = 4:02\n| title3          = Tracks of My Tears\n| note3           =\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          = Previously unreleased\n| length3         = 3:52\n| title4          = Call Me\n| note4           =\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Go West\n| length4         = 4:13\n| title5          = Faithful\n| note5           =\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          = Indian Summer\n| length5         = 4:26\n| title6          = Don't Look Down – The Sequel\n| note6           =\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          = Dancing on the Couch (American edition); original version from Go West\n| length6         = 4:20\n| title7          = One Way Street\n| note7           =\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = Previously unreleased version; original from Rocky IV soundtrack\n| length7         = 4:36\n| title8          = What You Won't Do For Love\n| note8           =\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          = Indian Summer\n| length8         = 4:27\n| title9          = From Baltimore to Paris\n| note9           =\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          = Dancing on the Couch\n| length9         = 5:48\n| title10         = Never Let Them See You Sweat\n| note10          =\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         = ''White Men Can't Jump soundtrack\n| length10        = 4:20\n| title11         = Goodbye Girl\n| note11          =\n| writer11        =\n| extra11         = Bangs & Crashes; original version from Go West\n| length11        = 4:33\n| title12         = I Want to Hear It from You\n| note12          =\n| writer12        =\n| extra12         = Dancing on the Couch\n| length12        = 3:41\n| title13         = Tell Me\n| note13          =\n| writer13        =\n| extra13         = Indian Summer\n| length13        = 4:17\n| title14         = True Colours\n| note14          =\n| writer14        =\n| extra14         = Dancing on the Couch\n| length14        = 5:12\n| title15         = The King Is Dead\n| note15          =\n| writer15        =\n| extra15         = Dancing on the Couch\n| length15        = 4:27\n| title16         = Tears Too Late\n| note16          =\n| writer16        =\n| extra16         = B-side of \"King of Wishful Thinking\" single\n| length16        = 4:22\n| title17         = Healing Hands\n| note17          =\n| writer17        =\n| extra17         = Previously unreleased version\n| length17        = 4:47\n}}\nNote\n* US version replaces \"True Colours\" with \"Eye to Eye\" (Horizontal Mix) from Bangs & Crashes & \"Healing Hands\" with \"Still in Love\" from Indian Summer.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for Aces and Kings – The Best of Go West\n!Chart (1993–94)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+1993 year-end chart performance for Aces and Kings – The Best of Go West\n!Chart (1993)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC)\n|66\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.discogs.com/Go-West-Aces-And-Kings-The-Best-Of-Go-West/release/6847306 Aces and Kings – The Best of Go West] at Discogs\n*[https://www.discogs.com/release/1466812-Go-West-Aces-And-Kings-The-Best-Of-Go-West Aces and Kings – The Best of Go West''] (US CD version) at Discogs"
