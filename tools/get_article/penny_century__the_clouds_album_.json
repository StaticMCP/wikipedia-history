The album was released in October 1991 and peaked at number 23 on the Australian ARIA Charts. Following a re-release, the album was certified gold in Australia in 1996.\nReception\nIn The Sell-In, Craig Mathieson said the album was, \"proof not only that Clouds could last the distance but that they ability to render depth and mystery into an accessible structure. Obvious on first listenings was the crispness of the drums and the razor-sharp talons of Easton's guitar work. Clouds were not only assured but great fun.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1991)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nCertification\nPersonnel\n*Stuart Eadie – drums\n*David Easton – guitar\n*Jodi Phillis – guitar, vocals\n*Patricia Young – bass, vocals\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|Australia\n| October 1991\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\"|Red Eye Records / Polydor Records\n|511398-1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe\n| 1992\n| CD\n|517967-2\n|-\n!  scope=\"row\"|Australia\n| 1996\n| 2xCD\n|531655-2\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
