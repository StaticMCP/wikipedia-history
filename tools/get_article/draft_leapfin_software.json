The company enables finance teams to centralize and standardize operational and transactional data from multiple systems, automate journal entry creation, and ensure compliance with revenue recognition standards such as ASC 606 and IFRS 15.\nFounded in 2015 and based in San Francisco, Leapfin primarily serves digital businesses, including software-as-a-service (SaaS), subscription, e-commerce, and marketplace companies. The platform functions as a revenue subledger and integrates with systems such as Stripe, Adyen, NetSuite, Apple, internally built systems, and payment gateways.\nHistory\nLeapfin was founded in 2015 by Raymond Lau and Eric Yao, both of whom previously held roles in finance and engineering at high-growth technology companies. The company launched with the goal of providing finance teams with a single source of truth for revenue data, automating previously manual, spreadsheet-driven processes associated with revenue accounting.\nIn 2022, Leapfin raised $12.2 million in Series A funding led by Crosslink Capital, with participation from Work-Bench and Uncorrelated Ventures. The funding was used to expand product development and grow the company’s customer base, which includes Reddit, GoodRx, and SeatGeek.\nProduct and Features\nLeapfin's core offering is a financial data platform designed to automate revenue subledger operations. It enables finance teams to:\n* Aggregate disparate revenue data from systems such as third-party and internal payment and billing platforms (e.g., Stripe), ERPs (e.g., NetSuite), marketplaces (e.g. Apple, Google), and CRMs (e.g., Salesforce)\n* Automate journal entry creation based on predefined accounting logic\n* Maintain audit trails and ensure compliance with industry standards including ASC 606, GAAP, and IFRS.\n* Track deferred revenue and revenue waterfalls\n* Accelerate month-end close processes by reducing manual reconciliation work\nIn 2024, Leapfin launched an AI tool called Luca, which empowers finance teams to explore revenue data by creating reports themselves, answer revenue and audit-related questions, analyze revenue trends, and detect and resolve anomalies using natural language inputs.\nUse Cases\nLeapfin is commonly used by Controllers and VPs of Finance at high-growth technology companies to automate revenue recognition, ensure compliance with accounting standards, and shorten the month-end close timeline. Its usage is prevalent in industries with complex revenue models and high transaction volumes such as SaaS, usage-based billing, e-commerce, and marketplaces.\nCustomers\nLeapfin’s customer base includes digital-first companies such as:\n* Reddit – implemented Leapfin to streamline revenue accounting from digital ad platforms\n* SeatGeek – adopted Leapfin to reduce manual accounting tasks and improve close speed\n* Guideline – used Leapfin to unify revenue data from multiple systems and scale accounting\n* Outside Interactive – implemented Leapfin to provide visibility and a single source of truth for revenue data\n* GoodRx – implemented Leapfin to streamline monthly close and provide FP&A insights\n* Eight Sleep – used Leapfin to automate Stripe reconciliation and detect revenue anomalies\nAs of 2024, Leapfin reported strong platform performance at scale, processing billions of transactions and hundreds of billions of journal entries annually across its customer base.\nReception\nLeapfin has been positively reviewed on third-party platforms such as G2 and GetApp. Reviewers have highlighted the platform’s ability to reduce manual journal entries, simplify Stripe reconciliation, and accelerate financial close cycles. Users have also highlighted Leapfin’s domain expertise and excellent customer support team.\nAnalysts and reviewers have noted Leapfin’s fit for companies operating in multi-entity, high-volume environments where legacy ERP systems may fall short of modern revenue accounting needs.\nSee Also\n* Accounting automation\n* Revenue recognition\n* ASC 606\nReferences"
