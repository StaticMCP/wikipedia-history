The award was subsumed in 2002 by the Best Male College Athlete ESPY Award.\nThe award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.  Inasmuch as the ESPY Awards ceremonies were conducted in February during the pendency of the award's existence, an award presented in a given year is for performance and achievements in the one year theretofore.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Player\n!Position\n!Team\n|-\n|1993\n|Garrison Hearst\n|Running back\n|Georgia\n|-\n|1994\n|Charlie Ward\n|Quarterback\n|Florida State\n|-\n|1995\n|Rashaan Salaam\n|Running back\n|Colorado\n|-\n|1996\n|Eddie George\n|Running back\n|Ohio State\n|-\n|1997\n|Danny Wuerffel\n|Quarterback\n|Florida\n|-\n|1998\n|Peyton Manning\n|Quarterback\n|Tennessee\n|-\n|1999\n|Ricky Williams\n|Running back\n|Texas\n|-\n|2000\n|Michael Vick\n|Quarterback\n|Virginia Tech\n|-\n|2001\n|Chris Weinke\n|Quarterback\n|Florida State\n|}\nSee also\n*List of college football player of the year awards\n*Heisman Trophy\n*Maxwell Award\n*Walter Camp Award\n*AP College Football Player of the Year\nReferences\n*"
