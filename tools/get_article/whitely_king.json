He was responsible, among other duties, for enforcing pay and conditions for shearers, on behalf of the owners, and supported the owners against the unionists during several strikes by recruiting non-union \"scab\" labour.\nHistory\nKing was born in Auckland, New Zealand, the elder son of Belgrave Theodore King and Sarah Hannah King née Whiteley.\nIn 1858 his father deserted his family,}} His wife married again, and King was raised by his grandparents, Rev. John Whiteley (1806–1869) and Mary Ann Whiteley née Cooke in New Plymouth.\nHe became a journalist in Gore, Invercargill. He founded the Mataura Ensign in 1880, then was editor and part proprietor of the Taranaki News in New Plymouth, and later editor of the Marlborough Daily Times.\nAround 1890 he left for Australia to manage the New Zealand Press Association's Sydney office.\nHe won the job of secretary at the foundation of the Pastoralists Union of New South Wales in July 1890, and was an effective organiser of non-union labour and promoter of the owners' arguments in the shearers' strike of the 1890s.\nAccording to the Freeman's Journal, King's \"loyalty to his masters and lack of sympathy for the workers, his almost cynical reliance upon \"freedom of contract\" as the solution to shearing shed discontent, prolonged the strike unnecessarily.\nIn March 1891 he co-founded (with A. W. Pearse and others) the ''Australasian Pastoralists' Review'', edited by R. E. N. Twopeny.\nLast Days\nHe was forced to retire after a serious illness, reportedly syphilis, from which he largely recovered.\nHe died at Gladesville Hospital, Sydney, and his remains were buried in Gore Hill Cemetery, North Sydney.\nPersonal\nKing married Esther Barham at Wellington, New Zealand on 26 May 1885. They had one daughter and three sons.\nHe died at Gladesville Hospital, Sydney. His remains were buried in Gore Hill Cemetery, North Sydney.\nIn Australian folklore\nAs part of his union-busting tactics, King enjoined large numbers of unemployed men with no bush experience to head for the shearing sheds. The makeshift billycans affected by some of these travellers, fashioned from a jam tin and a length of wire for a handle, were dubbed \"Whitely Kings\", also used as an adjective.\nHe is mentioned in the folk song \"The Shearer and the Rouseabout\" by Joe Watson and the poem \"Saint Peter\" by Henry Lawson (later adapted into a folk song by Peter Duggan).\nReferences\nReferences\n*[http://warrenfahey.com/people/joe-watson.html Profile of Joe Watson lyrics]; includes definition of homemade weapon\n*[http://www.uow.edu.au/~morgan/graphics/unity41denis.pdf \"The Shooting of William (Billy) McLean\" by Dennis O’Keeffe]; describes King's role in a Pastoralist union action"
