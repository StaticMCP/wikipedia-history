He served as deputy chief of the Operations Staff, one of the departments in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), the Armed Forces High Command. Following the war, Warlimont was convicted in the High Command Trial and sentenced to life imprisonment as a war criminal. He was released in 1954.\nWorld War I and inter-war years\nWarlimont was born in Osnabrück, Germany. In June 1914, just before the start of World War I, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 10th Prussian Foot Artillery Regiment based in Alsace. During the war, he served as an artillery officer and battery commander in France and later in Italy. In late 1918, he served in General Ludwig Maercker's Freikorps Jäger rifle corps.\nIn the inter-war years, Warlimont served in various military roles. In 1922, he served in the 6th Artillery Regiment and in 1927, as a captain, he was the second adjutant to General Werner von Blomberg, chief of the Truppenamt, the covert German General Staff. In May 1929, Warlimont was attached to the U.S. Army for a year to study American industrial mobilization theory during wartime.  This led to his service between 1930 and 1933 as a major on the staff of the Industrial Mobilization Section of the German Defence Ministry. He became the Section's chief in 1935.\nBetween August and November 1936, following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Warlimont served as the Reich War Minister (OKH General Staff)'s Wehrmacht Plenipotentiary Delegate to the government of Spanish General Francisco Franco in Spain. Reich War Minister Werner von Blomberg directed Warlimont to coordinate German aid in support of Franco's battle against the Spanish government forces.\nIn 1937, he wrote the Warlimont Memorandum calling for the reorganisation of the German armed forces under one staff unit and one supreme commander. The plan was to limit the power of the high officer caste in favour of Adolf Hitler. On the basis of this memorandum, Hitler developed the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (High command of the armed forces), with Hitler as supreme commander. Warlimont was rewarded in 1939 with a post as deputy to General Alfred Jodl. In 1938 he was promoted to colonel and became commander of the 26th Artillery Regiment.\nWorld War II\nIn late 1938, Warlimont became Senior Operations Staff Officer to General Wilhelm Keitel. This was a coveted position, and so between September 1939 and September 1944 he served as Deputy Chief of the Operations Staff (Wehrmachtführungsstab: WFSt: Armed Forces Operations Staff). General Jodl was his superior officer, who served as Chief of the Operations Staff, which was responsible for all strategic, executive and war-operations planning.\nWhile serving on this military operations planning staff, in early 1939 he assisted in developing some of the German military invasion plans of Poland. On 1 September 1939, German military forces invaded Poland, thereby starting World War II.\n1940 saw his promotion to Generalmajor, and he assisted in developing the invasion plans of France. During the Battle of France, on June 14, 1940, Warlimont, in an audacious move, asked the pilot of his personal Fieseler Storch to land on the Place de la Concorde in central Paris. In 1941, he continued to assist in developing invasion operations into Russia. This earned his promotion to Generalleutnant in 1942.\nHis meteoric advancement in rank almost sputtered out on 3 November 1942 when he was relieved of his job after a junior subordinate failed to process a message from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel sufficiently promptly. However, only five days later he was recalled to duty to visit the French Vichy Government in France to coordinate the defense of their colonial territories from possible occupation by the Allies.\nIn February 1943, Warlimont travelled to Tunis to confer with Rommel as to whether or not the Germans should abandon North Africa.\nIn early 1944, Warlimont was promoted to General of the Artillery. As Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces Operations Staff, he continued to give almost daily briefings to Hitler regarding the status of German military operations.\nOn D-Day, when the Allies invaded Normandy, France, Warlimont telephoned Jodl to request that the German tanks in Normandy should be released to attack the Allied invaders. Jodl responded that he did not want to make that decision; they would have to wait until Hitler awoke. Once Hitler awoke and authorised the release of the tanks for a counter-attack, it was too late to blunt the successful Allied invasion. The following day, Hitler sent Warlimont to inspect the German defences in Italy.\nOn 20 July 1944, Warlimont was wounded during the assassination bombing against Hitler in a war-briefing building in Rastenburg. He suffered a mild head concussion. Later in the day, he telephoned Field Marshal Günther von Kluge and convinced him that Hitler was alive; this prompted Kluge not to continue in the anti-Hitler coup. Even though Warlimont was wounded alongside Hitler, he was wrongly suspected of having been involved in the anti-Hitler conspiracy. In spite of this, he belatedly received the special 20th of July Wound Badge, which was awarded only to those few wounded or killed in the 20 July explosion.\nOn 22 July, Warlimont travelled to France to meet with Field Marshal Rommel (who had been wounded a week earlier by an Allied aeroplane attack) and Rommel's naval aide Vice Admiral Friedrich Ruge, to discuss the deteriorating battlefield situation in Normandy.\nEven though Hitler (in Wolfsschanze) ordered Warlimont to travel to Paris on 1 August to study the German military situation there with Field Marshal von Kluge, Hitler thought that Warlimont might have been involved in the conspiracy to have him assassinated (an action which Warlimont denied). On 2 August, Warlimont met outside Paris with General Günther Blumentritt and advised him that Hitler wanted the Germans to regain the offensive initiative against the Allies through Operation Lüttich. Later, Warlimont urged General Heinrich Eberbach to continue his attacks in the Falaise pocket region. Although all the German generals informed Warlimont that they believed the attack would fail, he cabled Hitler that the generals were \"confident of success\".\nAt Warlimont's request, due to his dizzy spells resulting from the 20 July assassination bombing against Hitler, he was transferred and retired to the OKH Command Pool (the Führerreserve), and was not further employed during the war.\nTrial and conviction\nIn October 1948, Warlimont was tried before a United States military tribunal in the High Command Trial, part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, in part for his responsibility for drafting the Barbarossa Jurisdiction Order which allowed the murder of civilians on the pretext of counteracting partisan activity. He also signed the order to execute Russian political Commissars on sight.  His sentence was reviewed by the \"Peck Panel\", which made a more lenient recommendation. This leniency was heavily criticized by Robert R. Bowie who stated: \"they Reinecke, Kuechler and Warlimont] were all directly implicated in the program which encompassed the murder of commandos, commissars and captured allied airmen as well as in brutal mistreatment of prisoners of war\". His sentence was commuted to 18 years in 1951. He was released in June 1954.\nPersonal life\nWalter Warlimont was a son of Louis Warlimont (1857–1923) and Anna Rinck (1860–1931). His parents came from Eupen, today part of the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and migrated to Osnabrück. His father was a bookseller and antiquarian.\nIn 1927 Walter Warlimont married Anita von Kleydorff (1899–1987), daughter of Franz Egenieff (born Marian Eberhard Franz Emil von Kleydorff), a son of Prince Emil zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and US-born Paula Busch, a niece of Adolphus Busch.\nHis brother was head of a factory in Vienna which made components for the V-2 rocket, using forced labour from the Soviet Union.\nIn 1962, Warlimont wrote ''Inside Hitler's Headquarters 1939–1945. He died in 1976 in Kreuth near the Tegernsee.\nSee also\n*Commando Order\n*Commissar Order\nReferences\n* Hitler's Generals: Authoritative Portraits of the Men Who Waged Hitler's War, edited by Correlli Barnett.\n*\n* \"The Decision in the Mediterranean 1942\" by Gen.
