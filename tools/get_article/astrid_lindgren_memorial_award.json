The prize is five million SEK, making it the richest award in children's literature and one of the richest literary prizes in the world. The annual cost of 10 million SEK (in 2008) is financed with tax money.\nThe Lindgren Award annually recognises one or more living people and extant institutions (twelve in the first ten years) – people for their career contributions and institutions for their long-term sustainable work. Specifically they should be \"authors, illustrators, oral storytellers and promoters of reading\" whose \"work is of the highest quality, and in the spirit of Astrid Lindgren.\" The object of the award is to increase interest in children's and young people's literature, and to promote children's rights to culture on a global level.\nThe award is administered by the Swedish Arts Council funded solely by the central government.\nOfficially it is called \"An award by the Swedish people to the world\". The award ceremony is presided over by Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden.\n\"The award recipients are chosen by a jury with broad expertise in international children's and young adult literature, reading promotion and children's rights. The 12 members include authors, literary critics and scholars, illustrators and librarians. One member represents Astrid Lindgren's family.\"\nThe annual cycle begins no later than December about 9 months before nominees are announced, 15 months before the winner is announced and 18 months before the presentation.\nWinners\nIn the first 23 annual cycles through 2025 there were 25 recipients, twenty-one people and four institutions. There were two inaugural awards in 2003 and two again in 2005.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award winners\n!Year\n!Author\n!Country\n!Ref.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2003\n|\n| Austria\n|\n|-\n|\n| United States\n|\n|-\n|2004\n|\n| Brazil\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2005\n|\n| Japan\n|\n|-\n|\n| United Kingdom\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|\n| United States\n|\n|-\n|2007\n| Banco del Libro\n| Venezuela\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|\n| Australia\n|\n|-\n|2009\n| Tamer Institute for Community Education\n| Palestine\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|\n| Belgium\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|\n| Australia\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|\n| Netherlands\n|\n|-\n|2013\n| Isol\n| Argentina\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|\n| Sweden\n|\n|-\n|2015\n| Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa (PRAESA)\n|South Africa\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|\n| United States/United Kingdom\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|\n| Germany\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|\n| United States\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|\n| Belgium\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|\n| South Korea\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|\n| France\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\n| Sweden\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|\n| United States\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Indigenous Literacy Foundation\n|Australia\n|\n|-\n|2025\n|Marion Brunet\n|France\n|\n|}\nFive of the Lindgren Award winners have also, and much earlier, won the older, international Hans Christian Andersen Award for their lifetime contributions to children's literature: Sendak and Erlbruch as illustrators; Nöstlinger, Nunes, and Paterson as authors. Lindgren herself won the Andersen Award in 1958. In 2020, Woodson also won the Andersen Award as an author, two years after winning the Lindgren Award.\nSee also\n*List of literary awards\nReferences\n. The Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award (ALMA).
