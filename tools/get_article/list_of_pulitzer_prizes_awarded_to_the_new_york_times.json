It won its first award in 1918, and has since won more Pulitzer prizes than any other organization.\nThe Pulitzer Prize is a prize awarded within the United States for excellence in journalism in a range of categories. First awarded in 1917, prizes have been awarded every year since, though not in every category. News organizations submit work, or series of works, for consideration to a 19-member board, which is composed of editors, columnists, media executives, artists, and academic administrators from Columbia University, which administers the prize\n1910s\n* 1918: The New York Times, for Public Service, specifically for expansive coverage of World War I, including publishing the full text of \"official reports, documents and speeches by European statesmen relating to the progress and conduct of the war.\"\n1920s\n* 1923: Alva Johnston, in Reporting, for science news and his reporting of the 1922 convention of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n* 1926: Edward M. Kingsbury, in Editorial Writing, for his editorial, \"The House of a Hundred Sorrows\".\n1930s\n* 1930: Russell Owen, in Reporting, for graphic radio dispatches from the Byrd Antarctic Expedition.\n* 1932: Walter Duranty, in Correspondence, for his series of dispatches from Russia describing the working out of the Five Year Plan. This award received substantial criticism in the later 1900s for failures to report on the conditions that led to the Soviet famine of 1932–33, but as of 2021, The Pulitzer board has twice declined to withdraw the award.\n* 1934: Frederick T. Birchall, in Correspondence, for reporting from Europe.\n* 1935: Arthur Krock, in Correspondence, for his Washington dispatches.\n* 1936: Lauren D. Lyman, in Reporting, for his exclusive story revealing that Charles Lindbergh and his family were leaving the United States to live in England following hysteria surrounding the kidnap and murder of his infant son. The U.S. media had called it the \"Crime of the Century\" and it spurred the U.S. Congress to enact the Federal Kidnapping Act, designating kidnapping a federal crime, so that charges could be pursued even if the perpetrator crossed state lines.\n* 1937: William L. Laurence, in Reporting, for his coverage of \"science\" at the Tercentenary Celebration at Harvard University, shared with four other reporters from other news organizations.\n* 1937: Anne O'Hare McCormick, in Correspondence, for her dispatches and feature articles from Europe in 1936.\n* 1938: Arthur Krock, in Correspondence, for his exclusive interview with President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937. This broke an \"unwritten rule\" among the White House press pool, and \"the Washington press corps sizzled with rage at such 'favoritism'\", according to a later Times Magazine report. The President apologized for granting the exclusive interview.\n1940s\n* 1940: Otto D. Tolischus, in Correspondence, for articles from Berlin explaining the economic and ideological background of war-engaged Nazi Germany.\n* 1941: The New York Times with a special citation for the \"public educational value\" of its foreign news reporting, \"exemplified,\" according to the Pulitzer Board, \"by its scope, by excellence of writing and presentation and supplementary background information, illustration, and interpretation\".\n* 1942: Louis Stark, in Telegraphic Reporting (National), for reporting of \"important labor stories\" during the year.\n* 1943: Hanson W. Baldwin, in Correspondence, for a series of articles reporting a wartime tour of the Southwest Pacific.\n* 1944: The New York Times, in Public Service (described by the Prize Board as \"for the most disinterested and meritorious public service rendered by any American newspaper during the year\"), for a survey of the teaching of American history.\n* 1945: James (\"Scotty\") Reston, in Telegraphic Reporting (National), for his coverage of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington, D.C., particularly an exclusive series that detailed how the delegates planned to set up the United Nations.\n* 1946: William L. Laurence, in Reporting, for his eyewitness account of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki and other articles on the \"development, production, and significance\" of the atomic bomb.\n* 1946: Arnaldo Cortesi, in Correspondence, for his reports from Buenos Aires in 1945.\n* 1947: Brooks Atkinson, in Correspondence, for his series of articles on Russia in 1946.\n* 1949: C. P. Trussell, in National Reporting, for \"consistent excellence in covering the national scene from Washington\".\n1950s\n* 1950: Meyer Berger, in Local Reporting, for an article on the killing of 13 people by a berserk gunman in Camden, New Jersey.\n* 1951: Arthur Krock, with a Special Citation, for his exclusive interview with President Harry S. Truman in 1950, which revealed he did not intend to run for a third term. At the time Krock published his work (in 1950), he was a member of the Pulitzer Board. The Board noted in this 1951 award that, as a policy, it \"does not make any award to an individual member of the Board\"; instead, they issued no award in the National Reporting category in 1950, and awarded Krock this special award in 1951. It was the second time (following his 1938 Pulitzer Prize) that Krock had won the Prize for an exclusive interview with a sitting president—which was exceedingly rare and a contravention of unwritten rules of engagement between a President and the press pool. At the time, it was viewed as a scandal among the White House press.\n* 1951: Cyrus L. Sulzberger, with a Special Award, for his interview with Archbishop Stepinac of Yugoslavia.\n* 1952: Anthony H. Leviero, in National Reporting, for an exclusive article he wrote disclosing the record of conversations between President Harry S. Truman and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur at their Wake Island Conference in 1950, where they discussed the progress of the Korean War.\n* 1953: The New York Times, with a Special Citation, for its \"Review of the Week\" section (credited as being edited by Lester Markel) which the Board said, \"for seventeen years has brought enlightenment and intelligent commentary to its readers.\"\n* 1955: Harrison E. Salisbury, in International Reporting, for a series based on his six years in Russia.\n* 1956: Arthur Daley, in Local Reporting (no edition time) for his sports column, \"Sports of The Times.\"\n* 1957: James (\"Scotty\") Reston, in National Correspondence, for \"his five-part analysis of the effect of President Eisenhower's illness on the functioning of the executive branch of the federal government\".\n* 1958: Staff of The New York Times, in International Reporting. The Board noted in particular The Times' \"initiative, continuity, and high quality\".\n1960s\n* 1960: A.M. Rosenthal, in International Reporting, for \"perceptive and authoritative\" reporting from Poland. The Pulitzer Board added, \"Mr. Rosenthal's subsequent expulsion from the country was attributed by Polish government spokesmen to the depth his reporting into Polish affairs, there being no accusation of false reporting.\"\n* 1963: Anthony Lewis, in National Reporting, for reporting on the proceedings of the United States Supreme Court that year, especially \"the decision in the reapportionment case and its consequences in many of the States of the Union.\"\n* 1964: David Halberstam, in International Reporting, for reporting from South Vietnam of the Vietnam War and the overthrow of the Diem regime (shared with Malcolm Browne of Associated Press).\n* 1968: J.

The New York Times and its reporters have been named more than a dozen times as finalists.\nControversies\nAs new reporting adds additional perspective to previously-reported topics, the quality and even the veracity of some reporting comes under question.\n* Walter Duranty's 1932 reporting for The New York Times on the news from Russia—and subsequently the Pulitzer Prize it was awarded—came under intense criticism for its failures to report on the conditions that led to the Soviet famine of 1932–33. Critics mounted campaigns for the award to be revoked, once in 1990, and again 2003. Voices for The New York Times both times wrote highly critical reviews of Duranty's work. As of 2021, the Pulitzer Board has twice discussed withdrawing the award—most recently in 2003—but declined to withdraw the award both times.\n* In 2005, journalists Amy Goodman and David Goodman filed a request with the Pulitzer Board to revoke William L. Laurence's 1946 Pulitzer Prize. They alleged he had been employed by the U.S. War Department to write \"military press releases and statements for President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson\" for four months while also employed by The New York Times to report on the atomic bomb. David Goodman remarked in an interview with Democracy Now! that Laurence seemed to have been \"completely unashamed and unrepentant of what was clearly an egregious conflict of interest by any of the most basic canons of journalism ethics.\"\n* Reporter Rukmini Callimachi was one of three finalists from The New York Times named for the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes (in addition to the two prizes awarded), but it came to light in 2020 that the reporting's central source had likely fabricated their story; The New York Times volunteered to return the award.\nSee also\n* List of awards won by The New York Times\nReferences"
