It is widely used across Assam in everyday life, traditional rituals, and social interactions. Often paired with paan (betel leaf), tamol symbolizes respect, hospitality, and auspiciousness.\nCultural Significance\nIn Assam, offering tamul-paan to guests is a long-standing tradition and is considered a gesture of warm welcome and respect. It is a cultural identity, especially present in weddings, religious ceremonies, and community gatherings.\nReligious and Ritual Use\nTamol-paan is considered indispensable in Assamese religious practices. Visitors to temples and naamghars, especially during Bihu, Durga Puja, and death rituals, commonly bring and offer it. The areca nut often functions as a fertility symbol and part of ancestral rites.\nSymbolism\nTamol represents prosperity, purity, and social bonding. It is typically presented in containers such as xorai or bota, and used during ceremonial gifting (‘'xoron‑diya) and other felicitations.\nHealth and Social Aspects\nDespite its cultural importance, chewing tamol—especially when combined with slaked lime (khun'') or tobacco—poses health risks and can lead to dependence.\nModern Adaptations\nCommercially packaged tamol-paan is now sold widely, yet the traditional presentation—fresh nut with paan in a xorai—persists at cultural events and household rituals.\nSee also\n* Xorai\n* Culture of Assam\n* Betel nut\n* Bihu\nReferences"
