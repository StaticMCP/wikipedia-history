She was in addition, the Secretary of British Isles Women’s Indoor Bowls Council (2000–03).\nKeen to promote the sustainability of the sport, in the 2000s King set up and organised the annual Welsh Ladies Junior Singles and the World Junior Singles Tournament (named the Wilf Pomeroy Trophy after Hilary's father), the mixed Under 16 Club Leagues and, determined also to promote the benefits of sport for older people, she initiated the Welsh over 60s Mixed Pairs Tournament. Aware of the power of the media, due to her efforts the Ladies National Bowls Singles event has been televised since 2003, which means that the sport can reach a wider audience and its popularity has been increased even further.\nIn the 2008 Birthday Honours, King was awarded an MBE in recognition of her services to Bowls in Wales.\nDeath\nKing died in September 2024.\nExternal links\n[https://www.wilba.com Welsh Ladies Indoor Bowls Association website]:\nReferences"
