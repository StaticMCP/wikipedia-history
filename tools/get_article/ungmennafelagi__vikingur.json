Víkingur or Víkingur Ólafsvík, is an Icelandic multi-sport club from the town of Ólafsvík located on the west coast of Iceland situated on the western end of the Snæfellsnes. It was founded on 6 October 1928.\nFootball\nMen's football\nVíkingur men's football team played in the Úrvalsdeild karla, the Icelandic top tier, for the first time in 2013.\nHistory\n*1928 : Foundation of club\n*1974 : 2. deild karla [champions]\n*2003 : 3. deild karla [champions]\n*2004 : 2. deild karla [promoted]\n*2010 : 2. deild karla [champions]\n*2012 : 1. deild karla [promoted]\n*2015 : 1. deild karla [champions]\nThe team has spent most of its history in the lowest league, but were promoted to the second tier for the 1975 season, but were instantly relegated back to the third tier, then the lowest tier. They didn't participate every season until recently, sending a merged team with other clubs from Snæfellsnes on occasion, and were last part of such a merger in the 2002 season. They sent a team under their name for the 2003 season and were instantly promoted to 2. deild karla, where they played in 2004 and were promoted again. They finished the 2005 1. deild karla season in a respectable fifth and stayed in that division until 2009, when they were relegated. They won the 2. deild in 2010 to bounce straight back up, finishing 4th, their best ever, in 2011.
