The trail runs in two disconnected segments, separated by a short section that leaves the state for neighboring New York State before returning to Vermont. The trail is a state park and is managed by the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation.\nThe former corridor was the D&H's Washington Branch, whose trains were known locally as the “Slate Picker”. The D&H Washington Branch ran from Eagle Bridge, New York, to Castleton, Vermont. D&H abandoned the Eagle Bridge-Salem, New York section in 1980 and sold the railbed to Ron Crowd with a grant from the Urban Development Corporation.\nThe Poultney-Castleton, Vermont and Rupert, Vermont-Granville, New York segments were sold to the Vermont Agency of Transportation and subsequently converted to the D&H rail trail.\nThe Salem, New York-West Rupert, Vermont and West Pawlet, Vermont-Granville, New York segments were sold to the New York State Department of Transportation. A rail trail was slated by the state, but were halted at the government level, resulting in several sections reverting to local property owners.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://fpr.vermont.gov/dh-rail-trail D & H Rail Trail] - Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation\n* [http://www.vtstateparks.com/assets/pdf/dhrailtrail.pdf D&H Rail Trail map]"
