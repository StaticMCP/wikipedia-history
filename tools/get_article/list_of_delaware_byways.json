The intent of this system is to promote tourism and raise awareness of the communities along these routes.\nHistory\nThe Delaware Scenic and Historic Highways program was created in 2000 by Senate Bill 320, which authorized the Delaware Department of Transportation to create a system of statewide scenic byways. In 2007, the United States Department of Transportation awarded a $174,600 grant to preserve the Route 9 and Brandywine Valley byways. The Delaware Scenic and Historic Highways program was renamed to the Delaware Byways program in 2010.\nByways\nBrandywine Valley National Scenic Byway\n}}\n]]\nThe Brandywine Valley National Scenic Byway is located in New Castle County, Delaware in the Brandywine valley.
