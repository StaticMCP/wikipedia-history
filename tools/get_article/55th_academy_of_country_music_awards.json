Keith Urban was the host for the show. The event was originally planned to air on April 5 of the same year in Las Vegas, Nevada, but was postponed and relocated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe show was broadcast from the Grand Ole Opry House, Ryman Auditorium, and the Bluebird Café in Nashville, becoming the first major in-person award event to take place in the United States since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. With her Vocal Event win, Miranda Lambert won her thirty-fifth award, extending her record as the most awarded artist in ACM history. The ceremony also featured the first tie ever in ACM history for the highest honor of the evening, Entertainer of the Year, with both Thomas Rhett and Carrie Underwood claiming its title.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are shown in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85;\" width=\"50%\" |Entertainer of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" |Album of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Carrie Underwood\n*Thomas Rhett\n**Luke Bryan\n** Luke Combs\n** Eric Church\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'What You See Is What You Get – Luke Combs'\n**Center Point Road – Thomas Rhett\n**Girl – Maren Morris\n**Heartache Medication – Jon Pardi\n**Wildcard – Miranda Lambert\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Female Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Male Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Maren Morris\n**Kelsea Ballerini\n** Miranda Lambert\n**Kacey Musgraves\n**Carrie Underwood\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Luke Combs\n**Dierks Bentley\n**Thomas Rhett\n**Chris Stapleton\n**Keith Urban\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Group of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Duo of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Old Dominion\n**Lady A\n**Little Big Town\n**Midland\n**The Highwomen\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Dan + Shay\n**Brooks & Dunn\n**Brothers Osborne\n**Florida Georgia Line\n**Maddie & Tae\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Single of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Song of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''\"God's Country\" – Blake Shelton\n**\"One Man Band\" – Old Dominion\n**\"Rainbow\" – Kacey Musgraves\n**\"Rumor\" – Lee Brice\n**\"What If I Never Get Over You\" – Lady A\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"One Man Band\" – Josh Osborne, Matthew Ramsey, Trevor Rosen, Brad Tursi'''\n**\"10,000 Hours\" – Dan Smyers, Shay Mooney, Justin Bieber, Jessie Jo Dillon, Jason Boyd, Jordan Reynolds\n**\"Girl Goin' Nowhere\" – Ashley McBryde, Jeremy Bussey\n**\"God's Country\" – Devin Dawson, Jordan Schmidt, Michael Hardy\n**\"Some of It\" – Eric Church, Jeff Hyde, Clint Daniels, Bobby Pinson\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |New Female Artist of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |New Male Artist of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Tenille Townes\n**Caylee Hammack\n**Gabby Barrett\n**Ingrid Andress\n**Lindsay Ell\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Riley Green\n**Cody Johnson\n**Jordan Davis\n**Morgan Wallen\n**Russell Dickerson\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Songwriter of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Video of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Hillary Lindsey\n**Ashley Gorley\n**Josh Osborne\n**Michael Hardy\n**Shane McAnally\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* \"Remember You Young\" – Thomas Rhett; Dir.
