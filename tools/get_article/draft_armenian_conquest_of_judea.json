Following the collapse of the Seleucid Empire, Tigranes expanded southwards into Mesopotamia, Syria, and Phoenicia.\nAt this time, Judea under the Hasmonean dynasty was weakened by dynastic conflicts, making it vulnerable to foreign domination.\nCampaign\nAround 83–82 BC, Tigranes invaded Syria and advanced into Judea. According to Josephus (Antiquities of the Jews, XIII.418–419), the Hasmonean rulers surrendered, acknowledged Armenian supremacy, and agreed to pay tribute. Armenian garrisons may have been stationed in the region.\nAftermath\nThe Armenian hold over Judea lasted only a few decades. During the Third Mithridatic War, Roman generals Lucullus and Pompey defeated Tigranes (69–66 BC), forcing him to abandon his conquests. Judea soon came under Roman influence, ending the short-lived Armenian domination.\nPrimary sources\n* Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XIII.\n* Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book XXXVI.\nModern scholarship\n* Sherwin-White, A.
