Faced with this situation, the \"katiba El karimia\" of the Wilaya IV, commanded by Si Ameur Mesbah, had developed a plan to loosen the vise by targeting several military post colonies in Bordj Bounaama, Sidi Abed, Lardjem and Tamalaht, to disperse the French troops.\nThe French colonial army suffered heavy losses in this battle (600 deaths, including 33 officers and two aircraft destroyed). In the ranks of the National Liberation Army (NLA), 360 were killed. 240 civilians were also killed.\nSee also\n* French Algeria\nReferences"
