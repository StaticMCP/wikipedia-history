During the First World War, specifically at the time of the Battle of Verdun in 1916, many villages in northern France were destroyed by the fighting. After the war, it was decided that the land previously occupied by the destroyed villages would not be incorporated into other communes, as a testament to these villages which had \"died for France\", as they were declared, and to preserve their memory.\nWhile three of the villages in Meuse were subsequently rebuilt and are governed as normal communes, the other six are entirely unpopulated and are managed by a council of three members, appointed by the prefect of Meuse. All of these communes are located in the canton of Belleville-sur-Meuse (in the canton of Charny-sur-Meuse before cantonal reorganization in 2015) in the arrondissement of Verdun, and are generally located north of the city of Verdun, in the Lorraine region of northeastern France.\nList of villages (communes)\nIn Meuse\n* Beaumont-en-Verdunois\n* Bezonvaux\n* Cumières-le-Mort-Homme\n* Douaumont (partially reconstructed)\n* Fleury-devant-Douaumont, location of the Verdun Memorial\n* Haumont-près-Samogneux\n* Louvemont-Côte-du-Poivre\n* Ornes (partially reconstructed)\n* Vaux-devant-Damloup (rebuilt)\nIn Marne\n*Auve\n*Beauséjour, Marne\n*Bignicourt-sur-Saultz (3/33 homes remained) 30 men and 45 women and children were taken captive.\n*Étrepy (7/70 homes remained)\n*Glannes\n*Hurlus\n*Le Mesnil-lès-Hurlus\n*Perthes-lès-Hurlus\n*Ripont\n*Somme-Tourbe (everything in the village except the village hall (Mairie), church, and two private buildings)\n*Tahure\n*Moronvilliers\n*Nauroy\n*Sermaize-les-Bains (40/900 homes remained).
