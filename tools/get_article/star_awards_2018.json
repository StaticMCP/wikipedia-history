The award would return again in 2019 due to Kym Ng winning her tenth Top 10 award.\n**The Special Achievement Award took its place, having returned for the first time since 2003, after 15 years of absence.\n*Although the Channel 8 News & Current Affairs had at least ten news presenters by the end of 2018, the Best News Presenter and Best Current Affairs Presenter awards were neither presented for the fifth consecutive year.\n*For unknown reasons, the Rocket award, which is given to the most improved Mediacorp artiste, was also not presented for the second consecutive year.\n*The Best News Story, Best Current Affairs Story, and Best Variety Special were also not presented this year, all three of which were absent for the first time since 2000.\n**Consequently, the absence for Best Variety Special ended Star Awardss 10-year streak of their nomination for the category, with the last time happened being 2005.\nRevisions of eligibility criteria\nTo recognise the contributions to local television more broadly, this year's awards will open up nominations to non-Mediacorp artistes. In response, the Star Awards Committee revised the criteria after considering the constructive feedback of industry watchers and audiences. Acting categories were mostly revised, as reflected below:\n*Artistes have to play as a lead role in a drama or host in a variety or info-ed program, or as a supporting role/assistant host in at least three eligible programmes or at least 30 episodes out of all eligible programmes, whichever applicable.\n*For the Evergreen Artiste Award (an award which recognises contributions by industry veterans), artistes were now evaluated based on the performances for the entire year to promote versatility. Previously, this award is evaluated on a single program only.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Organisation\n!Year!! Category !!
