The Tatar army numbered around 10,000.\nBattle\nTatars were going to cross the Samara River in order to return to Crimea with their exploits. Ivan Sirko knew about this, and with his Cossacks set up an ambush for an incoming Tatar army. As the Tatars were crossing the river, Sirko made his battle cry and with Cossacks launched a surprise attack on the unsuspecting Tatar army. Cossacks inflicted a crushing defeat on the vastly more numerous Tatar army, slaughtering it. Only a few Tatars managed to escape. Tatars expected to cross the river without anyone intervening, which backfired. According to a local legend, as the surviving Tatars were fleeing the battle, they yelled out \"Ogren! Ogren!\", which in Turkic meant: \"Cursed, Cursed [Place]!\".\nAftermath and legacy\nCossacks freed 15,000 people taken captive by Tatars. Tatars in Crimea were mourning their dead on Samara River for a whole week. After this battle, Monastery island became a property of Sich Cossacks. Sirko's victory here became well-known. Archeologists found artifacts related to this battle. According to local folk legends, after Tatars suffered a crushing defeat, they named this place \"Ogren\", the locals then changed the name to \"Igren\", and that's how they began calling the peninsula.\nHistoricity\nFor a long time, this battle was considered to be legendary, largely relying on accounts of local folk legends. However, archeologists later discovered a number of historical artifacts on Igren Peninsula, among which there were rusty sabres and Tatar arrowheads, supporting historicity of the battle.\nReferences"
