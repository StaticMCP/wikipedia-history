They were a part of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League, Central Junior B Hockey League, Metro Junior B Hockey League, and Metro Junior A League.  These two teams are the forerunners of the OPJHL's Brampton Capitals.\nHistory\nThe Warriors began as Brampton Regents during the 1940s playing at the Junior B level. In 1957, the team became sponsored by a local distributor of the 7 Up soft drink. The Brampton 7Ups played in the now defunct Metro Junior A League for two seasons, 1961–62 and 1962-63. Bob Savage was their coach for both seasons. The team returned to the Metro Junior B Hockey League in 1963.\nBrampton joined the Central Junior B Hockey League in 1971 during a massive Ontario Hockey Association reshuffling of the Junior \"B\" ranks. Prior to this, they were members of the Metro Junior B Hockey League. They are the only known member of the Metro league to be affected by the reshuffle as it was mostly done between members of the Central league and the Mid-Ontario Junior B Hockey League.\nThe Brampton Warriors Jr. A team were an OPJHL team for two seasons in the 1980s. Their 40-6-4 record in the second season would normally be unstoppable, however the Warriors finished in second place in 1981-82 behind a 40-4-6 Guelph Platers team that would make the jump to the Ontario Hockey League the next season. As the Warriors folded for good at the end of the season, the Platers came within arm's reach of winning the National Title.\nNotable alumni\nThree alumni of the Brampton 7Ups went on to play in the National Hockey League, all of them (Ken Broderick, Andy Brown, and Lyle Carter) were goaltenders playing a combined total of 106 NHL games. Although Andy Brown played in just 62 games in the NHL over the course of three seasons, he will forever be a part of NHL hockey history. Brown carries the distinction of being the last goaltender in the league to play without a protective mask, now a mandatory rule.\n;List of NHL alumni\n*Ken Broderick\n*Andy Brown\n*Lyle Carter\n*Frank Pietrangelo\nSeason-by-season results\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"  bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n!
