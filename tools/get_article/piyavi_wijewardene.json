His efforts focused on introducing the model in a non-partisan, citizen-led format, distinct from party politics. While Piyavi promoted this idea as a grassroots platform for democratic accountability, a formal version of a Shadow Cabinet was also briefly supported by then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who in 2018 proposed an official shadow cabinet within the United National Party (UNP) to enhance parliamentary opposition functions.\nOcean policy and EEZ advocacy\nPiyavi Wijewardene, through the Shadow Cabinet CIVIC initiative, advocated for greater national focus on Sri Lanka’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). He emphasized that the EEZ, which spans approximately 517,000 km², over eight times the size of the country’s landmass, represents a significant but underutilized resource base. In this context, he highlighted the potential of the oceanic domain for sustainable economic growth, environmental protection, and long-term national security, while calling on the Government to adopt policies that better integrate oceanic resources and marine ecosystems into development planning.\nNational media policy\nIn March 2019, he co-founded a social movement with the help of several mainstream academics and professionals to urge Sri Lankan media channels to strengthen their development orientation in prime-time news bulletins. Soon after many in the sector criticized him stating that he is countering media channels due to personal grudges. Despite criticisms, he played a leading role in developing a national media policy for a draft act aimed at emphasizing that the broadcasters will be required to make informative components about the economy, technology, arts, and culture in prime time news bulletins. Further, his media policy has aimed towards, regulation of crime reports, training media on the scientific usage of airtime, tax concessions for media channels, insurance for reporting correspondents, minimum wage for workers, monitory board for survey reports and advertising regulatory indexes.

He is also involved in policy advisory roles, supporting government and non-governmental organizations in developing more inclusive and effective food safety strategies.\nFostering entrepreneurship and enhancing educational outcomes\nIn late 2024, he led a movement focused on empowering women entrepreneurs and raising awareness about the significant impact of women’s entrepreneurship on the development of the Sri Lankan economy.

Rather than settling into a quiet retirement, he redirected his time and energy toward community development, education, and social research. Embracing his role as an educationist and social scientist, Piyavi became an active voice in both local and international media, where his thought-provoking perspectives on social issues gained widespread recognition.

Regular participation in athletic activities not only supported his physical well-being but also played a key role in sustaining mental clarity and a sense of routine during his post-career life.
