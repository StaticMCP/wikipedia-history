The film is based on the historical clash between brothers Kasyapa and Moggalana on Sigiriya Rock.\nProducer Dimitri de Grunwald financed the epic film as a dual project between England and Sri Lanka. He provided the three main actors, the script, the assistant director, the production Manager, makeup artist and money while the task of making the film was managed by Sri Lankan artists.\nPlot\nKing Kasyapa (Leigh Lawson) is the son of King Dhatusena (Geoffrey Russell). Kasyapa had murdered his father by walling him alive and then usurping the throne, which rightfully belonged to his brother Mogallana (Ravindra Randeniya), Dhatusena's son by the true queen. Mogallana fled to India to escape assassination by Kasyapa but vowed revenge. In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka which was rightfully his. Knowing the inevitable return of Mogallana, Kasyapa is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress and pleasure palace.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\"\n!
