      "text": "# Timeline of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests (June 2020)\n\nThe month of June 2020 was the first anniversary of the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. The decision taken by the National People's Congress on national security legislation and the alleviation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong led to a new series of protests and international responses. On 30 June, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed the Hong Kong national security law which came into force the same day, leading to even more people protesting on 1 July.\nEvents\n1 June\nA petition in support of Beijing's plan to implement national security legislation was published online, which claimed to have been signed by over 2,500 actors, artists, and individuals from the entertainment and cultural industry in Hong Kong. The petition contained the name of veteran actor Ram Chiang, but Chiang later stated in his Facebook page that he did not sign the petition. It was reported that Barbie Hsu had also denied receiving an invitation or notification to join the petition.\nThe petition also consisted of late artists such as Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung, with several netizens believing that the petition consisted of fake signatures. Sharon Cheung, a news broadcaster, clarified that she never did sign the petition.\nA restaurant in Ngau Tau Kok, which was supportive of the protests and youngsters, received a letter from the Hong Kong Housing Authority that the contract was no longer renewed and the eatery would shut down on 30 November 2020, despite the restaurant fulfilling social responsibility by giving out free lunchboxes to the elderly. Employees of the restaurant criticized the authority's decision, calling it a suppression of the Yellow Economic Circle. After learning that the contract was to be terminated through information from the Internet, citizens queued up to support them.\nIn a press interview in the Legislative Council, Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po was seen with tears in his eyes, stirring controversy and discussion among social media on whether he was scared of the United States restrictions on Hong Kong. Chan later clarified in a Facebook post that the tears were due to the camera lighting during the interview, calling it a \"misunderstanding\".\nThe annual Tiananmen Square massacre vigil in Hong Kong was banned for the first time since 1990 citing health concerns due to COVID-19. Lee Cheuk Yan, the chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organized the vigil in the past years, said that the ban signaled the end of Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\".\n2 June\nUnited Kingdom response\nUnited Kingdom Foreign Minister Dominic Raab addressed the Parliament with a statement which said that the imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Chinese central government would be in direct conflict with Article 23 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, as well as a violation of international law. He outlined the UK's possible response to support the Hong Kong people through providing a pathway to citizenship for British National Overseas-passport holders in Hong Kong.\nProgress of court cases related to anti-extradition protests\nA student, Lam Tsz-Ho, accused of rioting in Wong Tai Sin on 1 October was acquitted by judge Sham Siu-Man. The judge criticized the two police officers facilitating the accusations that they had not proven they had caught the person who had hurled a brick; and that the Court could not accept their affidavits. He went on to say that at least one of the two officers had failed to provide a full and truthful account of how Lam had sustained a head wound during his arrest.\nThe protester shot by a police officer in the 11 November shooting incident went on trial. The judge, Law Tak-Chuen, allowed the police officer who fired the shot to remain anonymous, stating that he had received death threats.\nOther developments\nLocal activist group Demosisto urged the United Nations to discuss the National Security Law, and to advise the mainland government not to implement it. In a nine-page report filed on 2 June the group argued that the definition of 'National Security' was unclear and vague, and stressed that the law would allow those critical of the Chinese Communist Party to face potential arrest. They worried that slogans which have been familiar in the protests would be banned, and that there would be frequent abuse of power and rights from the top authorities. They also added that Hong Kong's freedom and autonomy would encounter a 'fatal' blow. In addition to the emerging threat, the report also complained about alleged police brutality and prison abuses.\nIn a South China Morning Post commentary, Andrew Li, former Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong, stated that it was reasonable for the mainland government to take steps towards enacting a security law, given that the Hong Kong government had failed to discharge its constitutional duty as required by Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23. He wrote that in his understanding, the proposed legislation would be \"designed to fit Hong Kong's legal system\" and especially must not be retroactive (to previous offenses).\nIn addition, Yang Ti-liang, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, issued a statement, expressing that he felt assured that the national security law would be in line with common law principles, and that it was \"understandable and justifiable\" to have such a law.\nPrior to embarking on a trip to Beijing to discuss matters on National People's Congress Decision on Hong Kong national security legislation, Chief Executive Carrie Lam told reporters, referencing the protests that had recently erupted in the United States in connection with the murder of George Floyd, that the United States was applying \"double standards\" in its response to violence that had occurred during the Hong Kong protests.\nIn a report entitled 'New Law, New Threat', Human Rights First warned that the looming national security law would endanger human rights lawyers in Hong Kong to a further degree than what had already been the case.\n3 June\nUnited Kingdom response\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson announced in an opinion piece written for South China Morning Post that if China were to continue pursuing the national security law, he would allow all Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover to claim a British National (Overseas) passport (BNO) and open a path to British citizenship for them. Raab said that the UK would sacrifice trade deals with China to support Hong Kong, but that presently it will remain in conversation with the international community on the matter. A late-May statement by Raab had offered a similar measure that would allow the 300,000 current BNO passport holders to apply for a visa; Johnson's 3 June announcement would cover a further 2.5&nbsp;million Hong Kong residents born before the 1997 handover. China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian threatened \"serious consequences\", while many Hong Kong pro-democratic politicians and protesters were reported to wish for more protection for their city itself.\nOther international responses\nThe internet platform of state-run Xinhua News Agency published a list of \"many\" countries that had announced their support for the National Security Law, and moreover had aligned with the central government's view that Hong Kong's affairs were an internal matter of China: Burundi, Myanmar, North Korea, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tanzania, and Uganda. Previously on 1 June, the global edition of state-run China Daily published an article that mentioned the support of \"various\" countries for China's position regarding Hong Kong, naming Serbia, North Korea, Pakistan, Cuba, Russia, and Iran.\nOther developments\nSome protesters and citizens gathered outside the Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre to mourn the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, as well as to show solidarity with those who were detained for their actions in the current protests in Hong Kong.\nIn an article for the Bauhinia Magazine, Pro-China politician Tam Yiu-chung stated that those members of the legislative council who disapproved of the national security law should be disqualified. Members of the pro-democracy camp sharply criticized Tam's statements.\nDemosisto started a petition to fight for European state leaders to support Hong Kong citizens. There have been 70,000 signatures already out of the 100,000 goal.\n4 June\nAt the United States Department of State, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met surviving activists of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests. The State Department offered no details on what was discussed but said in a statement: \"We mourn the victims of June 4, 1989, and we stand with the people of China who continue to aspire to a government that protects human rights, fundamental freedoms and basic human dignity.\"\n4 June 2020 was the 31st anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. The official gathering at Victoria Park was banned by police on 1 June, the first time in 30 years citing COVID-19 concerns. Although the official candlelight vigil was banned, multiple activities were planned to mourn in different districts such as Victoria Park, Shatin, Tuen Mun, Tsuen Wan. At around 5:00&nbsp;pm, pro-democracy protesters handed out flyers outside Sogo in Causeway Bay, shouting slogans, and peacefully entering Victoria Park as groups of eight. The police used a broadcaster to warn citizens not to participate in unlawful assembly. Police stood on standby but did not prevent protesters inside the park grounds. Peaceful protesters lit candles or turned on their phone lights. In addition, Avenue of Stars, Shing Mun River in Shatin, Tuen Mun Park, Sai Ying Pun Station, Kwun Tong Promenade and Langham Place all featured events. Attendees held umbrellas with slogans, and formed chains by holding hands together. 3500 police officers were stationed at various checkpoints. At around 9:00&nbsp;pm, several people blocked roads near Langham Place in Mong Kok. The police stated that they were using traffic cones and fences to block multiple streets. People were arrested by the police who sprayed pepper spray. After the event, the pro-Beijing camp accused Lee Cheuk-yan of encouraging unlawful assembly and unlawful behaviour. Pro-Beijing citizens further urged the Hong Kong Police Force to arrest Lee Cheuk-yan and Jimmy Lai for participating in unlawful assembly, and alleged that the two had disobeyed social distancing measures during the vigil.\nOn 4 June 2020, the National Anthem Bill passed its third reading, with 41 legislators in favor of it and 1 against. 41 out of 42 pro-establishment legislators voted in favor of it, except the chairperson Andrew Leung who abstained. 1 out of 23 pan-democracy legislators voted against it, with the others abstaining, in protest. Before the voting, pan-democracy legislators Raymond Chan and Eddie Chu splashed a jar of reeking liquid in front of the rostrum in protest, accusing Andrew Leung of being a “rubber stamp” and that what he did will “reek for ten thousand years”.\n5 June\nInternational response: USA\nIn accordance to the restrictions and sanctions placed on China and Hong Kong by the United States, Republican senator Pat Toomey urged the United States government to implement the sanctions as soon as possible. In a meeting, he stated that both Republicans and Democrats hoped to implement the restrictions quickly, so as to sanction those Chinese authorities and bank officials from spoiling Hong Kong's original autonomy. In a joint statement with Democrat Chris Van Hollen, he argued that those authorities responsible for implementing the National Security Law should have their assets frozen.\nInternational response: Russia\nDirector of the Information and Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Maria Zakharova stated that Russia treated the national security law as 'internal affairs' of China, and Britain and the United States should not interfere. In a press conference on 5 June, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang stated that China appreciated Russia's stance. He also expressed that this facilitated the friendly relationship between China and Russia, and that it was well-received within the international community.\nInternational response: UK\nAfter HSBC backed the national security law proposed by Beijing in a petition, Alistair Carmichael, chairman of the U.K. parliamentary group on Hong Kong, referred to the petition signed by the London-based bank's top executive in Asia, Peter Wong, in support of a move that critics say will diminish the city's freedom and autonomy. The British government is opposing the proposed law, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying he will give as many as three million residents of his nation's former colony the chance to seek refuge in the U.K. if China presses ahead. Member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg criticized the bank of being pro-China instead of being pro-Britain, even though it was funded by the British. He publicly requested the bank to stop supporting the national security law. Former Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten criticized China for exerting pressure on foreign companies through the threat of withholding business opportunities. He advised the United States to unite with other democratic countries to counter \"underhanded tactics\" by Beijing.\nPrivate prosecution brought against taxi driver who rammed into a crowd\nPro-democracy legislator Ted Hui accused a taxi driver of driving towards a crowd during a protest in a private prosecution. It was the first private prosecution case which was allowed by the Court since the start of the large-scale protests in June 2019. Hui had initiated the proceedings in February 2020 after the Department of Justice had taken no legal action. Hui stated that this case could uphold justice to the victims of the car crash.\nProgress of public prosecutions related to arrestees at anti-extradition protests\nA Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education student accused of owning a petrol bomb was sentenced to one year in jail.\nAnother case which had gained notable attention in Hong Kong has begun on 11 May. Tong Wai-hung and To Yee-lan were arrested and charged of rioting in Sheung Wan on 28 July 2019 and had pleaded not guilty. In court today they claimed that the police officer who has arrested them had not given them a police caution warning. When asked by the defense, she stated that she had forgiven all the formal procedures she had learnt in the Police Academy.\nOther developments\nIn an editorial published by Ta Kung Pao, a pro-China newspaper, pro-China commentator Wut Wing-yin voiced out support for the national security law. She stated that the Chinese Communist Party has granted Hong Kong 23 years of autonomy and freedom since the handover in 1997, yet the 'resistance' has retaliated with disobedience, rioting and damage. The national security law would be used to tackle those who intend to commit illegal crimes and participate in 'riots'. She advised general citizens of Hong Kong not to worry about its implications. She criticized the pro-democracy party of \"instilling fear,\" generating negative attitudes and reviews towards the law.\nAccording to information published on a Hong Kong government website, the Home Affairs Bureau said that the plan of\n17 District Councils to hold a Joint Special Meeting on 6 June to discuss the National People's Congress decision on national security legislation was a violation of the District Councils Ordinance, which limited the functions of the District Councils to district related affairs. Later on 9 June, Kowloon City District Council Vice-chair Kwong Po-yin rejected this criticism by saying that the Councillors had a \"duty\" to voice the concerns of\ncitizens about the impact of the national security law on future generations \"to the SAR government, the Chinese government and the world\".\nLuo Huining, Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong, insisted that the law should be dealt strictly so as to 'protect the legal rights and freedom of the majority of Hong Kong citizens'.\nPatrick Nip, Secretary for the Civil Service visited the Police Headquarters. Among the purposes of his visit was to meet those who had been injured in the protest movement over the past year. Nip stated that the national security law was the crucial step for One Country, Two Systems to succeed. Two days later in a press interview he urged civil servants working for the government to support the national security law. He said, while dealing with national security issues, there should only be the concept of 'one country', and not 'two systems'. In addition, he expressed that the sense of identity was not strong among civil servants. He agreed that there should be enhanced communication with the Greater Bay Area and to develop programs to enhance the sense of identity among civil servants.\n6 June\nIn a 1.5 hour phone call with China's paramount leader Xi Jinping, President of France Emmanuel Macron expressed that he supported the 'One China, Two Systems' concept that China uses to govern Hong Kong. He stated that France was closely following the situation in Hong Kong.\nJeremy Tam, pro-democracy member of the Legislative Council, reported that he was followed by an unknown man speaking Cantonese with Chinese accents after leaving the Legislative Council in Wan Chai. They reportedly took pictures of him and followed him. When asked about his identity, the unknown man denied that he was a police officer. When Tam insisted on calling the police, the man suddenly ran towards the opposite direction. Tam stated that he has been followed since late May and has filed a police report. Tam expressed that 'Hong Kong has not been a totally safe place' after such incidents. He also claimed that if they were Chinese police, they could have abducted him on a car. Fellow pro-democracy Legislative Council member Alvin Yeung stated that society has been instilled with fear and terror. It has troubled politicians, social activists as well as commoners. Pro-democracy political party Hong Kong Civic Party executive member Cheng Tat-hung, also a member of the Eastern District Council, issued an official statement calling this incident 'totally unacceptable', and that it should be condemned.\nAt a press conference, Lee Cheuk-yan, pro-democracy member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, called for fundraising events for a virtual '4 June Museum of Memory and Human Rights', to permanently preserve historical archives and relics of victims of the protests on Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Lee stressed the urgency to start such a project in view of the impending national security law and possible suppression of the Alliance's activities.\nPro-China activist Man Shek and 2 other pro-China activists went to the British Council to protest against Dominic Raab's policies towards Hong Kong. They presented a joint statement and held the Chinese flag. In addition, they ripped and destroyed their BNOs and criticized the British government of failing to consult Hong Kong citizens before introducing policies relating to the national security law.\nIn a meeting with pro-Beijing political group Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong on June 6, Commissioner of Police Chris Tang blamed the pro-democracy protests for the increase in robberies in the past year.  The statistics he mentioned included 1) \"crime rate\" of 10-15 year-olds increased by about 80%, and 2) that of 16-20 year-olds increased by 120% from the year before. He also stated that last year over 4900 youths were arrested. He criticized netizens of encouraging citizens to participate in unlawful assembly, which also defied social distancing measures. It is worth noting that the number of arrests is different from number of convictions, as Hong Kong's legal system presumed one's innocence before proven guilty.\nHong Kong government has spent millions of tax-payers money to denounce the year-long pro-democracy movement and is intended to increase public relation budget in 2020-2021 budget by about 20%, according to a [https://www.budget.gov.hk/2020/chi/pdf/chead074.pdf budget proposal] sent to the Legislative Council. For example, a 30-second advertisement produced by the Hong Kong Government warning citizens not to participate in illegal activities and violence cost HK$499,000 to produce. While some newspapers criticized the government of wasting public resources, others believed that the government should spend more.\nSecretary of Education Kevin Yeung stated that if students and teachers insulted the national anthem, schools could call the police.\n7 June\nIn an interview broadcast in the TVB news programme On the Record, pro-democracy veteran Martin Lee expressed his view that the only legislative body legally allowed to pass any laws and legislation in Hong Kong was the Hong Kong Legislative Council (LegCo). He considered the central government's bypassing of the LegCo in spite of having a majority in it, and directly mandating the security law, as a breach of the Hong Kong Basic Law.\n9 June\nJapan, part of G7, expressed its concern over Hong Kong protests and arrests.\nA year ago over a million Hong Kong citizens took to the street protesting against the Hong Kong government's refusal to yield to citizens' demand to scrap the pro-Beijing extradition law.\nOne year later Carrie Lam said in a press conference that \"everyone has to learn a lesson. The SAR government has to learn a lesson, I hope each and every lawmaker will learn a lesson too.\"\nThe one-year anniversary memorials were characterized by grassroots, flash-mob pro-democracy events \"Lunch With You\", a type of protest that had been repeatedly seen over the past months. The rallies of that day took place in Wai Chai, Central, Tai Koo, San Po Kong, Kwai Chung, Kwun Tong, and Kowloon Bay. Hundreds of peaceful protesters, students and elders included, showed up with signs and sang the protest anthem \"Glory to Hong Kong\".\nIn all, police claimed that they made 53 arrests.\n10 June\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) urged the Hong Kong government to drop the \"riot\" charge against the two journalists who were at the scene on 1 July 2019 covering the protest inside Hong Kong Legislative Council building. The two journalists were charged on 10 June 2020, almost a whole year after the live news coverage. RSF's East Asia bureau head Cédric Alviani asked the Hong Kong Secretary for Justice to \"immediately drop the absurd rioting charge.”\nOne prominent policy proposed by the national security law was to enforce supervision and monitoring of schools and schoolchildren. Previously wrote about the danger of silencing schoolchildren and \"brainwashing\" them using fear of the new national security law in a Stand News article, today in an interview with NowTV, Ip Kin-yuen, pro-democracy member of the legislative council representing the education sector, continued to stress that the government, by supporting the law, was attempting to stop students from voicing out support for the movement. He said that schools were starting to have follow-up actions regarding students who participated in social movements such as 'Sing with You' and slogan-calling.\nHong Kong's Secretary of Security Lee stated in an exclusive interview with South China Morning Post that Hong Kong Police is ready to enforce the not-yet-enacted National Security Law. At the time of the interview, the draft of the law had not been made public.\n11 June\nSix-Monthly Report on Hong Kong\nThe UK released its regular Six-Monthly Report on Hong Kong documenting situations in Hong Kong from 1 July to 31 December 2019. When presenting this report British's foreign minister Dominic Raab stressed that the resolution to the Hong Kong pro-democracy protest must be done from within (the legislative procedures of) Hong Kong, and cannot be imposed by mainland China. He urged China to reconsider.\nInternational response: Germany\nIn a phone call to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, Angela Merkel discussed the situation in Hong Kong along with other economic and business topics. The foreign policy expert for Merkel's conservatives, Roderich Kiesewetter, urged China to respect Hong Kong's autonomous status.\nProgress of court cases\nFour pro-democracy leaders, Jimmy Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan, Richard Tsoi, Albert Ho and 9 others were charged for inciting others to defy a police ban and gather in Victoria Park on 4 June. They received a call from police, informing them of the court summons. The alliance has been organising the vigil for 30 years, but the police issued an objection letter to the event this year, citing the prohibition on group gatherings of more than eight amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA taxi-driver who drove his taxi and attempted to ram into crowds of protesters in October last year resulting in multiple injuries had still not been arrested or prosecuted by the police. As a result, pro-democracy politician Ted Hui has filed a private prosecution against the taxi-driver and has been approved by the court.\nOther developments\nSecretary for Education Kevin Yeung issued a statement to all the principals of schools and education institutions of Hong Kong. He stated that, the bureau opposes any form of class boycotts as it was considered a case of poor discipline. The board would closely follow-up if any schools violated this principle. He stated that, the anthem of the protest, \"Glory to Hong Kong\", was \"clearly propaganda\" and that it should be banned in schools. However, those which were related to the Basic Law would not be considered with political influence, as it was part of 'moral education' for students. Yeung stated that another popular song in the protests, \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" from the musical Les Misérables, would be allowed in principle, but that the situation and intent would be taken into account. Teachers would be provided with material for teaching the security law, as well as accompanying training in how to use it.\nAt a media session, Secretary for Security John Lee stated that the Hong Kong government would begin explaining the national security law once it was promulgated. He expressed confidence that the Hong Kong police would be quickly able to develop their skills and experience to discharge their function effectively. He said that police did have some prior experience in security matters, in particular through its actions against one Hong Kong independence society.\nThe videoconferencing platform Zoom admitted that it had shut down the accounts of Hong Kong-based human rights activist Lee Cheuk-yan and US-based activist Zhou Fengsuo, and twice shut down a Zoom event hosted by US-based activist Wang Dan, under pressure from the mainland government. The relevant Zoom meetings of the three human rights activists had been about the preparation of the anniversary and, in the case of Wang, the commemoration of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, in which Zhou and Wang had taken part. In a statement, Zoom said that it would create ways to block, if requested to do so by authorities, participants of Zoom calls who are based in mainland China, but would not allow to let such requests affect participants from outside China where the same activity is legal.\n12 June\nThe day marked the one year anniversary of occupying LegCo in Admiralty that successfully stopped the second reading of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill. Hong Kong citizens, in this one year memorial, continued to come out in droves to show solidarity against the government and demand the riot charge to be removed in addition to denouncing police brutality. The original mass protest plan was scrapped as police, using the pandemic as a reason, declined to grant a \"letter of no objection\" (LONO). In addition, police declared that there would be heavy armed forces in Central to prevent any citizens from unlawful gatherings. As a result, the mass protest turned into a more localized commemorative event throughout Hong Kong. Rallies and gatherings occurred in Causeway Bay, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Sha Tin, Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, and Tsuen Wan. Throughout the day, police detained dozens of pro-democracy protesters as crowds gathered to mark the anniversary of the start of the protests. and by the end of the day, police claimed that 43 individuals were arrested in Causeway Bay and Mong Kok, allegedly charged with unlawful gathering, among them several district representatives that had been elected in November 2019. One noticeable event was a pro-Beijing politician Kwong Sing-yu, who was arrested for wounding and attacking chanting citizens and an Epoch Times journalist in Kwun Tong.\nSecretary for Security John Lee stated that police officers would be given the authority to enforce the national security law as soon as possible after its implementation in Hong Kong.\nOn the anniversary of 12/6, protest activities sprung out all across Hong Kong. Riot police was on standby at different districts and conducted stop and searches of pedestrians. Ted Hui, pro-democracy activist, was arrested due to unlawful assembly.\nHundreds of students from Heung To Middle School in Kowloon Tong formed a human chain around the school in support of the school's music teacher. The teacher's contract was not renewed allegedly due to his failure to prevent his students from performing Glory to Hong Kong in a music test.\nAt night, a riot police officer shouted, in what seemed to be mockery of the United States over the George Floyd protests and police brutality, slogans such as Black Lives Matter, ''I can't breathe'' towards the camera of a foreign journalist at the protest site. The video went viral after 'BeWater HK' uploaded it on Facebook. Pro-democracy politicians condemned the conduct and actions of the police as 'unprofessional, unethical' and that their attitude was generally poor and disrespectful. According to the police, the police officer concerned was reprimanded for unprofessional conduct.\n14 June\nLegal scholar Johannes Chan of the University of Hong Kong said that the proposed security legislation had to be set out in detail, to avoid it being used to stifle dissent, and that waving flags and chanting slogans should not be prohibited under the law as these activities did not amount to \"action\". He said it was \"highly undesirable\" that, unlike in Hong Kong, laws were drafted in China in a \"rather vague manner and general manner\", leaving it to the government to fill it with content.\nPlaced late at night on Beacon Hill top and seen in the early morning of June 15, a 25-meter vertical protest banner with black fabric and white font criticized the state of Hong Kong as \"One Country One System Hong Kong Game Over\" (「一國一制香港玩完」).\n15 June\nOne-year memorial vigil for Marco Leung\nOne year ago on this day, Chief Executive Carrie Lam had declared that the anti-extradition law would be indefinitely suspended. The day also marked the one-year anniversary of the suicide of Marco Leung Ling-kit, which was linked to the anti-extradition protest; at the time of his fatal fall, Leung had worn a yellow raincoat with words written on the back that were seen as protest against Lam's decision not to withdraw the bill completely. Tens of thousands of Hong Kong citizens gathered in Admiralty to pay tribute and respect to the first death since the protest began. Hundreds more people gathered locally in Tuen Mun, Causeway Bay, and Tin Shui Wai. The crowd laid flowers and paid their tributes to Leung. Riot officers stopped and searched some people clad in black and a man dressed in a yellow raincoat.\nHong Kong protest art wins Prix Ars Electronica\nOver the year, there have been thousands of various arts, flyers, stickers, and slogans in various forms such as songs, memes, posters, created by thousands of Hong Kong citizens, young and old, supporting the pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong.

On 18 June, Chinese spokesman Zhao Lijian condemned these proposals, calling them an interference to the 'internal affairs' of China.\nOther developments\nTam Yiu-chung, pro-Beijing politician, said that the CPC had never stated that all of the cases which would be related to the national security law would be held trial in Hong Kong; rather, extradition of the arrested to China for trial was possible. Pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong saw Tam's statements as the end of the 'One Country, Two Systems' framework and of judicial independence.\nJames Tien, member of a pro-Beijing party but claimed to be a \"moderate\", stated that most people in Hong Kong disapproved of the national security law, and that the Hong Kong government had not eased their minds by raising the possibility that it may not adhere to the principles of common law.
