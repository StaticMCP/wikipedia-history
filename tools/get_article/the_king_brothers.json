They are best remembered for their cover versions of \"Standing on the Corner\" and \"A White Sport Coat (And A Pink Carnation)\".\nCareer\nThe group was composed of three brothers who first performed together professionally on the TV show Shop Window in 1952. Initially performing as The King Three, they appeared on the BBC Television early in their career on Six-Five Special, and by 1957 had been named \"top vocal group\" in the reader's poll for the NME. Their first hit on the UK Singles Chart was their cover of \"A White Sport Coat\", which hit No. 6 in 1957. In October 1960, they were again voted \"top vocal group\" in the NME reader's poll. They had a string of successful singles through to 1961, after which time they continued recording, but found their popularity waning.\nGroup leader Denis King later became an award-winning composer for television, film, and musicals; among other things, he wrote the theme music for The Adventures of Black Beauty and Lovejoy. Michael King was married to the actress Carol White, with whom he had two sons, Sean and Stephen.\nMembers\n*Denis King (born 25 July 1939, Hornchurch, Essex)\n*Michael King (25 April 1935, Barking, Essex – 9 November 2018)\n*Anthony King (born 31 January 1937, Barking, Essex)\nSingles\n;Parlophone Records\n*1957 \"Marianne\" / \"Little By Little\"\n*1957 \"A White Sport Coat (And A Pink Carnation)\" / \"Minne Minnehaha!\" (UK No. 6)\n*1957 \"In the Middle of an Island\" / \"Rockin' Shoes\" (UK No. 19)\n*1957 \"Wake Up Little Susie\" / \"Winter Wonderland\" (UK No. 22)\n*1958 \"Put A Light In The Window\" / \"Miss Otis Regrets\" (UK No. 25)\n*1958 \"Hand Me Down My Walking Cane\" / \"Six-5 Jive\"\n*1958 \"Moonlight and Roses\" / \"Torero\"\n*1958 \"Sitting In A Tree House\" / \"Father Time\"\n*1959 \"Leaning on a Lamp Post\" / \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\"\n*1959 \"Hop, Skip And Jump\" / \"Civilization\"\n*1959 \"Makin' Love\" / \"Caribbean\"\n*1960 \"Standing on the Corner\" / \"The Waiter And The Porter And The Upstairs Maid\" (UK No. 4)\n*1960 \"Mais Oui\" / \"Gotta Feeling\" (UK No. 16)\n*1960 \"Doll House\" / \"Si Si Si\" (UK No. 21)\n*1960 \"Seventy-Six Trombones\" / \"I Like Everybody\" (UK No. 19)\n*1961 \"Goodbye Little Darling\" / \"Tuxedo Junction\"\n*1961 \"The Next Train Out Of Town\" / \"Sabre Dance\"\n*1961 \"The Language of Love\" / \"Go Tell Her For Me\"\n*1962 \"King Size Twist\" / \"Oh!
