Cook was a historian at the Canadian War Museum and the author of thirteen books about the military history of Canada.

He won the Charles Taylor Prize in 2009 for his book Shock Troops. He was a two-time recipient (2000 and 2015) of the C.P. Stacey Prize, a two-time recipient of the J.W.

In 2020, he was named the museum’s chief historian and director of research.\nHe was a prolific writer on Canadian military history. His 2000 book, No Place to Run, was awarded the C.P.

At the Sharp End: Canadians Fighting the Great War, 1914-1916, won the 2007 J.W. Dafoe award for literary non-fiction and the 2008 Ottawa Book award.  His 2008 book Shock Troops: Canadians Fighting the Great War 1917–1918 won the 2009 Charles Taylor Prize.

In 2017, Cook published Vimy: Battle and Legend and in 2018 he published The Secret History of Soldiers: How Canadians Survived the Great War. Both were national best-sellers. Vimy received the 2017 J.W. Dafoe Book Prize and The Secret History received the Ottawa Book Prize. Almost all of these books have been national best sellers.\nIn June 2020, Cook and J.L.

It was long-listed for the Templer prize; his Vimy book was a finalist for the same prize.\nCook was the recipient of the 2013 Pierre Berton Award (Governor General's History Award for Popular Media), which is awarded by Canada's National History Society.  The award was given to Cook for his work making military history \"more accessible, vivid and factual\", both in his role as an author and as the First World War Historian at the Canadian War Museum.\nCook was a member of the Royal Society of Canada and the Order of Canada.\nDeath\nCook died on October 25, 2025.
