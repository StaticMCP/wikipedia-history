There is an early reference to Luther Burbank being the originator.\nOrigins\nThe earliest reference to this cultivar is in a US Gardening catalogue of 1929. It was reputed to be a mutation of Canna 'Roi Humbert' (synonym C. 'King Humbert') and was confirmed to be such by Dr Khoshoo in his published papers. On rare occasions it has also been known to produce stems where the foliage is all dark and the flowers are all red. That is the source of Canna 'Red King Humbert', amongst others.\nAll main catalogue references until the early 1990s are consistent in their descriptions of an Italian Group chimera cultivar, yellow with red spots. However, after that period there was some confusion and it found itself being used as a synonym for C. 'Austria' and its description was also confused with C. 'Roma'.\nSynonyms\n* 'Canna'' 'Anthony and Cleopatra' - name confined to Europe.\n* Canna 'Cleopatra' - the name first appeared in US catalogs in the 1960s, not to be confused with C. 'Cleopatré' which is a Crozy Group cultivar from the 1890s.\n* Canna 'Fusion' - name confined to eBay in USA.\n* Canna 'Goldkrone' - confined to Europe.\n* Canna 'Harlequin' - name appears to be confined to the USA.\n* Canna 'Queen Helena' - name appears to be confined to the USA.\n* Canna 'Queen of Italy' - name confined to India.\n* Canna 'Spanish Emblem' - - name appears to be confined to the USA.\n* Canna 'Striped Queen' - name confined to India.\n* Canna 'Yellow Humbert - first appeared in the 1990s, presumably as a shorthand for the correct name.\nGallery\nImage:Canna YKH 1075.jpg\nImage:Canna YKH 1174.jpg\nImage:Canna YKH 1060.jpg\nCatalogue References\n* Allen's Nurseries, Ohio, USA.
