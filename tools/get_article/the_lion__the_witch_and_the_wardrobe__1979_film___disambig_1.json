S. Lewis.  It was adapted by animator Bill Melendez.\nPlot\nWhen the Pevensie Children Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy go to Professor Kirke's mansion due to the air raids of World War 2, they stumble into an old wardrobe which transports them to a magical land called Narnia with talking animals, fauns, hags, the oppressive White Witch and the great lion Aslan. There they meet the friendly Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them on their quest to find Aslan the great lion. Only he can help save Lucy's friend Mr. Tumnus (the faun) from the White Witch. They have a fun mysterious time there, and ultimately end up ruling as kings and queens, until they end up back home. The Professor tells the children that they will return to Narnia one day.\nProduction notes\nThe rights to produce the television program were given to the Episcopal Radio TV Foundation in the mid-1950s when C. S. Lewis was recording the Episcopal Series of the Protestant Hour radio programs. Dr. Ted Baehr was elected President of the Episcopal Radio TV Foundation as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was preparing to be broadcast by CBS, and he supervised the distribution of the subsequent video. The CBS program had 37 million viewers and won two Emmy Awards.\nVoices\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Character\n!UK Version\n!US Version\n|-\n!Lucy Pevensie\n|Lisa Moss\n|Rachel Warren\n|-\n!Edmund Pevensie\n|Nicholas Barnes\n|Simon Adams\n|-\n!Peter Pevensie\n|Stephen Garlick\n|Reg Williams\n|-\n!Susan Pevensie\n|Shelley Crowhurst\n|Susan Sokol\n|-\n!Jadis (The White Witch)\n|Sheila Hancock\n|Beth Porter\n|-\n!Mr. Beaver\n|Arthur Lowe\n|Don Parker\n|-\n!Professor\n|Leo McKern\n|Dick Vosburgh\n|-\n!Mr. Tumnus\n|Leslie Phillips\n|Victor Spinetti\n|-\n!Mrs. Beaver\n|June Whitfield\n|Liz Proud\n|-\n!Dwarf\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Peter Hawkins\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Unknown\n|-\n!Fox\n|-\n!Aslan\n|colspan=\"2\"|Stephen Thorne\n|}\nThe only actor to appear in both versions is Stephen Thorne (who voiced Aslan).\nDifferences between novel and animated film\n*The meeting with Father Christmas, as well as the season's arrival, is omitted (though he is mentioned by some Talking Animals). Instead, Aslan gives the children their weapons.\n*There is a point in which eventually all four of the children enter the wardrobe (albeit two are still skeptical of Narnia). In the novel, this is to escape a housekeeper whom they do not like, but in the cartoon there is no specified reason.\n*The novel, and other adaptations, clearly portray the children as evacuees staying at the home of the Professor during World War II. In this cartoon, no particular reason is stated for them staying there.\n*No mention is made of World War II, and the clothing style of the children suggests a 1960s-70s setting.\n*Rather than ask Edmund what he would most like to eat (whereupon he chooses Turkish delight), as in the novel, The Witch simply offers him Turkish delight directly.\n*The wolf Captain of the White Witch's Secret Police is named \"Fenris Ulf\" (like in early American editions of the book) instead of \"Maugrim\".\n* Mrs. Macready, the Professor's housekeeper, was dropped from the film, and instead of the children being chased into the Wardrobe in the spare room, they all decided to try to get to Narnia all together after the Professor had discussed the truth about it with Peter and Susan.\n*The White Witch's dwarf was last seen before the battle and it is unknown what happened to him after the battle.\n*In the cartoon, the Minotaurs are on Aslan's side. In the novel, the Minotaurs work for the White Witch.\nReleases\n* Released on VHS in 1985 and 1991 and 1998.\n* Released on DVD on Region 1 and 2 in 2006.\nVHS UK history\n*''Children's Video Library'' (1985)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
