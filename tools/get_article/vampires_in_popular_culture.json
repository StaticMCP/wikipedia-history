      "text": "# Vampires in popular culture\n\n.]]\nVampires are frequently represented in popular culture across various forms of media, including appearances in ballet, films, literature, music, opera, radio, theatre, paintings, and video games.\nThough there are diverse and creative interpretations and depictions of vampires, the common defining trait is their consumption of blood for sustenance. They are represented using different mediums, including comic books, films, games. Examples of notable vampire-themed works, span from classic films like Nosferatu, to modern franchises like Twilight and Underworld. The role of vampires in role-playing games, particularly Dungeons & Dragons and Vampire: The Masquerade, is noteworthy. Vampires appear in vampire-themed manga and TV shows.\nComic books and graphic novels\n#1 (September 1969). Cover art by Frank Frazetta.]]\n* Comic books and graphic novels such as Vampirella (1969), Tomb of Dracula (1972), Blade (1973), 30 Days of Night (2002) Anita Blake Guilty Pleasures, and Dracula vs. King Arthur (2005). In addition, many major superheroes have faced vampire supervillains at some point.\n* Many comic books featuring Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin off Angel have been released.\n* Marceline and the Scream Queens is a mini-series of comic books focusing on Marceline the Vampire Queen from the cartoon TV show Adventure Time with Finn and Jake. The spin-off comic was produced by BOOM! Studios and published between July and December 2012.\nFilms\nwas the first Japanese film in the vampire genre.]]\nportrayed Count Dracula in the celebrated Hammer Horror series of films, starting with Dracula  in 1958.]]\nThe Vampire (1913, directed by Robert G. Vignola), also co-written by Vignola, is the earliest vampire film.\nThese were derived from the writer Rudyard Kipling who was inspired by a vampiress painted by Philip Burne-Jones, an image typical of the era in 1897, to write his poem 'The Vampire'. Like much of Kipling's verse it was incredibly popular, and its refrain: A fool there was . . . , describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular film A Fool There Was that made Theda Bara a star, the poem being used in its publicity. On this account, in early American slang the femme fatale was called a vamp, short for vampiress.\nA vampire features in the landmark Nosferatu (1922 Germany, directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau), an unlicensed version of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The Stoker estate sued the production and won, leading to the destruction of most copies of the film. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. Nosferatu is the first film to feature a Vampire's death by sunlight, which formerly only weakened vampires.\nThe next classic treatment of the vampire legend was in Universal's Dracula starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula.\nFive years after the release of the film, Universal released ''Dracula's Daughter, a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, Son of Dracula'', starring Lon Chaney Jr. followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's House of Frankenstein, 1945's House of Dracula and 1948's Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other movies during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula onscreen for the second (and last) time.\nDracula was reincarnated for a new generation in the celebrated Hammer Horror series of films, starring Christopher Lee as the Count. The first of these films Dracula (1958) was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these.\nA distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's Carmilla explored the topic of the lesbian vampire. The first of these was Blood and Roses (1960) by Roger Vadim. More explicit lesbian content was provided in Hammer Studios Karnstein trilogy. The first of these, The Vampire Lovers, (1970), starring Ingrid Pitt and Madeleine Smith, was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality.\nLater films in this subgenre such as Vampyres (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence.\nBeginning with the absurd Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) the vampire film has often been the subject of comedy. The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967) by Academy Award winner Roman Polanski was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include Old Dracula (1974) featuring David Niven as a lovelorn Dracula, Love at First Bite (1979 United States) featuring George Hamilton and Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995 United States, directed by Mel Brooks) with Canadian Leslie Nielsen giving it a comic twist.\nAnother development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. The Last Man on Earth (Italy 1964, directed by Ubaldo Ragona) and The Omega Man (1971 USA, directed by Boris Sagal), both based on Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend, are two examples. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in David Cronenberg's Rabid (1976 Canada), Red-Blooded American Girl (1990 Canada, directed by David Blyth) and Michael and Peter Spierig's Daybreakers (2009 United States).\nRace has been another theme, as exemplified by the blaxploitation picture Blacula (1972) and several sequels.\nSince the time of Bela Lugosi's Dracula (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. There is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal Nosferatu (1922) in which the vampire is depicted in the hideous lineaments of the creature of European folklore. Max Schrek's disturbing portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's remake Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979). In Shadow of the Vampire (2000, directed by E. Elias Merhige), Willem Dafoe plays Max Schrek, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Dafoe's character is the ugly, disgusting creature of the original Nosferatu. The main tradition has, however, been to portray the vampire in terms of a predatory sexuality. Christopher Lee, Delphine Seyrig, Frank Langella, and Lauren Hutton are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex-appeal into their portrayal of the vampire.\nA major character in most vampire films is the vampire slayer, of which Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in Vampires 1998 USA, directed by John Carpenter, Jack Crow (James Woods) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters, and in Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992 USA, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui), writer Joss Whedon (who created TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and spinoff Angel) attached The Slayer, Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson in the film, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV series), to a network of Watchers and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers.\nThe 1973 Serbian horror film Leptirica (\"The She-Butterfly\") was inspired by the story of Sava Savanović.\nOther notable Vampire movies also include the following, but not limited to:\n* \"Dracula\" (1931) starred Bela Lugosi as well he starred in \"Vampire Over London\" (1952) both of which are B/W films.\n* \"The Horror of Dracula\" (1958) starring Peter Cushing (playing Dr. Van Helsing) and co-stars with Christopher Lee.  Christopher Lee's saga of vampire films also includes the following as he personified Dracula in \"Dracula\" Prince of Darkness\" (1966), \"Dracula Had Risen From the Grave\" (1968), \"Count Dracula\" plus \"Taste the Blood of Dracula,\" and \"Scars of Dracula\" all in (1970).  Followed up with \"Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972) -co-starring again with Peter Cushing, as Van Helsing- then \"The Satanic Rites Of Dracula\" with Peter Cushing (1973), and \"Dracula and Son\" (1976).  While Peter Cushing was also in \"Vampire Lovers\" (1970), \"The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires\" and \"Tender Dracula\" (1974).\n* \"Atom Age Vampire\" (1960) B/W film aka  \"Seddok, l'erede di Satana\" starring Alberto Lupo, Susanne Loret, and Sergio Fantoni.  Directed by Anton Giulo Majano with both an Italian and English version of this film released.  A girl Jeanette Moreneau (Susanne Loret) who gets her face mangled in a car accident. Only the mysterious Dr. Levin (Alberto Lupo) can save her face...but at what cost?  (A 70-minute cartoon animated version of this film reflecting its story line was released in 2009).\n* \"Queen Of Blood\" (1966) starred John Saxon as well as Basil Rathbone and shared two elements in common (that being a derelict spaceship that harbors a female vampiric alien played by Florence Marly as the Alien Queen) as is the case too in the much later 1985 Sci-Fi thriller called \"Lifeforce.\"\n* \"Requiem for a Vampire\" (1971) while a mainstream film not widely shown due to its dubious odd-ball content, the film containing full frontal nudity regarding a bizarre tale that includes bats engaged in coitus with women. This film starred Marie-Pierre Castel, Mireille Dargent, and Piilippe Gaste.\n* \"Horror Express\" (1972) is not a vampire movie in the eyes of some, and then again it is a vampire film in the eyes of others.  Like the movie \"Lifeforce\" that breaks the mold of one's lifeforce or i.e. blood being drawn from a person by biting them, mysteriously drawn from their mouths, or as in this film a person's soul or spirit if you will is removed from them leaving them dead with their essence all that they were being drawn out through their eyes...  This film has a sinister character, call him vampiric or prehistoric man, or demon or devil if you will!  The idea is not rightly spelled out with this sinister character attacking passengers aboard a rail road passenger train (an idea that appears likewise to be shared to some degree in Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan's \"The Strain\" with its original vampire character -in this horror TV series- bearing the marks of the devil too, if you will).  \"Horror Express\" stars Peter Cushing, Telly Savalas, and Christopher Lee.\n* \"Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter\" (1974) featuring Caroline Munro (in the starring role as Carla) in this UK film which also starred (Captain Kronos) Horst Janson, (Dr. Marcus) John Carson, (Grost) John Cater; as well as Shane Briant as (Paul Durwood), and others.\n* \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979) \"Werner Herzog's Nosferatue, the Vampyre portrayed by Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula a well meaning replica of Max Schreck's vampire in F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu. As well \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000) picked up the gauntlet and went further being inspired by the classic too in its attempt to pay homage to F.W. Murnau's silent horror classic Nosferatu, while including comic elements to the classic.  All of which is also outlined above.\n* A TV film called \"Salem's Lot\" (1979) was made starring David Soul, who was more popularly known from his TV series \"Starsky and Hutch\" (1975-1979). This movie was then again remade in (2004) with the same title in (2004) starring Rob Lowe.\n* \"Lifeforce\" (1985) film that contained a lot of nudity throughout the film as a female vampire seduces and kisses men to drain out their life force and leaves them dried out like some mummified corpses.  This film has different bases for vampire folklore and has them seeded here from another planet coming here on a spaceship.  Starred Steven Railsback and Mathilda May.\n* One of the first popular vampire films of its decade there came out at the theaters a movie called \"Lost Boys\" in (1987) which quickly became a teen hearttrob film of girls at the time.  It starred Corey Haim, Kiefer Sutherland, and Jason Patric.\n* \"Near Dark\" (1987) starred both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen then in (2009) Lance did another vampire movie that shared a similar plot twist although the film itself with respect to the entirety of the script was different.  However, if you've seen \"Near Dark\" this second film may not hold as much of a novelty as far as the plot twist goes; or vice versa if you've seen \"Daybreakers\" Lance's second vampire movie before \"Near Dark.\"  Both of these actors Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen have also prominently starred together in the (1986) Sci-fi film \"Aliens.\"\n* \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992).  This film is based on the 1897 book.  The film starred Keanu Reeves, Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, and Anthony Hopkins.\n* \"Innocent Blood\" (1992) contains brief nudity in a scene in opening of the feature in its theatrical release.  The film is what is considered a 'dark comedy' with the female vampire having a moral angle to kill but bad people, and thus her involvement with the mob. This film starred:  Anne Parillaud (Marie the vampire), David Proval (Lenny), Robert Luggia (Sal \"The Shark\"),  Rocco Sisto (Gilly), Chazz Palminteri (Tony), Anthony LaPaglia (Joe Gennaro), Don Rickless (Emanuel Bergman), and Christopher Lee (as Count Dracula).\n* A somewhat more popular of the light hearted vampire films was \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" in (1992), featuring a high school girl who found herself gifted with fighting skills to kill vampires, and its spinoff TV series mentioned above.\n* \"Interview With the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles\" (1994) starred Tom Cruise with Brad Pitt, and co-starred actors Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst & Christian Slater. (This film is based on an Anne Rice book as is also the movie \"Queen of the Damned\" mentioned below).\n* \"Embrace of a Vampire\" (1995) a cable TV movie contains some nudity involving a human and her vampire lover with the human girl being played by Alyssa Milano in her most revealing role.\n* \"From Dusk till Dawn\" (1996) over the top Quentin Tarantino film story which inspired a sequel film and in 2014 inspired a TV series spinoff.  This movie was notably starring Salma Hayek, George Clooney, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Harvey Keitel, and John Saxon.\n* The \"Blade\" (1998) and its saga of three films starring Wesley Snipes, one begins to noticeably see a change in the genre of what has been considered the original origins of vampires in popular culture (from that of its original folklore).\n* \"Queen of the Damned\" (2002) regarding a queen vampire played by the beautiful and late actress Aaliyah.  Part of the film's plot deals with a rockstar vampire named Lestat (Stuart Townsend) whose music wakes up the Queen of the damned.  The film is based on Anne Rice novels called \"The Vampire Chronicles\" with the one bearing the title of this movie was published in 1988.  Her writings are also responsible for the film \"Interview with the Vampire\" and the book by the same title was published in 1976 the first of her vampire book series.\n* \"Underworld\" (2003) with its saga of films - are very popular including a story line of wolf Lycans fighting vampires in a well brushed out visuals and CGI effects not completely unlike the \"Twilight\" saga of films that likewise have the same conflict occurring between rivaling factions of wolves and vampires.  Starring Kate Beckinsale as the leding role in this series of movies.\n* \"Van Helsing\" (2004) starred Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale (more popularly known in the Sci-fi community for her portrayal of Selene in the \"Underworld\" saga of films); while this films is said to get a remake starring Tom Cruise.\n* \"30 Days of Night\" (2007) film directed by David Slade about an Alaskan town plunged into darkness with the misfortune of there being vampires there and all mayhem breaks out.\n* \"I Am Legend\" (2007) film starring Will Smith with a sequel in the works.  Original film is called \"The Last Man on Earth\" starring Vincent Price available in its original B/W release or now in a colorized version as well.  A more well known first remake was \"Omega Man\" starring Charlton Heston, or which inspired \"I Am Legend\" film that contained vampires as well as dog vampires all of which had slight zombie features too.  These films are all from a book by the title of this film outlined here; and none of the films follow what is contained in the last couple of pages of the book.  Another interesting point to note in the \"Omega Man\" film we find Chuck a white gentleman being the last man on earth as he meets his love interest, or passion a black woman (Rosalind Cash) the last woman on earth that has not become infected with the virus as is the rest of humanity.  While in the film version of \"I Am Legend\" Will Smith a black man meets a Latina women, who is the last woman apparently on earth; and they don't really get along very well. There is a DVD of \"I Am Legend\" which includes an alternative ending version.\n* Then there are the \"Twilight\" saga films beginning in (2008) which also featured Native American flashbacks in time as the film deals with what it calls werewolves (but would be technically 'skinwalkers') verses or in conflict with a vampire clan with one of each of them, a vampire (Robert Pattinson) playing Edward Cullen, and Native American changeling (Taylor Lautner) bidding for the hand of a mortal girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart).  Notably there are other Native American actors in this saga of films besides Lautner with Native ancestry of (Ottawa and Potawatomi tribes, on his mother's side) playing Jacob Black, they -other natives- include Gil Birmingham (Comanche) who played Billy Black, and Julia Jones (Choctaw and Chickasaw) who played Leah Clearwater. A difference in vampires portrayed in these films (and the book series) is that they don't burn up in the sun—their skin sparkles.  They live in Washington because it is almost always overcast, so their secret is safe.  While this film became a heartthrob film for a new generation of young girl moviegoers like \"Lost Boys\" was of previous generations it is also a notable film to modern day Generation X and Millennials who are hardcore vampire film buffs.\n* \"Dracula Untold\" (2014).  Directed by Gary Shore, and also starring Dominic Cooper, Sarah Gadon, Charles Dance, as well as Art Parkinson.  The film is based on the character in Bram Stoker the novel.\n* What We Do In the Shadows (2014). Originally a short film made in 2005, the feature film version is a mockumentary that follows a group of vampires, Viago, Vladislav, Deacon and Petyr, living together in Wellington, New Zealand. The film follows the daily lives of these flatmates on the run up to an event called the Unholy Masquerade, a masquerade ball where all of the cities undead (vampires, zombies and witches) come together once a year, and how they're shaken up after modern, reckless vampire Nick joins their flat. Directed by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi, this indie originally premiered at Sundance and over the years has gained a firm cult fanbase, getting two spinoffs including the show of the same name, What We Do In The Shadows.\nGames\nof vampires themselves.]]\nAs a well-known and iconic creature type, vampires are central to a variety of games, including board games, role-playing games, and video games.\nThese include a number of games where vampires are either incidental villains, or the primary villain of the game, as well as games that allow players to play as a vampire. It has been noted that vampires are \"supernatural beings with a laundry list of fantastic abilities and a need for feeding on the living, which would presumably give numerous options for a plot\". As late as 2014, however, it was lamented that there were not enough video games featuring vampires, with one commentary noting that \"Vampires have never lent themselves readily to video games\" due to their combination of cerebral and passionate characteristics, which \"need something that most video games can't handle at the best of times, great writing\".\nBoard games and card games\nThe Fury of Dracula is a board game for 2-4 players designed by Stephen Hand and published by Games Workshop in 1987. Fantasy Flight Games released an updated version in 2006 as Fury of Dracula, and a third edition in 2015 by the same name. WizKids Games released a fourth edition in 2019. In the April 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue 132), Jim Bambra liked the first edition of the game, saying, \"[It] takes some of the best elements of role-playing games and neatly transposes them into an intriguing and fun board game.\" Bambra recommended the game, concluding, \"Steeped in Gothic atmosphere and tinged with the unexpected, The Fury of Dracula game deserves to be in every gamer’s collection.\"\nVampire: The Eternal Struggle (published as Jyhad in the first or \"Limited\" edition and often abbreviated as V:TES) is a multiplayer collectible card game published by White Wolf Publishing, set in the World of Darkness. The game was designed in 1994 by Richard Garfield and initially published by Wizards of the Coast and was the third CCG ever created. As Garfield's first follow-up to his popular Magic: The Gathering collectible card game, he was eager to prove that the genre was \"a form of game as potentially diverse as board games\". In 1995 the game was renamed from Jyhad to Vampire: The Eternal Struggle to increase its appeal and distance itself from the Islamic term jihad.\nRole-playing games\nIn the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, the vampire is an undead creature. A humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature can become a vampire, and looks as it did in life, with pale skin, haunting red eyes, and a feral cast to its features. A new vampire is created when another vampire drains the life out of a living creature. Its depiction is related to those in 1930s and 1940s Hollywood Dracula and monster movies. In writing vampires into the game, as with other creatures arising in folklore, the authors had to consider what elements arising in more recent popular culture should be incorporated into their description and characteristics.\nThe vampire was one of the first monsters introduced in the earliest edition of the game, in the Dungeons & Dragons \"white box\" set (1974), where they were described simply as powerful undead. They appeared again in the Greyhawk supplement. The vampire later appeared in the first edition Monster Manual (1977), where its description was changed somewhat to a chaotic evil, night-prowling creature whose powerful negative force drains life energy from victims.\nOne popular Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting, Ravenloft, has as a central character a vampire named Strahd Von Zarovich, who is both ruler and prisoner of his own personal domain of Barovia. How Count Von Zarovich became the darklord of Barovia was detailed in the novel, I, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire.\nOther role-playing games\nThe role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as embrace and sire, appear in contemporary fiction.\nGURPS Cabal, a book that features a customizable campaign setting for the GURPS role-playing game system, depicts a modern-day secret society composed of vampires, lycanthropes and sorcerers who study the underlying principles of magic and visit other planes of existence and was integrated into Infinite Worlds, the \"default\" (core) setting for GURPS's 4th Edition. The Third Edition GURPS supplement Blood Types lists 47 different \"species\" of vampires describing 30 of them from both folklore and fiction in 23 listings (several are simply different names for the same type of vampire; for example the Burma's Kephn is considered a male version of the Penanggalen)\nShadowrun features vampires whose existence is explained by a resurgence of the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus. As such, the afflicted are not undead, but instead are still alive but radically changed by the retrovirus. They normally do not suffer from the supernatural limitations such as crosses, but still are vulnerable to sunlight. In the tabletop wargame Warhammer Fantasy, Vampire Counts are one of the playable forces.\nVideo games\nwas one of the first video games to feature vampires, along with the similar 1986 Spanish game Vampire.]]\nOne of the earliest video games featuring a vampire as the antagonist is The Count, a 1979 text adventure for various platforms, in which local villagers send the player to defeat Count Dracula.\nA number of video game developers \"have taken inspiration from the vampire myth to create unique gaming experiences that have players hunting down the beasts as well as playing as a member of the undead\". Popular video games about vampires include Castlevania, which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel Dracula, and Legacy of Kain.\nA number of websites have compiled \"best of\" lists of vampire games, with games frequently mentioned including Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Darkwatch, Infamous: Festival of Blood, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines.\nWhile most vampire-themed games involve some kind of combat between the player (either fighting vampires, or as a vampire fighting other foes), some games incorporate vampires without including those elements. In particular, The Sims 4 features the game pack, The Sims 4: Vampires, which includes Vampires as a life state, with Gothic-themed objects, outfits, interactions, aspirations, foods, and a Vampire Lore Skill. It is only available for digital download. The pack also features a new neighborhood called Forgotten Hollow which, fitting with the vampiric theme, has longer nighttimes than other neighborhoods. It takes elements from The Sims 2: Nightlife, The Sims 3: Late Night and The Sims 3: Supernatural.\nManga\n* Japanese anime and manga features vampires in several titles, including JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1987), Vampire Princess Miyu (OAV 1988, TV series 1997), Nightwalker: The Midnight Detective (1998), Vampire Hunter D (2000), Blood: The Last Vampire (2000), Hellsing (2002), Vampire Host (2004), Tsukihime, Lunar Legend (2003), Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase- (2004), Bleach (2005), Blood+ (2005),Trinity Blood (2005),Vampire Knight,'(2005)'Karin (2006), Black Blood Brothers (2006), Shiki (2007), Rosario + Vampire (2004) and Castlevania (2017)''.\nMusic\nArtists\nis a gothic black metal band fully concentrating on vampire themes.]]\n* Draconian is a doom metal band with issues facing vampires.\n* The vocalist Kamijo of the Japanese Visual Kei band, Versailles, says his look is influenced by the appearance of a vampire.\n* Theatres des Vampires is a gothic black metal band fully concentrating on vampire themes.\n* Vampire Weekend deliberately chose their name to capitalise on the popularity of vampires in popular culture.\n* Fearless Vampires Killers is an English alternative rock band, which received the name from the 1967 Roman Polanski film The Fearless Vampire Killers\n* Czech gothic rock group XIII.

The model was the famous actress Mrs Patrick Campbell. This femme fatale inspired a poem of the same name (also 1897) by Rudyard Kipling. Like much of Kipling's verse it was incredibly popular, and its inspired many early silent films whose \"vampires\" were actually \"vamps\" rather than being supernatural undead blood-suckers. The 1913 film The Vampire features the famous and controversial \"Vampire Dance\", which takes inspiration from the painting. The poem's refrain: A fool there was . . . , describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular film A Fool There Was (1915) which made Theda Bara a star, and the archetypal cinematic \"vamp\".\nRadio\nThere have been many interpretations of vampires over the years for mystery and horror radio anthology programs, including several adaptations of Sheridan Le Fanu's novella Carmilla and Bram Stoker's novel Dracula.\n* Dracula, adapted from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula by John Houseman and Orson Welles for Mercury Theatre On the Air's first ever broadcast on July 11, 1938.
