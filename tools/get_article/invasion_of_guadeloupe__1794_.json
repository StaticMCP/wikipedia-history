The British had negotiated with the French planters, Ignace-Joseph-Philippe de Perpignan and Louis de Curt, who wished to gain British protection, as France's National Convention was passing a law abolishing slavery on 4 February 1794. The Whitehall Accord was signed on 19 February 1794 while the British were securing Martinique in the Battle of Martinique (1794).\nTroops led by General Charles Grey landed in Guadeloupe on 11 April 1794, assisted by a fleet led by Admiral Sir John Jervis. On 24 April French general Georges Henri Victor Collot surrendered the last stronghold at Basse-Terre, leaving the island in the hands of the British and their French Royalist allies. On 4 June a French fleet landed troops under the command of Victor Hugues who, with the assistance of French Republican locals, helped by the effect of yellow fever and other tropical diseases on the British forces, regained full control of the island by 10 December 1794.\nTroops and people involved\n* 6th Regiment of Foot\n* 43rd Regiment of Foot\n* Major-General Thomas Dundas (appointed governor of Guadeloupe, but died of yellow fever 3 June 1794)\nReferences\n*"
