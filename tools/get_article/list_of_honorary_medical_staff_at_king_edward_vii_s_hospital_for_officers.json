In 1914, Sister Agnes compiled a list of 23 honorary physicians and surgeons just a few days before the First World War. Although open to all London consultants, at that time, the status of the medical staff on the list was considered such that patients rarely requested the service from any other London physician or surgeon. The list was abandoned in 1919 and reinstated when the new hospital opened in Beaumont Street in 1948.\nClosely associated with the Royal Family, the hospital was noted around the time of its centenary, to have in its list of physicians and surgeons around 100 staff, which required the inclusion of the Royal Medical Household. In 2018 there were 300 physicians and surgeons at the hospital working under a \"practising privileges agreement\", granted after the consultant selection and review committee (CSRC) approve and invite a consultant.\n1904 list\n]]\nThe King Edward VII's Hospital was established first as Sister Agnes' hospital in 1899 by Sister Agnes, and then formally opened as King Edward VII's Hospital for Officers in 1904 by King Edward VII. The hospital's honorary medical staff were first selected and appointed by the King. On 6 July 1904 Buckingham palace released a list of the honorary medical staff, headed by Sir Frederick Treves, who is credited with saving the King's life by performing an operation on his appendix, and Sir Thomas Smith who was present at that operation.
