He graduated from Lawrence High School.\nBorder War and World War I\nSirois joined the Massachusetts National Guard at the age of 17. In 1916 he was sent to the Mexican border during the Border War. During World War I he went to France with the 102nd Field Artillery Regiment. He took part in major engagements and was wounded. In 1919 he was promoted to lieutenant. His promotion required an act of Congress as he was only 20 years old (officers were supposed to be at least 21 years old).\nPolitical career\nFrom 1921 to 1922, Sirois served as a service clerk for the city of Lawrence. In 1922 he was appointed manager of the United States Veterans' Bureau sub-district office in Lawrence. Following his father's death in 1924, Sirois took over his florist business. From 1935 to 1941, Sirois represented the 5th Essex District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. In 1937, he was a candidate in the Massachusetts's 7th congressional district special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of William P. Connery Jr. Sirois upset C. F. Nelson Pratt in the Republican primary, but lost to Connery's brother, Lawrence J. Connery, in the general election. From 1940 to 1941, Sirois was chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party. He served as Robert F. Bradford's campaign manager during the 1946 gubernatorial election.\nWorld War II\nSirois remained in the National Guard after World War I and went into service when President Franklin D. Roosevelt federalized Massachusetts' National Guard units. He began the war as the commander of one of the 26th Infantry Division's field artillery battalions. He spent the last two years of the war in the China Burma India Theater. He organized the Army's first tank-destroyer battalion and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work at the General Staff School for Chinese officers. He was discharged in 1946 as a colonel.\nLater life and death\nIn September 1946, Sirois was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of the Yankee Division's four artillery battalions. His appointment was made by Governor Maurice J. Tobin while Sirois was managing the campaign of Tobin's gubernatorial opponent, Robert F. Bradford. In 1951, Sirois assumed command of the Yankee Division following the retirement of William I. Rose. He was promoted to major general in 1952. Sirois retired in 1956.\nOutside of the National Guard, Sirois was the executive vice president and treasurer of the Mutual Fire Insurance Association of New England until his retirement in 1959.\nSirois died on February 18, 1968, at Nashoba Community Hospital in Ayer, Massachusetts.\nSee also\n* 1935–1936 Massachusetts legislature\n* 1937–1938 Massachusetts legislature\n* 1939 Massachusetts legislature\nReferences"
