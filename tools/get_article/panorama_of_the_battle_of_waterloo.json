The neoclassical building is located immediately to the north of the Lion's Mound on the battlefield of the Battle of Waterloo in the municipality of Braine-l'Alleud in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant.\nDesign\nThe rotunda was designed by the architect  in 1911. It has an external diameter of  and stands  high, with a conical roof. The white painted brick walls of the rotunda are decorated with recessed blind arches separated by Ionic pilasters, and crowned with parapet with a frieze of palmettes.  The entrance porch has two pairs of Tuscan columns supporting a triangular pediment.\nThe rotunda houses an oil-on-canvas painting completed by French artist Louis Dumoulin in 1912, with 14 canvas panels sewn together to create a cylinder approximately  in circumference and  high.  It is lit from above by a ring of glazing around the edge of the conical roof and is viewed from a  high platform at the centre of the rotunda.\nThe painting depicts several different episodes from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, concentrating on charges by French cavalry.  Physical elements in front of the painting, including cut-out figures, fences and bodies made of plaster and papier mache, disguise the lower edge of the painting and enhance its immersive quality.\nThe building and the painting were protected as historical monuments in 1998.  In 2008 the Belgian government proposed that the panorama should be included within a UNESCO World Heritage Site listing.\nThe Waterloo Panorama is one of few original panoramas that have survived and which are still exhibited in their original location.  Other panoramas of the Battle of Waterloo, by Charles Verlat,  Paul Philippoteaux and  have been lost.\nFile:Waterloo panorama museum.JPG|The rotunda as seen from the Lion's Mound\nFile:Panorama de la Bataille de Waterloo 02.JPG|The entrance\nFile:Belgium-6745C - Marshal Ney (14154954584).jpg|Painting detail: Marshal Ney of France leading a charge\nFile:Belgium-6756 - Duke of Wellington - back right (14152047342).jpg|Painting detail: the Duke of Wellington and his staff (top right) sheltering from French cuirassiers in a square of Highland infantry\nSee also\n* List of Waterloo Battlefield locations\nReferences\n* Based on a translation of the French article\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5364/ Le Panorama de la Bataille de Waterloo, exemple particulièrement significatif de « Phénomène de Panoramas »], UNESCO submission, 8 April 2008"
