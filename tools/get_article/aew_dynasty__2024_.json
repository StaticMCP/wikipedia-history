It was the inaugural Dynasty event and took place on Sunday, April 21, 2024, at Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, marking AEW's first pay-per-view event to be held in Missouri.\nTwelve matches were contested at the event, including three on the \"Zero Hour\" pre-show. In the main event, Swerve Strickland defeated Samoa Joe to win the AEW World Championship. In other prominent matches, The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) defeated FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) in a tournament final Ladder match to win the vacant AEW World Tag Team Championship and become record-setting three-time champions, Will Ospreay defeated Bryan Danielson in a highly acclaimed \"dream match\", and Willow Nightingale defeated Julia Hart to win the AEW TBS Championship. The event also featured the return of Jack Perry, who had been absent from AEW programming since a legitimate backstage altercation at All In London in August 2023.\nThe event was praised by fans and journalists, particularly for the Will Ospreay vs. Bryan Danielson match. Some referred to the match as one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time.\nProduction\nin St. Louis, Missouri.]]\nBackground\nOn February 22, 2024, the American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) filed to trademark the name \"Dynasty\". At Revolution on March 3, AEW announced that it would hold a pay-per-view (PPV) event titled Dynasty on April 21, 2024, at the Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, marking AEW's first PPV event to be held in the state. The 2021 Full Gear was originally scheduled for the same venue and would have been AEW's first PPV event in Missouri; however, it was relocated and rescheduled to avoid counter programming against other combat sporting events happening at the time. Tickets for Dynasty went on sale on March 8, 2024.\nStorylines\nAEW Dynasty featured professional wrestling matches that were the result of pre-existing feuds and storylines, with results being predetermined by AEW's writers. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Collision, and Rampage, and the YouTube series Being The Dark Order.\nFrom mid-2022 through 2023, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) mainstay Will Ospreay had appeared on AEW programming as a result of a working relationship between the two companies. Ospreay then appeared at Full Gear in November 2023 and signed a contract to join AEW, but did not officially join the roster until February 2024 after his NJPW obligations were fulfilled. Following Ospreay's match on the March 6 episode of Dynamite, he was confronted by Bryan Danielson. The two confronted each other again on the March 9 episode of Collision where Danielson issued a challenge at Dynasty to prove which of them was the best, and the match was later made official.\nFollowing Sting's retirement match at Revolution, he and tag partner Darby Allin vacated the AEW World Tag Team Championship. During the post-event media scrum, AEW president Tony Khan announced that a tournament would be held to determine new champions. On the March 15 episode of Rampage, the tournament bracket was revealed and the tournament began on the following night's Collision. The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) and FTR (Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler) won their respective brackets, setting up the tournament final for Dynasty, which was scheduled as a ladder match, also being a title rematch between the teams, as they last faced each other for the title at All In London in August 2023, which FTR won. During the April 10 episode of Dynamite, The Young Bucks showed the surveillance footage of the legitimate backstage altercation between Jack Perry and former AEW wrestler CM Punk, which they blamed as the reason for why they lost their match to FTR at All In. They also defended Perry and conspired that FTR were behind the incident due to being friends with Punk.\nAt Revolution, Swerve Strickland competed in a three-way match for the AEW World Championship where Samoa Joe retained the title. Strickland then accumulated wins throughout March to rise back up in the contendership rankings. Following his victory on the March 27 episode of Dynamite, it once again positioned him as the number one contender for the AEW World Championship, and the title match was scheduled for Dynasty.\nIn late 2023, Willow Nightingale's former tag team partner Skye Blue turned heel for the first time in her AEW career and aligned herself with TBS Champion Julia Hart. Throughout early 2024, Nightingale and her new tag team partner Kris Statlander feuded with Hart and Blue, with Nightingale and Statlander being victorious during the Revolution Zero Hour pre-show and then Hart and Blue victorious in a street fight on the March 20 episode of Rampage. On the March 27 episode of Dynamite, Nightingale defeated Statlander, Blue, and Anna Jay in a four-way match to challenge Hart for the TBS Championship at Dynasty.\nThroughout the early months of 2024, Mark Briscoe engaged in a feud with House of Black (Malakai Black, Brody King, and Buddy Matthews), which included interfering in the House's AEW World Tag Team Championship tournament match. At the same time, he was also engaged in a friendly rivalry with Eddie Kingston over the latter's ROH World Championship. After House of Black attacked TNT Champion Adam Copeland during the March 30 episode of Collision, Briscoe and Kingston came out in support of Copeland, leading to the three men challenging House of Black to a trios match at Dynasty, which was later made official.\nThunder Rosa won her first AEW Women's World Championship at St. Patrick's Day Slam in March 2022 and was due to defend the title against Toni Storm at All Out in September of that year. However, due to Rosa being sidelined by a back injury, Storm instead won a four-way match at All Out to become interim champion, which was later retroactively recognized as her first reign after Rosa forfeited the title that November. Storm, who took on a \"Timeless\" gimmick in late 2023 impersonating a golden era film actress, won her third AEW Women's World Championship at that year's Full Gear. After Rosa returned to in-ring action in December 2023, Rosa laid claim to the championship she never lost, and quickly rose through the rankings to face Storm's protegé Mariah May on the April 4 episode of Dynamite in a number-one contendership match, which she won, and the title match was scheduled for Dynasty.\nEvent\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role\n!Name\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Commentators\n|Excalibur\n|-\n|Tony Schiavone\n|-\n|Taz\n|-\n|Nigel McGuinness\n|-\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Anthony Ogogo\n|-\n|Stokely Hathaway\n|-\n|Don Callis\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Justin Roberts\n|-\n|rowspan=7|Referees\n|Aubrey Edwards\n|-\n|Bryce Remsburg\n|-\n|Mike Posey\n|-\n|Paul Turner\n|-\n|Rick Knox\n|-\n|Stephon Smith\n|-\n|Brandon Martinez\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show hosts\n|Renee Paquette\n|-\n|RJ City\n|}\nPre-show\nIn the first match of the Dynasty: Zero Hour pre-show, Trent Beretta faced Matt Sydal (accompanied by Mike Sydal).

Obviously, watch Danielson and Ospreay, but go out of you way to watch Pac/Okada, Toni Storm/Thunder Rosa, O’Reilly/Strong, and FTR/Young Bucks, too. A night filled with unbelievable wrestling, excellent storytelling, and compelling twists and turns. When you sit back and look at the big picture, there is a heck of a bright future ahead for AEW\".\nErik Beaston of Bleacher Report graded the show an A, saying \"On paper, Dynasty was one of the best cards in AEW history. In execution, Dynasty had one of the best cards in AEW history. Whether AEW can build on the momentum remains to be seen. The company has had many great PPV offerings before, only to fall back into the same booking traps.\nPhil Wheat of Nerdly gave the overall show a 4.5/5, saying \"Just when you think AEW can’t do it better, they do. What can you really say about a PPV this good? Yes there are some low points – in particular the Jericho/Hook match (as you’ll hear from the fans in attendance) – but overall this was an amazing pay-per-view. Definitely an instant classic pay-per-view, Dynasty raised AEW out of the doldrums it has been in for a lot of 2024\".\nJohn Canton of TJR Wrestling.net gave the overall show an 8.25/10, saying \"it was a very good show as usual for most AEW PPVs. Other than that, it was mostly just bell-to-bell action with a few title changes. I think most of the match results were predictable and I did pretty well in terms of picking the winners. A predictable show isn’t bad by any means. Just saying that there weren’t many surprises in terms of results or moments. Good job AEW and the St. Louis crowd was awesome too. I enjoyed the show\".\nMichael Dworkis of The Pop Break simply said \"Dynasty earns its own title for best PPV of the year thus far. Almost every match delivered something memorable. There was so much to become invested in, I can’t imagine any fan of wrestling dismissing what was one of the best lineups in recent history\".\nWrestling journalist Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter rated the Ospreay vs. Danielson match six and a half stars—the second highest rating ever given after Kenny Omega and Kazuchika Okada's seven-star match at NJPW's Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall in 2018—and described the match as \"the second-best match [he's] ever seen\".
