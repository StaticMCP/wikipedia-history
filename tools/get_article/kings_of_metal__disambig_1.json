The album was the last to feature guitarist and founding member Ross \"The Boss\" Friedman, who later went on to rejoin punk band The Dictators. Drummer Scott Columbus left the band after this album as well, but rejoined for 1996's Louder Than Hell and remained with the band until 2008.\nIn 2017, Loudwire ranked it as the 13th-best power metal album of all time.
