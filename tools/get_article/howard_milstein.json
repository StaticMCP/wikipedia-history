In 2016, a Brooklyn jury found Emigrant Bank to have targeted minorities with predatory mortgages with rates of up to 18 percent. While these loans are now illegal, Milstein testified at trial that the lending was a community service because it provided capital for people who could otherwise not afford it. Between 2004 and 2009, the amount of delinquent loans at the bank had doubled from around 25% to 50%, with the highest commissions paid to employees who brought in subprime loans.\nHe is chairman of Sarasota Private Bank & Trust and Cleveland Private Bank & Trust, both with majority ownership by Milstein and his family along with local co-founders.

In 1986, Milstein started Liberty Cable as an alternative telecommunications supplier for the Milford Plaza Hotel.

The business was primarily centered in golf course design, golf equipment, and licensing for clothing and other items. In 2018, Milstein formed 8AM Golf, the holding company for Nicklaus Companies, which operates various global golfing brands, including Golf Magazine and Golf.com. On September 20, 2023, 8AM Golf announced a new golf-themed venture in collaboration with Tiger Woods and Justin Timberlake to open a sports bar in Manhattan, New York.\nCivic\nIn November 2010, Milstein was selected by Andrew Cuomo to be on the incoming New York governor's transition team as a member of the Committee on Economic Development & Labor.
