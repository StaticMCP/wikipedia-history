To read about the background of these events, see Ancient Rome and History of the Byzantine Empire.\nEvents and persons of the Kingdom of Rome (and to some degree of the early Republic) are legendary, and their accounts are considered to have varying degrees of veracity.\nFollowing tradition, this timeline marks the deposition of Romulus Augustulus and the Fall of Constantinople as the end of Rome in the west and east, respectively.  See Third Rome for a discussion of claimants to the succession of Rome.\nMillennia: 1st BC1st–2nd\nCenturies: 7th BC6th BC5th BC4th BC3rd BC2nd BC1st BC1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7th8th9th10th11th12th13th14th15th\n8th and 7th centuries BC\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%”\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n| |  || || Battle of Alba Longa.
