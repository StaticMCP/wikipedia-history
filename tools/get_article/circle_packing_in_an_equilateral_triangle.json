Optimal solutions have been proved for , and for any triangular number of circles, and conjectures are available for .\nA conjecture of Paul Erdős and Norman Oler states that, if  is a triangular number, then the optimal packings of  and of  circles have the same side length: that is, according to the conjecture, an optimal packing for  circles can be found by removing any single circle from the optimal hexagonal packing of  circles. This conjecture is now known to be true for . In a paper by Graham and Lubachevsky concerning solutions for  they also conjectured seven infinite families of optimal solutions in addition to the one by Erdős and Oler. These families give conjectured solutions for many more numbers, including .\nMinimum solutions for the side length of the triangle:\n{| class=\"wikitable defaultright col2center\"\n|-\n!
