Polish-Lithuanian forces under the command of Jan Zamoyski defeated the Wallachian forces commanded by Michael the Brave.\nThe battle, which took place in Bucov (in modern-day Prahova County) was fierce, and lasted several hours. After having sustained heavy losses, Michael the Brave retreated towards Craiova, with the hope of organizing a more efficient resistance.\nReferences\n* Dariusz Skorupa, Bitwa pod Bukowem 20 października 1600 r. {w} Staropolska sztuka wojenna XVI-XVII wieku- \"Fasciculi Historici Novi\", Tom V, 2002"
