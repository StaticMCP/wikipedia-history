This show is the second season of Protégé where Krizza Neri won in 2011. Unlike the previous season, the age limit was set from 13 to 21 years old to find new acting talent. The show premiered on July 23, 2012 (Inside Protégé) and hosted by Jennylyn Mercado and under the direction of Albert Langitan, while the Protégé Gala Night premiered on August 5, 2012, and presented by Dingdong Dantes, together with Carla Abellana and Maxene Magalona. The gala nights were directed by Rommel Gacho.\nOverview\nAccording to the show's fan page, there will be a \"new kind of battle\". Rumor has it that the incoming season will feature the other talent like acting or dancing and eventually will be an artista search like StarStruck did and it turned out to be true.\nThe show followed the same format as the previous season, except that it was no longer a singing competition but a talent artista search. Aspirants from ages 13 to 21 were filtered until two winners emerge - one male and one female protégé. In this battle, they were looking for a total package - an artist who can sing, dance, act and possess that charismatic appeal over TV. Like the first Protégé competition, this season had judges/mentors who were responsible for training and mentoring the chosen candidates.\nTwenty contestants were then selected from thousands of hopefuls. These 20 potential artists lived in the Protégé house complete with amenities including bedrooms for each contestant, a living room, dining area with a 20 seating capacity, a rehearsal area where they could practice dancing, singing and acting, and a confession room where they were asked to explain themselves in case of issues within the house or if a task was to be assigned privately. They also battled it out head to head for audience votes. The Protégé house was blessed and featured over the news of GMA Network long before the contestants resided there.\nThe winner received a 5-year contract with GMA Network.\nJudges, mentors and coaches\nJudges\n* Joey de Leon\n* Bert de Leon\n* Annette Gozon-Valdez\n* Cherie Gil\nMentors\nThere were five confirmed mentors for this season with their assigned location.\n* Ricky Davao—Northern and Central Luzon\n* Roderick Paulate—Mega Manila\n* Gina Alajar—Southern Luzon\n* Jolina Magdangal—Visayas\n* Phillip Salvador—Mindanao\nCoaches\nAside from their respective mentors who served as their guardian all the way through their journey, the protégés had coaches who also helped them improve their chosen craft.\n* Voice — Sushi Reyes\n* Dancing — Joe Abuda\n* Personality development — Floy Quintos\n* Acting — Maryo J. de los Reyes and Yanni Yuzon with Pen Medina\n* Fitness — Al Galang\n* Showbiz values & formation — German Moreno\nAuditions\n}}\nAuditions took place in the following cities:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

The bottom ten (2 per region) have to defend their slot in the next gala night in order to stay in the competition. The losing protégé will be sent home.\n|LineColor= F87431\n}}\n|ShortSummary= The bottom ten performed individually.

Because of the unexpected twists, the mentors were not able to decide on who they will choose.\n|LineColor= F87431\n}}\n|ShortSummary= The mentors finally chose their protégés who will stay under their guidance. Mentor Gina Alajar chose Thea Tolentino while mentor Ricky Davao chose Shelly Hipolito and mentor Jolina Magdangal chose Mikoy Morales. On the other hand, mentors Phillip Salvador and Roderick Paulate have only one protégé left each. As the gala night ends, the mentor chose another protégé from the other mentor's former protégés, signalling that that was the third \"shock\".
