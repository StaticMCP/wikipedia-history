The accident took place on [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sinjil/@32.0336066,35.263935,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x151cd77eac80503d:0x86390871fdd5cf65 Highway 60], an intercity road where the speed limit is 80&nbsp;km/h (50 Miles/h).\n* On 22 October, Adbel-Rahman Shaloudi, a 21-year-old Palestinian, who is said to have joined Hamas in prison, and who came from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, rammed his car into a group of passengers waiting at the Ammunition Hill Light Rail station. The attack left two dead, including a three-month-old baby, and seven injured. Shaloudi was shot dead while running from the scene. A brief uptick in Arab rioting followed. NGOs, such as Amnesty International and B'Tselem claim that Shaludi's case, and several others in similar incidents where a suspect was killed on the spot, raise suspicions that Israel is encouraging a policy of extrajudicial killings, or executions without trial.\n* On 24 October 2014, Urwah Abd al-Wahab Abd al-Ghani Khaleq (14) of Silwad, was shot dead by soldiers while he was trying to throw a Molotov cocktail at a car on Route 60.\n* On 30 October 2014, American-born Jewish activist Yehuda Glick was the subject of an assassination attempt.

His call to Palestinians to protect the Temple Mount from visits by Jews \"by any means\" has been widely viewed in Israel as incitement to violence. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu characterized Abbas' call as part of \"a wave of incitement by radical Islamic elements and by Palestinian Authority Chairman Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas)\".\nAbbas' Fatah Party called for Friday, 31 October 2014, to be a \"Day of Rage\" in Jerusalem. The protests on 31 October and on 1 November were not notably large and there was little violence.\nNovember 2014\nWeeks of unrest and high tension ensued after the visit on 2 November by Moshe Feiglin to the Temple Mount, after Prime Minister Netanyahu called for restraint and Jordan warned that attempts to alter the status quo of the Haram al-Sharif would imperil the Jordan-Israel peace agreement.\nDuring the first three weeks of the month, Israeli police and soldiers detained some 380 Palestinians, adding to more than 5000 in prison, and another 200 in \"administrative detention\".

Al-Akri was shot dead by police after getting out of his van and attacking people with a metal rod. The attack left three dead, including the perpetrator, and thirteen wounded, one of whom a Palestinian. A border police was killed on the site, Yeshiva student Shalom Ba'adani (17) was critically hurt and succumbed to his wounds several days later. The injured Palestinian, 60 years old, was reported as an Israeli victim, but handcuffed as a suspected accomplice, and died of his injuries on December 7.\n* On 5 November, an additional vehicular attack occurred just hours after the Jerusalem Light Rail attack. Hamam Jamal Badawi Masalmeh drove at high speed into three Soldiers waiting at a bus stop. All three were injured in this attack. Masalmeh fled the scene and the next morning he turned himself in to the police claiming it was an accident.

Shiloni was on the phone with his girlfriend, when 18-year-old Nur al-Din Abu Khashiyeh, a resident of Nablus illegally staying in Israel, stabbed him in the stomach. Shiloni sustained massive blood loss and succumbed to his wounds at the Tel HaShomer Medical Center in Ramat Gan. Abu Khashiyeh was chased and eventually taken into custody by Israeli police.\n* On Monday, 10 November 2014, four hours after the killing of Shiloni, Maher al-Hashlamun stabbed three Israelis at the entrance to the settlement of Alon Shvut in Gush Etzion, killing a young woman, Dalia Lemkus (26), and wounding two others.

Israeli sources say they mistook him for someone else.\n* On 12 November, the Al-Mughayyir mosque in the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate was damaged extensively when it was torched, reportedly by settlers in what was believed to be a price-tag attack. Israeli police say the incident does not match previous 'price tag' attacks, and that a full investigation was impossible because they were denied entry to the village by Palestinian authorities. According to Haaretz journalist Chaim Levinson, it was the 10th such mosque subject to arson in Israel and the West Bank since June 2011, and no investigation has ever led to an indictment.\n* On 12 November, a group of religious settlers damnaged trees and reportedly tried to set fire to crops while touring and performing religious rites near Nahalin in the Bethlehem Governorate.\n* On 13 November 2014, Saleh Mahmoud (an 11-year-old Palestinian boy) was shot in the face by a foam-tipped bullet fired by Israeli forces during clashes in the Isawiya neighborhood of East Jerusalem.

Hamas praised the stabbing.\n* On 16 November 2014, Yussuf al-Ramuni, a Palestinian bus driver working for Israeli Egged company, was found hanged in his bus in Har Hotzvim. Israeli police conducted an autopsy, determining that the hanging was a suicide and that \"there were no signs of violence on the body\". The autopsy report, reportedly written by an Arab coroner, was to be handed over to Ramuni's family, along with his body. However, the family and friends of the man disputed that claim. According to his family's lawyer, a Palestinian doctor who attended the autopsy stated that al-Ramuni had been murdered. Al-Ramuni's coworker, Muatasem Fakeh, claimed he saw evidence of violence on al-Ramuni's body, and that it wasn't possible to hang oneself, where he was found, on the back stepos of the bus. The bus driver's family said he had been a happy man, and accused \"settlers\" of killing him. The Israeli director of the Institute where the autopsy was performed stated that the Palestinian doctor, Sabir al-Aloul, concurred that the cause of death was suicide. However, the Palestinian doctor, director of Al-Quds University's Institute of Forensic Medicine, has gone on the record stating that he suspects foul play: his first vertebra was not dislocated and livor mortis signs were on his buttocks, not his legs. The pathologist refused to answer a summons to be questioned by Israeli police.\n:: Al-Ramuni's funeral was attended by thousands. At the mourners' tent in Jabel Mukaber, according to a Ynet source, the idea he had committed suicide was dismissed by all; those who feel crazy, it was claimed by locals, always go to the mosque and, bowing their head to the ground, discharge their madness by \"earthing\", a metaphor the locals, eletricians to much of Jerusalem, use. People there do not commit suicide, they claimed. The Palestinian foreign ministry accused the Israeli police of \"attempts to hide the hideous crime\" by claiming it was suicide. With rumours about the alleged murder running rampant, small riots broke out on the night of 16 November, in a number of Jerusalem locations, including At-Tur, Isawiya, Abu Dis, and Ras al-Amud.

Two police officers arrived on the scene and exchanged fire with the murderers, killing both. Zidan Saif, an ethnic Druze police officer, was killed in the firefight and another was wounded.
