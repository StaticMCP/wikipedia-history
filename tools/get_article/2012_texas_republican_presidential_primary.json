That date is uncertain and the primary was expected to be held, earliest in late May 2012, with both May 22 and May 29 being proposed. U.S. District Court judge Xavier Rodriguez, one of the three judges overseeing the litigation, had suggested a June 26 date for the election. Finally, on March 1, 2012, the court issued an order setting the date of the primary to May 29, 2012.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates achieved on the ballot:\n* Mitt Romney\n* Ron Paul\n* Rick Santorum (withdraw)\n* Newt Gingrich (withdraw)\n* Uncommitted (voting option)\n* Michele Bachmann (withdraw)\n* Jon Huntsman (withdraw)\n* Buddy Roemer (withdraw)\n* L.
