By the second half of the 7th century, most of the Slavs in proximity to Byzantium had recognized the Emperor's supreme rule.\nThe unnamed 7th-century Serbian ruler (prince, archon) who led the Serbs to the Balkans and received the protection of Heraclius (r. 610–641) was an ancestor of the Vlastimirović dynasty. The Serbs at that time were organized into župe, a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local župan (a magistrate or governor). According to Fine, the governorship was hereditary, and the župan reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war. Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r.&nbsp;913–959) mentions that the Serbian throne is inherited by the son, i.e. the first-born, though in one occasion there is a triumvirate in his enumeration of monarchs.\nAccording to the Royal Frankish Annals, written in 822, Ljudevit went from his seat at Sisak to the Serbs somewhere in Western Balkans, \"who are said to hold a great/large part of Dalmatia\" (ad Sorabos, quae natio magnam Dalmatiae partem obtinere dicitur). According to the DAI, \"baptized Serbia\" included the \"inhabited cities\" (kastra oikoumena) of Destinikon, Tzernabouskeï, Megyretous, Dresneïk, Lesnik and Salines, while the \"small land\" (chorion) of Bosnia, reportedly part of Serbia, had the cities of Katera and Desnik. Accordingly, Serbia included lands around rivers Lim, Tara, Piva, Ibar, West Morava, Upper Drina and Upper Bosna.\nGrand Principality of Serbia\n*Luška\n*Budva\n*Onogošt\n*Oblik\n*Ribnica\n*Ston\n*Popovo\n*Dubrava\n*Luka\n*Dabar\n*Žapska\n*Gorička\n*Večenik\n*Trebinje\n*Urmo\n*Konavlje\n*Risan\n*Rudina\n*Ras\n*Drina\n*Patkovo\n*Hvosno\n*Podrimlje\n*Toplica\n*Ibar\n*Rasina\n*West Morava\n*Dubočica\n*Kostrc\n*Draškovina\n*Sitnica\n*Lab\n*Lipljan\n*Glbočica\n*Reke\n*Uska\n*Pomoravlje\n*Zagrlata\n*Levče\n*Belica\n*Lim\n*Kujavča\n*Zatrnava\n*Raban\n*Pilot\nKingdom of Serbia\nSerbian Empire\nSee also\n*Administrative divisions of modern Serbia\n*Administrative divisions of Serbia\nReferences\nSources\n;Primary sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n;Secondary sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
