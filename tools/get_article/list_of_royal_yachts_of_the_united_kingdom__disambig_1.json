The plan for the ship is to \"host trade fairs, ministerial summits and diplomatic talks\", fulfilling functions in a similar capacity to previous Royal Yachts. The ship would be crewed by the Royal Navy. The cost was placed at between £200M and £250M. Some reports suggested the yacht would be named after the late Duke of Edinburgh. By late 2022, some reports suggested that the UK government might not proceed with the new yacht.\nSee also\n* Royal Yacht Squadron\n* Royal barge of the United Kingdom\n* Royal Mews\n* State and royal cars of the United Kingdom\n* Air transport of the Royal Family and government of the United Kingdom\n* British Royal Train\n* List of imperial and royal yachts by country\nReferences\nSources\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071018175256/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/history/history%7Bcapbadges1%7D.htm Royal Marines Bands]\n* [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/11/02/119083269.pdf New York Times archive] The end of the Royal Tour of 1901\n* [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/07/117897269.pdf New York Times archive] Ordering the new yacht in 1897\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/5knt1nAh3?url=http://www.geocities.com/hampshireanddorsetshipwrecks/5.html Hampshire and Dorset shipwrecks] Collision of HMY Albee with the Mistletoe\n* [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/06/27/117906123.pdf New York Times archive] Review of the Fleet 1897\n* [https://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk The Royal Yacht Britannia, Leith, Edinburgh.
