It takes its name from Balaam's Wood, a nearby woodland dating from at least 1600. An Ofsted inspection in January 2016 stated that the school 'Requires Improvement'.\nPreviously a community school administered by Birmingham City Council, in September 2019 Balaam Wood School converted to academy status and was renamed King Edward VI Balaam Wood Academy. The school is now sponsored by the King Edward VI Academy Trust.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://bwa.kevibham.org/ King Edward VI Balaam Wood Academy official website]"
