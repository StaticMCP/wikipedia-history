CEO and founder Marcin Kleczynski, originally from Poland, was still a teenager attending high school in Bensenville, Illinois, and was working as a technician in a computer repair shop in Chicago. He noticed that whenever infected computers arrived, the shop would typically reformat the computer entirely, rather than combat the virus, even if the infection was only minor. Kleczynski later discovered that, when his mother's computer became infected, neither McAfee nor Symantec would remove the malware from his system. He later recalled \"I've never been as angry as when I got my computer infected\", and professed that his mother told him to fix it \"under penalty of death\".\nIt was only after Kleczynski posted on the forum SpywareInfo that he was able to learn how to remove the virus, which took three days. The company was unofficially founded after this, when Kleczynski conversed and became friends with several of the editors of the forum, who tempted him to buy an unused domain from them.\nWith one of the site's regulars, Bruce Harrison, Kleczynski wrote the inaugural version of the company's software. In 2006, Kleczynski worked with a college roommate to produce a freely available program called \"RogueRemover\", a utility which specialized in fighting against a type of infection known as \"rogues\", which scam computer users into giving away their credit card information through fake anti-virus software. RogueRemover proved instrumental in developing Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, and Kleczynski was able to set up a forum which enabled him to improve the software through feedback.\nKleczynski and Harrison formally launched Malwarebytes on January 21, 2008, while Kleczynski was studying computer science at the University of Illinois. Bruce became the VP of Research for Malwarebytes, and further hired Doug Swanson, with experience in freeware development to work for the new company. Marcus Chung, an e-commerce expert who formerly worked for GreenBorder, was hired as chief operating officer. Kleczynski and Harrison reportedly made $600,000 in their first year of selling the software, despite not having met personally at the time.\nPost-2010 developments\nIn 2012, Malwarebytes acquired HPhosts, a website blacklisting company, which tracks blacklisted websites and ad servers, a necessary development to protect against new internet protocol addresses and web servers which distribute malware, and advise internet service providers to shut down those with malicious activity. That year, the company had claimed to have removed over five billion pieces of Malware in three years. The following year, the company launched into the corporate market with an enterprise product aimed at desktop-based anti-malware detection and protection. In 2013, Malwarebytes acquired ZeroVulnerabilityLabs, Inc., a security research and development company founded by Pedro Bustamante, which protects software applications from \"known and zero-day exploits used by exploit kits, web-based vulnerability exploits and other corporate-targeted attacks\". They expanded their malware removal and protection to the Android platform with the launch of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Mobile, and launched a USB-based product called Malwarebytes Techbench aimed at helping technicians remove malware.\nBy 2013, it claimed to have removed five billion malware threats from computers in its first five years. In 2014, Malwarebytes received $30&nbsp;million in funding from Highland Capital Partners, and by the following year, announced it had treated 250 million computers worldwide, representing about 20–25% of working business computers.\nIn June 2015, the company announced that it was moving its headquarters from 10 Almaden Boulevard in San Jose, California to a new  office space on the two top floors of the 12-story 3979 Freedom Circle in Santa Clara, California. The company reported a growth of 10 million users in just one year, from 25 to 35&nbsp;million active users, and an increase in revenue by 1653% in 2014. In 2015, Kleczynski was named one of Forbes Magazine's '30 Under 30'.\nIn January 2016, Malwarebytes unveiled advanced anti-ransomware package Endpoint Security, and announced that it had raised $50&nbsp;million in investment from Fidelity Management and Research Company. Kleczynski stated that the funds would be used primarily for the company's hiring, product development and marketing assets. In June, Malwarebytes announced a strong growth in sales of over 75 percent in the first quarter of the year compared to 2015, with billings surpassing $100&nbsp;million. The corporate subscription base for the company was reported to have grown by 90%. In September, Proofpoint, Inc. CEO Gary Steele joined the company's board of directors, with Kleczynski citing his \"deep expertise in the security software industry, and his proven ability [at] increasing sales revenue\" as the main reasons for his appointment. In October the company purchased AdwCleaner, a Windows program used to clean adware and Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) from computers. In February 2017 the company acquired Saferbytes, an Italian security start-up specialized in anti-malware, anti-exploit, anti-rootkit, cloud AV, and sandbox technologies.\nIn November 2019, the company joined forces with NortonLifeLock and Kaspersky, along with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and non-profits including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and Operation Safe Escape to form the Coalition Against Stalkerware. The coalition seeks to inform, educate and combat the use of tracking apps without consent.\nPost-2020 developments\nIn January 2021, Malwarebytes was targeted by the same nation state actor implicated in the SolarWinds attack and suffered a limited access breach. CEO Kleczynski published a blog post detailing the company's attack and response.\nIn February 2021, Malwarebytes published its 2021 State of Malware Report which shared cyberthreat research including 30 million examples of Mac malware and a 1,055% increase in spyware detections in 2020.\nIn May 2021, Malwarebytes announced a collaboration with Digitunity to deliver cyberprotection to vulnerable communities underserved by technology access, expanding its portfolio of social impact work.\nIn August 2022, the company laid off 125 employees. The company announced an additional 100 layoffs in August 2023, as part of plans to separate the company into two separate business units.\nIn November 2024, Malwarebytes acquired AzireVPN, a VPN service based in Sweden.\nServices and products\nKleczynski has stated that Malwarebytes, first developed in 2008, has a competitive advantage over many other traditional antivirus programs, many of which were developed in the late 1990s, before the development of many later forms of malware. The New York Times has described Malwarebytes as a \"hybrid of heuristics, behavior and a signature engine that is designed to detect and block malware that other vendors can't detect\". According to Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat, Malwarebytes complements other antivirus software from vendors such as Symantec and McAfee, with the anti-malware working alongside other anti-virus software to attack the problem from \"different directions\", remarking that the software both removed infections from infected machines, whilst preventing others from becoming infected in the first place.\nAs in the early development days with RogueRemover, Malwarebytes continues to support community feedback on its products, and runs two sub-forums complementing the main forum, known as \"False positives\" and \"Malware contribution\", with the false positives being reported allowing the company to update its database within hours of posting, and the Malware contribution allowing for users to quickly report malware missed by the software.\nProducts\nMalwarebytes has several products, which  were available in 36 different languages. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware offers two different versions, one for free download for home computers, and the other a professional version, with a 14-day free trial in advance, offering \"real-time protection against malware, automated scanning, and automatic updating\". Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Mobile is a free Android app which protects smartphones from mobile malware, preventing unauthorized access to personal data identifying tracking applications. As of April 2023, it has a rating of 4.3 on the Google Play store.\nIn 2014, the company launched Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 2.0 with an improved user interface and dashboard. The company also launched Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit in the same year, which shields selected applications from attacks by \"exploit mitigation to protect vulnerable programs\". Anti-Exploit also comes in a free and paid for version for Windows computers. The free version stops exploits in browsers and Java, whilst the paid product adds protection for a wider range of software applications. Anti-Exploit received four stars from PC Magazine in 2015 and won V3 magazine's \"Security Innovation of the Year\" award in 2014.\nIn 2016, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit was merged into the premium version Malwarebytes version 3.0, and the standalone application is now offered only as a perpetual beta.\nIn January 2016, Malwarebytes unveiled Malwarebytes Endpoint Security, advanced anti-ransomware technology which is described as the \"first solution to offer multiple layers of protection against unknown ransomware\". The company sponsored a survey with Osterman Research into 540 firms in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany and found that nearly 40% of companies had experienced ransomware incidents, of which 34 percent had accounted for loss of revenue. The Guardian reported that one-fifth of British companies had been charged over $10,000 to unlock their files and that there was an increasing demand for anti-ransomware technology. After Endpoint's inception, the beta was reportedly downloaded by some 200,000 businesses and consumers in the first six months of the year.\nIn 2017, Malwarebytes expanded its portfolio to include mobile products for Mac and Android including Malwarebytes for Android and Malwarebytes for Mac. Malwarebytes also can be run on ChromeOS, but mainly provides protection against Android threats.  Malwarebytes also released Malwarebytes for iOS in 2018 to deliver secure and private mobile experiences for its users. Due to Apple's security restrictions, Malwarebytes for iOS can not remove malware, but does provide basic web protection and spam blocking. In 2020, Malwarebytes Privacy, a VPN offering, was launched.\nIn 2018, Malwarebytes expanded its business portfolio by launching Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection and Response to monitor, identify and remediate attacks. This offering was extended in 2020 to include server protection for enterprise customers with Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response for Servers and Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection for Servers. In 2020, Malwarebytes also launched Malwarebytes Nebula, a cloud platform for enterprise customers to simplify endpoint management and reporting.\nMalwarebytes also has numerous tools such as a Junkware Removal Tool to remove adware, an Anti-Rootkit Beta to remove and repair rootkits, StartUpLITE to boost the speed of the Windows reboot, FileASSASSIN to prevent locked files and a Malware Removal Service to support organizations under an active malware attack.\nLicense and privacy\nThe software license requires arbitration \"in the county where you reside\", forbids class action suits, reverse engineering and sharing, and limits warranties and liability. Even the free version may not be shared, since the company tracks use of the product separately for each user.\nMalwarebytes' privacy policy lists many types of information they collect and store, including, amongst other things, software running on a user's computer (\"programs installed or in use\"), \"name, email address, mailing address, or phone number... company name, company size, business type...
