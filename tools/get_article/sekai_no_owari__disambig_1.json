Together the three began a cover band at an early age while still in high school inspired by senior professional bands such as Bump of Chicken. Later, they met DJ Love who was added to original line-up as a DJ, replacing Fukase who was meant to take on the concept of a clown, and Fukase became the lead vocalist while Nakajin and Saori became the guitarist and pianist of the band, respectively.

The band self-produced their first demo, Sekai no Owari, with a limited edition of 1,000 copies. Fukase, vocalist, named the band Sekai no Owari because \"Once you've experienced the bottom, you have to find a way to go up. So I named my band End of the World to create the strength [I needed] through the music.\"\n2010–2011: First album, Nippon Budokan and major label debut\nSekai no Owari released their first album Earth under the independent label Lastrum in 2010.
