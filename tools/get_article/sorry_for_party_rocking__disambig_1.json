The album currently holds a score of 47 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 13 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Josh Bush from AllMusic gave it a favorable review, awarding it three and a half out of five stars. He said \"Their second album, Sorry for Party Rocking, arrives at exactly the right time and includes exactly the right mix of energy and humor, plus a surprising amount of sincerity.\" They highlighted \"Sorry for Party Rocking\", \"Party Rock Anthem\" and \"Champagne Showers\".\nBillboard had said prior to the promotion \"LMFAO is, of course, not \"Sorry for Party Rocking.\" But the dance duo's sophomore album is \"more refined\" and more experimental than its 2009 debut, \"Party Rock.\"\nBritish music journal NME were particularly scathing, giving it a score of 0 out of 10.  Criticizing the album, Sam Wolfson wrote \"... it's not the persistent and aggressive misogyny that is the most soul-destroying thing about the record. Nor is it songs so imbecilic that if you ate a can of Alphabetti Spaghetti you could shit out more intelligent lyrics to a more pleasing tune... It's that... LMFAO understood the pain they would be inflicting on the world and did it anyway.\"\nSome negative feedback have also come in about their rapping and dance beats through the album. Entertainment Weekly gave it a negative review saying \"It's topped off by truly terrible rapping, which often turns otherwise groan-inspiring instrumentals into jumbled, maddening filler.\" The Rolling Stone gave it two stars out of five, positively highlighting that \"MC-DJs Redfoo and Sky Blu turn in some skillful hip-hop\", but they also said \"but also get seriously stupid, rapping about spanking girls and bathing in champagne, over a cheesy pastiche of Eighties synths and pounding beats.\"\nCommercial performance\nSorry for Party Rocking debuted at number 12 on the US Billboard 200 with 27,100 copies sold in its first week.
