Warspite also participated in the Battle of Quiberon Bay under Admiral Sir Edward Hawke.\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of Paris she was paid off on 5 May 1763, reappearing as a hospital ship during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83).\nShe was employed on harbour service from 1778. She was renamed Arundel in March 1800, and was eventually broken up at Portsmouth Dockyard in November 1801.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
