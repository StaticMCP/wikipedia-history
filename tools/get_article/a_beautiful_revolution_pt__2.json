At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on nine reviews, which indicates \"generally positive reviews\".\nRobin Murray of Clash wrote that the album \"stares down the traumas that proliferate our lives, offering hope, creativity, and soul filtered through Common's profound hip-hop vision\". Joe Goggins of DIY found the album \"a sweet paean to music's mood-boosting properties, as well as it capacity to effect meaningful change\". Ben Devlin of musicOMH wrote: \"Common raps with the calm contentment of a man who's reached his destination, and it certainly sounds satisfying\". Will Lavin of NME wrote: \"it's rich with Afro-centric grooves and dusty drum breaks, the spirit of James Brown weaving in and out of the pro-Black messaging, which emphasises hope and progress but still acknowledges the pain and suffering endured along the way\".\nIn mixed reviews, Mojo writer resumed \"an improvement on 2020's lightweight Pt. 1\". Mosi Reeves of Rolling Stone wrote: \"there's enough evidence on A Beautiful Revolution, Pt. 2 to suggest that he still cares about music, but it may take more than mellow bromides and Obama shout-outs to truly convince us\". The Line of Best Fit reviewer wrote: \"by catering to everyone in an effort to uplift, Common doesn't connect with the listener as much as he could–and as much as he has in the past. Common's big tent might be too spacious for its own good\".\nTrack listing\nAll tracks are produced by Karriem Riggins.\n| length1       = 3:00\n| title2        = A Beautiful Chicago Kid\n| note2         = with PJ\n| writer2       =\n| length2       = 2:38\n| title3        = When We Move\n| note3         = featuring Black Thought and Seun Kuti\n| writer3       =\n| length3       = 4:11\n| title4        = Set It Free\n| note4         = with PJ\n| writer4       =\n| length4       = 3:34\n| title5        = Majesty (Where We Gonna Take It)\n| note5         = with PJ\n| writer5       =\n| length5       = 4:34\n| title6        = Poetry\n| note6         = featuring Marcus King and Isaiah Sharkey\n| writer6       =\n| length6       = 3:16\n| title7        = Saving Grace\n| note7         = featuring Brittany Howard\n| writer7       =\n| length7       = 4:13\n| title8        = Star of the Gang\n| note8         = with PJ\n| writer8       =\n| length8       = 3:25\n| title9        = Imagine\n| note9         = with PJ\n| writer9       =\n| length9       = 3:41\n| title10       = Get It Right\n| note10        =\n| writer10      =\n| length10      = 3:08\n| title11       = Exclamation Point\n| note11        = Outro; featuring Morgan Parker\n| writer11      =\n| length11      = 2:42\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2021)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |UK R&B and Hip-Hop Albums (OCC)\n|25\n|}\nReferences"
