They do consider \"translations, short story and essay collections, self published books, and any titles that fall under the general categories.\"\nThe judges are the volunteer directors of the NBCC who are 24 members serving rotating three-year terms, with eight elected annually by the voting members, namely \"professional book review editors and book reviewers.\" Winners of the awards are announced each year at the NBCC awards ceremony in conjunction with the yearly membership meeting, which takes place in March.\nBetween 1983 and 2004, the award was presented jointly with autobiography.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography winners and finalists\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" |Year\n! scope=\"col\" |Author\n! scope=\"col\" |Title\n! scope=\"col\" |Subject\n! scope=\"col\" |Result\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1983\n|\n|Minor Characters\n|the women of the Beat Generation\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Black Apollo of Science: The Life of Ernest Everett Just\n| (1883–1941), pioneering African-American biologist, academic, and science writer\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Finalist\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|Eleni\n|the life of his late mother in Greece during World War II and the Greek Civil War\n|-\n|\n|The Roots of Treason: Ezra Pound and the Secret of St. Elizabeth’s\n| (1885–1972), American poet and critic\n|-\n|\n|Thomas Carlyle\n| (1795–1881), Scottish essayist, historian and philosopher\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1984\n|\n|Dostoevsky: The Years of Ordeal, 1850–1859\n| (1821–1881), Russian novelist\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Home Before Dark\n|memoir and biography of her father, author John Cheever\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Finalist\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|Josephine Herbst\n| (1892–1969), American writer and journalist\n|-\n|\n|One Writer’s Beginnings\n|\n|-\n|\n|Walt Whitman: The Making of a Poet\n| (1819–1892), American poet, essayist and journalist\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1985\n|\n|Henry James: A Life\n| (1843–1916), American-born British writer and literary critic\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Brigham Young: American Moses\n| (1801–1877), Latter Day Saint religious leader\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Finalist\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|Giacometti: A Biography\n| (1901–1966), Swiss sculptor and painter\n|-\n|\n|Louise Bogan\n| (1897–1970), American poet\n|-\n|\n|Visible Light: Four Creative Biographies\n|photographers Angelo Rizzuto, Bill Burke, John McWilliams, and Andrea Kovacs\n|- style=\"background:#cddeff\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |1986\n|\n|The Life of Langston Hughes, Vol. I: 1902-1941\n| (1901–1967), American writer and social activist\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|\n|Dostoevsky: The Stir of Liberation, 1860-1865\n| (1821–1881), Russian novelist\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Finalist\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|Maus: A Survivor’s Tale\n|the lives of his parents in Poland during the Holocaust and in the U.S. afterward\n|-\n|\n|Tombee: Portrait of a Cotton Planter\n|Thomas B.
