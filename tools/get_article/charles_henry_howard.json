He graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1859 and then attended the Bangor Theological Seminary for one year before enlisting for the Civil War.\nCivil War\nHoward enlisted as a private and musician in the 3rd Maine Infantry in June 1861, upon the request of his brother Oliver O. Howard, and saw action at the First Battle of Bull Run.

He fought at the Battle of Antietam and was wounded again in the Battle of Fredericksburg. In 1863, he was promoted to major and aide-de-camp to his older brother Oliver and served with him at the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.
