He graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1912.\nHe received the Medal of Honor for actions at the United States occupation of Veracruz, 1914.\nSent for aeronautical instruction at the Wright Company in Dayton, Ohio and flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, McDonnell was designated a naval aviator in March 1915. He then served as an aviation instructor at NAS Pensacola and at NAS Huntington Bay, Long Island, New York. On August 14, 1917, McDonnell took off from NAS Huntington Bay in a seaplane and conducted a test launch of an aerial torpedo. The torpedo hit the water at a bad angle and bounced, nearly hitting his aircraft. During World War I, he served as an aviator in France and Italy from late 1917 to September 1918.\nOn March 10, 1919, Lieutenant Commander McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off an overhauled gun turret on the USS Texas and thus became the first man to fly an airplane off a battleship.\nIn January 1920, McDonnell transferred to the active reserves. He worked as an executive for several New York City investment houses, eventually becoming a partner at Hornblower & Weeks. As a reserve naval aviator, McDonnell had active-duty assignments at NAS Pensacola and aboard the seaplane tender .\nPromoted to commander in July 1940, McDonnell traveled as a naval observer on the first Pan American Airways flight to the southwest Pacific. In October 1940, he was recalled to active duty. In early 1941, McDonnell served as air attaché in London before being transferred to the U.S. embassy in Peiping. In July 1941, he was given command of Naval Air Station New York City and also made District Aviation Officer for the Third Naval District.\nAfter United States entry into World War II, McDonnell was promoted to captain in December 1941 and then to rear admiral in 1942. In June 1943, he transferred to a staff position at the Naval Air Training Center in Corpus Christi, Texas. In May 1944, his rank reverted to captain so that he could command the escort carriers  from July to December 1944 and Nehenta Bay from December 1944 to September 1945.\nReleased from active duty in December 1945, McDonnell became a rear admiral in the naval reserves. When he retired permanently in December 1951, he was advanced to vice admiral on the reserve retired list.\nVice Admiral McDonnell died in the 1960 bombing of National Airlines Flight 2511 in Bolivia, North Carolina. At the time of his death, he was living in Mill Neck, Long Island and traveling from New York to Miami, where he had a vacation home in Hobe Sound, Florida. McDonnell was serving as a director on the boards of Pan Am and Hertz. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nMedal of Honor citation\nRank: Ensign, Organization: U.S. Navy, Born:13 November 1891, Baltimore, Md., Accredited to: Maryland, Date of issue: 12/04/1915\nCitation:\nFor extraordinary heroism in battle, engagements of Vera Cruz, 21 and 22 April 1914.
