It started as its own brand, and is now a subsidiary of Kroger. It is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.\nKing Soopers has a significant presence in the state of Colorado on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. The stores are located along the Front Range from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Pueblo, Colorado.  There are also a few locations in the foothills west of Denver and Colorado Springs.\nHistory\nEarly history\nLloyd J. King opened the first King Soopers with Charles W. Houchens and Robert C. Loury.  and  This location has since been demolished for Arvada's Public Library, built in 2005–06.\nThe name \"King Soopers\" was derived from Lloyd's family name and an alternate spelling of the word \"super!\" from the Archie comics series that one of his two sons, Larry, read. Within the next five years, King Soopers became the first grocery store in the country to open an in-store pharmacy and one of the earliest to have a meat department.\nOwnership changes\nKing Soopers grew to several stores in the Denver metro area and Colorado Springs, before being bought out by Dillon Companies in 1957. The original King Soopers location was relocated from Olde Town Arvada to Arvada Plaza.\nKing Soopers' then-parent, Dillon Companies, was bought out by The Kroger Company in 1982–83, and King Soopers and Dillon's are both still owned by Kroger today.\nFresh Fare King Soopers\nIn 2012, Kroger expanded its Fresh Fare style of supermarkets into the King Soopers brand, opening the first Fresh Fare King Soopers in Englewood, Colorado. This is a concept that first appeared in Kroger as early as 2007 and actually seems to have started with Ralphs, another Kroger subsidiary primarily located in California in 1998.\nThe main idea of Fresh Fare is to be a bit more upscale in that it sells more organic foods while still selling traditional groceries; it follows the themes of the 'Green Grocer' Concept.\nKing Soopers Marketplace\nIn 2012, the first King Soopers Marketplace opened, just one year after the first Kroger Marketplace in Texas. As of 2017, there are ten King Soopers Marketplace locations all located in Colorado.\nThe marketplace concept is based on Fred Meyer stores (which have spawned multiple Marketplace stores under other Kroger banners), and features a  wider selection of products besides just food and other necessities.\nModern day\nAs of June 2025, King Soopers operates 120 locations. All are located in Colorado except for one, located in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\nIn October 2022, Kroger and major competitor Albertsons announced a merger agreement. That plan has been challenged in court by several states. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser summarized consumer and worker opposition: the merger \"would lead to stores closing, higher prices, fewer jobs, worse customer service, and less resilient supply chains.”\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kingsoopers.com Homepage]\n* [http://www.thekrogerco.com Kroger corporate homepage]"
