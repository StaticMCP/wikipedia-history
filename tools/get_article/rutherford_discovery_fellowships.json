Established in 2010, they were administered by the Royal Society Te Apārangi and awarded yearly, via a multi-round peer-review and interview process, and funded by money diverted from the axed Foundation for Research, Science and Technology Postdoctoral Fellowships. Recipients of the fellowship were typically faculty members at New Zealand universities, or appointed in Fellow roles, a position comparable to \"research faculty\" or \"senior postdoc\" in the United States. In 2025, the fellowship scheme was replaced with the New Zealand Mana Tūānuku Research Leader Fellowship.\nThe Ministry of Science and Innovation commissioned a review of the scheme in 2011, following a public letter raising concerns about a gap in early and mid-career support for researchers. The review, conducted by the government Social Wellbeing Agency (The Hub), interviewed fellows, the selection panel, and representatives from host institutions and the Royal Society. A draft report is available but the final report and recommendations do not appear to have been made public.\nMajor contributions across research fields\nMore than a dozen Rutherford Discovery Fellowships were awarded every year, and by the final 2023 round life-sciences and humanities projects each accounted for 42 per cent of the portfolio, with the remainder in the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics.\nThe breadth of topics funded, and the influence Fellows have gone on to exert in their disciplines, illustrates the scheme’s strategic role in New Zealand’s research ecosystem.\nBiomedical and health sciences.  University of Auckland neuro-immunologist Dr Justin Rustenhoven (2021 Fellow) is tracing how age-related inflammation damages the meningeal lymphatic “drain-pipes” of the brain, work that points to new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.\nClimate and marine science.  Massey University marine ecologist Dr Libby Liggins (2020) is combining genomics, ocean-current modelling and citizen-science “fish watches” to identify *tohu*—early genetic and distributional signals—of climate-driven shifts in Aotearoa’s coastal biodiversity, providing communities and mana whenua with data for proactive kaitiakitanga.\nGreen chemistry and clean technology.  Organometallic chemist Dr Mathew Anker (Victoria University of Wellington, 2022) is designing lanthanide(II) hydride catalysts able to fix atmospheric nitrogen at ambient pressure, a step towards fossil-fuel-free ammonia fertiliser production and a potential one-per-cent cut in global CO₂ emissions.\nComputer science and software engineering.  Dr Kelly Blincoe (University of Auckland, 2022) is leading the first longitudinal study of Aotearoa’s software workforce to understand why women leave the industry and to create more inclusive development tools and practices, research that also informs ACM diversity policy worldwide.\nPublic-health and social equity research.  Psychologist Dr Jaimie Veale (University of Waikato, 2020) is extending the national *Counting Ourselves* survey into a multi-wave international study that tracks how access to gender-affirmation and other social determinants shape the health of transgender and non-binary people.\nIndigenous politics and civic participation.  Associate Professor Lara Greaves (Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, 2023) is co-creating tools with Māori communities to lift voter turnout, improve access to political information and strengthen data sovereignty—work that addresses structural barriers to participation for wāhine Māori and other under-represented groups.\nIndividual Fellowships have also seeded internationally recognised advances in the physical sciences; for example, laser physicist Dr Miro Erkintalo’s 2015 award preceded his Prime-Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize for micro-comb technology.\nCollectively, the programme created a pipeline of independent research leaders whose work now underpins national capability in everything from pandemic modelling to quantum photonics, demonstrating the long-term value of sustained, investigator-led funding.\nReplacement by Tāwhia te Mana Research Fellowships\nIn July 2023 the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) announced a new workforce-support initiative that would “retire” the Rutherford Discovery, Rutherford Foundation and James Cook Research Fellowships after the 2023 funding rounds.\nFrom 2024 onward, early-, mid- and established-career researchers would instead compete for three Māori-named awards grouped under the Tāwhia te Mana Research Fellowships portfolio:\n* Mana Tūāpapa Future Leader Fellowship (0–4 years post-PhD)\n* Mana Tūānuku Research Leader Fellowship (4–12 years post-PhD)\n* Mana Tūārangi Distinguished Researcher Fellowship (established researchers).\nRoyal Society Te Apārangi continues to administer the new fellowships, and existing Rutherford Discovery Fellows will receive their contracted support until those awards conclude.\nFellows\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|{{Hlist|2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
