It is the first binding document adopted by members of the African Union. Among its provisions are several aimed at combating unconstitutional regime changes, including the first legal instrument adopted by the AU acknowledging that constitutional coups are a form of unconstitutional regime change.\nCameroon and Burkina Faso, two semi-authoritarian countries, have ratified the ADC, indicating that adoption of the charter on its own is not enough to prevent authoritarianism in Africa.\nBackground\nThe supranational organization which preceded the AU, the Organization of African Unity, had a similar accord called the Declaration on the Framework for OAU Response to Unconstitutional Changes in Government, or the \"Lomé Declaration\" for short. Under the Lomé Declaration, the OAU was equipped with an official framework to deal with unconstitutional changes of government in Africa. However, the Declaration was largely ineffective for a number of reasons, including that the Lomé Declaration was not legally binding, it failed to create a framework for democratizing authoritarian countries, it defined unconstitutional changes narrowly, excluding constitutional coups, and it failed to create sufficient enforcement mechanisms. The ADC would later attempt to address some of these problems by making the charter binding and including constitutional coups in its mandate, for example.\nThe ADC was also preceded by a number of AU instruments which had similar goals of promoting democracy, protecting human rights, and preventing unconstitutional regime changes. Among these are the Constitutive Act of the AU, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa, and the AU Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption.\nAdoption by member states\nAdopted in 2007, the charter only came into effect on February 15, 2012. Signature and ratification by member states, however, has been a slow and continual process since the charter's inception. Many of the more authoritarian member states of the African Union were unwilling to ratify the ADC because of its expansive provisions designed to encourage liberal democracy. By 2009, 29 of 55 member states had signed the ADC, and only three had ratified it.\nIn order for a member state to adopt the charter, the head of state must sign the charter during an AU meeting, at which point it may be ratified. However, the ratification process is often prohibitively complicated, especially in states which lack the political will to adopt the charter in the first place. Ratification typically requires significant input from all key government and non-governmental stakeholders and often involves making preemptive costly adjustments to national institutions to be in accordance with the principles of the charter.\nOf the 55 member states that make up the African Union, 46 have signed, 34 have ratified, and 34 have deposited.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"\n|+Dates of Signature, Ratification/Accession, and Deposit as of 2019\n!Country\n!Date of Signature\n!Date of Ratification\n!Date of Deposit\n|-\n|Algeria\n|14/07/2012\n|20/11/2017\n|10/01/2017\n|-\n|Angola\n|27/01/2021\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Benin\n|16/07/2007\n|28/06/2012\n|11/07/2012\n|-\n|Botswana\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Burkina Faso\n|02/08/2007\n|26/05/2010\n|06/07/2010\n|-\n|Burundi\n|20/06/2007\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Cameroon\n| -\n|24/08/2011\n|16/01/2012\n|-\n|Central African Republic\n|28/06/2008\n|24/04/2017\n|06/03/2019\n|-\n|Cape Verde\n|27/01/2012\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Chad\n|22/01/2009\n|11/07/2011\n|13/10/2011\n|-\n|Côte d'Ivoire\n|11/06/2009\n|16/10/2013\n|28/11/2013\n|-\n|Comoros\n|02/02/2010\n|30/11/2016\n|06/01/2017\n|-\n|Congo\n|18/06/2007\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Djibouti\n|15/06/2007\n|02/12/2012\n|22/01/2013\n|-\n|Democratic Republic of Congo\n|29/06/2008\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Egypt\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Equatorial Guinea\n|30/01/2011\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Eritrea\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Ethiopia\n|28/12/2007\n|05/12/2008\n|06/01/2009\n|-\n|Gabon\n|02/02/2010\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Gambia\n|29/01/2008\n|11/06/2018\n|04/02/2019\n|-\n|Ghana\n|15/01/2008\n|06/09/2010\n|19/10/2010\n|-\n|Guinea-Bissau\n|17/06/2008\n|23/12/2011\n|04/01/2012\n|-\n|Guinea\n|09/05/2007\n|17/06/2011\n|11/07/2011\n|-\n|Kenya\n|28/06/2008\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Libya\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Lesotho\n|17/03/2010\n|30/06/2010\n|09/07/2010\n|-\n|Liberia\n|18/06/2008\n|23/02/2014\n|07/03/2017\n|-\n|Madagascar\n|31/01/2014\n|23/02/2017\n|13/04/2017\n|-\n|Mali\n|29/06/2007\n|13/08/2013\n|02/09/2013\n|-\n|Malawi\n| -\n|11/10/2012\n|24/10/2012\n|-\n|Morocco\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Mozambique\n|27/05/2010\n|24/04/2018\n|09/05/2018\n|-\n|Mauritania\n|29/01/2008\n|07/07/2008\n|28/07/2008\n|-\n|Mauritius\n|14/12/2007\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Namibia\n|10/05/2007\n|23/08/2016\n|30/08/2016\n|-\n|Nigeria\n|02/07/2007\n|01/12/2011\n|09/01/2012\n|-\n|Niger\n|17/06/2008\n|04/10/2011\n|08/11/2011\n|-\n|Rwanda\n|29/06/2007\n|09/07/2010\n|14/07/2010\n|-\n|South Africa\n|01/02/2010\n|24/12/2010\n|24/01/2011\n|-\n|Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic\n|25/07/2010\n|27/11/2013\n|27/01/2014\n|-\n|Senegal\n|15/12/2008\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Seychelles\n| -\n|12/08/2016\n|28/09/2016\n|-\n|Sierra Leone\n|17/06/2008\n|17/02/2009\n|08/12/2009\n|-\n|South Sudan\n|24/01/2013\n|26/01/2014\n|13/04/2015\n|-\n|São Tomé and Príncipe\n|01/02/2010\n|18/04/2019\n|27/06/2019\n|-\n|Sudan\n|30/06/2008\n|19/06/2013\n|16/09/2013\n|-\n|Eswatini\n|29/01/2008\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Tanzania\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Togo\n|30/10/2007\n|24/01/2012\n|20/03/2012\n|-\n|Tunisia\n|27/01/2013\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Uganda\n|16/12/2008\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|Zambia\n|31/01/2010\n|31/05/2011\n|08/07/2011\n|-\n|Zimbabwe\n|21/03/2018\n| -\n| -\n|}\nSee also\n* Inter-American Democratic Charter\n* Ushuaia Protocol\nReferences\nSubmission for Review"
