He then attended the University of Michigan for his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology, graduating in 1979. He was a postdoctoral fellow at NYU from 1979 to 1981, after which he joined RCA Laboratories as a staff scientist for five years. One of his most notable research outcomes is the Laplacian pyramid for visual image coding. Adelson has over 100 publications that have been cited more than 63,000 times on topics in human vision, machine vision, computer graphics, neuroscience, and computational photography\n.\nAwards\nDuring his time at RCA Laboratories, Adelson won the 1984 Adolph Lomb Medal from the Optical Society of America. He joined the faculty at MIT in 1987, first at the Media Lab before moving to the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences in 1994. In 1992, he received the Rank Prize in Opto-electronics, and in 2005 he received the Longuet-Higgins Prize from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2006, Adelson was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 2010, he was elected as fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2013, he received the Helmholtz Award from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2020, he received the Ken Nakayama Medal for Excellence in Vision Science.\nIn 2022, Adelson received the Kurt Koffka Medal for \"advancing the fields of perception or developmental psychology to an extraordinary extent\".\nAdelson is also a fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists.\nSee also\n*Checker shadow illusion\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
