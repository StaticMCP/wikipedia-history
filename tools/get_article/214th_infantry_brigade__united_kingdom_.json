It was initially composed of newly raised battalions. On 1 December 1941, it was redesigned as the 214th Independent Infantry Brigade.\nService\nresting during the assault on Geilenkirchen in Germany, 18 November 1944.]]\nOn 5 September 1943, the brigade joined the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, replacing the 34th Tank Brigade, and along with the 129th Infantry Brigade and 130th Infantry Brigade reformed the 43rd Division as a standard infantry division, after an experiment as Mixed (infantry and tank) division was abandoned. The brigade landed in Normandy on 24 June 1944, under the command of Brigadier Hubert Essame, and fought during Operation Overlord, It fought against the German 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen at Hill 112, in July 1944, during the Battle for Caen.\nThe 214th Brigade, along with the rest of the 43rd Division, were the first British units to cross the River Seine, with an assault crossing at the French town of Vernon opposed by the 49th Infantry Division. This enabled the armour of XXX Corps to thrust across northern France and into Belgium. The brigade was later involved in Operation Market Garden, and supported the Guards Armoured Division. The brigade was later placed along the Meuse as a reserve, during the Battle of the Bulge.
