In that occasion the party, that was especially strong in Southern Italy, gained 10.9% of the vote and 60 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.\nFour years later, in 1921 general election the party won only 4.7% of the vote and 29 seats.\nIn January 1922 the \"National Council of Social Democracy and Radicalism\" was officially created; this event is considered the date of the party's official formation and name, and of the dissolution of the Italian Radical Party. The main party's founders were Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesarò, Arturo Labriola and Ettore Sacchi.\nAfter the March on Rome, the party took part to the governments of Benito Mussolini until July 1924. It gained only 1.6% of votes in the general election of the same year and Antonio Colonna di Cesarò took part to the Aventine Secession. The party was disbanded by the regime in 1926, as all the other parties.\nAfter World War II some of its members joined the Labour Democratic Party, a centre-left party.\nElectoral results\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:50%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\"\n|-\n| colspan=6|Chamber of Deputies\n|-\n! width=13%|Election year\n! width=16%|Votes\n! width=6%|%\n! width=1%|Seats\n! width=8%|+/−\n! width=18%|Leader\n|-\n! 1919\n| 622,310 (4th)\n| 10.9\n| }}\n|\n| rowspan=3|\n|-\n! 1921\n| 309,191 (6th)\n| 4.7\n| }}\n|  31}}\n|-\n! 1924\n| 111,035 (10th)\n| 1.6\n| }}\n|  19}}\n|}\nReferences"
