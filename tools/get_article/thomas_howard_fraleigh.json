He represented Lambton East in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1929 to 1934 as a Conservative member.\nHe was born in St. Marys, Ontario, the son of Sidney Fraleigh, and was educated there. In 1902, he married Winnifred Anderson. He belonged to the local Masonic lodge. Fraleigh grew flax and hemp near Forest, Ontario. Fraleigh also pioneered techniques to make more efficient use of pasture land when raising of livestock. Fraleigh coordinated Canadian flax production in World War I: flax was shipped to Ireland to produce linen for use in the manufacture of airplane wings. Fraleigh also experimented with the production of hemp for use in manufacturing fibres. The cultivation of hemp  was later banned in Canada because of its association with cannabis. He died at his home in Forest, Ontario, on January 29, 1946.\nReferences\n* Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1930, AL Normandin\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080303091947/http://www.ourroots.ca/e/toc.aspx?id=4310 ''Lambton County's Hundred Years, 1849 - 1949'', V Lauriston (1949)]"
