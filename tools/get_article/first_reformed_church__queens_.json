The church was built in 1859.  The church has an early romanesque structure that was designed by Sidney J. Young and built by Anders Peterson. The First Reformed Church has been refurbished as part of the Jamaica Center for Arts & Learning.\nThe asymmetrical towers, round-arched openings, and corbel tables are examples of an architectural style known as Rundbogenstil.\nThe church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and a New York City Landmark in 1996.\nSee also\n*List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Queens\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Queens County, New York\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
