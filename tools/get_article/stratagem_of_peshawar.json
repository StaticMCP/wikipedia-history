When Mir Nawab and his few soldiers reached Jamrud, Azim Khan attacked Mir Nawab's army by encircling their army. The army of Mir Nawab was at a positional disadvantage on the battlefield against the guns and cannon of Azim Khan Barakzai.\nAs result, Mir Nawab Khan Tanoli was killed, resulting in a major loss to the Kingdom of Amb, which was already greatly embattled against the Sikh Empire. The Nawab of Amb lost their territory and was wiped out.\nMain Reason Behind war\nThe main reason for the war was a tax dispute that arose when Azim Khan's mother was traveling to Kashmir via Tanwal.\nReferences\n*\n*"
