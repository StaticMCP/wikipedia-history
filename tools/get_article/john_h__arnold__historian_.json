Since 2016, he has been the Professor of Medieval History at the University of Cambridge. He previously worked at Birkbeck College, University of London, where he specialised in the study of medieval religious culture. He has also written widely on historiography and why history matters.\nCareer\nBorn 28 November 1969, Arnold received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in medieval studies from the University of York. He was professor of medieval history at Birkbeck College, University of London, from 2008. He joined the college as a lecturer in 2001. Before that he was a lecturer at the University of East Anglia. He is a member of the Social History Society and the Medieval Academy of America.\nResearch\nArnold specialises in the study of medieval religious culture, saying that while he has never been a believer in any religion, \"belief\" has always fascinated him. In his work he asks \"Why do people believe the things they believe? What does 'believing' really mean in practice?\" Arnold has also written widely about historiography. In 2008 he wrote a policy paper, Why history matters - and why medieval history also matters, for History & Policy.\nSelected publications\n*What is Masculinity?
