In 2017, the society was renamed the Yellowknife Historical Society to broaden its mandate to create a community museum for Yellowknife that would include all cultural aspects of the city's history. In March of 2024, The Yellowknife Historical Museum was opened to the public.\nPanoramic view of future site\nExternal links\n* [http://www.yellowknifehistory.com/ Yellowknife Historical Society website]\nAffiliations\nThe Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.\nReferences"
