Fatima Hassouna was the protagonist of the documentary Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk.]]\nThe killing of journalists in the Gaza war, overwhelmingly Palestinians killed by Israel, along with other acts of violence against journalists, marks the deadliest period for journalists in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict since 1992 and the single deadliest conflict for journalists in all known conflicts in the history of the world, according to the Costs of War Project. According to the United Nations, the number of Palestinian journalists killed by Israel since the start of the war stood at 242 by 11 August 2025. On the other hand, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that 192 journalists, at least 184 of them Palestinian, had been killed by Israel  while the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) reported the killing of at least 180 Palestinian journalists and media workers by Israel . A July 2024 count by the Gaza Government Media Office placed the number of Palestinian journalists killed by Israel at 160. By January 2025, Israel had reportedly killed 42 more Palestinian journalists to raise this number to 202, and by July 2025, it had reportedly killed 15 more journalists to raise the number to 217. An aggregation of data from multiple sources, including from the CPJ and the IFJ, which listed the names of all journalists hitherto reported to have been killed by Israel concluded that, by 11 August 2025, Israel had killed up to 274 journalists, with 269 of them Palestinian.\nThe head of the Committee to Protect Journalists stated in 2024, \"Israel's war on Gaza is more deadly to journalists than any previous war\". Israeli airstrikes additionally damaged or destroyed an estimated 48 media facilities in Gaza. Reporters Without Borders has reported that the Israeli army intentionally targeted Palestinian journalists. The Guardian stated that contrary to international law, Israel had targeted Hamas-affiliated Palestinian journalists despite their non-involvement in combat, thus disputing Israel's denial of targeting journalists. In 2023, nearly 75% of journalists killed worldwide were Palestinians who had died in Israel’s war in Gaza. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Israel was the second worst country in the world for allowing the murderers of journalists to go unpunished.\nUNESCO awarded its 2024 World Press Freedom Prize to the Palestinian journalists of Gaza.\nAccording to a report by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the war in Gaza since 7 October 2023 has led to the deaths of more journalists than the combined total killed during the U.S. Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War (including related conflicts in Cambodia and Laos), the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s and early 2000s, and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan.\nKilling of journalists by Israeli forces\nAfter the October 7 attacks, a journalist named Omar Abu Shawish was killed in Gaza.\nThe Hajji Tower airstrike destroyed an apartment block housing journalists' offices on 10 October 2023, killing at least three journalists along with civilians. Salam Khalil, the head of the Gaza Journalists Syndicate's Committee of Women Journalists, was buried under the rubble of her home together with her family in an Israeli strike on the same day and presumed dead. She was subsequently found to be alive with her children.\nTurkish public broadcaster TRT World released footage on 17 November 2023 showing the Israeli police attacking their news crew, leading the Turkish minister of communications Fahrettin Altun to say, \"This ugly attack has added a new embarrassment to Israel's record on press freedom.\" On 19 November, six media professionals were killed by Israeli forces in just 24 hours. On 3 December, the Committee to Protect Journalists stated 54 Palestinian journalists had been killed in the war thus far. On 14 December, the United Nations released a statement that said, \"Gaza has seemingly become the deadliest place for journalists – and their families – in the world.\" Following an Israeli attack on a journalists' tent at the Al-Aqsa Hospital on 31 March 2024, Al Jazeera English stated, \"Journalists have been systematically targeted throughout this conflict.\"\nJournalist Fadi al-Wahidi was shot in the neck in October 2024 by Israeli forces and fell into a coma while awaiting approval for a medical evacuation.\nTwo journalists from the Palestine Today News Agency were killed on 8 April 2025 and one later died of his wounds after an Israeli strike on a press tent near Nasser Medical Complex.\nPalestinian photojournalist Fatima Hassouna was killed on 16 April 2025 along with ten members of her family in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Gaza City. She became the subject of the documentary film Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, selected for the ACID film programme shown during the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. The attack occurred one day after her documentary's selection for Cannes was announced.\nAssassinations of journalists by the IDF\nwas assassinated by Israel on 24 March 2025]]\nThe Israeli army has, by its own admission, deliberately assassinated journalists during the Gaza war, including Ismail al-Ghoul, Ramil al Refee, Hamza Dahdouh, Hossam Shabat, and Hassan Aslih. During the conflict, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) claimed that the Israeli army had deliberately targeted journalists.\nThe intentional targeting of journalists is a war crime. The killing of journalists by Israeli forces in Gaza had been a recurring issue, with previous incidents in 2018 and 2021. Earlier in 2023, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) released a report stating that 20 journalists had been killed by Israeli military fire since 2001, for which \"to date, no one has been held accountable\".\nAn investigation by The Guardian in June 2024 disputed Israel's denial of targeting media personnel, citing that some in the Israeli military have viewed journalists Hamas or its affiliates media as legitimate targets. At least 23 journalists who worked for the Al-Aqsa media network had been killed by the Israeli military in the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023, according to ARIJ, a Jordanian media non-profit. An Israeli military spokesperson confirmed that Israel does not differentiate between media workers and militants working for Hamas, a statement which the Guardian said had raised alarm among legal experts, as under the laws of war journalists are protected unless they participate in combat operations. The UN’s special rapporteur on the protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Irene Khan, stated that Israel had \"spread disinformation about journalists being linked to militants\" and that it failed to prove such claims. ARIJ surveyed 200 Gaza-based journalists, who almost all had been displaced, and reported that their homes had been bombed while sleeping with their families.\nIsmail Abu Omar\nAccording to Israel, Ismail Abu Omar, a journalist with Al Jazeera, was a deputy company commander in a Hamas battalion and participated in the 7 October attacks; during the attacks he shared a video in which he can be heard saying \"The brothers advanced, 'Masha'Allah' may God bless\". Abu Omar, along with camera man Ahmad Matar, was wounded in a drone strike on 13 February; Al Jazeera denied and condemned the Israeli accusations, stating \"Al Jazeera Media Network rejects the Israeli occupation forces’ attempt to justify the killing and targeting of journalists. The Network condemns the accusations against its journalists and recalls Israel's long record of lies and fabrication of evidence through which it seeks to hide its heinous crimes.\"\nMohamed Washah\nDuring operations in Northern Gaza, Israel alleged that they recovered documents revealing that Mohamed Washah, a journalist with Al Jazeera, was a commander in Hamas' anti-tank unit, and did research and development for their air unit. Israel released images that appeared to show Washah training with anti-tank weaponry, as well as working with others weapons and drones.\nAnas Al-Sharif\nHajji Tower airstrike\n| time          =\n| timezone      =\n| type          = Airstrike\n| motive        =\n| fatalities    = 3+\n| injuries      = Dozens\n| executed_by   =\n}}\nIsraeli aircraft bombed a residential building called Hajji Tower in the Gaza Strip on 10 October 2023. According to the Palestinian Press Union, four journalists covering the evacuation of a nearby building were killed, and an unknown number of people were injured. Journalists were present after a resident in a nearby building had reported receiving a phone call from the Israeli military warning of an imminent strike, and the building was being evacuated. The strike hit another building closer to the journalists. Hisham al-Nawajha sustained severe injuries and later died at Al-Shifa Medical Complex.\nAugust 2025 Nasser Hospital strikes\nOn 25 August 2025, an Israeli double tap strike hit Nasser Hospital, killing at least 20 people, including medics and five journalists. Most of the deaths were caused by the second strike. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"deeply regrets\" the strike.\nKilling of journalists' families\nNine family members of CNN producer Ibrahim Dahman were killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on 4 December. On 11 December, an airstrike on the home of journalist Anas Al-Sharif resulted in the death of his father. On 8 January 2024, the mother of Al Arabiya journalist Ahmad al-Batta, and the wife and children of journalist Sameer Radi, were killed in airstrikes. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate stated on 4 February that 70 journalists had lost close family members. On 28 February, a Palestinian journalist stated that an Israeli bombing had killed his pregnant wife, three-year-old son, and 20 other people. Hussein Jaber, an UNRWA photographer, stated that his five-year-old daughter was killed while his family was evacuating Gaza City in December 2023, stating, \"Heavy gunfire broke out, and I saw how Salma was hit in the neck in front of my eyes\".\nKilling of Wael Dahdouh's family\nSeveral members of the family of Al Jazeera Arabic's Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh were killed in an Israeli airstrike on 25 October in the Nuseirat refugee camp, south of Wadi Gaza, where they had been sheltering after following the Israeli order for Palestinian civilians to move south from northern Gaza. Al Jazeera condemned the killings, calling it an \"indiscriminate attack\". Dahdouh, speaking to Al Jazeera, said \"There is no safe place in Gaza at all\". The Israeli army confirmed it had conducted an airstrike in the area near where Dahdouh's family had been sheltering, saying they were targeting \"Hamas terrorist infrastructure\". Dahdouh himself was later injured in an Israeli missile strike in Khan Younis while covering the Haifa School airstrike.\nDahdouh's son Hamza al-Dahdouh, also a journalist, was killed with a colleague by an Israeli airstrike on their vehicle in Khan Younis on 7 January 2024. Reporters Without Borders stated it appeared a single rocket had fallen on Dahdouh's car. The IDF said that the pair were traveling with a \"terror operative\" who was operating a drone and that they \"identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft in a way that put IDF forces at risk\". According to the Washington Post, the IDF changed their statement the following day, when IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that their use of a drone to film made them appear to be terrorists. After a March 2024 investigation, The Washington Post concluded that there were \"no indications\" that Dahdouh had been \"operating as anything other than a journalist that day\" because experts said there was no evidence of any \"military deployments or militant activity\" in the vicinity of the rubble that eleven journalists had traveled from Rafah to report on after an Israeli airstrike earlier in the day. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated he was \"deeply sorry\" for the \"unimaginable loss\". Wael Dahdouh stated, \"Hamza was not part of me. He was all of me.\"\nAlleged membership in Hamas\nIsrael has claimed on multiple occasions that the journalists it has killed were affiliated with militant groups. The Committee to Protect Journalists has expressed doubts about these allegations. The Al Jazeera Media Network also rejected Israel's \"unfounded allegations\" against its journalists. Reporters Without Borders found inconsistencies with Israel's allegations and stated, \"Journalists are not terrorists and the mere publication of these documents doesn’t constitute proof of their affiliation nor does it give Israel the license to kill.\"\nKilling of journalists by Palestinian forces\nFour Israeli journalists and photographers were killed on 7 October amid the Hamas attack on Israel, including Yaniv Zohar, a photographer for Israel Hayom, who was killed along with his wife and two daughters in Nahal Oz massacre; Roy Edan, a photographer for Ynet, who was killed in the Kfar Aza massacre; and two editors who were killed in the Re'im music festival massacre: Shai Regev, an entertainment news editor for Ma'ariv, and Ayelet Arnin, an editor for KAN.\nIsraeli photojournalists driving in a convoy towards Re'im were attacked by Hamas militants, as they were documenting the scene of one of the massacres. The journalists were rescued by IDF reservists after a firefight that lasted roughly half an hour.\nOther violence against journalists\nAfter the October 7 attacks, Israeli police damaged equipment of a television crew reporting in Ashkelon.\nAlongside those killed, missing or detained, the Committee to Protect Journalists has received numerous reports of damage done to journalists' offices and homes, and estimates that \"48 media facilities in Gaza have been hit or destroyed\".

Footage by Shehab News Agency showed journalists being targeted by Israeli gunfire in Gaza City on 20 February. On 27 February, Al Jazeera journalist Tareq Abu Azzoum was nearly hit by an Israeli drone attack, stating, \"We don't know the reason for this attack, if it was done to prevent us from reporting on the war… It is absolute chaos.\" Ismail al-Ghoul, a journalist at Al-Shifa Hospital during Israel's March 2024 raid, stated journalists were stripped naked, forced to lie on their stomachs, blindfolded, and interrogated after twelve hours.\nIn Israel, a right-wing mob stormed the home of Israeli journalist Israel Frey and forced him into hiding after he dedicated a prayer to the victims of the war in Gaza, threatening his family.

If a journalist is not part of Hamas's military wing, if they are not a fighter by role or function, then they're a civilian unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.\" Haque added, \"It is shocking to hear that a member of the IDF would openly and publicly reveal either their ignorance or their disregard for this fundamental principle.\" The IDF subsequently issued a statement distancing itself from the spokesperson's comments.\nFollowing an Israeli drone strike in February 2024 that severely wounded several Al Jazeera correspondents, the U.S. Secretary of State spokesman stated, \"We continue to engage with the government of Israel to make clear that journalists ought to be protected.\" The editorial board of the Financial Times wrote of Palestinian journalists in Gaza: \"The role of the brave journalists informing the world of what is unfolding becomes ever more important.

Silencing Palestinian journalists conceals the shocking reality in Gaza.\"\nPalestine\nAbu Omar, an Al Jazeera journalist severely wounded by an Israeli drone strike in Rafah, stated in February 2024, \"We will continue the coverage. And we will continue to document Israel's crimes and to show our people's suffering and worries in the Gaza Strip.\" Wael Al-Dahdouh, who lost multiple members of his family and was himself wounded by an Israeli military attack, stated, \"Journalists are facing a massacre, a bloodbath in Gaza\" and called \"for this massacre to stop.\" Motaz Azaiza stated, \"Israel won't allow international journalists into Gaza and is killing those reporting from within. It is a deliberate attempt to obscure the Palestinian narrative and erase the truth.\"\nTareq Abu Azzoum, an Al Jazeera English correspondent in Gaza stated, \"Palestinian journalists are heroes. Sometimes they have lost their family members and in the same hour they return back to stand in front of the camera only for one purpose: to keep the world informed.\" Speaking to CNN, Abu Azzoum stated journalists \"are not supposed to be attacked\".\nIsrael\nFollowing an article published by HonestReporting on 9 November, Israeli officials suggested that several freelance Palestinian photographers who had documented the 7 October attack in real time must have known of it in advance. Outlets that obtained the photos, including AP, Reuters, CNN and the New York Times, denied embedding their reporters with the attackers or having any prior knowledge of the attack. One of the freelance photographers, who had previously published a photo of himself being kissed on the cheek by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, was subsequently dismissed by CNN and AP.

The Committee to Protect Journalists stated, \"More journalists were killed in the first three months of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year\". In August 2024, Israeli forces reportedly shot journalist Salma al-Qadoumi in the back while she was reporting in Khan Younis.\nThe director of Democracy for the Arab World Now stated international journalists were portrayed by the Israeli government as being biased toward Palestinians, and as a result, soldiers saw journalists as \"representative of their enemy\" and were thus not punished for killing the media. The International Federation of Journalists stated, \"I think this is now a press freedom issue. I think we have to ask ourselves, 'What is the [Israeli military] trying to achieve? Why won't they let foreign journalists in?'\" The CJP stated the conflict was the most dangerous situation for journalists it had ever seen. The CPJ's Middle East director stated, \"Israel's longstanding record of impunity in journalist killings must face public scrutiny\".\nReporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court in December 2023 over the killing of seven more Palestinian journalists, including Samer Abu Daqqa.
