About two thousand years ago, Osian was known as Upkesh Pattan (Umeshpur Patan) city, which was a metropolis and had eight suburbs around it. Being a group of nine cities, it was also called Navteri Nagari. Among the eight suburbs, Tinwari was the main trading town. Due to the rule of Tanwar Rajputs on this city, it later came to be known as Tanwari and Tinwari. Later, this Jagir went into the hands of Sevad Rajpurohits during the Rathore rulers. In V.S. 1272 (1215 A.D.), along with Rao Siha, his Rajguru Sevad Rajpurohit Devpaldev came to Marwar from Kanoj and was given the Jagir of Tinwari.\nDalpat Singh Manohardasot of Tinwari laid down his life in 1657 fighting with the enemies on the banks of Shipra River along with Maharaja Jaswant Singh. His son Akheraj lived in the forests with Maharaja Ajit Singh for 22 years and bravely fought off the attacks of the enemies.\nThakur Gumansingh Rajpurohit of Tinwari sacrificed his life for the defense of the motherland in 1815 by killing the Pathan commander while repulsing the attack of Mir Khan Pathan on Mehrangarh Fort.\nDuring the princely period, Jagirdars of this town made entrance gates on all the routes of entry into the town and put doors in them. Got reservoirs and wells constructed in all four parts of the city.\nEarly Administration\nBefore independence, administration was in the hands of Akherajots, the feudal lords of Tinwari. They built many temples, fortified walls, cenotaphs, baolis, etc.\nAfter independence, the development of this historical city started again.\nIn 1949, due to the tireless efforts of social worker Ratanlal Joshi, rail lines were laid here and trains started running. After this development gained momentum during the tenure of young Sarpanch Premchand Khatri and later Sarpanches recognized Tinwari as a developed town.\nAt the time of the first woman sarpanch of the village, Mrs. Kaushalya Devi Sankhla, the main road was extended from Mathania Square to Osian Square and given a grand and attractive look. Beautification was done with road lights by making dividers in the middle of the road. During the time of Padmaram Meghwal, commendable work was done in the interest of the village by removing illegal encroachments in the village.\nReligious and tourist attractions\nA Jain temple located in the center of the city, which was built around 165 AD, was excavated.
