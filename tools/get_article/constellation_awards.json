      "text": "# Constellation Awards\n\nThe Constellation Awards were a set of Canadian awards given annually for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The event was founded in 2007. Constellation Awards are the only Canadian sci-fi award where the Canadian public select the nominees and winners in all categories. The awards were held at Toronto area hotels every year, but attendance and interest declined over time and the annual awards ended in 2014, which remains to date the last year the awards were held. The awards were run by the TCON Promotional Society, a not-for-profit organization that also ran several other Toronto-area fan events including the Toronto Trek, Polaris, Polar Chill, and Reversed Polarity fan conventions.\nCategories\nTelevision\n*Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode\n*Best Female Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode\n*Best Science Fiction Television Series of the year\nFilm/TV Movie/Mini-Series\n*Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series\n*Best Female Performance in a Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series\n*Best Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series of the year\nOther\n*Best Technical Accomplishment in a Science Fiction Film or Television Production\n*Best Overall Science Fiction Film or Television Script\n*Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in the year\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode\n||David TennantDoctor Who||David TennantDoctor Who||Michael HoganBattlestar Galactica||David TennantDoctor Who||Adam BaldwinChuck||Robin DunneSanctuary - Fugue||Niall MatterPrimeval: New World - Truth || Jordan GavarisOrphan Black - Variations Under Domestication\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Female Performance in a Science Fiction Television Episode\n||Claudia BlackStargate SG-1||Carey MulliganDoctor Who||Catherine TateDoctor Who||Lena HeadeyTerminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles||Anna TorvFringe||Ming-NaStargate Universe - Epilogue||Rachel Nichols (actress)Continuum - A Stitch in Time||Tatiana MaslanyOrphan Black - Variations Under Domestication\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Science Fiction Television Series of the year\n||Doctor Who||Doctor Who||Doctor Who||Supernatural||Stargate Universe||Stargate Universe||Continuum||Orphan Black\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Male Performance in a Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series\n||Hugo WeavingV for Vendetta||Will SmithI Am Legend||Robert Downey Jr.Iron Man||Karl UrbanStar Trek||Johnny DeppAlice in Wonderland||Andy SerkisRise of the Planet of the Apes||Mark RuffaloThe Avengers||Benedict CumberbatchStar Trek Into Darkness\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Female Performance in a Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series\n||Natalie PortmanV for Vendetta||Emma WatsonHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix||Claudia BlackStargate: Continuum||Zoe SaldanaAvatar||Chloë Grace MoretzKick-Ass||Olivia WildeCowboys & Aliens||Sarah SilvermanWreck-It Ralph||Sandra BullockGravity\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Science Fiction Film, TV Movie, or Mini-Series of the year\n||''Pan's Labyrinth||Transformers||WALL-E||Star Trek||Inception||Rise of the Planet of the Apes||Looper||Gravity\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Technical Accomplishment in a Science Fiction Film or Television Production\n||Battlestar Galacticavisual effects||Transformerstransformation effects||WALL-Eanimations||Avatarvisual effects||Doctor Whomusic||Joel GoldsmithStargate Universe music||Frank Griebe and John TollCloud Atlas Cinematography||Tim WebberGravity Visual Effects\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Best Overall Science Fiction Film or Television Script\n||Stargate SG-1 episode200||Supernatural (U.S. TV series) episodeWhat is & what should never be||Doctor Who episodeSilence in the library||FlashForward episodeNo More Good Days||Inception||Stargate Universe episodeTwin Destinies||Continuum episodeA Stitch in Time||Doctor Who episodeThe Day of the Doctor\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"|Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in the year\n||Doctor Who||Tanya HuffBlood Ties||Stargate SG-1 franchise||Bruce Greenwood||Teddy Wilson and Ajay FryHosts of InnerSPACE sci-fi show||Stargate Universe||Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, Creators of Primeval: New World||Tatiana MaslanyOrphan Black''\n|}\nEvents\nConstellation Awards 2007\nConstellation Awards 2007 took place on 7 July in the Plaza Ballroom of the Doubletree International Plaza Hotel.
