It is known for the early bloom of almond flowers. The park is situated at the foothills of Koh e Maraan hill which gives an immense look. It is a historical park which existed before the 14th century, though the exact date is still unknown.\nA well covered dome in the garden is named after an Afghan ruler, Warris Shah.\nThe park is in full bloom during the spring season. The garden is spread over more than 300 kanals of land. The park was revived by the Jammu & Kashmir Bank in 2008; prior to this the park was left abandoned and nomads used to live there during summer.\nDuring the opening ceremony, several cultural activities including traditional Kashmiri folk songs and group dance are performed by local artists every year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
