At independence, Jamaica became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations as a Commonwealth realm; prior to this, Jamaica had been part of the West Indies Federation from 1958. With the independence of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands reverted from being a self-governing territory of Jamaica to direct British rule.\nBackground to enactment\nThe bill was first presented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as the Jamaica Independence Bill on 22 May 1962, by Secretary of State for the Colonies, Reginald Maudling. It was passed in the House of Commons after a third reading and committee on 29 June 1962.\nIt entered the House of Lords on 2 July 1962 and was read by Michael Hicks Beach, 2nd Earl St Aldwyn on 5 July 1962. It was passed in the House of Lords on 16 July 1962 without any amendments.\nThe bill received Royal assent on 19 July 1962, from Queen Elizabeth II.\nSee also\n* Commonwealth of Nations\n* Monarchy of Jamaica\nReferences\n*\n* Chronological table of the statutes; HMSO, London. 1993."
