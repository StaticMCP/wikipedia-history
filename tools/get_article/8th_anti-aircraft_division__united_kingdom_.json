It defended South West England during The Blitz and the Luftwaffe 'hit and run' raids, but only had a short career.\nMobilisation\nThe 8th Anti-Aircraft Division was one of five new divisions created on 1 November 1940 by Anti-Aircraft Command to control the growing anti-aircraft (AA) defences of the United Kingdom. The  division was formed by splitting the 5th AA Division, with the new formation taking responsibility for the City of Bristol and the counties of Somerset, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. Potential targets in this area included the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory and airfield at Filton, and the Royal Navy dockyards at Devonport (Plymouth) and Portland.\nThe Divisional headquarters (HQ) was at Bristol and the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Robert Allen, who was transferred from commanding the 5th AA Division. The division formed part of I AA Corps, which was created at the same time to cover Southern England and Wales. The fighting units, organised in four AA Brigades, consisted of Heavy (HAA) and Light (LAA) gun units and Searchlight (S/L) units of the Royal Artillery, with major concentrations of HAA guns in the Bristol and Plymouth Gun Defence Areas (GDAs)\nThe Blitz\n]]\nWhen the 8th AA Division was formed the Luftwaffes night Blitz on British cities was already under way. There had previously been daylight raids during the Battle of Britain, notably on Bristol and Portland on 25 September 1940, now the night attacks were stepped up both against London and smaller cities, with the ports of Bristol and Plymouth receiving frequent raids, particularly heavy in March 1941 (the Bristol Blitz and Plymouth Blitz).\nIn 1939 the scale of HAA guns (3-inch and the newer 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch guns) allocated to the Bristol GDA (covering Bristol and Avonmouth) had been 56, and this was increased to 80 in 1940, but by the end of February 1941 only 36 were in place. This increased to 68 a month later, though further additions to the establishment were already being called for. The position on LAA gunsites was worse: only small numbers of Bofors 40 mm guns were available at the start of the Blitz, and most LAA detachments had to make do with Light machine guns (LMGs).\nOrder of Battle\nThe division's composition during the Blitz was as follows:\n* 46th AA Brigade – Bristol\n** 76th (Gloucestershire) HAA Rgt\n** 23rd LAA Rgt – to 5th AA Division by May 1941\n** 66th (Gloucesters) S/L Rgt (part)\n** 68th (Monmouthshire Regiment) S/L Rgt\n* 55th AA Brigade – Plymouth and Falmouth, Cornwall\n** 56th (Cornwall) HAA Rgt\n** 118th HAA Rgt (part) – new regiment raised in December 1940; to 9th AA Division by May 1941\n** 58th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Rgt – part deployed at Plymouth, part under 65th AA Brigade at Southampton; left to join 11th Support Group in May 1941\n** 81st S/L Rgt – new unit formed in November 1940 from existing S/L Bty of Cornwall Fortress Royal Engineers\n** 82nd S/L Rgt – new unit formed in November 1940 from existing S/L Bty of Dorset Fortress Royal Engineers\npreserved at Nothe Fort overlooking Portland Harbour]]\n* 60th AA Brigade – Exeter, Yeovil and Portland\n** 104th HAA Rgt\n** 44th LAA Rgt\n** 66th S/L Rgt (part)\n* 64th AA Brigade – Airfield sector layout\n** 35th LAA Rgt\n** 2nd S/L Rgt\n** 3rd (Ulster) S/L Rgt – converted into 4th (Ulster) LAA Rgt in January 1942\n** 76th S/L Rgt\n** 85th S/L Rgt – new unit raised in January 1941\n* 9th AA 'Z' Rgt – equipped with Z Battery rocket launchers, formed by the 8th AA Division in January 1941\n* 8th AA Divisional Signals, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) – formed at Bristol as duplicate of 5th AA Divisional Signals at Reading, Berkshire\n* 8th AA Divisional Royal Army Service Corps (RASC)\n** 191st, 915th and 917th Companies\n* 8th AA Divisional Company, Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC)\n* 8th AA Divisional Workshop Company, Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC)\nMid-War\nBy October 1941 the availability of S/L control radar was sufficient to allow AA Command's S/L sites to be 'declustered' into single-light sites spaced at 10,400-yard intervals in 'Indicator Belts' along the coast and approaches to the GDAs, and 'Killer Belts' at  spacing to cooperate with the RAF's Night-fighters.\nEarly in 1942 the Luftwaffe began a new wave of attacks on British cities (the Baedeker Blitz): Exeter and undefended Bath were hit in March, April and May, and Weston-super-Mare in June. New GDAs were established at Exeter, Taunton, Bath and Salisbury.\nNewly formed AA units joined the division, the HAA and support units increasingly becoming 'Mixed' units, indicating that women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) were fully integrated into them. At the same time, experienced units were posted away to train for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for the invasion of North Africa (Operation Torch) and the need to transfer AA units  to counter the Baedeker raids and the Luftwaffes hit-and-run attacks against South Coast towns.\nThose AA units in the War Office (WO) Reserve rostered for overseas deployment were lent back to AA Command when not required for training. One of these, 103rd HAA Rgt, was moved down from Merseyside, which was rarely attacked by this stage of the war, to reinforce the 8th AA Division in Cornwall in April 1942, establishing its batteries at St Ives, Truro and Penzance under the 55th AA Brigade.\nIn July, the 103rd HAA Rgt was sent for a short attachment to the 11th AA Brigade (the mobile training brigade in Hampshire) and was relieved by 79th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) HAA Rgt which had just completed training with the 11th AA Brigade. The 79th HAA Regiment occupied sites at Hayle, Truro and Penzance on 14 July and the Penzance and Truro guns were in action against raiders early the next morning. The deployment lasted three weeks before the regiment left for further training and the 103rd HAA Rgt returned.\nIn West Cornwall the main threat was from low level daylight 'hit and run' raids by single engined Luftwaffe aircraft (such as attacks by pairs of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s on St Ives on 28 August and Truro on 7 September), which were difficult for HAA guns to engage. Night raids on Truro on 24 September and on Penzance two nights later were engaged by the regiment with both HAA and light machine guns.\nIn August 1942, the 64th AA Brigade was transferred from the 8th AA Division to the 3rd AA Division, a HQ brought down from Scotland to handle the increased workload along the South Coast.\nOrder of Battle\nDuring this period the division was composed as follows (temporary attachments omitted):\n* 46th AA Brigade\n** 59th (Essex Regiment) HAA Rgt – from the 6th AA Division December 1941;

The 8th AA Division merged with the 5th AA Division into the 3rd AA Group based at Bristol and cooperating with No. 10 Group RAF. Major-General Allen retired. The 5th and 8th Divisional Signals re-amalgamated at Bristol as the 3rd AA Group Signals. Postwar the unit became The 57th (City and County of Bristol) Signals Squadron, today part of 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment.\nGeneral Officer Commanding\nThe 8th AA Division only had one commander during its existence:\n* Major-General Robert Hall Allen, MC (11 November 1940 – 30 September 1942)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/index.html Basil Collier, History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series: The Defence of the United Kingdom, London: HM Stationery Office, 1957.]\n* Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939–1941, Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, .\n* J.B.M.
