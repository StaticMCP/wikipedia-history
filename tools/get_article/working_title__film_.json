The film is a satirical mockumentary about a film director who is being interviewed about the problem-plagued production of his planned magnum opus, The Merchant of Venus, by a parody of Canadian television host Elwy Yost.\nThe film premiered at the 1985 Toronto International Film Festival, and was later screened at Toronto Film Now, an event highlighting short films by emerging local directors, in November. Yost also aired it as an interstitial bonus, between the evening's feature films, on his TVOntario film series Saturday Night at the Movies in January 1986.\nThe film was a Genie Award nominee for Best Live Action Short Drama at the 7th Genie Awards in 1986.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
