There were ten constituencies, seven single-seat constituencies with elected by first-past-the-post voting and three two-seat constituencies with MPs elected by plurality block voting.\nResults\nThis was the first general election to Westminster in ten years, as elections had been postponed for the duration of World War II.\nIn the election as a whole, the Conservative Party government, which included the Ulster Unionists, lost out to the Labour Party, and Sir Winston Churchill was succeeded as Prime Minister by Clement Attlee.\n}}\n|gain       = 0\n|loss       = 2\n|net        = -2\n|votes      = 267,363\n|votes %    = 58.2\n|seats %    = 69.2\n|plus/minus = -4.0\n}}\n|}\nVotes in constituencies using the bloc voting system are counted as 0.5 each, as each voter had one vote per seat.\nMPs elected\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!
