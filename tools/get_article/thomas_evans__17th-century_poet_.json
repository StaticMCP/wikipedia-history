He was presented to the rectory of Little Holland, Essex, in 1618, and held that benefice till his death in 1633.\nWorks\nEvans was the author of Oedipus, a rare poetical work. It is dedicated to John Clapham, one of the six clerks in chancery, and in a pedantic preliminary address, the author says that it is his \"first child, but not the heyre of all the fathers wit: there is some laid up to enrich a second brother, to keepe it from accustomed dishonesty, when I shall put it to shift into the world; yet if this prove a griefe to the parent, I will instantly be divorc't from Thalia, and make myself happy in the progeny from a better stocke\". Each canto contains about six hundred lines, rhyming alternately.\nReferences\n;Attribution"
