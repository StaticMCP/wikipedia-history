The trade agreement would be the third FTA to cover South Korea–UK trade, superseding the South Korea–UK Trade Agreement; extending the deal to cover digital trade. In 2021, 80% of the UK's services exports, in areas from legal advice to management consultancy, were delivered digitally.\nHistory\nFrom 1 July 2011 until 30 December 2020, trade between South Korea and the United Kingdom was governed by the European Union–South Korea Free Trade Agreement, while the United Kingdom was a member of the European Union. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK and South Korea signed a continuity trade agreement on 22 August 2019, based on the EU free trade agreement; the agreement entered into force on 1 January 2021.\nNegotiations\nOn 9 December 2022, South Korea and the United Kingdom announced their intentions start talks on a modernised free trade agreement; the agreement would supersede the South Korea–UK Trade Continuity agreement. Trade negotiations formally opened on 22 November 2023.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ KUKFTA Round of Negotiations\n|-\n! Round !! Dates !! Location !!
