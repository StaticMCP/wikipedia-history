It was named Chung Shan Hall after the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945. It was once used as a senior citizens center and Wanchun Gong Suhu Laoyeh Temple. After renovation, it was renamed Lukang Culture Center.\nArchitecture\nThe roof framework of the building was constructed by wood and steel trusses and the top was paved with cement tiling. On the left wall is a wooden monument about local gentlemen's donating money to build the hall.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences"
