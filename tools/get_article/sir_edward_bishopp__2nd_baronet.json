He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War.\nBishopp was the son of Thomas Bishopp of Parham Park, Sussex, and his second wife Jane Weston, daughter of Richard Weston of Sutton Surrey. He was born 6 September 1602. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 22 October 1619, aged 18 and was a student of the Inner Temple in 1620. He was knighted at Hampton Court on 18 December 1625 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1626. In 1626, he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Steyning.\nIn 1627 Bishopp killed Henry Shirley when Shirley attempted to collect a £40 annual annuity that Bishopp owed him under the terms of a bequest. After initially escaping, Bishopp was captured, charged with manslaughter and sentenced to be burnt on the hand. He was later pardoned on condition that he paid the annuity to the victim's elder brother, which he never did. He was nevertheless named Sheriff of Sussex in 1636.\nIn April 1640, Bishopp was elected MP for Bramber in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected in the Long Parliament in November 1640 until his election was declared void in December. He supported the King in the civil war and was governor of Arundel Castle on behalf of the King in 1643 and was taken prisoner at the surrender of the castle in January 1644. His estates were sequestrated and he compounded in October 1644. He was fined £7,500 in October 1645 which was later reduced to £4,790.\nIn about 1626 Bishopp married Mary Tufton, daughter of Nicholas Tufton, Earl of Thanet and Frances Cecil, the daughter of Thomas Cecil, Earl of Exeter and Dorothy Neville. Bishopp died at the age of about 47 and was succeeded briefly in the baronetcy by his son Thomas, born 3 Dec 1627. In 1651, Thomas, his mother Mary, and sisters Frances, Diana, Christina, and Mary, successfully appealed for the portion of Bishopp's estate that was intended for the maintenance of his widow and daughters to be released from sequestration.\nThomas died unmarried and without issue in 1652 and was succeeded by his brother Cecil (c. 1635 – 3 June 1705).\nReferences\n|-"
