The site appears to currently be under disputed governance. A number of Cypro-Minoan Script inscriptions were found there including the longest known clay tablet. It has been suggested that this city was the Alashiya of the Amarna letters and in texts from several areas of the ancient Near East. The site is known for the hundreds of rich tombs that have been excavated and for exceptional metallurgic finds like the Ingot God and the Horned God.\nHistory\nThe chronology of Cyprus during the later half of the 2nd millennium BC is defined as follows:\n*Late Cypriot I LC I 1650–1550 BC\n*Late Cypriot IIA LC IIA 1550–1450 BC\n*Late Cypriot IIB LC IIB 1450–1300 BC\n*Late Cypriot IIC LC IIC 1300–1200 BC\n*Late Cypriot IIIA LC IIIA 1200–1100 BC\n*Late Cypriot IIIB LC IIIB 1100–1050 BC\nEnkomi was settled in the Middle Bronze Age, near an inlet from the sea (now silted up). From about the 16th to 12th centuries BC, it was an important trading center for copper, which was smelted at the site, with strong cultural links to Ugarit on the facing coast of Syria.\nThe complicated and badly disturbed stratigraphy of the site has four major phases, with many subdivisions:\n* Level A, Middle Bronze, a poorly represented preliminary stratum on bedrock. Pottery and scarabs found there led the excavators to date the level to 1900 to 1700 BC. The site then had a period of abandonment leaving a sterile stratum in the archaeological record;\n* Level I A, and B, at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. Dated by the excavators to have started slowly , reached property by , and been destroyed by an earthquake . Corresponds to the Late Cypriote I and II;\n* Level II A, and B, with many subdivisions, covering the elaborate expansion of the 14th and 13th centuries and ending in a mass destruction ;\n* Level III A, B, and C, with Mycenaean settlers, with a destructive attack, possibly related to the Sea Peoples in IIIA, culturally continuous with IIIB, ending in a destruction , and IIIC, a final, Mycenaean phase with dwindling population.\nArchaeology\n)]]\nbeads, Cypriot artwork with Mycenaean inspiration, –1200 BCE. From Enkomi. British Museum]]\nFollowing more than a decade of damage by looters attracted by the high quality of Enkomi's tomb gifts, Alessandro Palma di Cesnola drew the attention of archaeologists to the site after very briefly digging there in 1878. Most of the early excavations focused on the tomb area. The settlement remains were thought to be from the Byzantine period and a substantial portion were destroyed assuming they were unimportant. Alexander Stuart Murray worked there for the British Museum from 1895 to 1898. A total of 100 tombs were excavated. Under laws at the time, 2/3 of the finds went to the British Museum and the rest to the Cyprus Museum. The publication of excavation results was quite thin, mainly covering high status items. In 2003, the original excavation field notebook was published, detailing most of the individual tomb excavations. Unsuccessful trial excavations, also in the tomb area, were conducted in 1913 by the Cyprus Museum and in 1927 by R. Gunnis, though the latter did discover a hoard of bronzes. In 1930, a Swedish Cyprus Expedition team led by Einar Gjerstad excavated for two months in the tomb area, uncovering 22 \"productive\" tombs. Human remains were found seated and supine with robes fastened by gold pins, with grave goods of gold, silver, faience, and ivory. Some had diadems on their foreheads decorated with geometric ornaments, floral motifs or figures, and gold tin over their mouths. Ceramic and bronze vessels contained food and drink offerings. It has been suggested that one pottery shard was manufactured in Canaan, specifically in Ashdod. As they assumed that burial and settlement areas were separated the excavators used a pit digging technique that ended up destroying settlement remains:\nIn 1934, Claude Frédéric-Armand Schaeffer put in trial trenches, including about 200 soundings and partially excavating one building he named the Maison des Bronzes. Excavations were conducted between 1948 and 1973 by a joint expedition between Schaeffer for the French Expedition and Porphyrios Dikaios on behalf of the Cyprus Department of Antiquities. Early work determined that the site had been protected by a Cyclopean wall constructed of stone orthostat slabs up to  long. The wall enclosed an area of about 2.5 hectares. Cypriot excavations were conducted from 1848 until 1958 under Dikaios. French excavations, on behalf of the French National Centre for Scientific Research, proceeded under Schaeffer until 1970 at which point the expedition was led by Oliver Pelon. Excavation ended with the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the status of excavated objects in Mission storage are currently unknown.\nAn extensive metallurgy industry was found at Enkomi. Numerous production facilities, raw materials, and finished products were excavated, including three copper oxhide ingots (one at the Cyprus Museum and one at Harvey Mudd College). The most notable finished good finds were the \"Ingot God\", a statue wearing a horned conical hat and greaves, armed with shield and spear, and standing on a miniature hide-shaped ingot, and \"Horned God\".\nThe Horned God, measuring  in height, was found in a pit dug in the third phase of a very large tripartite ashlar building, built in the Late Cypriot III period (early 12th century BC) over earlier structures destroyed by an earthquake, also the dating of the statue. Large numbers of oxen skulls, stag antlers, animal bones, and miniature horns of gold sheet and other gold ornaments were found in the area in which the statue had originally stood, suggesting ritual activity. This level was also destroyed.\nA decorated metal cup, the \"Enkomi Cup\" has been controversially claimed to use niello decoration, which would make it one of the earliest uses of this technique. However, controversy has continued since the 1960s as to whether the material used actually is niello.\nThere are thought to have been around 2,000 tombs at the site. Most of the archaeological work at Enkomi has been on the intra-settlement tombs. The 1896 British team excavated about 100 tombs, mostly already looted. The Swedish work in 1930 excavated 28 tombs. In the most recent excavations, the French team dug 37 tombs and the Cypriot team excavated 30. Of the excavated tombs, most were chamber tombs. One was a tholos tomb (Tomb 71) and four were built tombs (Tombs 1, 11, 12 and 66).\nCypro-Minoan Script finds\nIn 1967 a small terracotta cylinder (#097 ENKO Arou 001) was found at Enkomi. It is dated to the Late Cypriot IIA–B period (fourteenth century BC) and is inscribed in the Cypro-Minoan 1 (CM1) variant, sometimes called Linear C. The text is the longest CM1 text found outside Syria. The cylinder holds 27 lines lines of text with 217 signs in total. The Cypro-Minoan Script is yet untranslated nor is the underlying language known with certainty.\nFour Cypro-Minoan Script tablets have also been found, three are in the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia and one is in the Louvre Museum. One tablet (#1885) was found in the north area of the site in \"room 103 of the Late Cypriote I building called the Fortress\", with only the top portion remaining. It is written in the Cypro-Minoan variant and dates to LC IB (1525–1425 BC) and contains 23 total signs, 21 on the obverse and 2 on the edge. Two other tables were found in a Late Cypriote III context, one (#1193 in two fragments) dated to LC IIIB (12th century BC) in the north area and one (#1687) dated to LC IIIA (late 13th-early 12th century BC) in the central area. One, AM 2336, is of unknown context.\nShort Cypro-Minoan inscriptions were found on three terracotta vessel. fragments. The first (Inv. 1904, PI. VI a) has four signs and part of a fifth and is dated to Mycenaean III C:lb (c. 1200 BC). The second (Inv. 4025, PI. VI b) contains six signs in two lines and is also dated to Mycenaean III C:lb (c. 1200 BC). The third (Inv 1848/12 PI. Vic) contains a single character incised after baking and its dating is unclear. Another example, found in a looted tomb during the 1913 trial excavation has 7 signs and is also of uncertain date. A single clay ball (AS 2226), held in the Louvre Museum, bears two signs.\nSee also\n*Cities of the ancient Near East\n*Hala Sultan Tekke\n*Kourion\n*Kition\n*Idalium\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Antoniadou, Sophia, \"The Impact of Trade on Late Cypriot Society: A Contextual Study of Imports from Enkomi\", Archaeological Perspectives on the Transmission and Transformation of Culture in the Eastern Mediterranean, edited by Joanne Clarke, Council for British Research in the Levant (CBRL), pp. 66–78, 2005\n*Courtois, J-C., \"Alasia II.
