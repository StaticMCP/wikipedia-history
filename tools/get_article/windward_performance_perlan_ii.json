Its design goal is to reach and exceed  in altitude. The project's goals include science, engineering and education. The aircraft will be used to study the northern polar vortex and its influence on global weather patterns. It has already surpassed the sub-sonic altitude record set in 1989 by a Lockheed U-2. The program also hopes to beat the 85,069&nbsp;ft altitude record set in 1975 by a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.\nThe aircraft is made from composites. Its  span wing has a high aspect ratio of 27.1 and is equipped with airbrakes. The pressurization system produces an 8.5 psi differential, and the two-person crew will not wear pressure suits. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel gear. Because the aircraft will operate at extreme altitudes, in only 3% of sea level atmospheric pressure, it will also be flying at true airspeeds in excess of 0.5 Mach. The aircraft was designed to minimize flutter and manage shock wave formation.\nThe original funding for the Perlan Project was provided by Steve Fossett and he flew the Perlan 1, along with test pilot Einar Enevoldson to a glider altitude record of  in the mountain waves of El Calafate, Argentina on 30 August 2006. Fossett was killed in a light aircraft crash a year later and the project floundered without funding. Since then more than US$2.8M has been raised to build the Perlan 2, including a donation in 2010 from Dennis Tito. In November 2013, a crowd-funding effort was undertaken. In August 2014 Airbus became a partner in the project and the title sponsor.\nThe Perlan 2 first flew in 2015 and started with flights in the U.S. Sierra Nevada mountain wave. The record setting and research flights started in southern Argentina in 2016, by Einar Envoldson or Perrenod using rebreather oxygen systems. The aircraft was displayed at AirVenture in July 2015.\nWorld records\nOn 3 September 2017 Perlan 2, flown by Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock, reached an altitude of , establishing a new world record for gliders over the Andes Mountain range in Argentina.\nOn 2 September 2018, Jim Payne and Tim Gardner reached an altitude of , surpassing the  attained by Jerry Hoyt on April 17, 1989, in a Lockheed U-2: the highest subsonic flight.\nComplete list of records\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Record type\n!Pressure altitude\n!Pilot\n!Crew\n|-\n|2017-09-03\n|Gliders\n|52,172 ft (15,902 m)\n|James M.
