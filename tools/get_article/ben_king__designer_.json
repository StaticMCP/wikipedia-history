In 1944, he was awarded a Neiman Marcus Fashion Award for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion. Although he produced some clothing, including a vibrant India-print pajamas ensemble in 1954, King was known particularly for accessories, being listed as a leading designer of belts in 1953. Ben King handbags were still available from stores such as Bonwit Teller in the mid-1970s, being featured in Vogue and ''Harper's Bazaar''.-\nReferences"
