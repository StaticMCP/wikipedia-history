On Rotten Tomatoes, \"100\" garnered a 75% rating, with an average score of 7.5/10 based on 8 reviews.\nMatt Fowler of IGN gave \"100\" a 9/10 rating, stating; \"\"100\" felt fresh and immediate and for the first time, even though it only focused in on one main character, Fear the Walking Dead felt wholly like its own unique endeavor. The same universe as the original series, sure, but with vitally different perspectives, angles, and objectives. It kind of answered that recurring question \"Why have another Walking Dead show?\" as Daniel was constantly saved while also constantly being placed in situations where he was called upon to do harm to innocent people. People who he even owned a great debt to. It was stunning and Ruben Blades was mesmerizing.\"\nRatings\n\"100\" was seen by 2.40 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, below the previous episodes rating of 2.50 million.\nReferences"
