Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship title. That title is bestowed by one or more of four different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason: the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll. About halfway through the season, two additional polls are released, the Harris Interactive Poll and the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings. The Harris Poll and Coaches Poll are factors in the BCS standings. At the end of the season, the BCS standings determine who plays in the BCS bowl games as well as the BCS National Championship Game.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n|

notable in that the winner of the BCS Championship Game was not the unanimous number 1.  While the coaches are obligated to vote the winner of that game, Utah coach Kyle Whittingham voted his team number 1 after they defeated favored Alabama in the 2009 Sugar Bowl and completed the only undefeated season (13–0).\n|Week2Date =Sept 2\n|Week3Date =Sept 7\n|Week4Date =Sept 14\n|Week5Date =Sept 21\n|Week6Date =Sept 28\n|Week7Date =Oct 5\n|Week8Date =Oct 12\n|Week9Date =Oct
