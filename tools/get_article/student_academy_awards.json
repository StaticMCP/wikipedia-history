It is an annual awards program for college and university filmmakers.\nDescription\nThe awards were originally named the Student Film Awards and were first presented in 1973. The current name was adopted effective in 1991. Since 1975, the awards have been given annually. The event has been held in October since 2017 and usually takes place at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California.\nThe awards offer prizes in four categories: alternative (experimental film), animation, documentary, and narrative. Gold, silver, and bronze awards are given in each category. Since 1981, a separate award has been given annually to a student filmmaker from outside the United States – however in the 49th annual SAA (2022), the academy merged its domestic and international categories. This reduced the 7 categories (4 domestic & 3 international) into 4 = narrative, animation, alternative/ experimental and documentary.\nSeveral award winners have gone on to significant achievement as filmmakers, including Robert Zemeckis, Bob Saget, Spike Lee, Trey Parker, Pete Docter and John Lasseter. Some of the award-winning student films have themselves been nominated for and/or won the Academy Award in the short film categories, including Chicks in White Satin, The Janitor, Karl Hess: Toward Liberty, The Lunch Date, 9, Quiero ser (I want to be...), Gang Cops, The Death of Kevin Carter: Casualty of the Bang Bang Club, The Red Jacket, On the Line (Auf der Strecke), God of Love, The Confession, 4.1 Miles An Ostrich Told Me the World Is Fake and I Think I Believe It and Dcera (Daughter).\nCopies (and some elements) for over 90% of films honored with Student Academy Awards, along with recordings of many of the awards ceremonies, are held by the Academy Film Archive.\nIn 2024, the 51st Student Academy Awards were held in London, and the following year the 52nd ceremony was held in New York City in the Ziegfeld Ballroom.\nThe Student Academy Awards are sponsored by Rolex.\nList of winners\n1970s\n1st Annual Student Film Awards December 20, 1973\n* Animation: Anti-matter, Lewis Hall, Carlos Guiterrez-Mena University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles)\n**Nominees: Cosmic Cartoon, Steven Lisberger, Eric Ladd Boston University (Boston)\n* Documentary: ''You See, I've Had a Life, Ben Levin, Mort Jordan Temple University (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)\n* Dramatic: Manhattan Melody, Reuben Trane, Ken WiederhornColumbia University (New York City)\n* Special Jury (Dramatic): Norman Nurdelpick's Suspension: A Tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, Bob DahlinNorthwestern University (Evanston, Illinois)\n2nd Annual Student Film Awards July 1, 1975\n* Animation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1q6JL8JbI Euphoria], Vincent Collins San Francisco Art Institute (San Francisco)\n* Documentary: Men's Lives, Josh Hanig, Will Roberts Antioch College (Yellow Springs, Ohio)\n* Dramatic: Swag, Bruce Postman New York University School of the Arts (New York City)\n* Experimental: Architecture of the Petroleum Age, Scott Thomas Rice University (Houston, Texas)\n* Special Jury (Dramatic): A Field of Honor, Robert Zemeckis University of Southern California (Los Angeles)\n3rd Annual Student Film Awards June 23, 1976\n* Animation: Fame, Mark Kirkland, Richard Jefferies California Institute of the Arts (Valencia, California)\n* Documentary: What the Notes Say Karen Grossman'', Richard O'Neill Adelphi University (Garden City, New York)\n* Dramatic: The Preparatory, Terence Cahalan University of Southern California (Los Angeles)\n* Experimental: After Lumiere, Joan Laine University of California, Los Angeles (Los Angeles)\n* Special Jury (Documentary): The American Love Affair, Lee M.
