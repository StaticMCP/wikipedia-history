In the , Stewart Creek Valley had a population of 24 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the north by the Daintree River. Stewart Creek rises in Dedin to the south-west and enters the locality from the south and then flows north through the locality becoming a tributary of the Daintree River at the locality's northern boundary.\nStewart Creek Road commences at the western end of the neighbouring town of Daintree and enters the locality from the north-east and loosely follows Stewart Creek, mostly to the east of the creek.\nThe land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with small amounts of crop growing and rural residential housing.\nHistory\nIn 1879, John, Archie and Gavin Stewart were the first settlers in the Daintree area.\nTwyford Provisional School opened in 1938, noting that the name Stewart's Creek State School was already in use for a school in Stewart's Creek (now called Stuart) in Townsville . The school name being different to the locality name led to a proposal that the locality be renamed Twyford, as mail sent to Stewart's Creek was often wrongly delivered to the Stewart's Creek Gaol in Townsville, leading to delays, but the locality name was not changed. The school closed at the start of 1942 due to low student numbers.\nIn 1952, the Twyford telephone exchange was installed. In 1953, a new post office was built.\nDemographics\nIn the , Stewart Creek Valley had a population of 18 people.\nIn the , Stewart Creek Valley had a population of 24 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Stewart Creek Valley. The nearest government primary school is Daintree State School in neighbouring Daintree to the north-east. The nearest government secondary school is Mossman State High School in Mossman to the south. There is also a Catholic primary school in Mossman.\nPopular culture\nThe film \"The Thin Red Line\" set in World War II was filmed in Stewarts's Creek in 1997 and released in 1998.\nReferences"
