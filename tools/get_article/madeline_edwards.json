With former partner Zhao Kai Pang, she is the 2014 World Junior bronze medalist and 2013 Canadian Junior Champion.\nCareer\nMadeline Edwards teamed with Zhao Kai Pang in December 2007. They debuted on the ISU Junior Grand Prix series in 2011, placing fifth in Austria. The following season, they won a pair of bronze medals at their JGP assignments, in France and Turkey, and gold in the junior event at the 2013 Canadian Championships. They were sent to the 2013 World Junior Championships, where they finished 12th.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Edwards and Pang won two JGP medals, silver in Mexico and bronze in the Czech Republic. Because Skate Canada required junior champions to move up, they competed on the senior level domestically, with a different pattern in the short dance and an additional 30 seconds in the free dance. They finished seventh at the 2014 Canadian Championships. At the 2014 World Junior Championships, they won the bronze medal after placing fifth in the short dance and third in the free dance.\nEdwards and Pang continued competing on the JGP series in the 2014–15 season. They were awarded silver in Courchevel, France, finishing second to Russia's Alla Loboda / Pavel Drozd by a margin of 2.82 points. After edging Loboda/Drozd by 0.44 to win gold in Aichi, Japan, they qualified for the JGP Final in Barcelona, where they placed fifth. Edwards injured her ankle during training in late December 2014. Ranked sixth in the short and fourth in the free dance, the duo finished sixth at the 2015 World Junior Championships in Tallinn, Estonia.\nEdwards and Pang sat out the 2015–16 season to allow her ankle to fully heal. His retirement in July 2016 ended the partnership.\nPrograms\n(with Pang)\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n! Season\n! Short dance\n! Free dance\n!
