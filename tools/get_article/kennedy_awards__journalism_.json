However the Kennedy Awards quickly grew to being a national event. The Kennedy Foundation was created as a charitable organisation on 7 March 2014 in order to attract funds for the awards and other endeavours, including providing scholarships for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander journalists.\nThe awards have been run annually without interruption since 2012. In 2021 they were also referred to as the NRMA Kennedy Awards, being sponsored by the NRMA. There were 34 categories in 2022.\nIn 2021–2022 the Kennedy Foundation entered a sponsorship deal with an organisation calling itself the Australian Journalists Association, which was exposed as a front for an organisation of dubious integrity, the Journalists First Inc., a small group of conservative political operatives based in Queensland which spread anti-vaccination and other controversial information. The foundation ceased its association with this organisation in May 2022.\nKennedy Foundation\nThe foundation is a strong advocate for cultural and gender diversity in media.  the foundation is chaired by accountant Carl Dumbrell; in 2021 the chair was Rocco Fazzari.\nAwards\nThe awards take place in Sydney. The main prize is Journalist of the Year (won by women in seven out of the nine events after 2012). Five of its awards are named after outstanding journalists, in several categories: Sport (Peter Frilingos); Indigenous Affairs (John Newfong); Outstanding Columnist (Peter Ruehl); Les Kennedy (Outstanding Crime Reporting) and Outstanding Foreign Correspondent (Tom Krause).\nPast winners\n;The Kennedy Prize – Journalist of the Year:\n*2012: Kate McClymont, The Sydney Morning Herald\n*2013: Joanne McCarthy, Newcastle Herald\n*2014: Adele Ferguson, Fairfax Media, ABC TV\n*2015: Caro Meldrum-Hanna, Four Corners, ABC TV\n*2016: Adele Ferguson\n*2017: Chris O'Keefe, Nine News\n*2018: Sharri Markson, The Daily Telegraph\n*2019: Anne Connolly, Four Corners, 7:30, ABC TV\n*2020: Nick McKenzie, of 60 Minutes, The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald\n*2021: Samantha Maiden, of news.com.au\n*2022: Nick McKenzie\n*2023: Neil Chenoweth and Edmund Tadros, of The Australian Financial Review\n*2024: John Lyons\n;Lifetime Achievement Award:\n*2013: Harry Potter, Ten News\n*2014: Philip Cornford\n*2015: Ian Heads\n*2016: John Smith, The Daily Telegraph\n*2017: Ita Buttrose\n*2018: Jana Wendt\n*2019: Brian Henderson\n*2020: John Hartigan\n*2021: John Laws\n*2022: Bruce McAvaney , of Seven Network\n*2023: Laurie Oakes\n*2024: Tracey Grimshaw\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
