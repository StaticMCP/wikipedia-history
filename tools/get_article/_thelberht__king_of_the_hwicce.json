It is probable that they were all sons of Oshere, although the paternity of Æthelheard and Æthelberht is not explicitly stated in surviving documents.\nIn 692, together with Æthelheard, Æthelweard, and Æthelric, he witnessed a charter of Æthelred, King of Mercia.\nIn 693 the four brothers witnessed a charter issued by their father Oshere.\nIn neither of these charters is he styled king.\nSee also\n*Hwicce\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
