The ruling family belonged to the Solanki (Chaulukya) clan of Rajputs, originally from Gujarat. Historical references indicate that the region was ruled by Raja Anand Singh Solanki during the late Mughal era. Dost Mohammad Khan, who later founded the Bhopal State, is known to have begun his career in Mangalgarh as a military mercenary.\nHistorical Background\nThe rulers of Mangalgarh are traditionally believed to have migrated from Lunawada in Gujarat. According to oral tradition and family genealogies, the founding lineage traces back to the Solankis of Gujarat. The estate held a small but strategic position in the Vindhyanchal range and was known for its fortified hill structure, now referred to as Mangalgarh Fort.\nFort and Geography\nMangalgarh Fort lies in a forested stretch of Vindhya hills near Berasia. Though largely in ruins today, it was locally important for its garrison and natural vantage point. The region is still referred to as \\\"Solankiwada\\\" in memory of the historical ruling family.\nLineage\nFamily traditions record the following line of succession:\n* Rao Bahadur Chain Singh\n* Rao Raja Bhupendra Singh\n* Rawat Tribhuvan Singh\n* Rawat Chaturbhuj Singh\n* Rawat Digvijay Singh\n* Rawat Narendra Singh\n* Rao Raja Hemendra Singh\n* Rawat Surendra Singh\n* Rawat Trilok Singh\n* Rawat Jaydeep Singh\n* Rawat Pradeep Singh\n* Kuldeep Singh Solanki (Current family head, born 1967)\nModern Presence\nWhile Mangalgarh is no longer a princely estate, descendants of the Solanki rulers continue to document their heritage. Recent efforts include creating a digital archive, historical timeline, and crest-based family emblem. One such summary is published online.\nReferences\nSee Also\n* Solanki dynasty\n* Rajputana\n* Bhopal princely state\n* Lunawada State"
