Formerly part of the Moderate Current Coalition, it describes itself as \"in the center: in the right-wing economically, and left-wing socially.\"\nThe party was founded by Mohamed al-Sawy, one of the two Al-Hadara members to be elected to the People's Assembly in the 2011-2012 parliamentary elections. Another prominent party member is Hatem Khater, head of the Egyptian Food Bank.\nReferences"
