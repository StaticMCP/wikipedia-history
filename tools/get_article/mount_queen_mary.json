The first ascent took place in 1961, when a seven-person team from Seattle climbed the northeast ridge. The west ridge was first climbed in 1978 by a Canadian team including a dog. Several other ascents of the peak have been made, but largely from the north and west sides of the mountain.\nSee also\n* Mountain peaks of Canada\n* Mountain peaks of North America\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Mount Queen Mary photo: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/29750062@N06/37209441985/in/album-72157678911028175/ Flickr]"
