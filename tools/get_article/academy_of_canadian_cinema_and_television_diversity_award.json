It was introduced in 1988 as the Multiculturalism Award under the umbrella of the Gemini Awards, and renamed to the Canada Award in 1993. The winner of the award was generally announced in advance of the ceremony, although the award was presented to the producers at the ceremony.\nIt was renamed to the Diversity Award in 2014 after the Geminis were merged into the Canadian Screen Awards. It has not been presented since the 4th Canadian Screen Awards in 2016.\nNational Film Board of Canada productions and co-productions have won approximately half of all Canada Awards.\nWinners by year\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n!
