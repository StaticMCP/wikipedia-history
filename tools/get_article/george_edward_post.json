Post published broadly in the areas of natural history, medicine, and theology. Post formally described 221 taxa, and published an extensive volume on the Flora of Syria, Palestine and Sinai in 1896.\nHe was also one of the contributors to ''Smith's Bible Dictionary'', in 1893.\nLater, a new and revised edition of Post's seminal work was published posthumously in 1932–1933 by John Edward Dinsmore, entitled Flora of Syria, Palestine, and Sinai: Volume 1: A Handbook of The Flowering Plants and Ferns, Native and Naturalized From The Taurus to Ras Muhammad And From the Mediterranean Sea to The Syrian Desert, Vol I and II, and which includes a description of many new plants, including Iris hermona.\nIn 1875, Pierre Edmond Boissier and Charles Isidore Blanche published Postia (in the Asteraceae family), it is now a synonym of Rhanteriopsis lanuginosa. Then in 1985, botanist Evgeniy Vasilyevich Kljuykov published Postiella, which is a monotypic genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae and named in Post's honour.\nFor his work as a surgeon and missionary, he received the Order of the Red Eagle from the Kingdom of Prussia.\nHe died in Beirut on September 30, 1909.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Jessup, H.
