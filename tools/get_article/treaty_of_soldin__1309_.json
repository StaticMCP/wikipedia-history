However, during the siege, disputes arose as to the extent of the fort that was to be loaned to the Teutonic Knights, and after being seized and briefly imprisoned, the Polish troops departed the siege. After they captured the city, the Teutonic Knights massacred its inhabitants and took the town for their own.\nHowever, the Order still lacked any legal basis for their possession of Danzig. As a result, they purchased these from Brandenburg, as well as the rights to most of Pomerelia (Dirschau (Tczew), Schwetz (Świecie) and their hinterlands) for 10,000 silver Mark, despite the fact that the initial claims to Danzig and surrounding areas by Brandenburg were themselves of dubious legality.\nThe treaty was subsequently confirmed in 1311 by Emperor-elect Henry VII, but repeatedly questioned by Poles, resulting in the Polish-Teutonic Wars.\nIn the Treaty of Kalisz (1343), the Polish king finally recognized the territorial changes.\nThe treaty gave the Teutonic Order control of the lower Vistula, a direct access to the Baltic Sea through Danzig, and a continuous route into the Holy Roman Empire. The same year the treaty was signed, the order's headquarters were moved from Venice to Marienburg (Malbork).\nReferences"
