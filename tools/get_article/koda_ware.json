It is also known as .\nMost of the decorative style is influenced by Goryeo ware.\nThe Hirayama Kiln Site  is inscribed in the list of Historic Sites of Japan (Kumamoto).\nHistory\nKōda ware is believed to have originated with the relocation of Hosokawa Mitsunao from Buzen Province to Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto) in 1632, which included moving potters who had produced Agano ware. However, it is more likely that Kōda ware production began before the arrival of the Hosokawas under the Kaga clan, who ruled Higo prior to their arrival.\nThe best-known Kōda ware was produced under the supervision of the Korean potter Sonkai, around 1658.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.pref.kumamoto.jp/kennan/kiji_7517.html"
