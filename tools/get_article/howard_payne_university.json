It is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas. Noah T. Byers and John David Robnett founded Howard Payne College in 1889. It was named for its first major benefactor, Edward Howard Payne, who was Robnett's brother-in-law.\nAthletic programs include NCAA Division III football, baseball, softball, women's volleyball, men's and women's soccer, basketball and tennis. The HPU mascot is a yellow jacket named \"Buzzsaw\".\nThe university also has extension centers in New Braunfels, Texas and in El Paso, Texas.\nFounding and history\nOn June 20, 1889, Howard Payne College was founded at Indian Creek by members of the Pecan Valley Baptist Association. It was named for its first financial benefactor, Robnett's brother-in-law Edward Howard Payne. HPC held its first classes in 1890 and granted its first degree in 1895, to Robnett. In 1915, the yellow jacket was chosen by Carrie (Camp) Allen as the university mascot.\nThomas H. Taylor led the university through the Great Depression, which began two months into his presidency. Robert Mangrum, university historian of HPU, says it was apparent to Taylor at the 1930 Texas Baptist convention that HPU would have to close due to an inability to continue funding through the BGCT. A faculty prayer meeting was held upon his return to Brownwood, writes Mangrum, and it was decided that HPC would continue to operate with no deficits through the receipts and endowment interests.\nDaniel Baker College, a Presbyterian college in Brownwood, consolidated with HPC in 1953. Taylor retired as the college's longest-serving president (26 years) after leading it through the Great Depression and helping the campus expand.\nGuy D. Newman was named HPC's next president. Under his leadership, the Douglas MacArthur Academy of Freedom was established. The program is now called the Guy D. Newman Honors Academy and is still housed in the Academy of Freedom, formerly DBC's main building. Newman retired in 1972. HPC became Howard Payne University in 1974.\nDon Newbury, a 1961 graduate of HPU, served as president of the university from 1985 to 1997. HPU's student enrollment increased significantly during Newbury's presidency. The university also underwent numerous upgrades and additions to campus facilities. HPU's \"Buzzsaw\" mascot was announced in 1996, during Newbury's presidency.\nThe university celebrated one of its most significant athletics successes during the 2000s, with the HPU women's basketball team capping a perfect 33-0 season by winning the 2008 NCAA Division III Women's Basketball National Championship.\nCory Hines, a 1997 graduate of HPU, was named president in 2019. Under his presidency, ground was broken for the Newbury Family Welcome Center in 2020. Construction on the project was scheduled for completion in 2022. The university also began restoring the Douglas MacArthur Academy of Freedom's wings in 2020. Other campus improvement projects were completed in 2020 and 2021, including renovations to the Veda Hodge Residence Hall lobby, the Newbury Place Student Apartments, and the lobbies of the Guy D. Newman Hall of American Ideals.\nPresidents\n# A. J. Emerson 1890–1893\n# John D. Robnett 1893–1896\n# James H. Grove 1896–1908\n# John S. Humphreys (Acting President) 1908–1910\n# Robert H.
