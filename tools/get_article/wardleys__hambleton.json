The building dated to the 18th century and occupied a location, on the eastern banks of the River Wyre and beside Wardleys Creek, believed to have been used since Roman times.\nIn the 1890s, during part of its life as a hotel, it was owned by Thomas Houghton. In the 1950s, R. F. Fyles was the proprietor. It was also a farm during that era, and a fire destroyed its barn in December 1899; the hotel was not affected.\nAfter the pub's closure in 2005, the building fell into disuse and dereliction, during which time it was used as a marijuana-growing location on its upper floors and a Chinese restaurant on the ground floor. It closed in late 2010 and burned down on 25 April 2011. It was then demolished, and has now been replaced by a home, built by the last owner of the pub.\nGallery\nFile:Wardleys Creek.png|An aerial view of Wardleys Creek, with the pub at the top of the picture\nFile:Wardley's Creek at Hambleton - geograph.org.uk - 109725.jpg|A view of the pub from Wardleys Creek, looking northwest\nFile:River Wyre from Wardleys - geograph.org.uk - 109723.jpg|Looking northwest from the pub car park across the River Wyre to the ICI works at Thornton and Fleetwood\nFile:England and Scotland 017.jpg|Wardleys Pub viewed from Wyre Estuary Country Park in Stanah, 2007.
