Ambrose Upton, canon of Christ Church, Oxford.\nMary Ronkswood advanced £500 (shortly before her marriage) towards the capital of the lead smelting enterprise of Sir Clement Clerke and his son Talbot, using reverberatory furnaces. However, her husband and her partner in the enterprise, Lord Grandison, were suspicious of the Clerkes. The result was that the enterprise was the subject of litigation, which continued until after Henry Howard inherited the earldom with its associated estates. He seems then to have stopped contesting the litigation, which was decided in favour of the Clerkes.\nReferences"
