Some of the artforms that have described Jesus' nativity include drama (including television and films) and music (including opera). Featured characters usually include Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.\nLiterature\n*Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, Part One (1880)\nDrama\n*The Nativity appears in many cycles of the Mystery Plays, dating back to medieval times.\n*Laurence Housman (Bethlehem, 1902; musical accompaniment by Joseph Moorat c.1919).\n*Lucjan Rydel (Polish Bethlehem, 1904).\n*Cicely Hamilton (The Child in Flanders: A Nativity Play, 1922.\n*Dorothy L.

Sartre saw Christ as part of the Jewish Resistance to the Roman Empire's occupation, mirroring the French Resistance of Nazi Germany's occupation.\nOpera and musicals\n*Rutland Boughton, English composer and founder of the original Glastonbury Festival, wrote a very popular Nativity opera in 1915 called Bethlehem. In 1926, in sympathy with the General Strike and the miners' lockout, he restaged it in London, in modern dress, with Jesus born in a miner's cottage and Herod as the top-hatted capitalist, flanked by soldiers and police.\n*Two From Galilee - A musical of Mary and Joseph leading up to the birth of Jesus Christ\n*Amahl and the Night Visitors by Gian Carlo Monetti\nFilm\n*Ben-Hur (1959) recounts the Nativity in its prologue, and Balthasar (a major character) also recounts it in the third person later in the film.\n*The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) begins with the Nativity.\n*''Monty Python's Life of Brian (1978) depicts Magi (Three Wise Men) at the wrong stable almost giving their gifts to the infant Brian.\n*The Nativity Story (2006)\n*Nativity!
