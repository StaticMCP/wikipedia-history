The award, which includes a £1000 prize, was first granted in 2017.   It is named after Sam Edwards.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Name\n!Institution\n!scope = col class = unsortable|For\n|-\n|2017\n|Tom McLeish\n| Durham University\n| his sustained and outstanding contributions to the fields of molecular rheology, macromolecular biophysics and self-assembly\n|-\n|2019\n|Wilson Poon\n| University of Edinburgh\n| his outstanding contributions to the fundamental study of condensed matter physics, statistical physics and biophysics using model colloidal systems.\n|-\n|2020\n|Julia Higgins\n|Imperial College\n|her pioneering work in neutron scattering applied to the understanding of polymer structure and dynamics.\n|-\n|2021\n|Julia Yeomans\n| University of Oxford\n| developing mathematical models and numerical algorithms to increase our understanding of soft and active matter, statistical physics and biophysics.\n|-\n|2022\n|Daan Frenkel\n|University of Cambridge\n|seminal contributions to the understanding of the kinetics, self-assembly and phase behaviour of soft matter systems, and for developing highly innovative and influential simulation methods.\n|-\n|2023\n|Ulrich Keyser\n| University of Cambridge\n| pioneering the study of transport of structured nucleic-acid molecules through nanopores and the quantification of out-of-equilibrium polymer dynamics at the single-molecule level.\n|-\n|2025\n|Ard Louis\n|University of Oxford\n|pioneering the development of novel mathematical and numerical models that have contributed to understanding of soft matter and biological physics across length scales.\n|}\nSee also\n* Institute of Physics\n* List of physics awards\n* List of awards named after people\nReferences"
