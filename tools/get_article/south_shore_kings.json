The team plays at the Foxboro Sports Center located in Foxboro, Massachusetts.\nThe organization fields Tier III teams in the National Collegiate Developmental Conference USPHL Premier and Elite Divisions. The Kings also offer youth hockey select teams at the Bantam, Peewee, and Squirt and other various levels.\nHistory\nThe franchise, then known as the NECDL Classics, is a charter member of the Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL) since 1993. In 1997 the Classics became the Walpole Stars, remaining as such until 2006, when it changed its name to the Foxboro Stars. One year later the team aligned itself with the South Shore Kings organization (which had fielded midget team), becoming known as the South Shore Kings.\nThe USPHL was formed for the 2013–14 season during a Tier III reorganization that led to the dissolution of the EJHL. Prior to that season, the Kings participated in the former Junior A Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL), the former Junior B Empire Junior Hockey League (EmJHL) and Continental Hockey Association (later named Eastern States Hockey League or ESHL). The former EJHL team now plays in the USPHL Premier Divisions, the former ESHL team plays in the Elite Division, and the former EmJHL team played in the Empire Division from 2012 to 2015.\nThe 2023-24 season marked thefirst Dineen Cup (USPHL NCDC playoff championship) and the next year their first regular season divisional and league championship.\nSeason-by-season records\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
