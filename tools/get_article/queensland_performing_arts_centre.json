Opened in 1985, it includes the Lyric Theatre, Concert Hall, Playhouse and Cremorne Theatre.\nHistory\nQPAC was designed by local architect Robin Gibson in the mid-1970s, after State Cabinet formally recognised in 1972 the need for a new Queensland Art Gallery and a new major performing arts centre, in addition to a new location for the Queensland Museum and State Library. It was opened by the Duke of Kent in 1985.\nAlthough originally opened as the Queensland Performing Arts Complex, after years of resisting the popular mis-naming of the building, it was officially changed to the \"Queensland Performing Arts Centre\" and all signage was altered to match.\nOpening with only 3 stages, the Lyric Theatre, the Concert Hall and the Cremorne Theatre, the Centre was designed with expansion in mind. In 1998 the Playhouse was opened, ending the original extension plans. A fifth and final theatre (seating 1500–1700) was announced in late May 2018 with a budget of $125 million. It was under construction .\nIn 2017, QPAC hosted more than 1.3 million visitors to more than 1,200 performances.\nProgramming\nEach year QPAC hosts over 1,200 performances across its four theatres and outdoor spaces. The centre's versatile venues accommodate a wide variety of performance including dance, musicals, theatre, opera, comedy and contemporary and classical music concerts featuring leading Queensland, Australian and international actors, dancers, musicians, artists and companies. In addition, QPAC co-produces and invests in some of Australia's most innovative and successful shows and free outdoor programs.\nIn recent years, QPAC has presented some of the world's leading artists and companies in the QPAC International Series including Paris Opera Ballet in 2020, Bolshoi Ballet in 2019, La Scala Theatre Ballet in 2018, The Royal Ballet in 2017, Bolshoi Ballet in 2013, Hamburg Ballet, Hamburg State Opera and Hamburg Philharmonic in 2012 and American Ballet Theatre in 2014.\nQPAC produces the Out of the Box Festival for children 8 years and under, and Clancestry program, as part of the QPAC First Nations Program which recognises the significant role First Nations of Australia have contributed and continue to contribute to Queensland's historical, creative and cultural landscapes.\nQPAC is the performance home for Queensland's leading performing arts companies – Queensland Ballet, Queensland Theatre Company, Opera Queensland, Queensland Youth Orchestras and Queensland Symphony Orchestra. In addition, QPAC regularly hosts many of Australia's leading performing arts companies including The Australian Ballet, Sydney Dance Company, Australian Chamber Orchestra and Bangarra Dance Theatre.\nPerformance spaces\n*The Lyric Theatre is a proscenium theatre and is the largest venue in QPAC, with a seating capacity of approximately 2,000. It is Brisbane's main venue for musicals, operas and ballets.\n*The Concert Hall is the second largest venue in QPAC, with a seating capacity of approximately 1,600 (1,800 if the choir balcony seats are used). It is Brisbane's main venue for orchestral performances although it is also used for comedy performances, graduation ceremonies, awards presentations and even rock concerts. The venue features a 6,566 pipe Klais organ which was built in 1986. Due to the overwhelming demand placed on the entire venue for traditional theatrical performances, in 2014 a creative solution was achieved by the addition of a removable proscenium arch and stage mechanisms for the Concert Hall increasing the type of performances possible in this theatre.\n*The Playhouse is a proscenium theatre with a seating capacity of approximately 850. The venue was constructed in 1997 and its premiere production was The Marriage of Figaro, with Geoffrey Rush in the title role of Figaro, in September 1998.\n*The Cremorne Theatre has a maximum seating capacity of 277. It is a reconfigurable performance space with six configurations (proscenium, theatre in the round, concert, cabaret, cinema or flat floor). Its name has been taken from an earlier venue in the vicinity, the Cremorne Theatre. Located at the entrance to the Cremorne Theatre is the Tony Gould Gallery; it features changing exhibits related to the performing arts, including theatre, opera, ballet, dance, costumes and scenery. The exhibits are organised by the QPAC Museum.\n*Glasshouse Theatre: In May 2018, the Queensland Government and QPAC announced funding had been secured for a new performing arts venue to be located on the Playhouse Green, adjacent to the current complex. The new theatre was projected to be completed by late 2022, and planned to seat a minimum of 1,500 patrons, making it the largest performing arts centre under one roof in Australia. The Queensland government announced in July 2025 that it would be completed in late 2025 before audiences are welcomed in 2026.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !! Capacity !!
