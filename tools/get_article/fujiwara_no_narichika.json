For his role in the Shishigatani Incident in 1177, he was exiled, along with his son Fujiwara no Naritsune, Taira no Yasuyori, and the monk Shunkan to Kikai-ga-shima island in the far south of Japan. Narichika was later executed by the order of the Taira.\nIt is known that he was one of Fujiwara no Yorinaga's many male lovers.\nReferences\n*Frederic, Louis (2002). \"Fujiwara no Narichika.\" Japan Encyclopedia.
