The Earl's only child, Elizabeth de Burgh (1332–1363), succeeded as Countess of Ulster and legal heir to the de Burgh estates as an infant. For safety, as an infant and a female heiress, she was taken by her mother to England as her lordships collapsed in a power struggle.\nThree members of the de Burgh family fought against each other in an attempt to preserve their own personal estates, and hold overall control of the massive de Burgh inheritance in Ireland. They were:\n* Sir Edmond de Burgh of Castleconnell (only surviving uncle of the Brown Earl, and senior member of the de Burgh dynasty) who drowned in Lough Mask in 1338.\n* Sir Edmond Albanach de Burgh of north Connacht (cousin of the Brown Earl, brother of the Walter Liath de Burgh who died in 1332)\n* Sir Uilleag de Burgh of south Connacht (chief of the Burkes of Galway)\nLoss and divisions\nThe eventual outcome of the war was the loss of almost all the de Burgh lands in Ulster, which was reconquered within a year by the Gaelic-Irish.\nThe remaining de Burghs in Ireland fragmented into three distinct clans, all of which had several sub-septs. They were:\n* Clan William Bourke of County Limerick\n* Mac William Íochtar (Bourke) of County Mayo\n* Mac William Uachtar or Clanricarde (Burke / de Burgh) of County Galway\nClan William, Mac William, Clanricarde\n* Walter de Burgh of Burgh Castle, Norfolk m.
