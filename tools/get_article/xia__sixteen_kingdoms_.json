Prior to establishing the Xia, the imperial clan existed as a tribal entity known as the Tiefu ().\nAll rulers of the Xia declared themselves \"emperors\". Both the Tiefu and Xia were based in the Ordos Desert, and during the reign of Helian Bobo, they constructed their capital of Tongwan, a heavily fortified and state-of-the-art city that served as a frontier garrison until the Song dynasty. Its ruins were discovered during the Qing dynasty and can still be seen in present-day Northern Shaanxi. At its peak, the Xia also controlled the Guanzhong region in modern-day central Shaanxi. Due to being a mix of the Xiongnu and Xianbei ethnicities, the Tiefu were initially known as a group of Wuhuan, which in the 4th century, was another term for \"miscellaneous hu\" or \"zahu\" (雜胡). It was not until Helian Bobo came to power that they fully affirm their Xiongnu lineage in a bid for legitimacy by claiming descent from the ancient Xia dynasty.\nHistory\nTiefu tribe\nThe rulers of Xia came from the Tiefu tribe, who descended from the Southern Xiongnu leader, Qubei. Qubei was a member of the ruling-Luandi clan as the brother of the Chanyu, Qiangqu, although a later and more dubious account alleged that he was the descendant of a Han dynasty prince-turned-Xiongnu noble, Liu Jinbo instead. In 196, he assisted the warlord, Cao Cao in escorting Emperor Xian of Han to Xuchang, and in 216, Cao Cao appointed him to supervise the Five Divisions of the Southern Xiongnu in Shanxi. As the Xiongnu imperial family claimed descent from the Han dynasty through their heqin marriages with Han princesses, Qubei's family adopted the \"Liu\" (劉) surname.\nIn 309, Qubei's grandson, Liu Hu succeeded his father, Liu Gaoshengyuan, as chieftain and named his tribe \"Tiefu\". The word \"Tiefu\" referred to people with Xiongnu fathers and Xianbei mothers, indicating that the tribe had intermingled with the Xianbei. The Tiefu were also known as Wuhuan, which in the 4th century was another term for \"miscellaneous hu\" or \"zahu\".\nIn 310, Liu Hu rebelled against the Western Jin dynasty in Shanxi. The Tuoba-Xianbei tribe allied with the Jin and quelled his rebellion, and were rewarded with their fiefdom of Dai. Liu Hu fled west to Shuofang Commandery, where the Han-Zhao emperor, Liu Cong, gave him the title of Duke of Loufan.\nThe Tiefu resided in Shuofang for many years. Liu Hu waged war with Dai but was repeatedly defeated and at one point had to flee the Great Wall. His son, Liu Wuhuan succeeded him in 341 and immediately entered a marriage alliance with Dai. On the other hand, he also submitted to the Jie-led Later Zhao dynasty. His brother Liu Eloutou succeeded him in 356, but was ousted by Wuhuan's son, Liu Xiwuqi in 358. After Xiwuqi died in 359, his brother, Liu Weichen, killed his son and took power.\nWeichen alternated between supporting the Dai and the Di-led Former Qin. In 376, after multiple defeats to Dai, he convinced Qin to launch a campaign against them, with him acting as a guide. Qin conquered Dai that same year, but when dividing up their territory, Weichen was unhappy that Qin deferred more control to his cousin, Liu Kuren of the Dugu tribe, prompting him to rebel. He was defeated and forced to cross the Yellow River west of the Ordos, where he resubmitted to Qin.\nAs the Former Qin collapsed following the Battle of Fei River, Weichen re-occupied Shuofang in 386. Around the same time, the Tuoba had also revived their state, now known as the Northern Wei. The Tiefu initially posed a threat to Wei, but in 392, Weichen was killed and the tribe’s power base was destroyed after a Wei counteroffensive. A son of Weichen, Liu Bobo, went into exile and found protection under the Xianbei, Moyigan of the Poduoluo tribe at Gaoping (in present-day Guyuan, Ningxia).\nIn 402, Moyigan and Liu Bobo fled to the Qiang-led Later Qin under pressure from Wei. During his time in Qin, Bobo caught the attention of its ruler, Yao Xing. Impressed by his appearance and talents, Yao Xing made Bobo a general and assigned him to defend Shuofang, despite warnings from his officials regarding his violent behaviour. In 407, Bobo was angered by peace talks between Qin and Wei, leading him to rebel. After ceasing 8,000 tribute horses from the Rouran, he went to Gaoping and killed Moyigan, taking over his forces.\nReign of Helian Bobo\n]]\nAs the Xiongnu alleged that they descended from Yu the Great, Liu Bobo claimed descent from the Xia dynasty and founded the state of Great Xia, claiming the titles of Heavenly King and Grand Chanyu. The same year, he led his forces to subjugate the tribes in Shuofang. He briefly fought with the Southern Liang after they rejected a marriage alliance, dealing them a heavy defeat. Despite his grudge against the Northern Wei, Bobo mainly concentrated his military efforts on the Later Qin. He refused to establish a capital in his early reign, instead choosing to lead a roving army and attacking Qin’s northern borders when least expected.\nIn 413, Bobo, believing that it was inappropriate to claim lineage of the Han dynasty through his maternal line, changed his family name from Liu to the prestigious-sounding name of Helian. He also built his capital city of Tongwancheng at the southern edge of the Mu Us Desert. Construction of the city was reportedly brutal, with around 100,000 Han Chinese and tribal people being drafted to build the city. Remains of the city can still be seen today at Jingbian County, Shaanxi. In 414, Helian Bobo entered into an alliance with the Northern Yan in Liaoning, and in 415, with the Northern Liang in Gansu.\nThe war with Xia greatly drained the Qin economy and military, with many of their key generals being killed in battle. In 417, the Eastern Jin commander, Liu Yu, conquered Qin, but the situation back at the Jin capital forced him to return and leave behind his generals to defend the Guanzhong region. In 418, Bobo invaded the Guanzhong, and due to violent infighting among the Jin generals, he inflicted them a catastrophic defeat and captured the region.\n, Shaanxi (modern Chang'an) carved during Helian Bobo's reign in 424.]]\nIn 419, Helian Bobo elevated himself to Emperor of Xia. Although the ancient capital, Chang’an, was under his control, he set up a Southern Administration there and kept Tongwancheng as his capital out of concern that the Northern Wei would invade the Ordos in his absence. Throughout his reign, Bobo is described in records as an extremely cruel ruler who often killed his subjects on impulse. In 424, a civil war broke out among his sons, which ended in him appointing Helian Chang as his new Crown Prince.\nDecline and fall\nAfter Helian Bobo’s death in 425, the Northern Wei intensified their pressure on the Xia. While Helian Chang was away campaigning against the Western Qin, Wei carried out a surprise attack on Xia, capturing many cities in Guanzhong including Chang’an. In 427, as Xia attempted to recapture Chang’an, Wei launched a second attack and captured their capital at the Battle of Tongwancheng. Chang relocated to Shanggui, but after several more defeats, he was finally captured in battle in 428.\nHelian Chang’s brother, Helian Ding, declared himself the new emperor at Pingliang. In 431, as Wei continued their encroachment, he made a last-ditch effort to expand westwards. He conquered the weakened Western Qin, but on his way to invade Northern Liang, he was ambushed and captured by the Tuyuhun. Helian Ding’s capture marked the end of the Xia, and in 432, he was turned over to Wei and executed. In 434, Helian Chang tried to escape west from Pingcheng but was intercepted and killed.\nRelations with the Dugu\nLiu Hu's uncle was Liu Meng, who in 272 was killed by the Jin dynasty after he rebelled the previous year. While Hu's father Liu Gaoshengyuan took over their people, Meng's son, Liu Fulun fled to the Tuoba tribe. In 318, Fulun's son, Liu Lugu also surrendered to the Tuoba and was given a daughter by Tuoba Yulü to marry. Fulun's branch became known as the Dugu tribe (獨孤), and like the Tiefu, they were known as Wuhuan people due to their mixed ethnicity.\nYao Weiyuan suggested in the past that 'Dugu' was an alternate form of 'Tuge' (屠各), the Xiongnu aristocratic clan that had adopted the Han Chinese surname of Liu (劉), members of which also ruled the Former Zhao state. This writer further suggests that 'Tuge' is an alternate form of 'Tuhe' (徒河), which is the branch of the Xianbei from which the Murong were descended.\nChieftains of the Tiefu and rulers of the Xia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
