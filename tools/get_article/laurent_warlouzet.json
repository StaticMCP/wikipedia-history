He was appointed associate professor at the Université d'Artois and subsequently full professor at University of the Littoral, before moving to Sorbonne University in 2019. He held postdoctoral fellowships at the European University Institute in Florence and at LSE, where he taught in the MSc History of International Relations. He co-lead with Kiran Klaus Patel the Franco-German research program [https://www.phe.uni-muenchen.de/projects/element/index.html ELEMENT] on the history of European environmental policies (1980-2000).\nWork Experience\nProfessor Warlouzet is a specialist in the history of European integration and of globalisation. He focuses on economic, social and environmental policies. In his book Governing Europe in a Globalizing World, he interpreted the history of European integration as a contest between social-oriented, neomercantilist, market-oriented and neoliberal projects, wherein competition policy played a major role in the assertion of a neoliberal Europe. He studied the early years of European environmental policy, and the project of democratization of companies (the 'Vredeling directive'). In Foreign Affairs, Andrew Moravcsik offered a balanced review of the book, stating that: “Although Warlouzet is sometimes tempted to exaggerate the range of potential choices governments faced, in the end, his book proposes some clear answers”.\nOn Brexit, during a roundtable with Piers Ludlow and Jonathan Faull, Warlouzet has emphasized the outsized influence Britain traditionally exercised over the EEC/EU during its years as a member-state.\nHe co-edited with Brigitte Leucht and Katja Seidel [https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/reinventing-europe-9781350213074/ Reinventing Europe], the first textbook on the history of European integration since 1945 that includes chapters on Euroscepticism, on environmental policy, on migration, and on Central and Eastern European countries.\nHe will publish in early 2026 a book by Cambridge University Press entitled: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/liberty-solidarity-and-community/355531CFEE184AFF8B706B24D25EC368 Liberty, Solidarity and Community. Capitalism and European Integration, 1945 to the Present].\nAn expert on EU and French politics, he writes in Le Monde and he was quoted by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, by the Danish newspaper Information, by the Helsingin Sanomat, by Il Fatto Quotidiano and by La Libre Belgique.\nBibliography\n* Warlouzet, L., Leucht, B., Seidel K., [https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/reinventing-europe-9781350213074/ Reinventing Europe.
