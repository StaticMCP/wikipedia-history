These warm-up matches had rules that were slightly different from normal, so are not recognised as ODIs. A team could use up to 15 players in a match, but only 11 could bat (or field at any one time) in each innings.\nMatches\n| team2 =\n| score1 = 318/7 (50 overs)\n| runs1 = Angelo Mathews 95 (106)\n| wickets1 = Moisés Henriques 3/46 (8 overs)\n| score2 = 319/8 (49.4 overs)\n| runs2 = Aaron Finch 137 (109)\n| wickets2 = Nuwan Pradeep 3/57 (9 overs)\n| result = Australia won by 2 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1096980.html Scorecard]\n| venue = The Oval, London\n| umpires = Ian Gould (Eng) and Sundaram Ravi (Ind)\n| motm =\n| toss = Australia won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain =\n| notes =\n}}\n----\n| team2 =\n| score1 = 341/9 (50 overs)\n| runs1 = Tamim Iqbal 102 (93)\n| wickets1 = Junaid Khan 4/73 (9 overs)\n| score2 = 342/8 (49.3 overs)\n| runs2 = Shoaib Malik 72 (66)\n| wickets2 = Mehedi Hasan Miraz 2/30 (4 overs)\n| result = Pakistan won by 2 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1096981.html Scorecard]\n| venue = Edgbaston, Birmingham\n| umpires = Richard Kettleborough (Eng) and Paul Reiffel (Aus)\n| motm =\n| toss = Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat.\n| rain =\n| notes =\n}}\n----\n| team2 =\n| score1 = 189 (38.4 overs)\n| runs1 = Luke Ronchi 66 (63)\n| wickets1 = Bhuvneshwar Kumar 3/28 (6.4 overs)\n| score2 = 129/3 (26 overs)\n| runs2 = Virat Kohli 52* (55)\n| wickets2 = James Neesham 1/11 (3 overs)\n| result = India won by 45 runs (D/L method)\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1096982.html Scorecard]\n| venue = The Oval, London\n| umpires = Aleem Dar (Pak) and Bruce Oxenford (Aus)\n| motm =\n| toss = New Zealand won the toss and elected to bat.\n| rain = Rain prevented any further play.\n* India were 45 runs ahead of the DLS target of 85 runs.\n| notes =\n}}\n----\n| team2 =\n| score1 = 57/1 (10.2 overs)\n| runs1 = Aaron Finch 36* (36)\n| wickets1 = Mohammad Amir 1/9 (4 overs)\n| score2 =\n| runs2 =\n| wickets2 =\n| result = No result\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1096983.html Scorecard]\n| venue = Edgbaston, Birmingham\n| umpires = Kumar Dharmasena (SL) and Richard Illingworth (Eng)\n| motm =\n| toss = Australia won the toss and elected to bat.\n| rain = The match was reduced to 34 overs per side due to rain.\n* Rain prevented any further play.\n| notes =\n}}\n----\n| team2 =\n| score1 = 356/8 (50 overs)\n| runs1 = Upul Tharanga 110 (104)\n| wickets1 = Trent Boult 2/47 (5 overs)\n| score2 = 359/4 (46.1 overs)\n| runs2 = Martin Guptill 116 (76)\n| wickets2 = Seekkuge Prasanna 2/63 (10 overs)\n| result = New Zealand won by 6 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1096984.html Scorecard]\n| venue = Edgbaston, Birmingham\n| umpires = Richard Illingworth (Eng) and Richard Kettleborough (Eng)\n| motm =\n| toss = New Zealand won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain =\n| notes =\n}}\n----\n| team2 =\n| score1 = 324/7 (50 overs)\n| runs1 = Dinesh Karthik 94 (77)\n| wickets1 = Rubel Hossain 3/50 (9 overs)\n| score2 = 84 (23.5 overs)\n| runs2 = Mehedi Hasan Miraz 24 (34)\n| wickets2 = Bhuvneshwar Kumar 3/13 (5 overs)\n| result = India won by 240 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/1096985.html Scorecard]\n| venue = The Oval, London\n| umpires = Marais Erasmus (SA) and Nigel Llong (Eng)\n| motm =\n| toss = Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field.\n| rain =\n| notes =\n}}\nReferences"
