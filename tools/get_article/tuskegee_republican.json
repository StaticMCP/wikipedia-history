Caldwell from 1845 to 1859. Daniel Sayre Jr. took over the paper that year but was killed early in the American Civil War. It competed with The Democrat for readership in Tuskegee.\nIn 1854 it denounced Frederick Douglass addressing students at a university in Ohio. It had a reputation for being anti-Jewish.\nReferences"
