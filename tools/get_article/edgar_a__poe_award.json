The prize, which paid $2,500 in 2011, was funded by the New Orleans Times-Picayune and Newhouse Newspapers in honor of the distinguished correspondent Edgar Allen Poe (1906–1998), a former WHCA president unrelated to the American fiction writer of the nearly identical name.\nThe award, which honored excellence in news coverage of subjects and events of significant national or regional importance to the American people, was presented from 1990 to 2019 at the annual dinner of the WHCA (when it was discontinued in place of two new awards).\nList of winners\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Employer\n!Article / Show\n!Notes /\n|-\n| 1989 || Keith Epstein || The Plain Dealer || ||\n|-\n| 1990 || Rochelle Sharpe and Marjie Lundstrom || Gannett News Service || \"A series of reports ... on child abuse.\" ||\n|-\n| 1991 || Stewart M.
