It has been published continuously on a quarterly schedule by the Oregon Historical Society since 1900. From 1900 to 1925 it was known as The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society; its present title was adopted in 1926. Historian, economist, and sociologist Frederic George Young served as editor from the journal's inception through 1928. The journal's circulation of about 4,500 makes it one of the largest state historical publications in the United States.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Searchable transcription of many pre-1964 editions available at wikisource:en:Oregon Historical Quarterly"
