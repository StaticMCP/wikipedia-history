In response, Sun Quan sent He Qi to supervise Mi Fang (麋芳), Xianyu Dan (鮮于丹), Liu Shao (劉邵) and Hu Zong to attack Qichun by advancing up the river. However, the weather was extremely hot and most of the Wu forces began to withdraw. Jin Zong, in response, let down his guard. This allowed He Qi to penetrate the Wei army and capture the rebel. Thus, the rebellion was quashed. This occurred at the southern slopes of the Dabie Mountains.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Chen, Shou, Records of Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi).\n* de Crespigny, Rafe.
