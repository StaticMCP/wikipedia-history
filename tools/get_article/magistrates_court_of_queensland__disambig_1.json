All criminal proceedings in Queensland begin in the Magistrates Court, with minor offences being dealt with summarily, and more serious ones being referred to a higher court on the strength of evidence. Most criminal cases are first heard in the Magistrates Court, as are most civil cases. The Magistrates Court hears approximately 95% of all court cases in Queensland.\nDecisions made by the Magistrates Court may be heard on appeal to the District Court of Queensland. The Magistrates Court does not have an appellate jurisdiction.\nThe Chief Magistrate of Queensland, since 2022, is Judge Janelle Brassington.\nJurisdiction\nCivil\nThe Magistrates Court has the jurisdiction to decide on civil matters for which the amount in dispute is less than or equal to 150,000.  Civil matters in which the amount in dispute is more than $150,000 are decided by either the District Court or the Supreme Court.\nCriminal\nThe Magistrates Court has the jurisdiction to decide on charges of summary offences, and indictable offence which may be heard summarily.\nThe Magistrates Court also conducts committal hearings in which the presiding magistrate decides, based on the strength of the evidence, whether to refer the matter to a higher court.\nProcedure\nThose present at court typically include the magistrate, police prosecutor, defendant, plaintiff and witnesses for either party. It is a condition that those who enter the court bow to the Queensland Coat of Arms, situated behind the Bench, upon entry. Plaintiffs, defendants, their counsel and witnesses must rise when they wish to address the bench or when addressed by the magistrate.\nMembers of the media and general public are allowed into the courtroom, except where a party to the proceedings is under 18 in which case the court becomes a child court and the media and public will only have restricted access to the court.\nNotable former magistrates\n* Di Fingleton\n* Basil Gribbin\nSee also\n}}\n* Australian court hierarchy\n* Judiciary of Australia\n* List of Queensland courts and tribunals\nReferences\nAttribution\n*  This Wikipedia article incorporates text from [https://www.qld.gov.au/law/court/courts/magistrates-court/about-magistrates-courts/ About Magistrates Courts] published by the State of Queensland under [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/ CC-BY 3.0 AU] licence (accessed on 4 August 2016).\nExternal links\n*"
