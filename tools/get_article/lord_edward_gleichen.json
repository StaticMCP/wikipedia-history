Lady Feodora Gleichen, the noted sculptor, was his sister.\nGleichen's comital title, shared by his sisters, derived from his mother, who had received it from Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, shortly before her morganatic marriage to his father. Gleichen had been an hereditary estate of the Princes of Hohenlohe in Germany since 1631, and their father voluntarily used it as a comital title to place himself on the same social footing as his wife. But Edward was not entitled to any land or revenues derived from this dynastic property.\nOn 15 December 1885, the Court Circular announced Queen Victoria's permission for Edward's mother to share his father's rank at the Court of St James's, and henceforth they were known as TSH Prince and Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. But the Queen did not extend that privilege to their children, although she confirmed use of their German style as count and countesses. On 12 June 1913 Edward was granted precedence before  marquesses in the peerage of England (while his sisters were granted precedence before the daughters of dukes in the English peerage).\nCareer\nGleichen served as a Page of Honour to the Queen from 1874 to 1879.\nAfter graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards as a lieutenant in October 1881 and gradually rose through the ranks over the years, eventually becoming a major general. He served in the short-lived Guards Camel Corps in the Sudan campaign in 1884–85 and, after attending the Staff College, Camberley from 1890–1891, with the Egyptian Army in the Dongala campaign in 1896.\nAfter having served at the War Office as a staff captain, Gleichen was, in May 1898, made a deputy assistant adjutant general there. In 1899–1900 he served in the Second Boer War in South Africa, and was mentioned in despatches for his actions during the Battle of Modder River on 28 November 1899. In January 1900 he was appointed deputy assistant-adjutant-general to the forces in South Africa.\nHe was Sudan agent in Cairo from 1901 to 1903 with the local rank of lieutenant colonel, After serving on half-pay, he became military attaché to Berlin, which he held from October 1903 until 1906. He and Kaiser Wilhelm II fell out, and Gleichen was sent to be military attaché in Washington D.C. from 1906 to 1907. He met the Wright brothers while in Washington and wrote a report on their aircraft, but also failed to form a relationship with U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt. He was assistant director of military operations from 1907 to 1911.\nIn August 1911 he was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general and succeeded Alexander Wilson as commander of the 15th Infantry Brigade.\nHe served in the First World War, which began in the summer of 1914, commanding his 15th Brigade until 1915, and then, after being promoted to major general, the 37th Division from 1915 to 1916. He was an intelligence bureau director at the department of information from 1917 to 1918.\nHe served as Chairman of the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names from 1919. He retired from the army in October 1919...\nAt court, the Count was appointed an Extra Equerry to King Edward VII in July 1901.\nHe wrote a number of books, including:\n*With the Camel Corps up the Nile (1888)\n*With the mission to Menelik (1898)\n*The doings of the Fifteenth Infantry Brigade, August 1914 to March 1915 (1917)\n*''London's open air statuary (1928)\n*A Guardsman's Memories (1932).\nHe was the editor of:\n*Anglo-Egyptian Sudan: a compendium prepared by officers of the Sudan Government - Vol. I: Geographical, descriptive and historical. - 1905. Vol.II: Routes.- 1905. Suppl.: 1906''\nChange of title\nWhen King George V commanded his German relatives domiciled in Britain to Anglicize their names and titles in 1917, the Gleichens' 1913 precedence was reduced several grades to that of younger son/daughters of a marquess in the peerage of the United Kingdom. This was because only marquisal rank was conferred upon the King's nearer, heretofore princely relatives, the Tecks and Battenbergs. Although inexplicably allowed to retain their German surname, the Gleichens relinquished use of the comital title and on 12 September 1917 acquired the prefix of Lord or Lady, although this was not made hereditary for Edward's descendants as his countship had been.\nOn 2 July 1910, Gleichen married Sylvia Gay Edwardes (a niece  of the 4th Baron Kensington), who was a maid of honour to Queens Victoria and Alexandra. They had no children. He is buried at Holy Trinity Church burial ground, Forest Row, Sussex, England.\nIn her memoirs, his sister Lady Helena Gleichen described a sad incident that happened at Overstone Hall. A \"particularly nice\" butler named Atkins tried to learn how to swim in the nearby lake, but disappeared. Lord Edward dived after him numerous times, but was unable to save him. In the end, his body was retrieved.\nHonours and awards\nBritish decorations\n*CMG: Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George – 1898 – for his contributions on a Mission to Ethiopia.\n*DSO: Companion of the Distinguished Service Order – 29 November 1900 – for his contributions in the Second Boer War.\n*CVO: Commander of the Royal Victorian Order – 2 February 1901 – on the day of the funeral of Queen Victoria\n*CB: Companion of the Order of the Bath – 1906\n*KCVO: Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order – 1909\nForeign decorations\n*1897: Order of the Star of Ethiopia (Third Class) – for his contributions on a Mission to Ethiopia.\n*1905: Order of the Medjidie (Second Class) – for his services in the Egyptian Army\n*Unknown dates: Commander of the Legion of Honour, Order of the Dannebrog (First Class)\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004713/http://www.gazette-online.co.uk/ The London Gazette]\n*[http://www.burkes-peerage.net/ Burke's Peerage & Gentry, 107th edition]\n*[http://www.firstworldwar.bham.ac.uk/nicknames/gleichen.htm Centre for First World War Studies]\n*[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/GLEICHEN.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
