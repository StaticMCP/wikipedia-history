It was a series of dramas based on historical events.\nThe ABC Weekly, reviewing the first episode, said:\nOur chief criticism is that this might be a little too advanced listening for young children. The much older children and their fathers (and perhaps mothers) will like it more; Beautifully scripted, and opening with the splendidly quoted lines, “I too will something make, and joy in the making,” the half-hour play had barely a weak link... The whole thing was inspirational  as well as educational... Don’t miss Joy in the Making.\nSelect episodes\n*Ep 1 - Four Men and a Light, the story of the attempts to build the Eddystone Lighthouse (30 Sept)\n*Ep 2 - Elizabeth Pry (7 Oct)\n*Ep 3 The Maker of Songs: Story of Franz Schubert (14 Oct)\n*Ep 4 Island of Forgotten Men (21 Oct) - Father Damien\n*Ep 5 Honest Abe (28 Oct)\n*Ep 6 Pine Trees and X-Rays.
