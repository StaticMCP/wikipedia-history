It can be divided into two categories:\n* Automated code review software checks source code against a predefined set of rules and produces reports.\n** Different types of browsers visualise software structure and help humans better understand its structure. Such systems are geared more to analysis because they typically do not contain a predefined set of rules to check software against.\n* Manual code review tools allow people to collaboratively inspect and discuss changes, storing the history of the process for future reference.\nSee also\n*List of tools for code review\nReferences"
