It has about 300 inhabitants.\nAdministrative division\nGruna consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):\n*Gruna (176)\n*Žipotín (56)\nGeography\nGruna is located about  east of Svitavy and  northwest of Olomouc. It lies on the border between the Zábřeh Highlands and Orlické Foothills. The highest point is a nameless hill at  above sea level. The Třebůvka River briefly crosses the municipal territory in the southwest. The brook Grunský potok originates here and then flows through the village into the Třebůvka.\nHistory\nThe first written mention of Gruna and Žipotín is from 1365, when Gruna belonged to the Moravská Třebová estate and Žipotín to the Cimburk estate. From 1398 at the latest, Žipotín was also a part of the Moravská Třebová estate. For almost its entire history, Gruna was an agricultural village.\nDemographics\n}}\nTransport\nThe I/35 road (part of the European route E442) passes through the municipality. It replaces the unfinished section of the D35 motorway from Olomouc to the Hradec Králové Region.\nSights\nAmong the protected cultural monuments in the municipality are a rural homestead from the first half of the 19th century (an example of local folk architecture) and a locality with remains of a fortified market settlement called Radkov (today an archaeological site).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
