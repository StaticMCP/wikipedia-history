It was the 12th consecutive year the ceremony was held at the center, and the ceremony was broadcast live simultaneously by TNT and TBS.\nThe nominees were announced on December 20, 2007, by Jeanne Tripplehorn and Terrence Howard at Los Angeles' Pacific Design Center's Silver Screen Theater.\nInto the Wild received the highest number of nominations among the film categories with four, three for acting and one for ensemble performance. In the television categories The Sopranos, 30 Rock and Ugly Betty had the most nominations with three each.\nThe 2007 Screen Actors Guild Awards was the first to give awards for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture and Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Television Series.\nThe 2007 ceremony celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Screen Actors Guild with historical background and film clips presented in segments introduced by Blair Underwood throughout the ceremony. Charles Durning was presented with an award for Lifetime Achievement following accolades by Denis Leary and Burt Reynolds.\nThe ceremony was held in the midst of the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike. Because the acting community steadfastly had supported the writers during this period, the WGA granted a waiver on December 11, 2007, to SAG for the awards show, allowing members to attend without having to cross picket lines. While talk of the strike was kept to a minimum, Julie Christie openly acknowledged it in her acceptance speech, commenting, \"It's lovely to receive an award from your own union, especially at a time when we're being so forcefully reminded how important unions are.\" In her acceptance speech, Tina Fey thanked the Screen Actors Guild for its support of the WGA.\nAfter acknowledging the recent death of Heath Ledger, Daniel Day-Lewis dedicated his award to the actor.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\nScreen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award\nThe Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award was presented to:\n* Charles Durning\nFilm\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"50%\"| Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\" width=\"50%\"| Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Daniel Day-Lewis – There Will Be Blood as Daniel Plainview'\n** George Clooney – Michael Clayton as Michael Clayton\n** Ryan Gosling – Lars and the Real Girl as Lars Lindstrom\n** Emile Hirsch – Into the Wild as Christopher McCandless\n** Viggo Mortensen – Eastern Promises as Nikolai Luzhin\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* ' Julie Christie – Away from Her as Fiona Anderson'\n** Cate Blanchett – Elizabeth: The Golden Age as Queen Elizabeth I\n** Marion Cotillard – La Vie en Rose as Édith Piaf\n** Angelina Jolie – A Mighty Heart as Mariane Pearl\n** Elliot Page – Juno as Juno MacGuff\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* ' Javier Bardem – No Country for Old Men as Anton Chigurh'\n** Casey Affleck – The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford as Robert Ford\n** Hal Holbrook – Into the Wild as Ron Franz\n** Tommy Lee Jones – No Country for Old Men as Ed Tom Bell\n** Tom Wilkinson – Michael Clayton as Arthur Edens\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ruby Dee – American Gangster as Mama Lucas'\n** Cate Blanchett – ''I'm Not There as Jude Quinn\n** Catherine Keener – Into the Wild as Jan Burres\n** Amy Ryan – Gone Baby Gone as Helene McCready\n** Tilda Swinton – Michael Clayton as Karen Crowder\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n! style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n* 'No Country for Old Men – Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, and Kelly Macdonald'\n** 3:10 to Yuma – Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Peter Fonda, Ben Foster, Logan Lerman, Gretchen Mol, Dallas Roberts, Vinessa Shaw, and Alan Tudyk\n** American Gangster – Armand Assante, Josh Brolin, Russell Crowe, Ruby Dee, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba, Cuba Gooding Jr., Carla Gugino, John Hawkes, Ted Levine, Joe Morton, Lymari Nadal, John Ortiz, RZA, Yul Vazquez, and Denzel Washington\n** Hairspray – Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Paul Dooley, Zac Efron, Allison Janney, Elijah Kelley, James Marsden, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Jerry Stiller, John Travolta, and Christopher Walken\n** Into the Wild – Brian H.
