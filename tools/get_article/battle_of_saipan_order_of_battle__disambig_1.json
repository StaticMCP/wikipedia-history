This invasion was part of Operation Forager, an effort to recapture the entire Marianas chain from the Empire of Japan.\nThe island had been a Japanese possession since it was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War I. As military conflict with the United States became increasingly likely during the 1930s, Japan expended great effort in fortifying Saipan. In mid-1944, nearly 30,000 troops were based on the island, almost double the estimates of US intelligence.\nUS forces declared Saipan secure on 9 July 1944.\nUnited States\nNaval forces\nUnited States Pacific Fleet\nAdmiral Chester W.
