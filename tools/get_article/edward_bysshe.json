He sat in the House of Commons variously between 1640 and 1679 and was Garter King of Arms during the Commonwealth period.\nLife\nBysshe was born at Smallfield, Burstow, Surrey, the eldest son of Edward Bysshe a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, and his wife Mary Turnor, daughter of John Turnor of Ham, Bletchingley, Surrey. His ancestors were lords of the manors of Burstow and Horne, and some of them owners also of the manor of Bysshe, or Bysshe Court, in Surrey. In 1633 he became a commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, but before he took a degree he entered Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar.\nBysshe was elected Member of Parliament (M.P.) for Bletchingley to the Short Parliament which met at Westminster in April 1640 and to the Long Parliament which met on 3 November 1640.  He took the covenant. In about 1643 he was made Garter King of Arms in the place of Sir John Borough, who had followed King Charles I to Oxford. On 20 October 1646 votes were passed in the House of Commons that Bysshe should be Garter King of Arms, and likewise Clarenceux King of Arms, that William Ryley should be Norroy King of Arms, and that a committee should be appointed to regulate their fees. In 1654 Bysshe was chosen burgess MP for Reigate, Surrey, to serve in First Protectorate Parliament which met at Westminster on 3 September 1654. He was returned as member for Gatton Surrey, to the Third Protectorate Parliament which assembled on 27 January 1659.\nAfter the Restoration he was required to leave the office of Garter in favour of Sir Edward Walker, but he obtained a patent dated 10 March 1661 for the office of Clarenceux King of Arms. The latter office was void by the lunacy of Sir William Le Neve, and was given to Bysshe because he had  preserved the library of the College of Arms during the Interregnum. The appointment was made in spite of Walker, who alleged that Bysshe had not only usurped, but maladministered the office of Garter, and that if he were created Clarenceux it would be in his power to confirm the grants of arms previously made by him.\nBysshe was knighted on 20 April 1661, and he was elected M.P. for Bletchingley to the Cavalier Parliament which met at Westminster on 8 May. During that parliament, which lasted seventeen years, he is said to have become a pensioner, and to have received £100 every session. Anthony Wood speaks very harshly of Bysshe. In June 1663 he was elected an (Original) Fellow of the Royal Society.\nByshhe died in the parish of St Paul, Covent Garden, at the age of 64. He was buried in the church of St Olave, Jewry.\nBysshe married Margaret Green, daughter of John Green of Boyshall, Essex, serjeant-at-law. She survived him.\nWorks\nBysshe edited:\n* Nicolai Vptoni de Studio Militari Libri Quatuor. Iohan. de Bado Aureo Tractatus de Armis. Henrici Spelmanni Aspilogia. Edoardus Bissæus e Codicibus MSS. primus publici juris fecit, notisque illustravit, London 1654. An edition of the heraldic writings of Nicholas Upton, Johannes de Bado Aureo and Henry Spelman, dedicated to John Selden. The notes, originally written in English by Bysshe, were translated into Latin by David Whitford, an ejected student of Christ Church, Oxford.\n* Palladius, de Gentibus Indiæ et Bragmanibus. S. Ambrosius, de Moribus Brachmanorum. Anonymus, de Bragmanibus, London 1665. In Greek and Latin, and dedicated to Lord Clarendon. The translations themselves (from Greek into Latin) were apparently the work of the Christ Church scholar John Gregory (died 1646/47), and passed through the hands of Edmund Chilmead (died 1653/54) before coming to Bysshe.\nAt one time he contemplated writing the Survey or Antiquities of the County of Surrey, but the work never appeared.\nArms\n| motto = Prudens Simpliciter (\"Simply wise\")\n| orders =\n| bannerimage =\n| banner =\n| badgeimage =\n| badge =\n| symbolism =\n| previous_versions =\n}}\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
