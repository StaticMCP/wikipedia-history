The first Olowu of Owu (son of Oduduwa's daughter) is also one of the original kings in Yorubaland.\nThe Owu Kingdom is ruled by princes selected from six ruling houses: Amororo, Otileta, Ayoloye, Akinjobi, Akinoso and Lagbedu. The king is assisted by appointed chiefs known as the kingmakers. The Akogun heads the chiefs, Obamaja, Orunto, Oyega, Osupori and Omolasin. Olosi is the Ifa priest of the Olowu. Originally, the Owu Kingdom had 3 townships namely Owu, Erunmu and Apomu. By tradition, the Olowu is selected by six kingmakers but two more chieftaincies were added to this number in 1964, those of the Balogun and the Olosi.\nPast and Present Olowu of Owu Kingdom (Owu Kings)\nLegendary Olowu\n*Oba Ajibosin \"Asunkungbade\" 12-13th century\n- The six current Owu royal families, Otileta, Ayoloye, Amororo, Akinoso, Lagedu, and Akinjobi are considered to be sons of Ajibosin, but likely represent influential descendants of Ajibosin whose descendants continue to occupy the throne.
