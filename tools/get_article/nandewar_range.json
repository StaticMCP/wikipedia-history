The range is situated approximately  east of the township of Narrabri.\nJohn Oxley was the first European to see the range in 1818 as he explored the New South Wales.\nLocation and features\nThe range is located on the western, inland, side of the New England region, and generally forms the watershed divide between the Namoi River and Gwydir River catchment basins to the south and north respectively. The Macdonald River starting south of Walcha drains west to Warrabah National Park where it changes its name to the Namoi then is added to by the Manilla River, Peel River and Mooki River. The Horton River runs north to the Gwydir. Both rivers together drain segments of the Nandewar Range.\nThe eastern part of the Nandewar Range starts at the Great Dividing Range south of Uralla. The main road between Narrabri and Bingara crosses the range. At its western end, the Nandewar Range culminates at Mount Kaputar, a complex of volcanic origin, from which there are views of the flat inland plains of New South Wales.\nThe foothill areas of the Nandewar Range are used for grazing and cropping. There are forests in some of the higher areas.  The Mount Kaputar area is included in Mount Kaputar National Park.\nrises to . and is the most northerly peak in the range.]]\nThe range is occasionally dusted with light snow in winter.\nGeology\nThe range is the remnants of an eroded basaltic shield volcano that formed about 18 million years ago. Some of the exposed rocks in the area are 230 million years old.\nEtymology\nThe first is a volcanic plug called 'Ninghdoo' (pronounced locally as Ningy-doo) or 'Nungadhun'. The names Nandewar, Kaputar and Ninghdoo are the Gamilaraay language names for these features.\nPeaks\nMountains within the Nandewar Range include;\n* Bushy Mountain, ()\n* Castletop Mountain\n* Gins Mountain\n* Grattai Mountain, ()\n* Mount Dowe, ()\n* Mount Kaputar, ()\n* Mount Lawler\n* Mount Lindesay, ()\n* Mount Ningadhun, ()\n* Mount Waa\n* Mount Yulludunida\n* Round Mountain\nSee also\n}}\n*\n* Warrumbungles\nReferences\nExternal links"
