The meeting is held at the  long Borderline Speedway in Mount Gambier, South Australia.\nAfter the success of the 1995 Australian Sprintcar Championship at the speedway, the first Kings Challenge was held in 1995 and was won by Sydney-based driver Brooke Tatnell.\nTraditionally run on the Friday night before the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic at the Premier Speedway in Warrnambool (Victoria), the $10,000 to win event was moved to the Thursday night to accommodate the Classic's move to a 3-day event in 2014. With the Kings Challenge running prior to the Classic, the event attracts the best sprintcar drivers from Australia and the United States.\nBrooke Tatnell (1995), Skip Jackson (1998), Danny Lasoski (2001) and Donny Schatz (2002) are the only drivers to have won the Kings Challenge / Sprintcar Classic double in the same year.\nWinners since 1995\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n!Year\n|width=210px |Winner\n|-\n|align=center| 1995\n| Brooke Tatnell (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 1996\n| colspan=2 | not held (rain)\n|-\n|align=center| 1997\n| Gary Brazier (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 1998\n| Skip Jackson (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 1999\n| Phil Gressman\n|- align=center\n!Year\n|width=210px |Winner\n|-\n|align=center| 2000\n| Donny Schatz\n|-\n|align=center| 2001\n| Danny Lasoski\n|-\n|align=center| 2002\n| Donny Schatz\n|-\n|align=center| 2003\n| Donny Schatz\n|-\n|align=center| 2004\n| Daryn Pittman\n|-\n|align=center| 2005\n| Donny Schatz\n|-\n|align=center| 2006\n| Robbie Farr (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 2007\n| Daryn Pittman\n|-\n|align=center| 2008\n| Robbie Farr (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 2009\n| colspan=2 | not held (rain)\n|- align=center\n!Year\n|width=210px |Winner\n|-\n|align=center| 2010\n| Robbie Farr (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 2011\n| James McFadden (Qld)\n|-\n|align=center| 2012\n| Jason Johnson\n|-\n|align=center| 2013\n| Robbie Farr (NSW)\n|-\n|align=center| 2014\n| Steven Lines (SA)\n|-\n|align=center| 2015\n| Kerry Madsen (NSW)*\n|-\n|}\n* Kerry Madsen became a naturalised United States citizen and is officially an Iowa driver for World of Outlaws.
