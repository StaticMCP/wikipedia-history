The Museum is located on main street at 5007 - 50 Avenue.\nHistory\nThe Wetaskiwin and District Heritage Museum was incorporated as a non-profit society in May 1986.\nIn 2004, the museum outgrew the Calgary Power building, and the Wetaskiwin and District Museum Society purchased the Montgomery Store building situated on Main Street. The main floor opened in November 2004. The entire building-home to a collection of more than 15,000 artefacts-officially opened its doors on May 7, 2005.\nExhibits\nChildren's Legacy Centre\nThe Children's Legacy Centre, located in the basement of the historic building, is a unique, hands-on permanent exhibit showcasing pioneer life. Kids are invited to experience a one-room schoolhouse, visit a pioneer kitchen, and explore other rooms while dressed in period clothing.\nThe Women of Aspenland\nEvery October, Canada celebrates Women's History Month. October was chosen because it is the month in which Canadian women officially became persons by law.  The Wetaskiwin & District Heritage Museum honours and celebrates the Women of Aspenland as an ongoing exhibit. It pays tribute to the many women who made their own unique contributions to the community of Wetaskiwin and area.   2008's inductees were Mary (Keogh) Christopher, Margaret (Todd) Emmett, Minnie Johnson, and Caroline (Dorchester) Shantz.\nTemporary exhibits\nThe main floor features temporary exhibits which are changed on an annual basis. Presently featured is \"Entertainment and Past Times\" (1890-1940). The main floor also holds the Gift Shop, Front Desk, Donation Desk, Resource Library, and Public Washrooms.\nSecond floor exhibits\nOrigins Exhibit\nThe Origins Exhibit includes dinosaur fossils, archaeological artefacts, and facts about the local Cree Nations of Samson, Ermineskin, Montana, and Louis Bull. A fur trading post and a tipi are also included in the exhibit. There are also Interactive Games, where you can learn about Cree migration, bison, and fur trading.\nCommunity Halls\nAfter two years of research and more than 250 hours of exhibit design work, visitors are now welcome to explore the new \"virtual\" exhibit devoted to twenty-five Community Halls from the County of Wetaskiwin No. 10. Read the halls' histories and view hundreds of pictures on a touch screen computer.\nChristian Heritage\nThe Christian Heritage exhibit contains information regarding 28 churches from the Wetaskiwin district, and displays artefacts from many different congregations.\nHistory of Healing\nA hundred years of history about the local hospitals and the healthcare professionals who served the community.\nEarly businesses\nWetaskiwin's earliest businesses include French's Jewellery, the local branches of seven different banks, the Driard Hotel and Barbershop, the Drug Store, a General Store, the City Meat Market, and local dairies.\nCentury Home\nThis turn-of-the-century town house features a circa 1910 living room, kitchen, master bedroom and child's room.\nImmigrant stories\nImmigration has had an enormous effect on Canada, and the Heritage Museum features exhibits devoted to the Swedish and Chinese immigrants who helped build the City of Wetaskiwin.\nWar Years Remembered\nThis exhibit honours the citizens who served on the home front and overseas. A war brides exhibit is also featured.\nReferences"
