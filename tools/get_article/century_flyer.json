It is located on the grounds of the Conway Human Development Center, a residential facility that treats patients with developmental disabilities at 150 East Siebenmorgen Road in Conway, Arkansas.\nHistory\nThis train was built in the early 1950s by National Amusement Devices, a manufacturer of roller coaster cars. This company built several of the Century Flyer train sets for use at amusement parks around the country. This particular train set was sold to the Burns Park \"Funland\" in North Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957.\nIn 1959, the train and tracks were sold to a local professional women's organization, who donated them to the Conway Human Development Center (then known as the Arkansas Children's Colony) for use by the patients. One third of a mile of track was laid and two trestles were built.\nOver the years, the train and track fell into disrepair. The Central Arkansas Model Railroad Club volunteered to upgrade and refurbish the train and track.\nThe Century Flyer was listed in the National Register of Historic Places due to its being one of the few remaining trains built by National Amusement Devices still operating.\nSee also\n*Amusement rides on the National Register of Historic Places\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Faulkner County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101014032724/http://artrains.org/index.php5?title=CHDC Central Arkansas Model Railroad Club article on the Century Flyer]"
