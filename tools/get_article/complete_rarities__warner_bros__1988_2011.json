Tracks 33 (slightly longer due to more audience noise) and 89 are the same live version of \"Drive\" from November 19, 1992. It can be found as a B-side on the \"Strange Currencies\" single and also on the Alternative NRG Greenpeace compilation.\n:B. Tracks 81 and 93 are both the same demo version for \"The Lifting\".\n:C. There is a previous mistake (uncorrected here) with track 87, a live version of \"Turn You Inside-Out\", which was reported in the entry for In Time: The Best of R.E.M.\n:D. Track 94 (an acoustic live version of \"The One I Love\") is listed incorrectly. The correct venue is The Museum of Television and Radio on June 8, 2001. The same version can be found on the compilation In Time: The Best of R.E.M. The 2MMM Sydney version is different from both and can be found on Not Bad for No Tour.\n:E. Tracks 100, 101, and 103–109 originated from a lossy source, even in the FLAC version of the release.\nResolved issues\nThe original release of this compilation had a few other mistakes that have been solved by iTunes. Those original files, though, can still be found in many sources and still present the same mistakes.\n*Track 1 (\"Funtime\") was originally listed as a live version, but is actually a studio recording. It is correctly listed on iTunes now.\n*Track 14 (\"Shiny Happy People\"&nbsp;– Hip Mix) had a silent gap from 0:27 to 0:48. That has been fixed by iTunes and the track is available as a whole now.\n*Track 20 was listed as \"Orange Crush\" (live), but was actually a repeat of \"Dark Globe\". This has been fixed by iTunes and the mistaken track was replaced by the correct song.\nReferences\n}}"
