The election was originally due to take place in May 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt was the inaugural election to Buckinghamshire Council, a unitary authority created on 1 April 2020 as part of structural changes to English local government. Buckinghamshire Council replaced Buckinghamshire County Council, last elected in 2017.\nA total of 147 councillors were elected, with 49 wards electing 3 councillors each. In order to secure a majority, a party needed to secure 74 seats. The Conservative Party took an overall majority with 113 seats; the Liberal Democrats came second, with 15 seats.\nBackground\nDue to the postponement of the 2020 local elections until 2021, it was announced on 18 March 2020 that all of the current shadow authority members would become councillors and the shadow executive members would form the cabinet. They remained in post until the inaugural election took place in May 2021.\nSummary\nElection result\n|-\nWard results\nAbbey\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAmersham & Chesham Bois\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAston Clinton & Bierton\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAylesbury East\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAylesbury North\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAylesbury North West\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAylesbury South East\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAylesbury South West\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nAylesbury West\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nBeaconsfield\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nBernwood\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nBooker, Cressex & Castlefield\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nBuckingham East\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nBuckingham West\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nChalfont St Giles\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nChalfont St Peter\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nChesham\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nChess Valley\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nChiltern Ridges\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nChiltern Villages\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nCliveden\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nDenham\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nDownley\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nFarnham Common & Burnham Beeches\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nFlackwell Health, Little Marlow & Marlow South East\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nGerrards Cross\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nGreat Brickhill\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nGreat Missenden\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nGrendon Underwood\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nHazlemere\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nIver\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nIvinghoe\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nLittle Chalfont & Amersham Common\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nMarlow\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nPenn Wood & Old Amersham\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nRidgeway East\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nRidgeway West\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nRyemead & Micklefield\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nStoke Poges & Wexham\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nStone & Waddesdon\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nTerriers & Amersham Hill\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nThe Risboroughs\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nThe Wooburns, Bourne End & Hedsor\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nTotteridge & Bowerdean\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nTylers Green & Loudwater\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nWendover, Halton & Stoke Mandeville\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nWest Wycombe\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nWing\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nWinslow\nTo elect 3 councillors.\nBy-elections\nBernwood\nA by-election was held on 30 June 2022 following the resignation of Cllr Cameron Branston.\nDenham\nA by-election was held following the resignation of Cllr Paul Bass.\nBuckingham East\nThe Buckingham East by-election was triggered by the resignation of Conservative councillor Warren Whyte.\nFarnham Common and Burnham Beeches\nA by-election was held on 22 February 2024 following the resignation of Cllr David Anthony.\nHazlemere\nA by-election was held on 22 February 2024 following the death of Cllr Ron Gaffney.\nReferences"
