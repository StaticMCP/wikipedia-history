The structure was constructed in the neoclassic-renaissance style. Today, the structure stands as a national symbol of the Dominican Republic and serves as the final resting place of the Republic's most honored citizens.\nHistory\nJesuits held mass here until 1767. After 1767, it was used as a tobacco warehouse and then as the first Dominican theater for purely artistic purposes by the society Amantes de las Letras in 1860 until 1878 when it became theater La Republicana which operated until 1917. It housed governmental offices until 1956.\nIn 1956, Spanish architect Javier Borroso renovated the structure to serve its new purpose as a national mausoleum, by order of then dictator Rafael Trujillo. Originally, Trujillo envisioned being interred at the National Pantheon, yet today it is the place where the country's most famous persons are honored, among others Trujillo's assassins.\nNotable people buried\n* Francisco Gregorio Billini –  was a Dominican writer, pedagogue, and politician of Italian origin.\n* Concepción Bona – A nursery school teacher who took part in designing the Dominican Republic flag\n* Pedro Francisco Bonó – An Italian-French Dominican who was a politician, sociologist and intellectual\n* Francisco Caamaño –  Dominican soldier and politician who took presidency of the Dominican Republic during the Civil War of 1965.\n* Juan Bautista Cambiaso – was an Italian-born explorer, admiral and sailor in the Dominican Navy.\n* Antonio Duvergé –  was a Dominican general of French origin who served in the Dominican War of Independence.\n* Ulises Francisco Espaillat – was a Dominican author and president.\n* Fabio Fiallo – was a Dominican writer, poet, politician, and diplomat\n* José María Cabral – was a Dominican military figure and politician.
