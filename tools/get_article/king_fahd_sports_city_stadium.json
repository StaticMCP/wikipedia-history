The stadium is currently closed for reconstruction, which will expand its capacity to approximately 70,200 seats by 2026.\nOverview\nThe stadium was built in 1982 and opened in 1987, with Majed Abdullah scoring the first goal there. It hosted matches of the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship, including the final.\nIn September 2017, as part of Saudi Vision 2030, there was a celebration of the 87th anniversary of the foundation of Saudi Arabia with concerts and performances. For the first time, women were allowed into the stadium.\nThe stadium has been included in the FIFA series of video games since the 2013 edition, when the Saudi Pro League began featuring in the game, while a modified version with two tiers all around was featured in the Pro Evolution Soccer series during the PlayStation 2 era under the name \"Nakhon Ratchasima\", due to its resemblance (or lack thereof) to the 80th Birthday Stadium that hosted the 2007 SEA Games in Thailand.\nThe cost of construction was about 1.912 billion Saudi riyals or $510 million. The stadium's roof covers an area of 47,000 square feet and held up by 24 columns arranged in a 247-metre diameter circle, creating an umbrella effect that shades spectators from the hot desert sun. A special pavilion for members of the royal family is also included.\nEvents\nThe stadium's first major musical event was holding a concert by BTS, which was their first concert in the Middle East, as part of their Love Yourself: Speak Yourself World Tour on 11 October 2019. This made the band the first international act to perform in the stadium. They played to an audience of 31,899 people.\nThe stadium hosted WWE's event Crown Jewel on 31 October 2019.\nThe stadium also hosted all the three matches of the 2022 Supercopa de España, which was won by Real Madrid. The semi-final between Barcelona and Real Madrid was the first official  to be held in a stadium outside of Spain.\nOn 28 October 2022, David Guetta performed during the opening ceremony of Saudi Games 2022.\nOn 15 January 2023, the 2023 Supercopa de España final was hosted in the stadium with Barcelona winning the cup. Three days later, the stadium hosted the 2022 Supercoppa Italiana between AC Milan and Inter Milan.\nSee also\n* List of football stadiums in Saudi Arabia\n* List of things named after Saudi kings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_pictures/middle_east/saudi_arabia/riyadh_king_fahd.shtml World Stadium Article]\n*[http://www.worldfootball.net/spielorte/king-fahd-international-stadium-riyadh/ World Football Profile]\n*[https://int.soccerway.com/teams/saudi-arabia/al-hilal-riyadh/venue/ Soccerway Profile]"
