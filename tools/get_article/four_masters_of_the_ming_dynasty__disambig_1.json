The group consists of Shen Zhou (1427–1509), Wen Zhengming (1470–1559), Tang Yin (1470–1523), and Qiu Ying (c.1494–c.1552). They were contemporaries, with Shen being the teacher of Wen, while Tang and Qiu was taught by Zhou Chen (1460–1535). All five of the aforementioned painters were part of the Wu School. Their styles and subject matter were varied. Qiu was solely a painter, while the other three developed distinct styles of painting, calligraphy, and poetry.\nOther names\nClearing after Snow on a Mountain Pass by Tang Yin (1470-1524)\nThere are several alternative terms for these four leading painters:\n* Four Great Masters of the Ming ()\n* Four Masters of Suzhou: all four came from the vicinity of Suzhou\n* Four Masters of Wu (): all four came from the region of Wu, which surrounds the city of Suzhou\nThe \"Four Masters\" designation was first used in the mid-Ming dynasty, probably during the Jiajing era, and has continued to be applied since then.\nThe painters\nSome of the painters were friends when they were living, and were familiar with each other's works. Their family backgrounds varied, Tang Yin was born into a poor merchant background, while Wen Zhengming's father had strong connections and became a patron to Tang, suggesting a relatively prosperous family status. Both Tang and Wen were also skilled in poetry and calligraphy.\nShen Zhou was born in a respected and wealthy family. He was one of the main founders of the Wu School of painting and was also a poet, essayist and calligrapher. Wen studied painting with Shen while Tang and Qiu studied with Zhou Chen, all of whom from the Wu School and made major painting revival techniques from their predecessors.\nShen was most accomplished in shan shui painting and painted in a firm well-structured painting technique, probably following the techniques of Wang Ming. While Tang was accomplished in painting landscapes and semi-cursive script. Wen studied under the tutelage of Shen and would have borrowed painting techniques from him.\nExcept for Qiu, the other three painters were accomplished calligraphers and poets.\nSee also\n* Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty\n* Six Masters of the early Qing period (Four Wangs)\n* Ming dynasty painting\n* Ink and wash painting\n* Bird-and-flower painting\n* Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar\nNotes\nReferences\n*Rawson, Jessica (ed).
