He was also honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 7th Filmfare Awards Marathi. Nagraj Manjule stands out as the only director who has won the award every time he was nominated, with two wins from two nominations. Nachiket Patwardhan has twice received the award, including one joint win with his wife Jayoo Patwardhan.\nIn an exceptional feat, among prolific nominees, Mahesh Manjrekar has received four nominations with one win, while Prasad Oak and Chandrakant Kulkarni have one win each from three and two nominations, respectively. Sameer Vidwans was nominated in two consecutive years (2020–2021) and won in 2020 for Anandi Gopal. Vikram Phadnis also earned back-to-back nominations between 2017 and 2020. Paresh Mokashi, despite being nominated three times, including consecutively in 2023 and 2024, has not yet won.\nOther directors with two nominations include Satish Rajwade, Aditya Sarpotdar, Digpal Lanjekar, and Hemant Dhome, with Dhome being unique in receiving nominations for both an original film and its sequel. Remarkably, Pravin Tarde is the only director to achieve two nominations within the same year and, alongside Dhome, share the distinction of nominations for both an original film and its sequel.\nWinners and nominees\n1970s\n* '1975 – Jabbar Patel – Samna\n* 1976 – Vasant Joglekar – Ha Khel Sawalyancha\n* 1977 – Muralidhar Kapdi – Naav Motha Lakshan Khota\n* 1978 – Jabbar Patel – Jait Re Jait\n* 1979 – Jabbar Patel – Sinhasan\n1980s\n* 1980 – Nachiket Patwardhan – 22 June 1897\n* 1981 – Jabbar Patel – Umbartha\n* 1982 – Rajdutt & Arvind Deshpande – Shapit\n* 1983 – V.
