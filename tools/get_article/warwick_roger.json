      "text": "# Warwick Roger\n\nWarwick George Roger  (21 August 1945 – 17 August 2018) was a New Zealand journalist who founded Metro magazine.\nHe was one of New Zealand's leading journalists during the late 20th century, and his Metro magazine  was the first of its kind in Auckland, with its campaigning journalism, long opinionated articles, publishing of long letters to the editor in full,  no matter the viewpoint, and general celebration of glitz, gossip and conspicuous consumption. It reflected the times of the 1980s and early 90s. Roger was a keen cricket fan and a marathon runner, who also wrote a gossip column called \"Felicity Ferret\" which could border on the cruel, and it brought him a defamation lawsuit in 1994, costing the magazine $100,000, and heralding the ferret's demise.  He was a mentor to many journalists.\nIn the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honours, Roger was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to journalism.\nRoger died of Parkinson's disease in 2018 at the age of 72.\nReferences"
