At the current crossroads of Holly Tree Road and Reynolds Pond Road just east of Ellendale was the New Market Church, around which the town was located.\nNone of the town exists today, although the cemetery from the church yard is still at the intersection. Some small ranch homes have been built in the area in recent years, but the only namesake to the original town that stood there is New Market Village, a single wide trailer park a quarter mile east of the crossroads.\nReferences"
