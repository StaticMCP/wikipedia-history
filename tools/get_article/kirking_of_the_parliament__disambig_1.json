It was re-introduced as a multi-faith service to coincide with the opening of the Scottish Parliament which was devolved from the United Kingdom Parliament and reconvened in 1999. It takes place every 4 years.\nComposition\nThe Kirking is led by the Minister of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, while the sermon is given by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The services have typically consisted of readings from the Bible, the Qur'an, and Jewish prayers, and are concluded by an act of commendation.\nAttendance\nThe service is attended by the leaders of all the main parties and previous Kirkings have been attended by the Duke of Rothesay, musicians from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) and the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland, as well as  lobbyists.\nReferences"
