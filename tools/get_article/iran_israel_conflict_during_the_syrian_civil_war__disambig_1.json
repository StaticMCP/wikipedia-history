With increasing Iranian involvement in Syria from 2011 onwards, the conflict shifted from a proxy war into a direct confrontation by early 2018.\nHistory\nOne of the first reported Israeli airstike against Iranian-linked targets in Syria was on 30 January 2013, when Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian convoy in Rif Dimashq allegedly transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah.\nIsrael historically refused to comment on its purported actions in Syria, allegedly so that the Syrian government would not feel obliged to retaliate.\nIn March 2017, Syria launched anti-aircraft missiles toward Israeli-controlled parts of the Golan Heights, allegedly targeting Israeli Air Force aircraft, which Syria claimed were on their way to attack targets in Palmyra, Syria. After the incident, the State of Israel stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, located in Lebanon. Israel denied Syria's claim that one jet fighter was shot down with another one damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident.
