Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began in Dover on the first Tuesday in January. This date was January 2, 2001, which was two weeks before the beginning of the first administrative year of Democratic Governor Ruth Ann Minner from Kent County and Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Carney from New Castle County.\nCurrently the distribution of seats for both houses was based on the interpretation of the federal 1990 census. It resulted from a large number of memberships in the New Castle County area and ruling that the election districts would abandon county lines for their boundaries, but would design whatever district boundaries that would accomplish such population equals.\nIn the 141st Delaware General Assembly session the Senate had a Democratic majority and the House had a Republican majority.\nParty summary\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:Senate\n*Democratic (D): 13 (majority)\n*Republican (R): 8\nTotal members: 21\n|\n:House of Representatives\n*Democratic (D): 15\n*Republican (R): 26 (majority)\nTotal members: 41\n|}\nLeadership\n{| width=100%\n|- valign=top\n|\n:Senate\n*Lieutenant Governor (President of the Senate):\n** John Carney, Democratic of New Castle County.\n*President pro tempore of the Senate:\n** Thurman G.
