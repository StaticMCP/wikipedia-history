The purpose of the awards is to acknowledge and celebrate some of the most notable achievements in the country that are helping to promote cycling and to create a cycle-friendly environment. Since 2016, the awards have been jointly organised with the New Zealand Transport Agency and rebranded as the [https://www.nzta.govt.nz/walking-cycling-and-public-transport/cycling/cycling-awards/bike-to-the-future-awards 'Bike to the Future Awards'].\nHistory and description\nCAN announced on 7 August 2003 that the awards had been created. The first awards ceremony was held on 10 October 2003 and the awards have since been awarded approximately annually.\nThere are several categories (four initially, since extended to five), and in each category there are up to five finalists. Those finalists are announced some time prior to the awards ceremony, enabling representatives to attend the awards function. In each category, one of the finalists is announced the winner during an awards ceremony. The awards function is typically combined with the biennial NZ Cycling Conference, or with the annual get together of CAN in the intervening years.\nFinalists receive a certificate. Winners receive a certificate and a trophy; originally a bicycle bell mounted on a plinth.\nIn 2012, the opportunity has been taken to combine the awards with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140524032541/http://www.livingstreets.org.nz/walking_awards2011 \"Golden Foot\" Awards] presented by walking advocates Living Streets Aotearoa. In addition a new joint award for all Walking and Cycling finalists was introduced. These initiatives were repeated in 2014, but the Golden Foot Awards have been subsequently awarded at a separate ceremony.\nIn 2016, the New Zealand Transport Agency took on organisation of the awards, with CAN still involved, and rebranded them as the 'Bike to the Future Awards'. A new trophy design, incorporating a stylised bicycle, was created for the winners.\nA panel of judges uses criteria to individually assess the nominations. The judges work independent from one another, so can't influence each other, and don't know how the others are scoring. Combining the judges' scores by the awards coordinator determines the winner. The following criteria are used:\n* Coverage – the number of people potentially affected\n* Success to date – of initiatives / person in encouraging cycling\n* Potential – applicability to other locations / organisations / commitment by person\n* Innovation – relative uniqueness & innovation of initiative / person's action in New Zealand\nAward categories\nBest cycle facility project\nThis category is for the transport infrastructure project year that has had the most significant impact on promoting cycling and a cycle-friendly environment in the past year. Examples could include new cycle ways, cycle parking facilities, or general roading projects that assist and encourage cycling. Nominations are typically received for projects undertaken by local or central government agencies.\nBest cycling promotion\nThis category is for the education or encouragement project that has had the most significant impact on promoting cycling and a cycle-friendly environment in the past year. Examples could include publicity campaigns, school education programmes, or promotional cycling events. Nominations range from individuals to government organisations.\nCycle-friendly commitment by business\nThis category is for the companies that have made significant efforts encouraging and supporting cycling by its staff, customers and clients the past year. Examples of cycle-friendly actions include cyclist parking / changing facilities, employee support and incentive programmes, and company 'pool' bikes. Nominations cover both general businesses and those directly involved in the bicycle industry.\nCycle-friendly commitment by public organisation\nThis category is for the public or government organisation that has made significant efforts encouraging and supporting cycling by its staff and public users in the past year. This category includes central or local government agencies, and organisations such as health boards, universities or airports. Examples of cycle-friendly actions include cyclist parking / changing facilities, employee support and incentive programmes.\nCycling champion of the year\nThis category, first awarded in 2007, is designed to recognise the contribution made by individual New Zealanders to the promotion of cycling.\nWinners and finalists\nThe following table shows the winners for the various years.\nWinners by
