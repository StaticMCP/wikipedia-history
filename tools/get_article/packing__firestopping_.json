Lesser packing, such as foam backer rod or fibreglass are used simply to hold up materials that can survive fire testing on their own. In both cases, the packing is placed in such a way as to control the exact depth of the materials that top off the seal.\nSee also\n* Firestop\n* Mineral wool\n* Annulus (firestop)\n* Penetration (firestop)\n* Fire test\n* Passive fire protection\n* Sealant\n* Caulking\n* Annulus (firestop)\nExternal links\n* [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0733384.html Packing as used in a patented firestop product patent]\n* [http://www.wardmfg.com/_Files/ULCert/W-J-1099.pdf Ward Manufacturing UL Listing, Item 4A is Packing Material for Firestop]"
