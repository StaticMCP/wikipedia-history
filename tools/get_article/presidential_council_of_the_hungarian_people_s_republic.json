It was created in 1949, following the enactment of a new constitution that year that officially created the People's Republic of Hungary. Originally vested with broad powers during the interim of parliamentary sessions, its jurisdiction was limited throughout the moderate liberalization witnessed during the Kadar era. Along with the state itself, it was abolished on 23 October 1989.\nThe Parliament of Hungary, upon the recommendation of the Presidential Council, elected and relieved the chairman and ministers of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic of their duties.\nList of chairmen of the Presidential Council\nParties'\n|Independent|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!\n!
