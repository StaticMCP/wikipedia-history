He is known for his work in seismology and radio astronomy, and particularly for his contributions to the design of the Howard E. Tatel Telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia.\nEarly life and education\nHoward Edwin Tatel was born on December 22, 1913 in New York City. In 1935, he obtained a B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He obtained an M.S. degree from the same institution the following year. In 1939, he earned a Ph.D. at Stanford University. After earning his doctoral degree, Tatel served as a research associate in nuclear physics at the University of Michigan.\nCareer\nTatel left the University of Michigan in 1941 to work for the Carnegie Institution of Washington, assisting with the Institution's defense work for the Office of Scientific Research and Development. While at the Carnegie Institution, Tatel contributed to the invention of the proximity fuse. The Carnegie Institution's fuse research was transferred to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in 1942, and Tatel likewise transferred to the Applied Physics Laboratory in order to continue working on the proximity fuse project under the leadership of Dr. Merle A. Tuve. Tatel also aided in the early development phase of ramjet propulsion in 1944 and 1945.\nFollowing the war, Tatel returned to the Carnegie Institution. While there, Tatel conducted research alongside James Van Allen, using instruments attached to V-2 rockets to investigate cosmic rays in the Earth's magnetosphere. In 1947, he joined the Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, once again under the leadership of Dr. Tuve, who had recently been appointed the Department's director. In 1948, Tatel became chairman of the Department's Earth Crust Section. Between 1949 and 1957, he led numerous seismologic expeditions across the Americas. Together with Tuve, Tatel pioneered the use of large-scale seismic refraction to better determine the structure of the Earth's crust and mantle.  .\nWhile Tatel's career primarily concerned seismology, he also made contributions to radio astronomy.
