The award was first presented in 1955 by Sport magazine, but since 1985 has been officially presented by MLB. The winner is determined during the final game of the World Series by a committee of reporters and officials present at the game.\nOn September 29, 2017, the award was renamed in honor of Willie Mays in remembrance of the 63rd anniversary of The Catch, which occurred the year before the award's debut; Mays never won the award himself.\nCar and trophy\nThe award winner has traditionally received a new car. Johnny Podres, the inaugural winner in 1955, received a Chevrolet Corvette. The 1977 winner, Reggie Jackson, received a Ford Thunderbird, while the 1983 winner, Rick Dempsey, received a Pontiac Firebird. Frank Viola, the 1987 MVP, received a Volvo 740.\nSince 2004, General Motors had provided the vehicle. Examples include David Ortiz (2013 MVP) receiving a 2014 Chevrolet Silverado High Country, Ben Zobrist (2016 MVP) receiving a 2017 Chevrolet Camaro SS Convertible 50th Anniversary Edition, and Corey Seager (2020 MVP) receiving a 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71.\nA trophy has also been presented to the award winner since at least the late 1970s. In 1985, Major League Baseball (MLB) took over as the official award presenter from Sport magazine, although for a few years, MLB and Sport each presented different trophies to the winner. Trophies given to award winners include:\n*A wooden base supporting a metallic baseball inside a hoop; in use by 1978, and last presented in 1984.\n*A tall wooden base with a metallic baseball on top, surrounded by a number of metallic flags; first presented in 1985, and last presented in 1988. The text on this trophy read \"''Sport Magazine's'' World Series Most Valuable Player Award\".\n*A metallic bowl on a wooden base; in use by 1987, apparently the MLB-awarded trophy.\n*A trapezoidal wooden base, which included the MLB logo, topped by a metallic baseball; first awarded in 1988.\n* A pyramid-shaped trophy with a dark base, clear body, and baseball on top; in use by 1995.\n*A scaled-down variant of the Commissioner's Trophy with a single large metallic pennant; last presented in 2017.\n*A wooden pedestal topped by a bronze sculpture of Willie Mays making \"The Catch\" in the 1954 World Series; in use since 2018.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Key\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|Year\n|Links to an article about the corresponding World Series\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\"|Otherawards\n|Player also won, in the same season:\n:ASG: All-Star Game MVP Award\n:CY: Cy Young Award\n:LCS: League Championship Series MVP Award\n:MVP: Major League Baseball MVP Award\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffffbb\"|\n|Inductee of the National Baseball Hall of Fame\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfecec\"|\n|Player is still active in professional baseball\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#fbd4ff\"|#\n|Player was a rookie that season\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffbbbb\"|§\n|Member of losing team in the World Series\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#bbffbb\"|^\n|Multiple award winners in the same World Series\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;|(#)\n|Number of times winning World Series MVP at that point (if more than one)\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

In 68 editions, a single MVP was named; in 1981, three MVPs were named; and in 2001, two MVPs were named. Thus, there have been a total of 72 MVPs.\nThe position at which players have won the most MVPs is pitcher, 30 times. Four of those winners were exclusively relief pitchers, the most recent being Mariano Rivera in 1999. Twelve of the first 14 MVPs were pitchers. From 1969 through 1986, the prevalence of pitcher MVPs declined, as only two pitchers won the award during this period. From 1987 through 1991, all of the MVPs were pitchers. Since 1995,  years ago, pitchers have won the award eleven times, the most recent being Yoshinobu Yamamoto in 2025.\nThe most uncommon position for an MVP is second baseman, with only Bobby Richardson in 1960 winning at the position. Richardson is also the only MVP to be named from a losing World Series team.\nOf the 30 current MLB franchises, 24 have had at least one MVP. The six that have not are the Cleveland Guardians, Colorado Rockies, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners, and Tampa Bay Rays. Of those six franchises, five have never won a World Series with Seattle never having been in a World Series and Cleveland last won in 1948, prior to the MVP award being established.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by team\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Team\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Total\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York Yankees\n|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Los Angeles/Brooklyn Dodgers\n|11\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|St. Louis Cardinals\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Boston Red Sox\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Oakland Athletics\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Baltimore Orioles\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Cincinnati Reds\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Atlanta/Milwaukee Braves\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|San Francisco Giants\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Arizona Diamondbacks\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Detroit Tigers\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Miami/Florida Marlins\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Houston Astros\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Kansas City Royals\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Minnesota Twins\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|New York Mets\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Philadelphia Phillies\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Pittsburgh Pirates\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Toronto Blue Jays\n|2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Los Angeles/Anaheim Angels\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Chicago Cubs\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Chicago White Sox\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Texas Rangers\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Washington Nationals\n|1\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Winners by position\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Total\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Pitcher\n|30\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Third baseman\n|10\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Outfielder\n|10\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Shortstop\n|8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Catcher\n|7\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|First baseman\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Designated hitter\n|3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Second baseman\n|1\n|-\n|}\nNote: When a player is listed at multiple positions in the main table, the first position is deemed to be his primary position, and he has been counted here as such.\nNotable accomplishments\nFour players have won the award twice: Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965), Bob Gibson (1964, 1967), Reggie Jackson (1973, 1977), and Corey Seager (2020, 2023). Jackson and Seager are the only players to have won the award with two different teams, while Seager is the first player to win the award in both leagues.\nA total of 13 players born outside of the United States have been named World Series MVP, with Pedro Guerrero, a native of the Dominican Republic, being the first to win it in 1981. Of players born outside the U.S., the Dominican Republic has produced the most World Series MVP winners, with five. Venezuela, Cuba, and Japan have produced two each, and Colombia, and Panama have each produced one.
