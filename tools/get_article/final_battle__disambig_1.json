The event was initially held in 2002.\nIt is held in December, and is the promotion's last show of the calendar year. The 2009 edition of the show was ROH's first internet pay-per-view, and the first ROH show to be broadcast live. The 2010 edition and the 2011 edition were also broadcast live via the internet. Between 2006 and 2014, every event was held at either the Grand Ballroom or the Hammerstein Ballroom of the Manhattan Center in New York City. Final Battle has since become Ring of Honor's premiere flagship event, similar to WWE's WrestleMania.\nDates and venues\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable succession-box\"  style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"|Event\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"10\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"224\"|Venue\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"126\"|Location\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"390\"|Main event\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"1\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|-\n|Final Battle 2002\n|\n|Murphy Recreation Center\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Bryan Danielson vs. Low Ki vs. Samoa Joe vs. Steve Corino in a four-way match for the Number One Contender's Trophy\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2003\n|\n|Pennsylvania National Guard Armory\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|The Prophecy (Christopher Daniels and Dan Maff) vs. The Great Muta and Arashi\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2004\n|\n|Pennsylvania National Guard Armory\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Samoa Joe (c) vs. Austin Aries for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2005\n|\n|Inman Sports Center\n|Edison, New Jersey\n|Kenta (c) vs. Low Ki for the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2006\n|\n|Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Bryan Danielson (c) vs. Homicide for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2007\n|\n|Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) (c) vs. The Age of the Fall (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black) for the ROH World Tag Team Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2008\n|\n|Hammerstein Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Bryan Danielson vs. Takeshi Morishima in a Fight Without Honor\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2009\n|\n|Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Austin Aries (c) vs. Tyler Black for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2010\n|\n|Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|El Generico vs. Kevin Steen in an unsanctioned Fight Without Honor for Generico's mask or Steen's ROH career\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2011\n|\n|Hammerstein Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Davey Richards (c) vs. Eddie Edwards (with Dan Severn) for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2012: Doomsday\n|\n|Hammerstein Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Kevin Steen (c) vs. El Generico in Ladder War IV for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2013\n|\n|Hammerstein Ballroom\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Adam Cole (c) vs. Michael Elgin vs. Jay Briscoe in a Three-way match for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle 2014\n|\n|Terminal 5\n|Manhattan, New York\n|Jay Briscoe (c) vs. Adam Cole in a Fight Without Honor for the ROH World Championship\n|\n|-\n|Final Battle (2015)\n|\n|2300 Arena\n|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|Jay Lethal (c) vs A.J.
