Additionally, these organisms look very different to him, and much larger than what can be seen under a microscope by normal people. This ability has brought him a bit of fame as when he entered the university, Tadayasu discovered that one of the professors there, Keizō Itsuki, already knew about his gift via Tadayasu's grandfather. Professor Itsuki's coworker Haruka Hasegawa has trouble believing what Tadayasu claims at first, but later comes to accept it.

In early 2004, the editor-in-chief of Kodansha's seinen magazine Evening at the time, Kazuya Kajiwara, gave Ishikawa the opportunity to draw a manga that would appear in that year's 16th issue sold on July 20, 2004. Kajiwara told Ishikawa to draw a storyboard for five chapters, and only after Kajiwara approved the storyboard would Ishikawa be allowed to draw the manuscript for the first chapter. Following this, Ishikawa worked on several proposals for a story about an agricultural university with his supervising editor and submitted them to Kajiwara, but he rejected every one. As the deadline approached, Ishikawa asked his editor what was wrong with his proposals, to which his editor casually suggested that one of the characters could have the ability to see microorganisms with the naked eye. After submitting this idea to Kajiwara, he immediately approved it.\nIn 2004, Ishikawa was living in Sakai not far from Osaka Prefecture University, so to better understand microorganisms, Ishikawa spent long days from morning until evening reading technical books on microorganisms in the university's library. During this time, Ishikawa always had lunch at the university's dining hall where he would hear students and faculty talking about various topics. This led him to solidify the story's concept about college life using microorganisms as a motif and self-reliance as a theme. The series was originally titled , but this was changed in the second chapter to  and then simply Moyasimon with chapter three; the subtitle Tales of Agriculture was added with chapter eight.\nEven after the serialization began, Kajiwara continued to suggest ideas for future chapters, such as adding the police to one chapter, or including a mysterious microorganism that could threaten humanity. However, Ishikawa did not feel any of these proposals were interesting, and instead decided to work with his editor to get ranked No. 1 among the series serialized in Evening without any other outside help. Shortly thereafter, while Kajiwara went on a short vacation to Germany, Ishikawa and his editor worked feverishly on the next chapter, which ultimately led Moyasimon to achieve a No. 1 ranking for the first time in its history. When writing Moyasimon, Ishikawa aimed to take difficult to understand information from technical books and present it in a way that was easier for readers to grasp. Themes and motifs Ishikawa developed led him to learn more about additional topics to better flesh out the initial idea. When deciding on certain fashion for the characters, Ishikawa wanted clothing that would not degrade with age as new fashion trends were introduced, which is one of the reasons for Haruka Hasegawa's distinctive bondage-esque fashion.\nMoyasimon was serialized in Evening from July 20, 2004, in the 16th issue of that year to April 23, 2013, in the 10th issue of that year. Following this, it moved to Kodansha's Monthly Morning Two magazine and ran in that magazine from the August 2013 issue sold on June 22, 2013, to the March 2014 issue sold on January 22, 2014. The individual chapters were collected and published in 13 tankōbon volumes by Kodansha from May 2005 to March 2014. Limited editions were also released for volumes 3 through 13. The manga was licensed in North America by Del Rey Manga, but they only released the first two volumes in November 2009 and June 2010. Further English volumes were discontinued after Kodansha USA took over the manga published by Del Rey Manga. The manga is also published by Glénat Manga in France, GP Publishing and later RW Edizioni in Italy, and Sharp Point Press in Taiwan.\nIn the December 2024 issue of Kodansha's Monthly Afternoon magazine released on October 25, 2024, it was announced that Ishikawa would launch a new series titled Moyasimon+ in the next issue released on November 25, 2024.\nAnime\nAn 11-episode anime adaptation aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina block between October 11 and December 20, 2007.

In 2006, the manga was a finalist in the 10th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.\nZoltan Fehervari writing for Cell commends the manga's art for being \"generally excellent throughout, with crisp detail, expressive characters, and fluid action.\" Brigid Alverson commends the manga with \"while this series showcases the author's zany sense of humor, the series is so scientifically accurate it's legitimately educational, too!\" ''Ain't It Cool News''' Scott Green comments on the presentation of the bacteria in the manga \"basically shapes with faces\", highlighting the differences between their \"broad and cute\" character design and Jessica Rabbit. He also praises the art with \"characters appear in thought out backgrounds with plenty of line work, an abundance of zip tones, margin illustrations and notes.\" However the density of the information given leads to \"a viscous manga that moves slowly. Even if there aren't dead stops, it doesn't flow easily.\" Satsuki Murakami and Mio Bryce writing for the International Journal of the Humanities commend the manga by stating that \"key concepts are repeatedly presented in the entertaining format, making Moyashimon representative of manga that successfully promotes readers' interest in, and effective understanding of, difficult subjects such as brewing technology.\" Jason Thompson, in his online appendix to Manga: The Complete Guide, comments that \"Ishikawa sometimes errs on the side of too much info, resulting in pages and pages filled with text, and not so much in the way of plot or character development in the macroscopic human world.\" Carlo Santos from Anime News Network commended Ishikawa's art stating \"lots of careful shading to bring out the depth and texture in each scene, as well as distinctive character designs for each of the newcomers.\"\n}}\nJake Godek from THEM Anime commends the anime for its portrayal of the microorganism stating that they are \"so adorable it's easy to see one in the show and want to hug it.\" He also praises the \"catchy beyond needed\" music, however he criticizes the weak story stating \"it feels like the story really is being decided on step-by-step during production rather than before it.\" Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network commends the anime's setting for \"capturing that collegiate feeling: the freedom, the newness, the adventure; the bad roommates, the bizarre school activities, the drunken sexual experimentation.\" Kimlinger compared the two seasons of anime: \"This season is the sharper looking of the two, with cleaner designs and more detailed settings; season two is the more vivid, with brighter colors and more expressive designs. This season's score is sometimes incongruously serious (which actually adds to the humor on occasion), and its fan service level is orders of magnitude higher. (Remember the drunken sexual experimentation? Let's just say no men were involved).\" Kimlinger, in his review of the second season, commends the \"great ensemble cast\" and \"pleasing pace\" but criticizes the first three episodes of \"inconsequential filler and food-science lectures\".\nClarissa Graffeo from Anime World Order comments on \"gross\" practice of preparing kiviak in the live action and Itsuki consumes the fermented meal. Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network comments on the denseness of the live action, comparing the live action to Nodame Cantabiles live action, \"which seemed to cover one entire volume of manga per episode.\" Mania.com's Chris Beveridge comments on the \"mildly comical microbes that are reminiscent of the aliens from Toy Story except that they talk more.\" In a review of the fifth episode, Beveridge criticizes the introduction of gothic lolita girl, saying \"that while cute in manga and anime, looks ridiculous in person.\" A review of the final episode has Beveridge commending the \"CG work both for the bacteria and all the campus oddities\". He further applauds the live action with \"Moyashimon overacts everything in just the right way, rarely taking it too far and instead being just goofy and unrealistic enough to make you laugh while still going with the core concept.\"\nSee also\n*Silver Spoon – a similar manga and anime series by Hiromu Arakawa set at the fictional Ooezo Agricultural High School\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://kamosuzo2.tv/ Anime official website]\n*\n}}"
