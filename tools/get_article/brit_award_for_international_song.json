The accolade is presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. The winners and nominees are determined by the Brit Awards voting academy with over one thousand members, which comprise record labels, publishers, managers, agents, media, and previous winners and nominees.\nThe inaugural winner of the category was Olivia Rodrigo with \"Good 4 U\", a single from her debut album Sour. Billie Eilish holds the record for most nominations in the category, with three. Noah Kahan's \"Stick Season\" is the first song to be nominated in consecutive years. The current recipient of the award is Chappell Roan for her song \"Good Luck, Babe!\".\nHistory\nThe category was introduced in 2022 following a restructuring which resulted in the removal of gendered categories. It is the first award to recognise individual songs by international artists and only the second category, following the Brit Award for International Album (1977, 2002-2011), to honor the work of international artists rather than the artists themselves.\nWinners and nominees\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"35%\" | Song\n! width=\"60%\" | Artist(s)\n|-\n|rowspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 (42nd)\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Good 4 U\"\n| Olivia Rodrigo\n|-\n|\"Black Magic\"\n|Jonasu\n|-\n|\"Calling My Phone\"\n|Lil Tjay & 6lack\n|-\n|\"Girls Want Girls\"\n|Drake featuring Lil Baby\n|-\n|\"Happier Than Ever\"\n|Billie Eilish\n|-\n|\"Heartbreak Anthem\"\n|Galantis, David Guetta & Little Mix\n|-\n|\"I Wanna Be Your Slave\"\n|Måneskin\n|-\n|\"Kiss Me More\"\n|Doja Cat featuring SZA\n|-\n|\"Love Nwantiti Remix (Ah Ah Ah)\"\n|CKay featuring Joeboy and Kuami Eugene\n|-\n|\"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\"\n|Lil Nas X\n|-\n|\"Rapstar\"\n|Polo G\n|-\n|\"Save Your Tears\"\n|The Weeknd\n|-\n|\"Stay\"\n|The Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber\n|-\n|\"The Business\"\n|Tiësto\n|-\n|\"Your Love (9pm)\"\n|ATB, Topic & A7S\n|-\n|rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023 (43rd)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Break My Soul\"\n| Beyoncé\n|-\n|\"I'm Good (Blue)\"\n|David Guetta & Bebe Rexha\n|-\n|\"Peru\"\n|Fireboy DML & Ed Sheeran\n|-\n|\"We Don't Talk About Bruno\"\n|Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero & Stephanie Beatriz\n|-\n|\"First Class\"\n|Jack Harlow\n|-\n|\"About Damn Time\"\n|Lizzo\n|-\n|\"Where Are You Now\"\n|Lost Frequencies & Calum Scott\n|-\n|\"I Ain't Worried\"\n|OneRepublic\n|-\n|\"Anti-Hero\"\n|Taylor Swift\n|-\n| rowspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2024 (44th)\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| \"Flowers\"\n| Miley Cyrus\n|-\n| \"What Was I Made For?\"\n| Billie Eilish\n|-\n|\"Daylight\"\n|David Kushner\n|-\n|\"Paint the Town Red\"\n|Doja Cat\n|-\n|\"Giving Me\"\n|Jazzy\n|-\n|\"People\"\n|Libianca\n|-\n|\"Made You Look\"\n|Meghan Trainor\n|-\n|\"Stick Season\"\n|Noah Kahan\n|-\n|\"Miss You\"\n|Oliver Tree & Robin Schulz\n|-\n|\"Vampire\"\n|Olivia Rodrigo\n|-\n|\"(It Goes Like) Nanana\"\n|Peggy Gou\n|-\n|\"Calm Down\"\n|Rema\n|-\n|\"Kill Bill\"\n|SZA\n|-\n|\"Greedy\"\n|Tate McRae\n|-\n|\"Water\"\n|Tyla\n|-\n|rowspan=\"16\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2025 (45th)\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n|\"Good Luck, Babe!\"\n|Chappell Roan\n|-\n|\"Beautiful Things\"\n|Benson Boone\n|-\n|\"Texas Hold 'Em\"\n|Beyoncé\n|-\n|\"Birds of a Feather\"\n|Billie Eilish\n|-\n|\"End of Beginning\"\n|Djo\n|-\n|\"Houdini\"\n|Eminem\n|-\n|\"Too Sweet\"\n|Hozier\n|-\n|\"Lovin on Me\"\n|Jack Harlow\n|-\n|\"Stick Season\"\n|Noah Kahan\n|-\n|\"I Had Some Help\"\n|Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen\n|-\n|\"Espresso\"\n|Sabrina Carpenter\n|-\n|\"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\"\n|Shaboozey\n|-\n|\"Fortnight\"\n|Taylor Swift featuring Post Malone\n|-\n|\"Lose Control\"\n|Teddy Swims\n|-\n|\"Million Dollar Baby\"\n|Tommy Richman\n|}\nArtists with multiple nominations\n;3 nominations\n*Billie Eilish\n;2 nominations\n*Beyoncé\n*Doja Cat\n*David Guetta\n*Jack Harlow\n*Noah Kahan\n*Olivia Rodrigo\n*Post Malone\n*SZA\n*Taylor Swift\nSee also\n*Brit Award for British Single\nReferences"
