It is commonly used by banks and other large enterprises with IBM mainframe IT computing platforms. In 1987, Computer Associates took ownership of the product when it acquired its archrival, UCCEL Corporation. CA subsequently renamed it from UCC-7 to CA-7, as was done with product prefixes for UCC-1 (tape library  management) and UCC-11 (batch job rerun/restart), etc.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/intelligent-ops-automation/automation/ca7-workload-automation CA 7 Workload Automation Intelligence]\n* [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/28/rbs_job_cuts_and_offshoring_software_glitch/ Half the team at the heart of the RBS disaster WERE in India • The Register]\n* [http://businessetc.thejournal.ie/ulster-bank-backlog-banking-customers-royal-bank-of-scotland-507284-Jul2012/ Ulster Bank now doesn't know when normal service will be resumed]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043734/http://supportconnectw.ca.com/public/ca-7/ca-7/infodocs/ca7-r11datasheet.pdf Unicenter CA-7 Job Management r11 PDF (Archived)]\n* [http://www.siliconrepublic.com/strategy/item/27990-rbs-may-sue-ca-over-softwar RBS may sue CA over software glitch that hit Ulster Bank and NatWest - Enterprise | siliconrepublic.com - Ireland's Technology News Service]"
