In the , Caldervale had \"no people or a very low population\".\nGeography\nThe ridge of the Great Dividing Range passes through Caldervale and creates a drainage divide. The north and south of the locality are within the Warrego River drainage basin which becomes part of the Murray-Darling basin which enters the Southern Ocean at Lake Alexandrina in South Australia. The west of the locality is within the Cooper Creek drainage basin which ultimately ends at Lake Eyre. The east of the locality is within the Fitzroy River drainage basin which flows into the Coral Sea south of Rockhampton. The Pluto Timber Reserve is in the east of the locality.\nHistory\nIn March 1881, the Caldervale pastoral station of  was forfeited by its previous owner and sold to J. & R. Winton.\nMalta Provisional School opened in 1881 and closed in 1883. Malta is the name of the parish and a pastoral property in the west of Caldervale.

Tambo State School is neighbouring Tambo to the east provides primary schooling and secondary schooling to Year 10, but, given the size of Caldervale, it may too distant from some parts of the locality for a daily commute. Also, there is no nearby school offering secondary schooling to year 12. For both reasons, other options include distance education and boarding school.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* —shows the location of the Caldervale pastoral lease and homestead in 1912"
