In 1985, it was published by Sinclair Research as part of a software pack bundled with ZX Spectrum+.   It was one of the earliest Star Wars-related video games, following Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back in 1982 and alongside  Atari's 1983 Star Wars arcade game. It was the first video game based on Return of the Jedi.\nGameplay\nZX Spectrum screenshot\nThe player controls the Millennium Falcon with the aim of destroying the second Death Star. The game is split into two stages. In the first, the player must shoot enemy TIE fighters while waiting for an opportunity to pass through an energy shield.\nIn the second stage, the player must shoot at parts of the Death Star until there is a clear path to the reactor. Once the reactor has been destroyed, the player must avoid being hit by fireballs from the resultant explosion.\nOnce these objectives are completed, the game begins again in a new round with greater difficulty.\nRelease\nThe cover art depicts the Millennium Falcon in flight away from the partially constructed Death Star, pursued by four TIE interceptors. It was produced by science fiction artist John Berkey, who designed some of the earliest poster art for the original 1977 film, Star Wars.\nSee also\n*Return of the Jedi, a 1984 arcade game from Atari\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
