From 1961 to 1981 the promotion was known as Big Time Wrestling (BTW) and World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA) from 1986 until 1989. WCCW held multiple Star Wars shows throughout the year, especially on or close to Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. None of the shows were broadcast live, but were instead taped for WCCW's weekly TV shows where several of the matches would air.\nDates, venues, and main events\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Event\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|City\n!scope=\"col\"|Venue\n!scope=\"col\"|Main Event\n!class=\"unsortable\" scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n|Star Wars ||  || Dallas, Texas || Reunion Arena || Bruiser Brody vs. The Great Kabuki ||\n|-\n|Star Wars ||  || Dallas, Texas || Reunion Arena || Al Madril (c) vs Bill Irwin for the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship ||\n|-\n|Christmas Star Wars ||  || Dallas, Texas || Reunion Arena || 14-man, two-ring battle royal ||\n|-\n|Star Wars ||  || Dallas, Texas || The Convention Center || Kevin and Kerry Von Erich vs. Gary Hart and King Kong Bundy in a \"Texas Death\" steel cage match||\n|-\n|Star Wars ||  || Dallas, Texas || The Convention Center || Ric Flair (c) s.
