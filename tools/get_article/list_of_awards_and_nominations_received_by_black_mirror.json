The main award ceremony is the Primetime Emmy Award, whilst Creative Arts Emmy Awards are given in technical, creative and craft categories, and International Emmy Awards are presented to shows airing outside of the U.S.\nBlack Mirror won three consecutive awards in the Outstanding Television Movie category. In 2018, submissions were required to have a runtime of 75 minutes or more; Bandersnatch won with a nominal runtime of 90 minutes. Netflix also petitioned for \"Smithereens\" to be submitted in 2020, despite a 70-minute runtime. This was initially allowed, but it was later entered as Outstanding Drama Series instead. Critics for IndieWire disagreed that the series should have been eligible in the category as it is episodic; rule changes have been attributed to Black Mirrors success. In 2021, the Limited Series category expanded to include anthology series.\nEmmy Awards\n, who appeared in series four episode \"Black Museum\" as Nish, was nominated for an Emmy.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" summary=\"Black Mirror won eight of fourteen awards.\"\n|+ Emmy Awards and nominations received by Black Mirror\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:33%;\"| Category\n!
