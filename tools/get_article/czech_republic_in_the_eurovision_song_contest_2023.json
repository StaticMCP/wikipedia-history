      "text": "# Czech Republic in the Eurovision Song Contest 2023\n\n| SF result = Qualified (4th, 110 points)\n| Final result = 10th, 129 points\n}}\nThe Czech Republic, presented for the first time as Czechia, was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 with the song \"My Sister's Crown\" performed by the band Vesna. The Czech broadcaster Česká televize (ČT) organised the national final ESCZ 2023 in order to select the Czech entry for the 2023 contest. Five entries competed in the national final and \"My Sister's Crown\" performed by Vesna was announced as the winner on 7 February 2023 following the combination of an international public vote and a Czech public vote.\nCzechia was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 9 May 2023. Performing during the show in position 13, \"My Sister's Crown\" was announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and therefore qualified to compete in the final on 13 May. It was later revealed that Czechia placed fourth out of the 15 participating countries in the semi-final with 110 points. In the final, Czechia performed in position 14 and placed tenth out of the 26 participating countries, scoring 129 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2023 contest, Czechia has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest ten times since its first entry in . The nation competed in the contest on three consecutive occasions between 2007 and 2009 without qualifying to the final. After Gipsy.cz performing the song \"\" placed 18th (last) in their semi-final in , failing to score any points, the Czech broadcaster withdrew from the contest between 2010 and 2014, citing low viewing figures and poor results as reasons for their absence. Since returning to the contest in  and qualifying to the final for the first time in , Czechia has featured in four finals. In , the country qualified for the final with the song \"Lights Off\" performed by We Are Domi, placing 22nd with 38 points.\nThe Czech national broadcaster, Česká televize (ČT) broadcasts the event within Czechia and organizes the selection process for the nation's entry. The broadcaster has used both national finals and internal selections to select the Czech Eurovision entries in the past. ČT confirmed their intention to participate at the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in October 2022. The broadcaster later confirmed that the Czech entry for the 2023 contest would be selected through a national final that would be broadcast live. This marked the first time in 15 years that ČT organised a live show in order to determine their participant.\nBefore Eurovision\nESCZ 2023\nESCZ 2023 was the national final organised by ČT in order to select the Czech entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. Five entries participated in the competition which took place between 30 January 2023 and 6 February 2023, with the winner being selected entirely via a public vote and announced on 7 February 2023.\nCompeting entries\nArtists and composers were able to submit their proposals to the broadcaster between 2 November 2022 and 8 December 2022. Artists were required to have Czech citizenship and for groups of a maximum of six members, at least one of the lead vocalists were required to have Czech citizenship. Songwriters of any nationality were able to submit songs. The broadcaster received over 170 submissions at the closing of the deadline, most of them which were written by Czech songwriters. ČT selected five entries for the national final from the submissions received, which were announced on 16 January 2023.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n!

On 1 April, Vesna performed during the Polish Eurovision Party, which was held at the Praga Centrum in Warsaw, Poland and hosted by Poli Genova and Konrad Zemlik. Between 2 and 4 April, the band took part in promotional activities in Tel Aviv, Israel and performed during the Israel Calling event held at Hangar 11 of the Tel Aviv Port.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 31 January 2023, an allocation draw was held, which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, and determined which half of the show they would perform in. Czechia has been placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 9 May 2023, and has been scheduled to perform in the second half of the show.\nOnce all the competing songs for the 2023 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Czechia was set to perform in position 13, following the entry from  and before the entry from the .\nAll shows were broadcast in Czechia on ČT2 and featured commentary by Jan Maxián. The Czech spokesperson, who announced the top 12-point score awarded by the Czech jury during the final, was Radka Rosická.\nSemi-final\nVesna took part in technical rehearsals on 1 and 3 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 8 and 9 May. This included the jury show on 8 May where the professional back-up juries of each country watched and voted in a result used if any issues with public televoting occurred.\nThe Czech performance featured the members of Vesna appearing on stage in long braided hair and wearing matching pale pink jumpsuits with a grey tassle. The stage colours transitioned between pale pink, white and black and the LED screens displayed the lyrics of the song, clips of the band members and hands reaching and banging. During the second chorus, the band members marched in a line to the satellite stage before forming a circle for the bridge with a light swirling around them. The art director for the performance was Matyáš Vorda and the stage director was Vítek Bělohradský.\nAt the end of the show, Czechia was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final. It was later revealed that the Czechia placed fourth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 110 points.\nFinal\nShortly after the first semi-final, a winners' press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries appeared in the semi-final running order. Czechia was drawn to compete in the second half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they had done for the semi-finals. Czechia was subsequently placed to perform in position 14, before the entry from Finland and before the entry from Australia.\nVesna once again took part in dress rehearsals on 12 and 13 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show. The band performed a repeat of their semi-final performance during the final on 14 May. Czechia placed tenth in the final, scoring 129 points: 35 points from the televoting and 94 points from the juries.\nVoting\nVoting during the three shows involved each country awarding sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting in the final vote, while the semi-final vote was based entirely on the vote of the public. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, each member of a national jury may only take part in the panel once every three years, and no jury was permitted to discuss of their vote with other members or be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member in an anonymised form as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.\nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to Czechia and awarded by Czechia in the first semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows:\nPoints awarded to Czechia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to Czechia (Semi-final 1)\n|-\n!
