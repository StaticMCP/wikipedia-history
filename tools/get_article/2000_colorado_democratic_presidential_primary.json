The Colorado primary, the first in the state since 2000, was a semi-closed primary and awarded 61 delegates towards the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 51 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary with 71% of the vote and ultimately received 44 delegates, ahead of Senator Bill Bradley, who won roughly 23% and received 7 delegates, after withdrawing the night before. The option for Uncommitted received 4% of the vote and conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche Jr. received just under 1%.\nProcedure\nColorado was one of two states that held primaries on March 10, 2000, along with Utah.\nVoting took place throughout the state until 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 61 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 5 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 6 congressional districts and another 7 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 11 at-large delegates.\nThe state convention voted on the 11 at-large and 7 pledged PLEO delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 12 unpledged PLEO delegates: 6 members of the Democratic National Committee, 2 members of Congress (Diana DeGette and Mark Udall), 1 distinguished party leader, and 1 add-on.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nWithdrawn\n*Bill Bradley\nThere was also an uncommitted option.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Colorado Democratic presidential primary\n!
