The party was established on 22 February 1997 in Sofia.

Two deputies from the Bulgarian Business Bloc joined the BEL in February 1998. The party was part of the opposition in the National Assembly.\nIn 1998, the coalition voted to convert itself into a party, establishing a National Council to lead it.\nIn 2000, BEL formed into a new party, BSDE.\nThis new party competed in the 2001 election, and failed to win any seats alongside minor party allies. and following the election, a split off party from the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party, the Bulgarian United Social Democratic Party led by Valkana Todorova, merged into BSDE.\nAlliances\nRose Coalition (2005)\nIn the 2005 election, the party took part in the election in the Rose Coalition.
