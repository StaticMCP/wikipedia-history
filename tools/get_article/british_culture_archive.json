Its archive, online galleries and exhibitions have a strong emphasis on 20th-century social documentary photography and images of cultural importance. In 2021 the organisation set up [https://britishculturearchive.co.uk/bca-21/ BCA21] which highlights 21st Century documentary photography. BCA has exhibited in London, Manchester and Berlin. Its [https://britishculturearchive.co.uk/thepeoplesarchive/ People's Archive] offshoot crowdsources images of everyday life in Britain from the 1930s to 2000.\nDetails\nThe British Culture Archive was founded by Paul Wright in 2017. It was established to ensure that photographs capturing the social fabric of the UK—often overlooked by traditional institutions—are preserved and accessible to future generations. It highlights images from both professional and amateur photographers, emphasising themes of community, resilience, and cultural identity, with a focus on working-class history and British subculture and fashions of the 20th century.\nCollections and Themes\nThe archive’s extensive collection covers a diverse range of subjects, including:\nWorking-Class Life – Documentary Photography from working-class communities and industrial landscapes across the UK.\nYouth Subcultures – The rise of punk, mod, skinhead, rave, and other youth culture movements that shaped British identity.\nSocial Change – Documenting shifts in society, from post-industrial decline to political protests.\nRegional History – Showcasing communities from London to Glasgow, capturing the unique character of different regions.\nPhotographers and Contributions\nThe British Culture Archive showcases work from renowned documentary photographers. Contributors include Peter J Walsh, known for his images of Manchester’s club and rave scene, Peter Mitchell's celebrated colour photography of Leeds, and social documentary photographer Tish Murtha who documented marginalised communities and working class life in Newcastle upon Tyne. The archive also welcomes photography by others whose work documents social change in British society but has not been widely seen. An example of the latter is Heidi Alexander's photographs of Stockport.\nImpact and Legacy\nThe archive has gained recognition for championing British documentary photography and ensuring that ordinary people’s experiences are not forgotten. It has been featured in international publications and continues to grow through its exhibition and publishing programmes, cementing its place as a vital resource for historians, photographers, and cultural enthusiasts.\nExhibitions\n*British Culture Archive, The Social, London, November 2019 – January 2020.
