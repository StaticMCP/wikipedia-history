It was founded in 1986 and provides education from Kindergarten through to Year 12.\nHistory\nIn 1983, members of the Presbyterian Church in Warrnambool began discussing the possibility of establishing a Christian school for the local community. The school was registered in August 1984 as 'Warrnambool Presbyterian School Ltd'. The following year the Balmoral Road location was purchased for A$93,000.\nIn 1986, King's College opened, using a small room they had rented in town. Initially, there were 19 students. The year after, they moved to the Balmoral Road site, where some portable classrooms were set up and the first building, a toilet block, was constructed. There were 26 students that year.\n1990 saw the appointment of King's College's first principal, Peter Bosker. There were 106 students enrolled that year. Bosker served as principal for 3 years with Neil Benfell later taking over. Benfell was not new to the school, however, as the founding of the school is largely attributed to him.\nIn 1997, King's College began to offer preschool classes, and in 1998, they began to branch into secondary schooling. This involved an initial class of Year 7s in 1998, who became the first of each year level as they progressed through. This meant that the first Year 12s graduated from King's College in December 2003.\nIan McKay took over as principal from 2011 to 2016, when Neil Benfell retired after almost two decades.\nIn 2017, Allister Rouse was appointed Principal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://kings.vic.edu.au// Website]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kings-College-Warrnambool/155821531235380/ Facebook]"
