As one saying went: \"\" (\"Uruguay is the cow and the port\"). Wool production boomed in the 19th century.\nHowever, when world market prices for Uruguay's main export commodities like beef and wool fell drastically in the 1950s, the country's prosperous golden era came to an end.\nProduction\nIn 2018, the country produced 1.36 million tons of rice, 1.33 million tons of soy, 816 thousand tons of maize, 637 thousand tons of barley, 440 thousand tons of wheat, 350 thousand tons of sugar cane, 106 thousand tons of orange, 104 thousand tons of grape, 90 thousand tons of rapeseed, 87 thousand tons of potato, 76 thousand tons of sorghum, 71 thousand tons of tangerine, 52 thousand tons of oats, 48 thousand tons of apple, in addition to smaller yields of other agricultural products.\nUruguay is also a major meat producer. In 2018, it produced 589 thousand tons of beef.\nContemporary agricultural contribution to Uruguayan economy\nToday, agriculture still contributes roughly 10% to the country's GDP and is the main foreign exchange earner, putting Uruguay in line with other agricultural exporters like Brazil, Canada and New Zealand. Uruguay is a member of the Cairns Group of exporters of agricultural products. Uruguay's agriculture has relatively low inputs of labour, technology and capital in comparison with other such countries, which results in comparatively lower yields per hectare but also opens the door for Uruguay to market its products as \"natural\" or \"ecological.\"\nCampaigns like “Uruguayan grass-fed beef” and “Uruguay Natural” aim to establish Uruguay as a premium brand in beef, wine and other food products.\nEstancia tourism\nA heartland of historic estancias : Estancia San Eugenio, Casupá, southern department of Flórida\nEstancia tourism is based upon traditional, historical elements of Uruguay and the remaining resources of the historic ranches (estancias) from Uruguay's \"Golden Era\".\nSee also\n* Cairns Group#Uruguay Round\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.estancias-uruguay.com Estancia Tourism in Uruguay]\n*[http://www.uruguaycountryinformation.com agriculture related data and maps]"
