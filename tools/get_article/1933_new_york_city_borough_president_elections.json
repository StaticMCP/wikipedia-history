Republicans or Fusionists won Queens, Brooklyn, and Richmond, while Democrats retained office in Manhattan and The Bronx. This gave mayor-elect Fiorello H. La Guardia control of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## 1933 New York City Borough President elections\n\n#REDIRECT 1933 New York City borough president elections\n}}"
