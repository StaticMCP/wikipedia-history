Gray, 1861)\n| synonyms =Locustella fasciolata\n}}\n'''Gray's grasshopper warbler (Helopsaltes fasciolatus), also known as Gray's warbler', is a species of bird in the family Locustellidae; it was formerly included in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage.\nThe Sakhalin grasshopper warbler was formerly considered conspecific.\nDistribution and habitat\nThis small passerine bird breeds in southern Siberia, northeastern China and Korea. It is migratory, wintering in southeast Asia.  It is a species found in lowland and coastal regions, nesting in forests or thickets.\nDescription\nThe adult has an unstreaked olive-brown back, uniformly grey breast and buff underparts, with unmottled dull orange undertail coverts.\nThe song is a short phrase, loud and distinctive; nothing like the insect-like reeling of European Locustella'' species, and more musical than that of Pallas's grasshopper warbler.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Gray's Grasshopper Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Gray's grasshopper warbler\n}}"
