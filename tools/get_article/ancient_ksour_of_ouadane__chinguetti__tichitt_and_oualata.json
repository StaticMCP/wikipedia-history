These cities were founded around the 11th century as stopping places for the caravans of the Trans-Saharan trade crossing the Sahara.\nOnce prosperous centres of Saharan culture, these cities survive today with many difficulties, not only due to the radical transformation of the trade routes, but above all because of the advancing sands of the desert.\n|places=\n}}\nReferences"
