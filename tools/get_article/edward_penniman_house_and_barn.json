Penniman was attracted by the profits to be made as a whaler, so he ran to sea at age eleven and became master of his own whaling ship by age 29. He took his wife with him on his travels, which lasted up to four years.\nPenniman retired in 1868 and built this house with plans that he designed himself, including a modern toilet and bath with hot running water.\nIrma Knowles Penniman Broun sold the Penniman estate to the Cape Cod National Seashore.\nNational Park Service\nThe house is now on the Fort Hill Trail, which is kept up by the National Park Service.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Cape Cod National Seashore\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Barnstable County, Massachusetts\nReferences\n* Fort Hill Trail map and guide [https://web.archive.org/web/20090901121536/http://www.nps.gov/caco/planyourvisit/upload/FortHillcolor.pdf]\n* Teaching with Historic Places entry for Penniman house [https://web.archive.org/web/20080528030535/http://www.nps.gov/history/nR/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/112penniman/112penniman.htm]"
