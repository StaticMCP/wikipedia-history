For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n4 & 5 Eliz. 2\nContinuing the first session of the 41st Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 7 June 1955 until 5 November 1956.\nPublic general acts\nand for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  and the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act, 1937, with respect to escapes from the care of fit persons, from approved schools and from remand homes or special reception centres.|note4= }}\n|  and the Therapeutic Substances (Prevention of Misuse) Acts, 1947 to 1953.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and the National Insurance Act (Northern Ireland) 1946, or of member of an appeal tribunal constituted in pursuance of the National Assistance Act (Northern Ireland) 1948.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  and rules under the Indictments Act, 1915. }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and 1924, the Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1944 and 1947, the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1952, and the Second Schedule to the Pensions (India, Pakistan and Burma) Act, 1955.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  are to be made in respect of earnings.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and 1952; to extend the definition of a child for the purposes of those Acts, the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts, 1946 to 1954, and the National Insurance Acts, 1946 to 1955; to amend the provisions of the said Acts of 1946 to 1954 and 1946 to 1955 with respect to benefits payable to widows; to validate certain marriages for the purposes of the Acts aforesaid; to make provision with respect to reciprocal arrangements with other countries in connection with family allowances; to authorise a local authority to whose care a person has been committed by an order of any court under the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, or the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act, 1937, to entrust the care and control of that person to a parent, guardian, relative or friend; to permit such a person to be treated as included in a family for the purposes of family allowances while the control of that person is so entrusted; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  the Teachers (Superannuation) Acts, 1918 to 1946, and so much of the Education (Scotland) Acts, 1939 to 1953, as relates to superannuation and to the employment of teachers over the age of sixty-five years; and for purposes connected therewith.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  relating to the disposal by the British Transport Commission of the property held by them for the purposes of the existing road haulage undertaking (including the provisions as to the transport levy and the Transport Fund), to extend certain enactments relating to holding companies to the British Transport Commission, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  with respect to the payment of Exchequer Grants to local authorities in Scotland and with respect to the apportionment of the expenditure of joint bodies among their constituent authorities; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and the dissolution of that Court; to provide for conferring on the first-mentioned court jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from the courts of colonies which are not for the time being included in the federation and to repeal the British Honduras (Court of Appeal) Act, 1881; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  or the London Government Act, 1939. }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1953; to provide for the appointment of additional judges of the High Court and of the Court of Session; and for other purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.}}\n|  the statute law of England and Wales relating to sexual crimes, to the abduction, procuration and prostitution of women and to kindred offences, and to make such adaptations of statutes extending beyond England and Wales as are needed in consequence of that consolidation.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  in its application to the said Commissioners, and to make new provision as to the annual report of the said Commissioners; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  and other enactments relating thereto; to amend the Registered Designs Act, 1949, with respect to designs related to artistic works in which copyright subsists, and to amend the Dramatic and Musical Performers' Protection Act, 1925; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  and certain other enactments relating to education in Scotland and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to Greenock Burgh Extension &c.|po1=Greenock Burgh Extension, &c.
