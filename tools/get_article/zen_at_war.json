      "text": "# Zen at War\n\nZen at War is a book written by Brian Daizen Victoria, first published in 1997. The second edition appeared in 2006.\nContents\nThe book meticulously documents Zen Buddhism's support of Japanese militarism from the time of the Meiji Restoration through the World War II and the post-War period. It describes the influence of state policy on Buddhism in Japan, and particularly the influence of Zen on the military of the Empire of Japan. A famous quote is from Harada Daiun Sogaku: \"[If ordered to] march: tramp, tramp, or shoot: bang, bang. This is the manifestation of the highest Wisdom [of Enlightenment]. The unity of Zen and war of which I speak extends to the farthest reaches of the holy war [now under way].\"\nThe book also explores the actions of Japanese Buddhists who opposed the growth of militarism.\nThe 2006 edition of Zen at War was followed by Zen War Stories, which further explores the intimate relationship between Japanese institutional Buddhism and militarism during World War II.\nSources\nVictoria draws from his own study of original Japanese documents, but also uses the publications of Ichikawa Hakugen, a Rinzai-priest and a scholar who taught at Hanazono University in Tokyo. Hakugen's work, in Japanese, include:\n* 1967 Zen and Contemporary Thought (Zen to Gendai Shiso)\n* 1970 The War Responsibility of Buddhists (Bukkyosha no Senso Sekinin)\n* 1975 Religion Under Japanese Fascism (Nihon Fashizumu Ka no Shukyo)\n* 1977 Buddhism During the War (Senji Ka no Bukkyo)\nHakugen himself had been \"a strong advocate of Japan's 'holy war'\": \"And I should not forget to include myself as one of those modern Japanese Buddhist who did these things. \"\nHakugen points to twelve characteristics of Japanese Zen which have contributed to its support for Japanese militarism:\n# Subservience of Buddhism to the state.\n# Buddhist views on humanity and society. Though \"Buddhism emphasizes the equality of human beings based on their possession of a Buddha nature\"; the doctrine of karma has also been used as a \"moral justification for social inequality\".\n# Protection of the state and the hierarchical social structures.\n# Emphasis on śūnyatā and selflessness, \"leaving no room for the independence of the individual\".\n# Lack of Buddhist dogma, which left no \"compelling basic dogma a believer would fight to preserve\".\n# The concept of on, \"the teaching that a debt of gratitude is owed to those from whom favors are received\". In the case of Japanese Zen, this gratitude was also owed to the Emperor, as \"the head of the entire Japanese family\".\n# The belief in mutual dependency, which \"led in modern Japan to an organic view of the state coupled with a feeling of intimacy towards it\".\n# The doctrine of the Middle Way, which \"took the form of a constant search for compromise with the aim of avoiding confrontation before it occurred\".\n# The tradition of ancestor veneration, in which \"the entire nation came to be regarded as one large family in which loyalty between subject and sovereign was the chief virtue\".\n# The value given to \"old and mature things\". Since society was based \"on a set of ancient and immutable laws\", opposition to this was unacceptable.\n# Emphasis on inner peace, which \"contributed to its failure to encourage and justify the will to reorganize society\".\n# The Buddhist logic of soku, \"just as it is\", which leads to \"a static, aesthetic perspective, a detached, subjective harmony with things\".\nHakugen saw D. T. Suzuki as \"most responsible for the development of imperial-way Zen\", but in no way standing alone in this development. Hakugen traces this development to pre-meiji developments:\n}}\nResponses\nThe book drew a lot of attention, and mixed responses.\nProfessor Kemmyo Taira Sato, Director of Three Wheels Shin Buddhist Temple and former pupil of D. T. Suzuki, wrote :\n}}\nRobert Aitken, zen teacher and social activist, wrote :\n}}\nTon Lathouwers, Chán-teacher in the Netherlands, in relation to Zen at War mentions Hisamatsu's impossible question, \"What will you do when you cannot do anything, when all your best intentions and great endeavour are invested to no avail whatsoever, when all you do is doomed to fail?\", relating it to a statement by Takeo Sato:\n}}\nApologies\nIn response to Zen at War, Ina Buitendijk started a campaign to receive apologies from leading parties within the Japanese Zen-schools:  It had never occurred to her that the Zen masters, whom she deeply respected, would ever glorify the waging of war.}}}}\nHer campaign resulted in responses from Kubota Ji'un, third abbot of the Sanbo Kyodan, Hirata Seiko, and Hosokawa, abbot of Myoshin-ji.\nKubota Ji'un writes:\n}}\nHirata Seiko writes:\n}}\nCriticism\nBrian Victoria's book has also been harshly criticized.\nKemmyō Taira Sato states that Victoria's criticism of D. T. Suzuki is misplaced since he did not support Japanese militarism in his writings :\n}}\nVictoria himself quotes critical remarks by Suzuki on the war and the support given to it by the Zen-institutions: \"[T]hey diligently practiced the art of self-preservation through their narrow-minded focus on 'pacifying and preserving the state'.\"\nMuhō Noelke, a German-born Zen monk in the Sōtō Zen tradition, states that Victoria has mistranslated texts from Kōdō Sawaki, who was a prominent Japanese Sōtō Zen teacher in the 20th century.\nFurther studies\nThe issues of Japanese nationalism, individualism, and the justification of social inequality have been taken up by other authors as well.\nJapanese nationalism\nIn 1995, the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture published Rude Awakenings. Zen, the Kyoto School, and the question of nationalism, which \"examines the relationship between Japanese nationalism and intellectuals in the Kyoto school and the world of Zen.\" It places the development of the Kyoto school, and its alleged support for the Japanese militarism, in the larger context of the Meiji-restoration.\nRobert H. Sharf contributed to this volume, as a sequel to his The Zen of Japanese Nationalism, in which he extensively investigates the support of the Zen-institutions for the Imperial State, and the backgrounds of this support.\nNam-lin Hur has described the support of the Sōtō for the occupation of Korea in the beginning of the 20th century.\nIndividualism\nPeek argues that individualism, contrary to popular notions, is inherently supported by Buddhism. This inherent support made it possible to effect a transmission from authoritarian imperialism to democracy:\n}}\nSocial inequality\nThe Soto-school has taken up the issue of social inequality. According to Bodiford, the Soto-school has insisted that \"the types of social discrimination found in Sõtõ rituals and temple practices\" find their origin in \"the medieval institutional regulations imposed by the Tokugawa regime, not in the religious attitudes, religious practices, or religious mission of Sõtõ Zen itself\". The Soto-school has installed a Human Rights Division, to terminate the regulations which contribute to discriminatory practices.\nEnlightenment and authority\nZen at War has contributed to discussions on the meaning of \"enlightenment\", and the role of Zen-teachers in the emerging western Zen-Buddhism. Bodhin Kjolhede, dharma heir of Philip Kapleau, says:\n}}\nStuart Lachs has written several essays on this issue, connected to teacher-scandals in western sanghas. The issue has been taken up by others as well.\nSee also\n* Shinbutsu Bunri\n* State Shinto\n* Buddhist modernism\n* Buddhism and violence\nNotes\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n; Online\n*\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n}}\n*\n| archive-date = 2014-09-29\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140929075114/http://research.nichibun.ac.jp/en/researcher/staff/s118/index.html\n| url-status = dead\n}}\nFurther reading\n* Daniel A.
