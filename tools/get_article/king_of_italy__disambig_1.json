The first to take the title was Odoacer, a barbarian warlord, in the late 5th century, followed by the Ostrogothic kings up to the mid-6th century. With the Frankish conquest of Italy in the 8th century, the Carolingians assumed the title, which was maintained by subsequent Holy Roman Emperors throughout the Middle Ages. The last Emperor to claim the title was Charles V in the 16th century. During this period, the holders of the title were crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy.\nA Kingdom of Italy was restored from 1805 to 1814 with Napoleon as its only king, centred in Northern Italy. It was not until the Italian unification in the 1860s that an independent Kingdom of Italy covering the entire Italian Peninsula was restored. From 1861 the House of Savoy held the title of King of Italy until the last king, Umberto II, was exiled in 1946 when Italy became a republic.\nHistory\nAfter the deposition of the last Western Emperor in 476, Odoacer was appointed Dux Italiae (Duke of Italy) by the reigning Byzantine Emperor Zeno. Later, the Germanic foederati, the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, proclaimed Odoacer  ('King of Italy). In 493, the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great killed Odoacer, and set up a new dynasty of kings of Italy. Ostrogothic rule ended when Italy was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in 552.\nIn 568, the Lombards entered the peninsula and ventured to recreate a barbarian kingdom in opposition to the Empire, establishing their authority over much of Italy, except the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchies of Rome, Venetia, Naples and the southernmost portions. In the 8th century, estrangement between the Italians and the Byzantines allowed the Lombards to capture the remaining Roman enclaves in northern Italy. However, in 774, they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who deposed their king and took up the title \"king of the Lombards\". After the death of Charles the Fat in 887, Italy fell into instability and a number of kings attempted to establish themselves as independent Italian monarchs. During this period, known as the Feudal Anarchy (888–962), the title Rex Italicorum (\"King of the Italians\" or \"King of the Italics\") was introduced. After the breakup of the Frankish Empire, Otto I added Italy to the Holy Roman Empire and continued the use of the title Rex Italicorum. The last to use this title was Henry II (1004–1024). Subsequent emperors used the title \"King of Italy\" until Charles V. They were crowned in Pavia, Milan and Bologna.\nIn 1805, Napoleon was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at the Milan Cathedral. The next year, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II abdicated his imperial title. From the deposition of Napoleon (1814) until the unification of Italy (1861), there was no Italian monarch claiming the overarching title. The Risorgimento successfully established the House of Savoy dynasty over the whole peninsula and, uniting the kingdoms of Sardinia and the Two Sicilies, it formed the modern Kingdom of Italy. The monarchy was superseded by the Italian Republic, after a institutional referendum was held on 2 June 1946, after World War II. The Italian monarchy formally ended on 12 June of that year and Umberto II left the country.\nAs \"Kingdom of Odoacer\"\nInitially named Dux Italiae (Duke of Italy) by Zeno, the Roman Emperor in Constantinople, he later was recognized as King of Italy by the foederati in control of the Italian peninsula. He was deposed by the Ostrogoths, who established their own kingdom.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"15%\" | Image\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Life\n! width=\"15%\" | Coronation\n! width=\"15%\" | Ceased to be King\n|-\n|\n|Odoacer\n|c. 433 – 15 March 493 AD\n|4 September 476\n|15 March 493\n|}\nOstrogothic Kingdom (493–553)\nTheodoric the Great was invited by the emperor Zeno to take Italy from Odoacer and rule it in Zeno's name. He defeated Odoacer in 493, establishing a new kingdom in place of Odoacer's. Officially, the Ostrogothic kings ruled the Roman citizens in Italy as a viceroy of the Roman emperors, and their own Gothic people as their king, though functionally they ran their kingdom entirely independently from the Roman authority in Constantinople. Their greatest extent was during Theodoric's reign; as Roman Emperors from the east began to exert more power and retake control of Roman territory, the last Ostrogothic king fell to the Emperor Justinian in 553.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"15%\" | Image\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Life\n! width=\"15%\" | Coronation\n! width=\"15%\" | Ceased to be King\n|-\n|\n| Theodoric the Great\n| 454 – 30 August 526\n| 15 March 493\n| 30 August 526\n|-\n|\n| Athalaric\n| c. 516 – 2 October 534\n| 526\n| 2 October 534\n|-\n|\n| Queen Amalasuintha\n| 495 – 30 April 535\n| 2 October 534\n| 30 April 535\n|-\n|\n| Theodahad\n| c. 480 – December 536\n| 535\n| December 536\n|-\n|\n| Vitiges\n| ? – 542\n| 536\n| 540\n|-\n|\n| Ildibad\n| ? – 541\n| 540\n| 541\n|-\n|\n| Eraric\n| ? – 541\n| 541\n| 541\n|-\n|\n| Totila\n| ? – 1 July 552\n| 541\n| 1 July 552\n|-\n|\n| Teia\n| ? – 552/553\n| 552\n| 552/553\n|}\nInterregnum (527–578)\nByzantine Roman authority in Italy was briefly re-established under Justinian, though his gains were lost under his successor Justin II, after a new Germanic tribe, the Lombards, invaded from the north and established their kingdom in 568.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100% \"\n! width=\"15%\" |Image\n! width=\"15%\" |Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Life\n! width=\"15%\" |Coronation\n! width=\"15%\" |Ceased to be King\n|-\n|\n|Justinian I\n|482 – 14 November 565\n|1 April 527\n|14 November 565\n|-\n|\n|Justin II\n|?– 5 October 578\n|14 November 565\n|5 October 578\n|}\nKingdom of the Lombards (568–756)\nThe Lombards under Alboin established their kingdom in the extreme north of Italy in 568, gradually pushing the Byzantine Romans back from the peninsula until only the Exarchate of Ravenna remained under Roman control.

The last Lombard King of Italy, Desiderius, was deposed by his son-in-law Charlemagne, who folded it into the larger Carolingian Empire, which evolved over time into the Holy Roman Empire.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=\"15%\" | Image\n! width=\"15%\" | Name\n! width=\"15%\" | Life\n! width=\"15%\" | Coronation\n! width=\"15%\" | Ceased to be King\n|-\n|\n| Alboin\n| 530s – 28 June 572\n| 568\n| 572\n|-\n|\n| Cleph\n| ? – 574\n| 572\n| 574\n|-\n|\n| Rule of the Dukes (interregnum)\n| 574 – 584\n| 574\n| 584\n|-\n|\n| Authari\n| c. 550 – 5 September 590\n| 584\n| September 590\n|-\n|\n| Agilulf\n| c. 555 – April 616\n| 591\n| 616\n|-\n|\n| Adaloald\n| 602-628\n|\n| 626\n|-\n|\n| Arioald\n| ? – 636\n| 626\n| 636\n|-\n|\n| Rothari\n| 606 – 652\n| 636\n| 652\n|-\n|\n| Rodoald\n| 630– 653\n| 652\n| 653\n|-\n|\n| Aripert I\n| ? – 661\n| 653\n| 661\n|-\n|\n| Perctarit & Godepert\n| ? – 668\n| 661\n| 662\n|-\n|\n| Grimoald\n| 610 – 671\n| 662\n| 671\n|-\n|\n| Garibald\n| 655 - 671\n| 671\n| 671\n|-\n|\n| Perctarit (restored)\n| ? – 688\n| 671\n| 688\n|-\n|\n| Alahis\n| 680 – 689\n| 688\n| 689\n|-\n|\n| Cunincpert\n| ? – 700\n| 689\n| 700\n|-\n|\n| Liutpert\n| ?– 702\n| 700\n| 701\n|-\n|\n| Raginpert\n| ? - 701\n| 701\n| 701\n|-\n|\n| Aripert II\n| ? – 712\n| 701\n| 712\n|-\n|\n| Ansprand\n| 657 -712\n| 712\n| 712\n|-\n|\n| Liutprand\n| 680 – 744\n| 712\n| 744\n|-\n|\n| Hildeprand\n| ?- 744\n| 744\n| 744\n|-\n|\n| Ratchis\n| ? – 749\n| 744\n| 749\n|-\n|\n| Aistulf\n| ? – 756\n| 749\n| 756\n|-\n|\n| Desiderius\n|  –\n| 756\n| 774\n|}\nKingdom of Italy (781–962)\nCarolingian Dynasty (774–887)\nCharlemagne ruled over northern Italy as King of the Lombards.

In 952, Berengar and Adalbert became his vassals but remained kings until being deposed by Otto.\nHoly Roman Empire (962–1556)\nOtto is considered to be the founding emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy was considered one of the constituent realms of the Empire. Beginning in the 12th century, states such as the Republic of Venice and the Papal States captured more and more territory from the Kingdom of Italy, and the Empire's territory on the Peninsula shrunk over time. After Charles V, the emperors stopped being crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy and the Italian title fell into disuse. Imperial control in Italy receded to Trent and South Tyrol until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806. Southern Italy had never been part of the Holy Roman Empire; it remained initially under the control of various Byzantine fiefs until the Norman Kingdom of Sicily (later the Kingdom of Naples) took control of the area in the 11th century. Central Italy, along the Rome-Ravenna axis, was part of the Papal States, under the direct personal rule of the pope. The Duke of Savoy was de jure a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor, with the Duke being Prince and Perpetual Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire.\nOttonian dynasty (962–1024)\n{| width=90% class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Habsburg emperors claimed the Italian crown until 1801. The empire continued to include Italian territories until its dissolution in 1806.\nKingdom of Italy as a client state of France, House of Bonaparte (1805–1814)\nIn 1805, Napoleon established a client state in northern Italy, named the Kingdom of Italy. He established himself as King of Italy, in personal union with his role as Emperor of the French. This client state did not survive the end of the Napoleonic era; in its place, the Congress of Vienna established a number of independent duchies and kingdoms in the region.\n{| width=90% class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=8% | Image\n! width=8% | Coat of Arms\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=8% | Life\n! width=8% | Coronation\n! width=8% | Ceased to be King\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"| Napoleon I\n| align=\"center\"| 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821\n| align=\"center\"| 17 March 1805\n| align=\"center\"| 11 April 1814\n|}\nFull title\nThis title is present in Italian laws proclaimed by Napoleon I:\n[Name], by the Grace of God and the Constitutions, Emperor of the French and King of Italy.\nKingdom of Italy, House of Savoy (1861–1946)\nDuring and after the Revolutions of 1848, sentiment on the peninsula grew for the establishment of a unified Italian kingdom. Southern Italy had not been united with northern Italy since the early medieval period, being mostly under the rule of the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Northern Italy, in the early 19th century, came under the domination of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which besides its namesake island, also ruled the expansive Piedmont and Savoy regions along the French-Italian borderlands. The formerly republican leader in southern Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi, made common cause with the House of Savoy to overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and the people voted in a plebiscite to join Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861; the Papal States and the city of Rome were annexed to the Kingdom in 1870, completing the Unification of Italy. This kingdom lasted until the aftermath of World War II, when the 1946 Italian institutional referendum ended the monarchy.\n{| width=90% class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=8% | Image\n! width=8% | Coat of Arms\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=8% | Life\n! width=8% | Became King\n! width=8% | Ceased to be King\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"| Victor Emmanuel II\n| align=\"center\"| 14 March 1820 – 9 January 1878\n| align=\"center\"| 17 March 1861\n| align=\"center\"| 9 January 1878\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"| Umberto I\n| align=\"center\"| 14 March 1844 – 29 July 1900\n| align=\"center\"| 9 January 1878\n| align=\"center\"| 29 July 1900\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"| Victor Emmanuel III\n| align=\"center\"| 11 November 1869 – 28 December 1947\n| align=\"center\"| 29 July 1900\n| align=\"center\"| 9 May 1946\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"| Umberto II\n| align=\"center\"| 15 September 1904 – 18 March 1983\n| align=\"center\"| 9 May 1946\n| align=\"center\"| 12 June 1946\n|}\nFull title\nUp until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1946, the full titles of the Kings of the Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946) were:\n}}\nSee also\n* King of Jerusalem\n* List of kings of the Lombards\n* List of monarchs of Naples\n* List of monarchs of Sardinia\n* List of Sicilian monarchs\n* List of monarchs of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia\n* List of monarchs of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n* List of rulers of Tuscany\n* List of popes\n* List of viceroys of Naples\n* List of viceroys of Sicily\n* List of Italian queens\nNotes"
