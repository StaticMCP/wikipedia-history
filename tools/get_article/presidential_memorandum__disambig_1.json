It has the force of law and is usually used to delegate tasks, direct specific government agencies to do something, or to start a regulatory process. There are three types of presidential memoranda: presidential determination or presidential finding, memorandum of disapproval, and hortatory memorandum.\nSometimes used interchangeably, an executive order is a more prestigious form of executive action that must cite the specific constitutional or statutory authority the president has to use it. Unlike executive orders, memoranda are not required by law to be published in the Federal Register, but publication is necessary in order to have \"general applicability and legal effect\". The Federal Register gives publication priority to executive orders and presidential proclamations over memoranda. Memoranda can be amended or rescinded by executive orders or another memorandum, but executive orders take legal precedence and cannot be changed by a memorandum.\nHistory\nIn the past, presidential memoranda have been referred to as presidential letters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!President\n!Number Issued\n|-\n|Barack Obama\n|644\n|-\n|Donald Trump ()\n|167\n|}\nPresidential determination\nPresidential determination, or presidential finding, are memoranda required by a statute and must be issued before certain actions are taken. For example, a presidential determination on the status of a country must be released before sanctions are imposed on the country.\nMemorandum of disapproval\nA memorandum of disapproval is a public veto statement.\nHortatory memorandum\nA hortatory memorandum is issued as a broad policy statement, but unlike a presidential proclamation is directed to executive agencies.\nNational security presidential memorandum\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump issued the national security directives under the name of \"national security presidential memorandums\". They operate like executive orders, but are only in the area of national security. They date back to President Harry S. Truman and have been issued by various presidents under different names.\nSee also\n*Executive order (United States)\n*Presidential directive\n*Presidential proclamation\n* Memorandum of conversation\nReferences"
