He is notable for his academic work on terrestrial slugs and Isopoda and on economic biology.\nEarly life and education\nCollinge was born in Huddersfield. He undertook his first degree at Leeds University before becoming a demonstrator in zoology at the University of St Andrews  in 1891.\nCareer\nCollinge was a lecturer in zoology and comparative anatomy at Birmingham University when it was founded in 1900. He was director of the Cooper Research Laboratory and edited the first volume of its journal in 1909. From 1915–1919 he returned to St. Andrew's as the Carnegie Research Fellow at the Gatty Marine Laboratory. He became Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum in March 1921 and stayed in this post until his retirement in March 1941. During his tenure at the Yorkshire Museum, Collinge devoted much of his academic attention to the economic aspects of ornithology.\nCollinge was a member of many learned societies. He was a member of the British Numismatic Society, a 'foreign member' of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, Honorary Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, joint secretary of the Association of Economic Biologists, and a member of the British Ornithologists' Union. He was a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society, the Linnean Society and the Society of Antiquaries of London, and had served as president of the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\nBinominal authority\nCollinge identified several species as new to science, including Arion flagellus, Cryptosemelus gracilis, and Microparmarion pollonerai.\nTwo species are named in honour of Collinge, Clanculus collingei and Streptaxis collingei.\nPublications\n*Collinge, W.
