The fund was established in 1995.\nThe fund maintains databases of property, including the Art Database of the National Fund, held in the Wiener Stadtbibliothek.\nGeneral Settlement Fund\nThe General Settlement Fund is constituted to seek to compensate victims of Nazi persecution from all of the persecuted minorities, religious, cultural, ethnic, handicapped, and those who left Austria in order to escape persecution.  The claim for compensation passes to the heirs of the original victims on their death.\nApplications to the General Settlement Fund closed in May 2003.\nOn 26 April 2022, the Board of Trustees determined that the General Settlement Fund had \"completely fulfilled its tasks\" and was dissolved.\nNational Fund\nThe National Fund is different from the General Fund in that it has different eligibility criteria and there is, in January 2009, no deadline for filing applications.\nBibliography\n* Renate S.
