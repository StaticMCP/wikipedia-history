The rivalry dates back to the men's basketball teams playing in 1911 and has since grown into a multi-sport rivalry, and one of the largest intra-city college rivalries in New York City.\nManhattan play in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, and Fordham play in the Atlantic 10 Conference.\nHistory\nThe history of the rivalry dates back to the 1911-12 NCAA basketball season when the Fordham Rams men's basketball and Manhattan Jaspers men's basketball programs squared off. The game was won by Manhattan 20–19, who would dominate the men's basketball series through the remainder of the 1910s. The series between the two basketball programs swayed over the course of the 20th century, with Manhattan dominating the series in the 1930s, 1950, and 1970s; while Fordham dominated the series in the 1920s and 1980s. The men's basketball series of the rivalry given it century-long longevity has been called one of the most storied rivalries in men's college basketball. The rivalry received extensive coverage in 2011 when they met for the 100th year.\nIn describing the rivalry former Manhattan guard, Tyler Wilson, said \"You always have to play a team that's in your city. You always want to beat those teams &mdash; want to feel like you're the best team in your area.\" Chuba Ohams of Fordham said \"It's gonna be fun, competitive &mdash; you know we're gonna play hard, go at each other.\"\nThe rivalry has expanded beyond men's basketball to include all sports programs that both Fordham and Manhattan sponsor. The women's basketball teams have played each other 50 times in their history, with their rivalry dating back to the 1980s.\nSeries table\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
