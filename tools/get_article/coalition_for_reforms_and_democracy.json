The members of the coalition are the Orange Democratic Movement, the Wiper Democratic Movement, FORD–Kenya, Kenya Social Congress, KADU–Asili, the Peoples Democratic Party, the Mkenya Solidarity Movement, Chama Cha Uzalendo, the Muungano Party, the United Democratic Movement, Chama Cha Mwananchi, and the Federal Party of Kenya Following the hotly-contested elections that saw the Jubilee Alliance win, CORD filed a petition contesting the results. The Supreme Court rejected CORD's petition and declared the Jubilee candidate Uhuru Kenyatta president-elect.\nCORD was the official opposition party in Kenya for the 2013 elections. It had broad support in Kenya with roughly 50% of the electorate.\nThe coalition was dissolved in the period leading up to the 2017 elections as part of the creation of the National Super Alliance.\nReferences"
