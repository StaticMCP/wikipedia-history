The album mainly consists of cover songs of country songs from the 1950s through the 1970s, as done by then-contemporary country music artists.\nContent\n\"Same Old Train\", the only song on the album which is not a cover, charted at number 59 on Billboard Hot Country Songs in 1998. The song won the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals.\nJoe Diffie's rendition of Charlie Rich's \"Behind Closed Doors\" also charted at number 64, and Doug Stone's cover of Steve Wariner's \"Gone Out of My Mind\" peaked at number 48. The album was intended as a fundraiser for a retirement center in Nashville, Tennessee.\nCritical reception\nJana Pendragon of AllMusic rated the album four out of five stars. Although she criticized Joe Diffie and Collin Raye's vocal performance on \"Honky Tonk Heroes Like Me\" and Mary Chapin Carpenter's on \"Oh Lonesome Me\", she praised the album for the variety of artists and thought that \"Same Old Train\" was a \"grand finale\". Joel Bernstein of Country Standard Time gave the album a mostly positive review, as he thought the album had potential to introduce country music standards to a more contemporary audience.\nTrack listing\n| note1        = The Chicks\n| extra1 = Blake Chancey, Paul Worley\n| length1       = 3:21\n| title2        = Mama Tried\n| writer2       = Merle Haggard\n| note2        = Randy Travis\n| extra2 = James Stroud, Travis\n| length2       = 2:15\n| title3        = Wine, Women, and Song\n| writer3       = Betty Sue Perry\n| note3        = Patty Loveless\n| extra3 = Vince Gill\n| length3       = 2:32\n| title4        = I Never Go Around Mirrors\n| writer4       =\n| note4        = Trace Adkins\n| extra4 = Adkins\n| length4       = 4:46\n| title5        = Oh Lonesome Me\n| writer5       = Don Gibson\n| note5        = Mary Chapin Carpenter\n| extra5 = Chet Atkins\n| length5       = 3:37\n| title6        = Behind Closed Doors\n| writer6       = Kenny O'Dell\n| note6        = Joe Diffie\n| extra6 = Diffie, Johnny Slate\n| length6       = 3:10\n| title7        = She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)\n| writer7       = Wayne Carson\n| note7       = Wade Hayes\n| extra7 = Don Cook\n| length7       = 3:34\n| title8       = 'Til I Can Make It on My Own\n| writer8       =\n| note8       = Martina McBride\n| extra8 = Worley, McBride\n| length8       = 3:10\n| title9        = Cold, Cold Heart\n| writer9       = Hank Williams\n| note9       = Collin Raye\n| extra9 = Worley, Raye, Billy Joe Walker Jr.\n| length9       = 3:22\n| title10      = The Three Bells\n| writer10       =\n| note10      = Alison Krauss\n| extra10 = Atkins\n| length10       = 4:11\n| title11       = City Lights\n| writer11       = Bill Anderson\n| note11       = Rick Trevino\n|extra11 = Doug Johnson, Steve Buckingham\n| length11       = 2:44\n| title12        = Honky Tonk Heroes (Like Me)\n| writer12       = Billy Joe Shaver\n| note12        = Joe Diffie, Collin Raye\n| extra12 = Raye, Diffie\n| length12       = 3:30\n| title13        = Gone Out of My Mind\n| writer13       =\n| note13        = Doug Stone\n| extra13 = Jerry Kennedy, John Guess\n| length13       = 3:26\n| title14      = Same Old Train\n| writer14       = Stuart\n| note14        = Clint Black, Joe Diffie, Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Patty Loveless, Earl Scruggs, Ricky Skaggs, Marty Stuart, Pam Tillis, Randy Travis, Travis Tritt, Dwight Yoakam\n| extra14 = Stuart\n| length14       = 6:00\n| total_length  =49:38\n}}\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1998)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
