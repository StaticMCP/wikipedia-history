Its name is of Polish origin and comes from the word twardy/twarda, which means \"hard\". The local parish church of Saint Margaret was first mentioned in 1305. Later on, the village was also part of Bohemia (Czechia), Prussia, and Germany. In 1885, Twardawa had a population of 780. In 1936, during a massive Nazi campaign of renaming of placenames, the village was renamed to Hartenau to erase traces of Polish origin.\nDuring World War II, the Germans operated the E255 forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the village. After the defeat of Germany in the war, in 1945, the village became again part of Poland and its historic name was restored.\nTransport\nThere is a train station in Twardawa, and the Polish National road 40 also passes through the village.\nNotable people\n*  (1954–2016), Polish footballer\nSee also\n* Prudnik Land\nReferences"
