      "text": "# Draft:King Yah\n\n----\nDisclosure\nI am the subject of the draft article Draft:King Yah. I am contributing with the intent to follow all Wikipedia guidelines, including neutrality, verifiability, and notability. I welcome editor feedback and will revise accordingly.\nKing Yah (born Thaddis Johnson Jr.) is an American rapper, activist, and spiritual teacher from Fresno, California. Known for his prophetic lyricism, biblical insight, and politically charged storytelling, King Yah rose to prominence during the 2020 Save Our Children movement, which brought global attention to child trafficking and media censorship.\nIn 2021, he made headlines after entering the U.S. Capitol and was later pardoned by former President Donald Trump following the completion of his probation. King Yah’s music blends deep theology, historical research, and poetic aggression—garnering respect from both the conscious hip-hop community and truth-seeking believers. He has collaborated with artists including Daylyt, Dizzy Wright, and fellow Fresno native Fashawn.\nHis discography includes albums like Heaven is Near, Captive in Babylon, The Renaissance, and Path to Paradise—works that chronicle both personal redemption and societal reckoning.\nReferences"
