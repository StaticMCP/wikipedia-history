The book was written in 1993 by Gene Sharp (1928–2018), a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts. The book has been published in many countries worldwide and translated into more than 30 languages. Editions in many languages are also published by the Albert Einstein Institution of Boston, Massachusetts.  its current primary English-language edition is the Fourth United States Edition, published in May 2010.\nThe book has been circulated worldwide and cited repeatedly as influencing movements such as the Arab Spring of 2010–2012.\nOrigin\nFrom Dictatorship to Democracy (FDTD) was written in 1993 at the request of a prominent exiled Burmese democrat, Tin Maung Win, who was then editor of Khit Pyaing (The New Era Journal), in\nBangkok, Thailand. The book took several months to write as the author drew upon several decades of experience in scholarship on nonviolent action.\nFDTD was first published in 1993 as installments in Burmese and English in Khit Pyaing. In 1994, it was issued as a booklet in both English and Burmese. Since that time, there have been several additional English-language editions and translations into more than 30 additional languages.\nTopics covered\nFrom Dictatorship to Democracy contains a preface and ten sections.  Its first appendix includes 198 Methods Of Nonviolent Action that were taken from Gene Sharp's The Politics of Nonviolent Action (1973), Part Two, The Methods of Nonviolent Action. The main sections of the 4th US edition are entitled:\n:1. Facing Dictatorships Realistically\n:2. The Dangers of Negotiations\n:3. Whence Comes the Power?\n:4. Dictatorships Have Weaknesses\n:5. Exercising Power\n:6. The Need for Strategic Planning\n:7. Planning Strategy\n:8. Applying Political Defiance\n:9. Disintegrating the Dictatorship\n:10. Groundwork for Durable Democracy\nThree appendices are included in the fourth US edition of FDTD:\n:Appendix 1. The Methods of Nonviolent Action\n:Appendix 2. Acknowledgements and Notes on the History of From Dictatorship to Democracy\n:Appendix 3. A Note About Translations and Reprinting of this Publication\n:For Further Reading\nAppendix 3 gives a step-by-step procedure for effectively translating FDTD into other languages.\nInfluence\n, Feb. 2011.]]From Dictatorship to Democracy has been circulated worldwide and cited repeatedly as influencing movements such as the Arab Spring (pictured) in 2011. Sharp has stated that after FDTD was first written, \"although no efforts were made to promote the publication for use in other countries, translations and distribution of the publication began to spread on their own.... We usually do not know how awareness of this publication has spread from country to country.\"\nA CNN profile of Sharp in 2012 stated that FDTD had \"spread like a virus,\" calling it a \"viral pamphlet.\" The book \"started life in Myanmar as incendiary advice printed on a few sheets of paper and surreptitiously exchanged by activists living under a military dictatorship.\" Later it \"took on a life of its own... eventually, some say, inspiring the uprisings known as the Arab Spring.\"\nThe Pakistani Daily Times stated that FDTD \"has had an impact on the Arabic-speaking world even though the setting is in a non-Arabic world.\"\n{|style=\"float: right; width: 45%; border: 1px solid darkgray; margin: .46em; font-size: 85%;\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |'Non-English EditionsFrom Dictatorship to Democracy'\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|align=\"center\"|Language\n|&nbsp;Year&nbsp;\n|Information\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|Afan&nbsp;Oromo\n|2011\n|* (Ethiopia)\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|Amharic\n|2007\n|* (Ethiopia)\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|Arabic\n|2004, 2009\n|*  70p (2004);  (2009) Radwan Ziadeh (intro.), Khaled Dar Omar (trans.).

This owes a great deal to the strategic thinking of Gene Sharp, an American academic whose how-to-topple-your-tyrant manual, From Dictatorship to Democracy, is the bible of activists from Belgrade to Rangoon.\nThe BBC reported in 2004 that FDTD \"was used practically as a textbook\" in lectures attended by members of Otpor!, the Serbian resistance movement, in the year 2000.\nThe New York Times reported in 2011 that From Dictatorship to Democracy had been posted by the Muslim Brotherhood on its website during the 2011 Egyptian revolution.\nIn 2012, The New York Times noted that FDTD was \"available for download in more than two dozen languages\" (and provided a link), while describing Sharp as a \"leading [advocate] of grass-roots democracy.\"\nIn June 2015, the Financial Times reported that the Chinese government had tried to buy language rights to FDTD:\nFDTD has been reviewed in newspapers.\nIn 2015, 17 activistists were charged for an attempted coup d'état in Angola, and one of the proofs presented was the possession of the book FDTD.\nEditions\nThe book was first published in 1993 in installments in Burmese and English in Khit Pyaing in\nBangkok, Thailand. In 1994, it was issued as a booklet in both languages, with the\nassistance of the Committee for the Restoration of Democracy in Burma. Since that time, there have been several additional English-language editions. There have also been editions in at least 30 other languages (see table at right). The English-language editions include:\n* (79 pages)\n* (93 pages)\n* (93 pages)\n* (93 pages)\n* London: Housmans Bookshop.
