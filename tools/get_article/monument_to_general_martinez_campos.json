It lies on the centre of the Plaza de Guatemala, in El Retiro.\nHistory and description\nYears after some inconclusive lobbying by Antonio Berenguer and José Ibáñez Marín intending to promote the erection of a monument dedicated to Martínez Campos, the  resumed the initiative by organizing a popular subscription in 1904, succeeding in bringing on board many military officers. The project was awarded to Mariano Benlliure. The managing committee for the monument was constituted in 1905, with General Primo de Rivera as chairman.\nBenlliure worked simultaneously in this project and in the Castelar's project.\nA staircase pedestal made of white marble with 4 steps constitutes the base of the monument. A largely unpolished crag made of limestone from Tamajón lies on top of the marble plinth, creating the sense of being a natural feature.\nThe front side of the monument displays a war trophy cast in bronze consisting of two flags (cavalry and infantry) and additional wartime items, with an inscription carved above in the limestone reading  (\"to General Martínez Campos, model of patriots and soldiers, Spain\"). The right-hand side of the crag displays inscriptions compiling important military dates, namely ,  and . A relief carved in the limestone rock representing the battle of Castillejos extends across the left-hand and back sides of the crag, featuring an inscription in the marble below reading .\nThe right side and back side display another two additional plaques reading  (\"erected by voluntary national subscription, initiated on 5 December 1904 by the Marquis of Cabriñana\") and  (\"inaugurated by His Majesty King Alfonso XIII, 28 January 1907\").\nCast in bronze in Barcelona by Masriera & Campins' foundry, the equestrian statue of Martínez Campos top it all off.\nThe monument was unveiled on 28 January 1907, during a ceremony attended by Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie, and Antonio Maura, among others.\nThe Council of Government of the Community of Madrid declared the monument as bien de interés cultural in 2013.\nFile:Buen Retiro A Martinez Campos.jpg|View of the left-hand side\nFile:Madrid 2015 10 25 2960 (26521099895).jpg|Closer look of the general\nFile:Madrid 2015 10 25 2959 (26495163896).jpg|Detail of the war trophy\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
