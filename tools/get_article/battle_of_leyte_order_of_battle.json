This operation was the beginning of General Douglas MacArthur's fulfillment of his promise in March 1942 to the Filipino people that he would liberate them from  Japanese rule.\nThe choice of Leyte was the result of heated discussion at the highest levels of the US military and government. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest J. King had forcefully advocated for an invasion of the island of Formosa, about  north of the Philippines, insisting that it would both bolster the morale of the Nationalist Chinese, then fighting the Japanese occupation of their country, and provide a much closer base for military operations against the Japanese home islands. In the event, MacArthur's viewpoint that the United States needed to be seen as following through on its promise to liberate the Filipino people from Japanese oppression won out.\nSummary of US ground forces:\nUS Sixth Army\nLieutenant General Walter Krueger\nApprox. 202,500 total officers and enlisted\n: Northern landing area\n::  X Army Corps\n:: Lieutenant General Franklin C.
