The Chama Cha Mapinduzi (Party of the Revolution) is the country's dominant ruling party, and the longest reigning ruling party in Africa.\nIncumbent president and 2010 nominee Jakaya Kikwete is ineligible for re-election due to term limits. He is looking forward to his retirement, and has described the presidency as being both \"stressful and thankless\". Kikwete, who also serves as the party's National Chairman, said that he was not backing anyone as his preferred and chosen successor.\nMore than forty candidates (including 12 Cabinet Members) collected the nomination forms. On 12 July, Minister of Works John Magufuli was selected as the party's presidential nominee, and was most likely to win. He won the presidential election by 58.46%.\nBackground\ngrowth of 7%.]]\nDodoma Six\nIn February 2014, the CCM's Central Committee summoned and interrogated six prospective candidates at the party's headquarters in Dodoma; and banned them from engaging in premature campaigns for a period of twelve months. They were former Prime Ministers Frederick Sumaye and Edward Lowassa, Foreign Minister Bernard Membe, Minister Stephen Wasira, Deputy Minister January Makamba and former Minister William Ngeleja. The ban was further extended in March 2015, before being lifted on 22 May 2015.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates have been listed according to the dates that they expressed interest or formally
