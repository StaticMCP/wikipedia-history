He was forced to sign a letter of remorse and released three days later, while the funds were confiscated by authorities in Beijing.\nDonald Tsang attendance controversy\nIn June 2006, Szeto Wah and other participants recalled seeing Donald Tsang attend the event. Tsang, then the director of administration for the government, would have broken civil service rules by attending the concert. However, Tsang denied \"unequivocally\" he ever attended the event, stating that he had merely run into Szeto Wah after having dinner with his son at the Hong Kong Jockey Club. At the 2006 commemoration of the 1989 protests in Hong Kong, Fernando Cheung also claimed that Donald Tsang attended the concert, which Tsang again denied.\nSong list\nSee list on Chinese Wikipedia.\nSee also\n*Memorials for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre\n*June 4th Museum\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
