During this long span, the Ottomans transformed from a small Anatolian principality into a powerful, multi‑continental empire. Their military campaigns and administrative expansion carried them across the Balkans, Anatolia, the Middle East, and North Africa. By integrating diverse populations and projecting both land and naval power, they became one of the most formidable forces in Eurasian history.\nOverall\nThe Ottoman Empire (1299–1922) expanded over parts of Balkans, Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Eastern Europe, establishing one of the most enduring empires in world history. Its rise was marked by a combination of military conquest, strategic alliances, and administrative reforms.\nOver the centuries, the Ottomans built a highly organized military and bureaucratic system, enabling control over diverse populations and vast territories. They became a dominant naval and land power, participating in conflicts across Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and even Southeast Asia.\nThe empire's longevity was supported by its ability to integrate different cultures and religions under Ottoman rule, maintain trade routes between Europe and Asia, and adapt to changing geopolitical circumstances. By the height of its power in the 16th and 17th centuries, the empire spanned three continents and influenced politics, economics, and culture far beyond its borders.\nEurope\nThe son of Murad II, Mehmed the Conqueror, restructured both the state and military. On 29 May 1453, he captured Constantinople, bringing an end to the Byzantine Empire. Mehmed allowed the Eastern Orthodox Church to retain its autonomy and lands, provided it recognized Ottoman authority. Many Orthodox Christians preferred Ottoman rule over that of the Venetians. Albanian resistance remained a key barrier to Ottoman expansion in the Italian peninsula.\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the Ottoman Empire underwent a significant expansion period. Its economy thrived, controlling crucial overland trade routes connecting Europe and Asia.\nSultan Selim I (1512–1520) extended the eastern and southern frontiers by defeating Shah Ismail of Safavid Iran at the Battle of Chaldiran. He established Ottoman control in Egypt after defeating the Mamluks and created a Red Sea naval presence.\nSuleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566) captured Belgrade in 1521, conquered central and southern Hungary, and, following his victory at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, established Ottoman control over parts of present-day Hungary and Central Europe. He laid siege to Vienna in 1529 but failed to capture it. Tributes were extracted from Transylvania, Wallachia, and intermittently Moldavia. The Ottomans also took Baghdad from the Persians in 1535, establishing control over Iraq and access to the Persian Gulf. The Peace of Amasya partitioned the Caucasus between the Ottomans and Safavids.\nBy 1539, a 60,000-strong Ottoman army besieged Castelnuovo on the Adriatic coast, capturing it with 8,000 casualties. France allied with the Ottomans in opposition to Habsburg power, coordinating conquests such as Nice (1543) and Corsica (1553).\nBy the end of Suleiman's reign, the Empire spanned around , covering three continents. It had become a dominant naval power in the Mediterranean Sea and an active participant in multi-continental conflicts with the Iberian Union. Ottoman expeditions extended as far as Southeast Asia to support the Sultanate of Aceh.\nWest Asia\nSultan Selim I’s campaigns solidified Ottoman control over Arabia and the Levant, laying the foundations for later Ottoman influence in Persian Gulf trade routes. Ottoman–Safavid rivalry continued to define much of the region's political landscape.\nNorth Africa\nThe Barbary corsairs from cities like Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, nominally under Ottoman suzerainty, captured European ships and enslaved coastal populations. Ottoman naval dominance extended across North Africa and the Mediterranean, consolidating its position in European and Middle Eastern politics.\nMediterranean\nThrough alliances with France and naval campaigns against Venice and the Iberian powers, the Ottomans controlled key ports and sea lanes in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. They engaged in global conflicts, including interventions in Southeast Asia, marking the Empire as a major early modern world power.\nReferences"
