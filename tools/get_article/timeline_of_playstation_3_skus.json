Both of these models included hardware backwards compatibility for PlayStation 2 games.\nIn January 2007, Sony announced that Europe's 60 GB version would exclude hardware backwards compatibility for PS2 titles and instead would provide compatibility through software emulation of the PS2's hardware. During the course of 2007, Sony announced several new PlayStation 3 SKUs and discontinued others. The new 40 GB, 80 GB and 160 GB PlayStation 3 models do not feature software emulation of PlayStation 2 hardware.\nIn August 2009, all previous models were discontinued, as the new PS3 Slims were released, in 120GB and 250GB editions, priced at $299 and $349, respectively. One year later, in August 2010, the 120GB version went out of production, to be replaced by a 160GB counterpart, which was also priced at $299.\nTimeline of SKUs\n2005\n*On May 16, 2005, at E3, Sony unveils a PlayStation 3 prototype with 2 HDMI ports, 6 USB ports and 3 Ethernet ports. This was never planned to be released.\n2006\n*On November 11, 2006, the PlayStation 3 was launched in Japan with both 20&nbsp;GB and 60 GB models available.\n*On November 17, 2006, the PlayStation 3 was launched in the United States and Canada, with both 20 GB and 60 GB models available.\n2007\n*On March 23, 2007, the PlayStation 3 was launched in Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Africa and New Zealand, with only a 60 GB model available.\n*On April 11, 2007, Sony discontinued the 20 GB PlayStation 3 model in North America, citing \"lack of consumer demand.\"  It is widely speculated that the removal of the 20 GB model from the North American market was probably done in order to save manufacturing costs, as there is a difference in cost between the two aforementioned models of around $30.\n*In June 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE) president David Reeves stated that there were no plans for the 80 GB PlayStation 3 model to be released in the PAL regions, and that a 20 GB PS3 model for PAL regions is \"highly unlikely\".\n*On July 9, 2007, Sony announced the 80 GB PlayStation 3 model for North America, bundled with MotorStorm,  to be available beginning August 6, 2007.  In addition, Sony announced a price drop in which the 60&nbsp;GB model would sell for US$499.\n*On July 12, 2007, SCEE announced a Starter Pack bundle in Europe, including a second SIXAXIS controller and two first-party titles from a given selection, to sell at the same price as the standalone model. SCEE stated that there were no plans to introduce an 80&nbsp;GB model or to drop the price for the 60&nbsp;GB model in Europe.  Around this time SCEE President David Reeves and Sony Computer Entertainment, Incorporated President Kaz Hirai clarified that the North American \"price drop\" was in fact a clearance sale intended to eliminate stock of the 60&nbsp;GB unit, the production of which had actually been halted at the time of the price drop announcement. After all 60&nbsp;GB units were sold, only the 80&nbsp;GB unit would remain in stores in North America.\n*On August 30, 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) senior director of corporate communications Dave Karraker stated that it had sold and shipped all of its remaining North American 60&nbsp;GB models to retailers, and that the company no longer has any inventory in its warehouses.  According to spokeswoman Kimberly Otzman, retailer supplies for the North American 60&nbsp;GB model would probably last through October 2007.\n*On October 5, 2007, SCEE announced a 40&nbsp;GB PlayStation 3 model for release on October 10, 2007, in the PAL territories of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In Australia and New Zealand, the 40&nbsp;GB model was announced to be released on October 11, 2007, priced at A$699 for Australia and $799 for New Zealand.\n*On October 9, 2007, it was announced that the 40&nbsp;GB PlayStation 3 model was released in Japan on November 11, 2007, with the new Ceramic White color, in addition to the original Piano Black. Both models will retail for a recommended retail price of JP¥39,980. As with the SCEE announcement, an accompanying price drop was announced in Japan for older PlayStation 3 models, with both the 20&nbsp;GB and 60&nbsp;GB receiving a JP¥5,000 price reduction in the suggested retail price to JP¥44,980 and JP¥54,980, respectively.\n*On October 10, 2007, the 40 GB PlayStation 3 model was released in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Once stocks of 60&nbsp;GB PAL region model are exhausted, the 40&nbsp;GB model will be the only one available in the SCEE territories.\n*On October 11, 2007, the 40 GB PlayStation 3 model was released in Australia and New Zealand.\n*On October 18, 2007, SCEA announced that the 80 GB PlayStation 3 model would receive an immediate price reduction in North America to US$499/CAD$499.\n*On November 2, 2007, the 40 GB model was released in North America for US$399/CAD$399, with Spider-Man 3 on Blu-ray as a pack-in.\n2008\n*On January 10, 2008, Sony discontinued the 20 GB and 60 GB models in Japan.\n*On February 5, 2008, Sony announced the 40GB model in Satin Silver for Japan.\n*On February 26, 2008, Sony announced at Destination PlayStation, during a retailers conference, the intended release of a 80GB Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots bundle PS3 that includes the 80GB PS3, a copy of MGS4, and a DualShock 3 controller.
