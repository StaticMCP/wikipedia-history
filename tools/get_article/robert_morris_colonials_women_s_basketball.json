The school's team currently competes in the Horizon League.\nProgram History\nRobert Morris began its women's basketball program in 1970, and rattled off 11 straight winning seasons from 1978–79 to 1988–89. Under RMU Athletic Hall of Fame head coach Dan Swalga, the Colonials achieved their first 20-win season in 1981–82 at 20–8, won the Pennwood West tournament after a 23–5 campaign in 1983–84, and captured their first ECAC Metro (now Northeast Conference) Tournament championship in 1988. Swalga led RMU to a second NEC tournament title in 1991, but the program then fell into a 16-season championship drought.\nAfter winning just seven games over a three-season span, the Colonials hired Sal Buscaglia from Manhattan to turn around the program. RMU went 3–24 in Buscaglia's first season, but rebounded with a 20–10 record in 2004–05 - marking the third-largest single-season turnaround in NCAA history. Another 20-win season followed, then the Colonials won their third NEC tournament championship and advanced to the program's first NCAA tournament in 2006–07. RMU added a second NCAA tournament berth the next season, and earned a Postseason WNIT berth in 2009–10 after going 17–1 in league play.\nFollowing an injury-plagued 2012–13 season, RMU reached the peak again in 2013–14 with its fifth NEC tournament title and third NCAA tournament  berth. Two years later, Buscaglia added another NEC tournament crown and NCAA tournament  bid in his final season on the bench, before handing over the reins to his son, Charlie Buscaglia, prior to the 2016–17 season.\nCoach B, as he is respectfully called, has continued to raise the standard for the program. In his first season, the Colonials made it back-to-back NEC tournament championships and played in their fifth NCAA tournament, then followed that with a school-record 25 wins and Postseason WNIT berth in 2017–18. In 2018–19, RMU went 16–2 in league play - including a 11–0 start - winning their eighth NEC tournament and sixth NCAA tournament bid. This past season, the Colonials went 23-7 and started a program-best 14–0 in the NEC, and became the first team since Saint Francis U from 2001 to 2005 to win at least a share of four consecutive NEC regular-season crowns. RMU moved onto the NEC Tournament semifinals and were recipients of the conference's NCAA tournament berth after the cancellation of the NEC Tournament due to the COVID-19 virus outbreak.\nIn the classroom, the Colonials ranked in the top five of NCAA Division I women's basketball in cumulative grade point average, finishing second in 2016–17 and fourth in 2017–18.\nOverall, RMU has captured eight NEC Tournaments, eight NEC regular-season titles, and played in nine national postseason tournaments (6 NCAA, 2 WNIT, 1 WBI). The Colonials have won 20 or more games in 13 seasons.\nPostseason results\nNCAA tournament results\nThe Colonials have appeared in the NCAA tournament six times.
