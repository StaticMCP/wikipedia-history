Yurchi and the neighboring towns of Serasiya, Kabadiyan, and Dehnau were taken by Basmachi forces under the leadership of Enver Pasha after they decisively defeated the Soviet Red Army.\nEnver Pasha's victory\nFollowing the recent victory in Dushanbe, Enver Pasha launched an offensive targeting the Uzbek fortress of Yurchi with 1,500 men against a Soviet force of 7,000 or 8,000. Throughout the battle, Enver Pasha’s forces disrupted the Red Army's communication lines by raiding their camel-trains. Between 28 January and 22 February, Enver Pasha's forces captured Serasiya, Yurchi, Kabadiyan, Dehnau. 2 days after capture of dushanbe, Enver Pasha has sent a letter to Amanullah Khan;\"To His Majesty Amanullah Khan,\nThe President of Bukhara’s attempt to disarm enemy soldiers failed due to the intervention of Lakay Ibrahim in favor of\nthe Bolsheviks. The soldiers, caught between fire from the Lakays outside and the Bolsheviks inside, withdrew from Dushanbe. A sudden change in weather—with strong winds and heavy rain—caused panic among the troops who were left out in the open. In this dire situation, the units became separated from each other and dispersed in different directions. President Osman Bey and Commander Ali Rıza Bey were left alone. Therefore, they sought asylum in the Sublime State (Afghanistan).\nAfter the Republican forces disbanded due to Ibrahim's hostility, he provided aid to the enemy by sending them provisions. The Commander of Darvaz joined us with his forces. Taking advantage of this, I escaped Ibrahim’s control and besieged the enemy; I blocked the supply route. Two days later, the Russians promised to evacuate Dushanbe; I demanded their weapons, but they refused to surrender them.\nTwo days ago, under cover of night, they evacuated Dushanbe. They are now retreating, fighting a rearguard battle between Yurchi and Baysun. Our mujahideen are pursuing them and inflicting casualties.\nI have ordered the Chilligöl mujahideen to besiege the Kabadiyan garrison and cut off their supply lines. I hope it will be recaptured soon.The struggle of the people of Bukhara to liberate their country from the Bolsheviks requires the protection of the Afghan Sublime State. In this matter, I await the royal will to be issued. I respectfully submit that, if a power of attorney is obtained and sent on my behalf by Emir Alim to strengthen my influence among the people of Bukhara, we shall succeed.\nWith my highest regards,.\" There is another letter saying;\"29 Jumada al-Awwal / 27 Jumada al-Thani 1340\n(28 January / 25 February 1922)\nOn 28 January 1922, the recapture of Dushanbe was accomplished, and the Bolsheviks were expelled from the city. Although the recapture of Dushanbe had been delayed by about two months due to the treachery of Lakay Ibrahim, on the day of liberation, the city's population—including the Lakay tribespeople—celebrated in an atmosphere of great joy, regardless of tribal differences.\nAfter the city was retaken, amid chants of \"Long live Enver Pasha, live long!\" from the Uzbeks, Enver Pasha and his entourage took up residence in the Government House. However, considering staying there a waste of time, he issued orders to resume the pursuit of the enemy.\nOn 29 January, they reached Serasiya, and on 30 January, Yurchi, where a temporary headquarters was established. In the meantime, the enemy had fled and taken refuge in Baysun, when news also arrived that Kabadiyan had been recaptured.\"These successes increased Enver Pasha's popularity and recognition across Turkestan. The Soviet authorities grew increasingly concerned about Enver Pasha's rising influence and military achievements.\nReferences"
