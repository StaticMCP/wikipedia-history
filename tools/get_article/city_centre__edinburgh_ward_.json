Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it elects four Councillors. As its name suggests, the ward's territory is based around a compact area in the centre of Edinburgh, including Calton Hill, the Canongate, Haymarket, Lauriston, the New Town, the Old Town, West Coates and the West End. A minor 2017 boundary change saw the loss of Abbeyhill and the gain of Tollcross and Dumbiedykes, but the overall population rose considerably and one further representative was added. In 2019, the ward had a population of 32,410.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Charles C Dundas(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Joanna Mowat(Conservative)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|David Beckett(SNP)\n!colspan=2; rowspan=3|3 seats\n|-\n!2011 by\n|rowspan=3|Alasdair Rankin(SNP)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Karen Doran(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Claire Miller(Greens)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Margaret Graham(Labour)\n|rowspan=1|Finlay McFarlane(SNP)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\n|numcounts=6\n}}\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2011 by-election\nA by-election arose following the resignation of SNP councillor David Beckett on 9 June 2011.
