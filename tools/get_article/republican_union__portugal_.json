It won 15 seats in the House of Representatives and 11 seats in the Senate in the 1915 parliamentary elections, emerging as the third-largest faction after the Democratic Party.\nThe party boycotted the 1918 elections, but returned to run in the 1919 elections, in which it won 17 House seats, regaining its place as the third-largest party.\nIn 1919 the party merged with the Evolutionist Party to form the Republican Liberal Party.\nReferences"
