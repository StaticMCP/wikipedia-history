The ceremony was broadcast on the ABC. It was hosted by Henry Winkler and Cheryl Ladd. This ceremony is remembered for problems with the Pasadena Civic Auditorium's air-conditioning.\nThe top shows of the night were Taxi, which pulled an upset in the Outstanding Comedy Series field when it beat All in the Family's final season, and Lou Grant, which received 12 major nominations and won two awards including Outstanding Drama Series.\nFor the first time, most of the Miniseries and Television Movie Categories were merged into one, this would become the standard for later ceremonies, culminating with the TV Movie and Miniseries Program Categories combining in 2011. For this year only, the comedy and variety categories were combined in acting, directing and writing. This combination would not stick, and the traditional categories returned the next year.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Taxi (ABC)'\n** All in the Family (CBS)\n** Barney Miller (ABC)\n** M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Mork & Mindy (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Lou Grant (CBS)'\n** The Paper Chase (NBC)\n** The Rockford Files (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Roots: The Next Generations (ABC)'\n** Backstairs at the White House (NBC)\n** Blind Ambition (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Friendly Fire (ABC)'\n** Dummy (CBS)\n** First, You Cry (CBS)\n** The Jericho Mile (ABC)\n** Summer of My German Soldier (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n* 'Steve & Eydie Celebrate Irving Berlin (NBC)'\n** Arthur Fiedler: Just Call Me Maestro (PBS)\n** The Muppet Show (Syndicated)\n** Saturday Night Live (NBC)\n** Shirley MacLaine at the Lido (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* '''Carroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker in All in the Family (CBS)'\n** Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce in M*A*S*H (CBS)\n** Judd Hirsch as Alex Reiger in Taxi (ABC)\n** Hal Linden as Capt.
