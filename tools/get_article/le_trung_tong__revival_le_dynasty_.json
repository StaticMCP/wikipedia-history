He succeeded Lê Trang Tông (1533–1548) and was succeeded by Lê Anh Tông (1556–1573). The emperor ruled in name only however, as the Trịnh lords monopolized the royal court while the Mạc dynasty ruled in the far north and the Nguyễn lords seized control of the southern part of Vietnam up to Thanh Hoa.\nSources\n* Đại Việt Thông Sử, Lê Quý Đôn (1759)"
