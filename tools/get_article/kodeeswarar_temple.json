Shiva is worshipped as Koteeswarar and His consort Parvathi as Pandhadu Nayaki. Lord Koteeswarar is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical and greatest work, Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 275 temples revered in the canon.\nThe temple has a five-tiered Raja Gopuram, the entrance tower and all the shrines are enclosed in rectangular walls. The temple has four daily rituals at various times from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar, namely Margaḻi Tiruvathirai during the Tamil month of Margaḻi (December–January), Shivaratri in February–March, Panguni Uthiram during Panguni (March–April) and Arrow festival during Purattasi (September–October) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend\nAs per Hindu legend, Suruchi, the son of Sathyarthi, the ruler of Trihartha kingdom, took the form of a devil on account of a curse. On account of disfigure, people ran away on seeing him. He prayed to Shiva and was advised to take a holy dip in the spring in the temple. He got his original form and the belief is followed in modern times, where ladies take a holy dip to get a better appearance. As per another legend, sage Herandar (Athreya) is believed to have worshipped Shiva at this place. Pandhadu Nayagi, meaning Goddess playing with a ball, got her name as she is believed to toss the curses of devotees off their suffering. Shiva is believed to have appeared in ten million (called kodi in Tamil) forms of Vinayaga, Parvathi and Muruga and hence got Koteeswarar as his name.\nArchitecture\n, which is unique in the temple|left]]\nThe temple is located  north-west of Kumbakonam on the Kumbakonam–Swamimalai road.
