He later studied at Crown Point Press in San Francisco.\nMcHugh applies a thin layer of archival wax to the surface of photographic prints, using a painterly brushstroke, giving it a handmade surface. The Seattle Times described an image of the battleship USS New Jersey treated with this technique, saying that \"the effect is both enchanting and unsettling\".\nExhibitions\n*Sans Titre, Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Boulder, Colorado, 1999\n*Altered Photo, Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle, 2010\n*American Photography X2, Towson University, Towson, Maryland, 2013/14\nReferences"
