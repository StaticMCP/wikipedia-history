In recent years, the memorial was restored.\nDescription\nThe monument, dedicated to the residents of Bobrek who perished during World War I, is located on the north wall of the Church of the Holy Family in Bytom. It was ceremoniously unveiled on June 21, 1925, being designed by Richard Ulmer, an architect from the Julia Steel Mill () in Bobrek. It measures 6,6 metres in length, 2,2 metres in height, and was constructed with limestone brought in from the Table Mountains () in the Central Sudetes.\nThe monument features 7 stone tablets with the names of around 280 perished residents. The majority of the construction was carried out by  from Beuthen (now Bytom), with Wilhelm Rose from Gleiwitz (now Gliwice) being commissioned to finish the stone work. Sculptor Ernst Neumeister from Stuttgart designed its bas-reliefs, depicting a woman bearing a child on one side and a man carrying a boulder fighting off a snake on the other. An Iron Cross cradled by an olive branch (a symbol of peace) and an oak branch (a symbol of endurance) towers over the memorial's elements. The plinth contains the inscription \"Dass Ihr aufständet und sprächet zu uns! Bobrek seinen Gefallenen\" (That you may rise and speak to us! Bobrek to its fallen).\nGallery\nReferences"
