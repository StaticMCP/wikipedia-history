It is located in the northern part of the city and covers an area of . The population of this ward in 2011 was 27,481 people in 9,906 households. It is one of the wards that make up the Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough constituency.

It lies north west of Firshill, and the area in between was historically known as Pitsmoor Firs. On 12 June 2020 66 confirmed deaths caused by the coronavirus were reported in the Crabtree and Fir Vale district in the three months up to May 2020. The Office for National Statistics said this was the highest number of coronavirus deaths of any area of England and Wales. This is nearly twice the number of deaths per 100,000 population of the next highest area, Church End in the London borough of Brent. A care home, where staff said they were told not to wear face masks is under investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.\nCrabtree Ponds is a Wildlife Trust for Sheffield and Rotherham nature reserve at Fir Vale. It was originally an ornamental pond for Crabtree Lodge, built in the nineteenth century. Fish such as rudd, roach, perch, crucian carp, sticklebacks and eels can be found at the site. Amphibians at the reserve are smooth and palmate newt, frogs and toads. Pipistrelle, Daubenton's and Leisler's bats have been seen feeding at the ponds. The surrounding woodland is dominated by sycamore, poplar and ash. Blue tits, great tits, treecreepers, woodpeckers, and wrens also breed at the nature reserve.\nGrimesthorpe\nGrimesthorpe  is a suburb in north east Sheffield, lying west of Brightside and north east of Pitsmoor.\nThe settlement originated in the Dark Ages as a farmstead, passing from Grimshaw to Ulfae, the De Buslis, the De Lovetots and then the Dukes of Norfolk.  A guide of 1840 describes the appearance of the village as \"exceedingly striking, and partakes in some degree of the grotesque\", with it main feature being the Grimesthorpe Grinding Wheel Company.  The hills around the village had already been extensively quarried.\nGrimesthorpe lies below Wincobank hill, and in the nineteenth century was surrounded by woods, which were popular places for walking.  Between 1838 and January 1843 the area was served by Grimesthorpe Bridge railway station on the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway. The area became somewhat run down in the twentieth century.  A nineteenth century village pump survives in the suburb.\nOsgathorpe\nOsgathorpe is a small suburb of Sheffield, lying between Shirecliffe and Firvale.  It was probably founded by Norse settlers, and was for many years a hamlet largely owned by the Wake family, who were based in the now-demolished Osgathorpe Cottage.  The area was largely covered by housing in the nineteenth century.  Osgathorpe Park lies in the area.\nPitsmoor\nPitsmoor () is a former village, now a suburb of Sheffield.\nShirecliffe\nShirecliffe () is a suburb of Sheffield, lying west of Grimesthorpe.  Its name comes from \"scir-cliffe\", a bright, steep hillside.  In the mediaeval period, the area was owned by the De Mounteney family, who had a seat at Shirecliffe Hall, demolished in the early nineteenth century.  In 1676, the hall was home to a congregationalist church, founded by the curates of James Fisher, who had been ejected as Vicar of Sheffield.\nDemographics\nThis district of Sheffield is home to a large percentage of Sheffield's ethnic minority population as these statistics from the 2001 census show:\n*White: 58.5%\n*(White British: 55.8%)\n*Black British: 12.3%\n*(Black Caribbean: 6.3%)\n*(Black African: 5.2%)\n*British Asian: 22.9%\n*(Indian: 0.8%)\n*(Pakistani: 18.8%)\n*(Bangladeshi: 0.6%)\n*British Chinese & other: 1.6%\n*(Chinese: 0.2%)\n*Multiracial: 4.7%\nAccording to the 2011 census:\n*White: 42.5%\n*(White British: 38.1%)\n*Black British: 14.0%\n*(Black African: 7.9%)\n*(Black Caribbean: 3.6%)\n*Asian British: 28.3%\n*(Indian: 1.7%)\n*(Pakistani: 22.8%)\n*(Bangladeshi: 0.6%)\n*(Chinese: 0.5%)\n*Mixed: 4.7%\n*Other: 10.4%\n*(Arab: 7.8%)\nThe most common countries of birth, other than the UK, were Pakistan-2,507 (9.1%), Somalia-880 (3.2%) and Jamaica-411 (1.5%)\nBurngreave Messenger\nThe Burngreave Messenger is a community newspaper based in Burngreave.\nIt is published eight times a year and is distributed free to all households and businesses in the area.
