Covering an area of around 600&nbsp;km², the plain stretches for 35 kilometres along the coast of  Foveaux Strait. This stretch of coast includes the peninsula of Tiwai Point, Awarua Bay, the Waituna Lagoon, and Toetoes Bay.  The Mataura River is the major river responsible for the presence of the Awarua Plain; along with the Ōreti River, it is a remnant of the rivers from the Ice Ages that formed the Southland Plains (Murihiku).  In addition, several small streams enter Foveaux Strait along this stretch of coast, mainly via Awarua Bay and Waituna Lagoon.\nThe New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \"two streams\" for Awarua.\nDemographics\nThe Awarua Plains statistical area covers  within Southland District. It had an estimated population of  as of  with a population density of |R}}/409.10|1}} people per km2.\nAwarua Plains had a population of 1,020 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 6 people (−0.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 57 people (5.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 360 households, comprising 531 males and 489 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.09 males per female.

An expedition seeking 'an extensive area of flat lands [producing] the best results' first scouted the area for radio purposes in 1911.\nRadio-related facilities here are:\n* Unwin Radar of La Trobe University\n* Awarua Tracking Station of the European Space Agency\nAwarua Radio\nAwarua Radio (callsign VLB or ZLB) was New Zealand's main receiving and transmitting coast radio station providing worldwide radiotelegraph and voice communications with ships at sea. Some facilities were built by Telefunken of Germany. It was operated from 18 December 1913 by the New Zealand Post Office (to 31 March 1986) then by NZPO successor corporation Telecom New Zealand until the station closed on 30 August 1991.\nThe site was selected following an expedition in 1911 led by Mr J Orchiston, head of the New Zealand Telegraph Department, Captain Gard'ner of the New Zealand Artillery and representatives of AWA, seeking 'an extensive area of flat lands [producing] the best results'.\nReferences"
