By examining ways that the past appears in the present, Buckingham also scrutinizes the power and effects of historical representation. His projects work with space, real and imaginary, to create physical and social contexts where viewers are encouraged to question received ideas—often the things that are most familiar. His works have investigated the Indigenous past and present in the Hudson River Valley; the ‘creative destruction’ of the city of St. Louis; the inception of the first English dictionary and the effects of radical Mary Wollstonecraft’s thoughts in our own time.\nHe is also a full-time faculty member at Columbia University and is the chair of the visual arts department.\nPublications\n*Canal Street Canal\n*Everything I Need\n*False Future\n*Improbable Horse\n*A Man of the Crowd\n*Messages from the Unseen\n*Narratives\n*One Side of Broadway\n*Play the Story\n*Sandra of the Tulip House or How to Live in a Free State\n*The Six Grandfathers from the Cretaceous Period to the Present\n*The Spirit and the Letter\n*Subcutaneous\n*Amos Fortune Road\nExhibitions\nHe has had solo exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum, New York; Glassel School of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; Museum of Contemporary Art, Denver; Camden Arts Centre, London; Charles H.
