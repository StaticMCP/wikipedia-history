It passes by indorsement and delivery and transfers the absolute right to the goods described in it.\nIn England, , a dock warrant was liable to a stamp duty of threepence, which was denoted by an adhesive stamp, to be cancelled by the person by whom the instrument is executed or issued.\nReferences\n;Attribution\n*\n\n---\n\n## Dock Warrant\n\n#redirect Dock warrant"
