The band self-categorizes their music as \"ecstatic black metal.\" According to Marko Djurdjić of Exclaim: \"The music r[i]ses, trembling in optimism and memory, even when it's rooted in adversity, need and tumult. It's awash in noise and devastation, but from the sound and the fury, it purifies. There is change and growth, acceptance and celebration. There is love.\" The band's music draws influence from Bob Dylan, Lou Reed and Zen Buddhism.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* Agriculture (2023)\n* The Spiritual Sound (2025)\nExtended plays\n* The Circle Chant (2022)\n* Living Is Easy (2024)\nReferences"
