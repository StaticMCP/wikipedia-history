He set about combating laxity and want of discipline among the clergy.\nEarly life\nBorn in London into a notable Cheshire family, Stanley was the second son of Sir John Thomas Stanley , and the younger brother of John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley.\nEducated at St John's College, Cambridge (16th wrangler, 1802), he was ordained in 1802 and three years later became rector of Alderley, Cheshire, a position he held for the next 32 years. While there he took a great interest in education, and encouraged especially the teaching of secular subjects at his school.\nEpiscopal discipline\nIn 1837 he was consecrated Bishop of Norwich and appointed Clerk of the Closet, holding both positions until his death. The diocese at this time was conspicuous for laxity and want of discipline, which he proceeded to remedy, although at first he met with much opposition. Ordinations and confirmations were held more regularly and frequently, schools were properly inspected, the Plurality Act, which prohibited the holding of more than one benefice by a clergyman except in certain cases, was enforced, and undesirable clergy were removed.\nStanley showed tolerance towards Dissenters and supported all missionary undertakings, without regard for their sectarian associations. In politics he was a Liberal and devoted himself especially to educational questions.\nOther work\nStanley's letters, Before and after Waterloo (edited by J. H. Adeane and M. Grenfell, 1907), are of interest to students of Napoleonic history.\nBishop Stanley was the original Patron of the Ipswich Museum and presided at its opening in 1847. A portrait of him in oils is displayed there. From 1837 to 1849 he was President of the Linnean Society.\nDeath and succession\nEdward Stanley died in 1849 and was buried in the nave of Norwich cathedral.\nHe was succeeded by Samuel Hinds, a broad-churchman with strong associations with the Maoris of New Zealand, notably the Ngati Kuri and Te Patu tribes.\nFamily\nOn 8 May 1810, Edward Stanley married Catherine, eldest daughter of Rev. Oswald Leycester (from another notable Cheshire family). They had five children:\n* Owen Stanley (1811–1850), Royal Navy officer and surveyor\n* Mary Stanley (1813–1879), nurse and Catholic convert\n* Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1815–1881), priest and historian, Dean of Westminster\n* Charles Edward Stanley (1819–1849), Royal Engineers officer\n* Catherine Maria Stanley (1821–1899), married Charles Vaughan\nCultural reference\nStanley appears as a character in Alan Garner's novel Strandloper.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
