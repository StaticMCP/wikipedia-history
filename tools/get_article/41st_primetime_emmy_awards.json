The ceremony was broadcast on Fox from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California. The ceremony saw the guest acting categories double, as they were now based on gender as well as genre. Two networks, Lifetime and USA Network, received their first major nominations this year.\nAfter being nominated and losing for the previous four years, Cheers regained the title of Outstanding Comedy Series. L.A. Law also won Outstanding Drama Series after losing the previous year. For the second straight year, L.A. Law received 15 major nominations, making it the first show ever to receive more than 14 major nominations multiple times. With nine main cast acting nominations, L.A. Law tied the record set by Hill Street Blues in 1982.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\n(right), Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program winner]]\n, Outstanding Directing in a Miniseries or a Special winner]]\n, Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series winner]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Cheers (NBC)'\n** Designing Women (CBS)\n** The Golden Girls (NBC)\n** Murphy Brown (CBS)\n** The Wonder Years (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'L.A.
