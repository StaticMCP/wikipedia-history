Miriam Defensor-Santiago submitted her certificate of candidacy (COC) on October 16, 2015. She was fifth overall in the election and lost to Rodrigo Duterte. Santiago died of lung cancer five months later.\nBackground\nMiriam Defensor Santiago previously ran for president in the elections of 1992 and 1998.\nIt was reported in March 2014 that Santiago was not interested in vying for a higher post, saying that she would rather support a female candidate for presidency. She said that she had no funds for a presidential campaign, but argued that social media would be a significant factor in the 2016 election.\nOn July 2, 2014, Santiago announced that she was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. However, she said that her cancer is not metastasic and is expected to be cured within six weeks through molecularly targeted therapy.\nIn August 2014, Santiago declared that she was open to run as president, saying that she was recovering and considering two other career options: entering the International Development Law Organization based in Rome, or authoring books about foreign policy at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.\nIn November 2014, Santiago announced that she will run for president if she is completely healed of cancer, saying that, at that time, 90 percent of her cancer cells had regressed. She also said that she was considering entering a coalition with the Liberal Party and Nacionalista Party if she decided to run.\nOn October 26, 2015, a meet-and-greet event in front of UP students was held in UP Bahay ng Alumni (the same place where her co-presidential candidate Grace Poe announced her intention to run for president). Santiago reiterated that she would run for the highest political position in the Philippines for the third time to stop the corruption in the government despite having stage 4 lung cancer:\nRunning mate\n]]\nIn July 2014, Bongbong Marcos said that he was not discounting the possibility of his running for president and, at that time, he said that his Nacionalista Party had only discussed about their agenda in the 2016 election.\nIt was reported in September 2014, that Santiago considered Rodrigo Duterte, Grace Poe and Gilberto Teodoro as her running mates.\nOn October 15, 2015, Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago confirmed Senator Bongbong Marcos as her running mate. Santiago and Marcos are two of the three senators who acquitted Renato Corona in his impeachment trial in 2012 (the other senator was the late Joker Arroyo).\nMarcos revealed on January 21, 2016, that his campaign with Santiago would be officially launched in the Ilocos region, his home region. He also said that he and Santiago would campaign separately if possible to maximize their reach.\nSantiago and Marcos started their campaigns with a proclamation rally held in Mariano Marcos State University in Batac, Ilocos Norte on February 9, 2016.\nMarcos, on the other hand, inaugurated his campaign headquarters in Mandaluyong on February 18, 2016.\nPolitical positions\nCorruption\nIn relation to the Priority Development Assistance Fund scandal, Santiago promised to put those who have pocketed their Priority Development Assistance Fund, commonly known as pork barrel to be arrested.\nGovernance\nAccording to Defensor Santiago's running mate Bongbong Marcos, he and the candidate agreed on the importance of good governance.\nShe has also promised to sign the Freedom of Information Act as the act is an \"important tool to promote public accountability.\"\nSocial and economy issues\nDefensor Santiago also plans to \"aggressively fight the war against illegal drugs\". She has promised to reform the tax system and increase government efficiency, with the goal of keeping the government deficit below 3% of the GDP. Defensor Santiago also plans to invest in public infrastructure, agriculture sector, and government institutions.\nRH Law\nAn advocate of the Reproductive Health Law (RHL), Defensor Santiago was not pleased by the 1 billion peso budget allocation cuts for contraceptives. She said that, if she will be elected, she will work for a full and conscientious implementation of the RHL.\nEndorsements\n* Kathy Bersola, volleyball player\n;Current and former Philippine Senators\n* Cynthia Villar\n;Current and former Philippine Representatives\n* Imelda Marcos, wife of former President Ferdinand Marcos, Incumbent Representative of Ilocos Norte (2nd District)\n* Mitos Magsaysay, former Representative (Zambales)\n* Prospero Nograles, former House Speaker and Representative (Davao City)\n* Rodolfo Fariñas, Incumbent Representative of Ilocos Norte (1st District)\n* Mark Cojuangco, former Representative of Pangasinan\n* Trisha Bonoan-David, 4th District Representative of Manila\n* Antonio Lagdameo, Jr.,  incumbent Representative of Davao del Norte\n* Jonathan dela Cruz, incumbent Representative of ABAKADA Party-List and Marcos' campaign manager\n* Mark Villar, incumbent Representative of Las Piñas\n* Lucy Torres, incumbent Representative of Leyte\n;Current and former Provincial Governors and Vice Governors\n* Imee Marcos, Governor (Ilocos Norte)\n* Chavit Singson, former Governor of Ilocos Sur\n* Ryan Singson, Governor (Ilocos Sur)\n* Ramil Hernandez, Governor (Laguna)\n* Faustino \"Bodjie\" Dy, incumbent Isabela Governor\n* Casimiro Ynares Jr., former Rizal Governor\n* Rebecca Ynares, incumbent Rizal Governor\n;Current and former Philippine Mayors and Vice Mayors\n* Jerry Pelayo, former Mayor (Candaba, Pampanga)\n* Pablo Ortega, Mayor (San Fernando, La Union)\n* Guia Gomez, Mayor (San Juan City)\n* Benjamin Abalos, Jr. Mayor (Mandaluyong)\n* Casimiro Ynares III, former Rizal Governor, Mayor Antipolo City, (Bong Revilla's brother in law)\n* Vergel Aguilar, Mayor (Las Piñas)\n;City Councilor\n* Ramon Yabut, Member, Sangguniang Panlungsod (Pasay)\n;Former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court\n* Renato Corona (now deceased)\n;Celebrities\n* Nora Aunor, actress\n* John Estrada, actor\n* Alex Gonzaga, TV host and actress, daughter of Taytay, Rizal vice mayor Bonoy Gonzaga\n* Toni Gonzaga, TV host and actress, daughter of Taytay, Rizal vice mayor Bonoy Gonzaga\n* Richard Gomez, actor, sportsman and Ormoc mayoralty candidate\n* Paul Soriano, film director\n* Dawn Zulueta, TV host and actress, wife of Davao Representative Anton Lagdameo\n* Ferdinand Topacio, lawyer (a member of Iglesia ni Cristo)\n;Organizations and Support Groups\n* Alliance of Transport Organizations (ACTO)\n* El Shaddai\n* Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines (FEJODAP)\n* Iglesia ni Cristo\n* Iglesia Filipina Independente\n* Kabataang Barangay Alumni Association Inc., Manila Chapter\n* Liga ng Transportasyon at Operators sa Pilipinas (LTOP)\n* National Federation of Sugarcane Planters\n* Panay Federation of Sugarcane Planters\n* Pangkalahatang Sanggunian Manila & Suburbs Drivers Association Nationwide, Inc.
