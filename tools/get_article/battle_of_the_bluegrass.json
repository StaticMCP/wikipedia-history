Both schools were formerly members of the Ohio Valley Conference, and played against each other regularly until Western Kentucky's transition from the NCAA's FCS to FBS in 2008. The two teams have met 86 times on the football field, with Western Kentucky currently holding a 48–35–3 edge in the all-time series. The series resumed again in 2017, when Western Kentucky hosted Eastern Kentucky in a game played at Houchens Industries–L. T. Smith Stadium. The two teams met again on September 7, 2024.\nGame results\n| team2 = Western Kentucky\n| team2style =\n| October 23, 1914 | Richmond, KY | Eastern Kentucky | 34 | Western Kentucky | 6\n| November
