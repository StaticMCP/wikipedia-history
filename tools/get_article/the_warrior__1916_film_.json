It saw huge success in Italy and abroad and whose name is due to Gabriele D'Annunzio who thus created a neologism that is still in use today. The warrior is the best-known and critically praised film of the Maciste series.\nThe film is not far from what the seris (with the exception of Maciste in hell) became: an escapist fantasy with the horrors of the First World War not really addressed.\nBibliography\nNotes\nReferences\n* - Total pages: 240\n* - Total pages: 432\nExternal links\n*"
