      "text": "# Draft:Timeline of the New York City Subway\n\nThe New York City Subway, documenting major milestones in its development, ownership, service, and technological evolution from its earliest origin in the 19th century to the present day. The subway is one of the world's largest rapid transit systems, serving the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, and is operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).\nMid-19th-century rapid transit proposals in New York began with private efforts and demonstration tunnels. The first underground transit proposal emerged in the 1860s, followed by the opening of the first IRT subway line in 1904.\nInitially operated by the private IRT, the network later expanded under the BMT and the city-owned IND. In 1940, these separate systems were consolidated under municipal control. Subsequent developments included expansions under the Dual Contracts of 1913, electrification, the introduction of the MetroCard (1990s) and OMNY tap-to-pay system (2010s), and infrastructure investments like the opening of the Second Avenue Subway in 2017.\nThe timeline also records service changes, fare system upgrades, major disruptions, and modernization efforts that have shaped the Subway's physical and operational history. Station names shown are current names; many stations have previously had different names.\n{| id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\" summary=\"Contents\" align=\"center\"\n!\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |\n1820s 1830s 1840s 1850s 1860s 1870s 1880s 1890s 1900s 1910s 1920s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020sSee also Notes References__NOTOC__\n|}\nPrecursors\n1827\n: New York City's first public transportation, the  horse-drawn omnibus, begins operating.\n1832\n:The New York and Harlem Railroad opens the city's first street railway.\n1868\n: The first elevated railway (or \"El\"), the West Side and Yonkers Patent Railway, opens along Greenwich Street using cable-driven trains.\n1869\n: Alfred Ely Beach demonstrates the Beach Pneumatic Transit, a short underground pneumatic tube railway built beneath Broadway in Lower Manhattan.\n1870\n:The Beach Pneumatic Transit, an experimental subway, opens beneath Broadway.\n:The Beach Pneumatic Transit opens to the public as a demonstration line between Warren Street and Murray Street.
