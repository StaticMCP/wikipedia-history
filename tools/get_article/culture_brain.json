In 2016, it was renamed Culture Brain Excel.\nHistory\nCulture Brain was founded in 1980 as Nihon Game Corporation. In 1981, a subsidiary to handle the sales operations of the company was established. Its first video games were arcades games, with titles such as Shanghai Kid and Chinese Hero that were manufactured under \"Taiyo System\" trademark. In 1987, it transitioned from arcade to console video games and renamed itself \"Culture Brain\". The company has also alternatively used the brand \"Micro Academy\" in the mid-1980s.\nIn North America, Culture Brain is mostly known for its six video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and its three for the Super NES. Three of those NES games, Baseball Simulator 1.000, The Magic of Scheherazade and Flying Dragon 2, were strongly redesigned from their Japanese source to better appeal North American consumers.\nCulture Brain was distinct for its innovative gameplay by incorporating multiple genres in its games, but like many other Japanese video game companies, Culture Brain ceased its operations in the United States in the 1990s. Ever since the demise of Culture Brain USA, video games developed by the parent company have rarely made it in America. An exception of the latter situation is the Nintendo 64 version of Flying Dragon which was published by Natsume Inc. in the United States.\nCulture Brain Excel era\nIn 2016, the company was renamed Culture Brain Excel and the website's URL was changed to the new name. The longtime Culture Brain logo was instantly dropped with the intent of launching a new logo in the following year.\nIn September 2021, Culture Brain Excel was renamed as Nihon Game once again, returning to its original name from 1980.\nSubsidiary\nCulture Brain also ran until 2003 a professional school, the Culture Brain Art Institute.\nGames\nNintama Rantarō series\nBaseball Simulator series\nThese baseball titles included some form of \"Super League\" where pitchers and batters would have special abilities.\n* Baseball Simulator 1.000 (1989, NES), also known as Choujin Ultra Baseball\n* Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 (1991, Super NES), also known as Super Ultra Baseball\n* Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban (1992, SNES), NPB licensed.\n* Super Ultra Baseball 2 (1994, SNES)\n* Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 2 (1994, SNES), NPB licensed.\n* Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 3 (1995, SNES), NPB licensed.\n* Pro Yakyū Star (1997, SNES), NPB licensed.\nHiryū no Ken series\n* Shanghai Kid (known in Japan as Hokuha Syourin Hiryu no Ken (Arcade)\n* Hiryu no Ken Special: Fighting Wars (NES - Japan only)\n* Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll (NES)\n* Flying Warriors (NES)\n* Fighting Simulator 2-in-1: Flying Warriors (Game Boy)\n* Ultimate Fighter (Super NES)\n* SD Hiryu no Ken Gaiden (Game Boy)\n* Flying Dragon (Nintendo 64)\n* SD Hiryu no Ken Densetsu (Nintendo 64 - Japan only)\n* Hiryu no Ken Retsuden GB (Game Boy Color)\n* Virtual Hiryu No Ken (Sony PlayStation)\nSuper Chinese series\nIn this list are series which were originally released as \"Chinese Hero\", but became better known as Super Chinese, but with the exception of \"Kung-Fu Heroes\", these titles were released in North America as the \"Ninja Brothers\" series.\n* Chinese Hero (Arcade)\n* Kung Fu Heroes (NES)\n* Little Ninja Brothers (NES)\n* Ninja Boy (Game Boy)\n* Super Chinese 3 (NES)\n* Super Ninja Boy (Super NES)\n* Ninja Boy 2 (Game Boy)\n* Super Chinese World 2 (Super NES)\n* Super Chinese Fighter (Super NES)\n* Super Chinese Land 3 (Game Boy)\n* Super Chinese World 3 (Super NES)\n* Super Chinese Land 1-2-3 Dash (Game Boy)\n* Super Chinese Fighter GB (Game Boy)\n* Super Chinese I+II Advance (Game Boy Advance)\n* Twin Series Vol. 3: Konchuu Monster/Super Chinese Labyrinth (Game Boy Advance)\nOshare Princess series\nA Japan-only series of games for the GBA (with two DS versions) about fashion and dressing up.
