In its first six months, HIPS has provided commentary and guidance on topics as diverse as educational opportunities in Somalia, displaced nationals, and domestic diplomatic initiatives in Kismayo and the self-declared state of Somaliland.  Notable speakers include Asha Haji Elmi, Mohamed Nur \"Tarzan\" and Mohamed Ali Ameriko.\nAs part of its mission, the HIPS will also promote a culture of learning and research in Somalia. It aims to do so by launching a series of public libraries across the country, organizing summer book fairs and offering research courses and fellowships to postgraduate students and aspiring researchers.\nHIPS is headed by Mursal Saney.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.heritageinstitute.org Official website]"
