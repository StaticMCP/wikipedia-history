He also captained his country.\nEarly life\nTemple Gurdon was born on 25 January 1854 in Barnham Broom, Norfolk. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Gurdon of Bear's Farm, Hingham, Attleborough, Norfolk and older brother of Charles Gurdon, also a rugby international and captain of England, and Francis, who became Bishop of Hull. He attended Haileybury and in 1873 entered Trinity College, Cambridge from whom he received his BA in 1878 (and his MA in 1888). His two younger brothers, Charles and Francis also studied at Cambridge. He then worked in Public Record Office from 1877 to 1879 and became a solicitor, having finished his articles in November 1883. He was a member of the firm Frere, Cholmely and Co.\nRugby union career\nGurdon played rugby football at his school, Haileybury, and was awarded a rugby 'blue,’ in three consecutive years at Cambridge (in 1874, 1875, and 1876) where he was also captain for two seasons (1875–6 and 1876–7).\nGurdon made his international debut on 4 March 1878 at The Oval in the England vs Scotland match. He first captained England in 1880 and he played his final match for England on 13 March 1886 at Edinburgh in the Scotland vs England match, in which he was also the national captain. In parallel, he played his rugby for Richmond Football Club, and captained them in two seasons (1879–80 and 1887–8).\nAfter his playing career was over his involvement in the game continued and he acted as President of the Rugby Football Union for two terms (1890–1 and 1891–2).\nReferences\nExternal links"
