It was later re-taken by the British.\nA wading pond, added in the 1920s and replaced in 1967, is located within the site. The walls of the redoubt can still be seen.\nOther fortifications are located nearby, since the area was close to the border with the United States:\n* Fort Mississauga (1814–1816)\n* Fort George, Ontario (1802)\nReferences"
