The ward covers most of Belsize Park, between Haverstock Hill, Swiss Cottage, and Primrose Hill.\nThe ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. The ward was redrawn in May 1978, May 2002, and May 2022. From 2010, the ward was in the Hampstead and Kilburn constituency, having previously been in Hampstead and Highgate from 1983 until 2010, and Hampstead prior to 1983. In 2018, the ward had an electorate of 8,999. The Boundary Commission projects the electorate to rise to 9,097 by 2025.\nThe ward currently returns three councillors to Camden Council, with an election every four years. At the last election in May 2022, all three candidates from the Liberal Democrats were elected to represent the ward.\nHistory\nThe ward underwent boundary changes for the 2022 election. A significant portion of the ward was transferred to the newly created Primrose Hill ward, and significant portions of the existing Hampstead Town and Frognal and Fitzjohns wards were transferred to Belsize.\nAt the 2022 election, leader of the Conservative group on Camden London Borough Council Oliver Cooper stood as a candidate in Belsize, having previously represented Hampstead Town. Hampstead Town had been a safe Conservative ward, while Belsize had been marginal between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Leader of the Liberal Democrat group Luisa Porritt, who represented Belsize, stood down at the 2022 election, citing work commitments, while the Camden New Journal suggested that the new ward boundaries would favour the Conservatives.\nCouncillors\nNotable former councillors include Opposition Leaders Claire-Louise Leyland (2010–18), Piers Wauchope (2002–06), Judith Barnes (1986–98), and Tony Kerpel (1978–86); MEP Luisa Porritt (2018–22); future Council Leader Richard Arthur (1974–78); and former Leader Martin Morton (1976–78).\n1978–2022\nThree councillors have represented Belsize ward since 1978. Currently, all three councillors from the Liberal Democrats represent the ward.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Term!!Councillor!!Party\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: \" | || 2018–present ||Tom Simon|| Liberal Democrats\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: \" | || 2022–present || Judy Dixey || Liberal Democrats\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: \" | || 2022–present || Matthew Kirk || Liberal Democrats\n|}\n1964–1978\nFour councillors represented Belsize ward, from its creation in 1964, until 1978.\nElection results\nThe last election was held in May 2022.
