Though there are a few technical differences (for instance, whereas ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials to the host country's head of state, high commissioners are accredited to the head of government), in practice they have the same function.\nTrinidad and Tobago were British colonies from 1802 to 1964, when the combined country gained independence from Britain and joined the Commonwealth.\nFrom 1974 until 1980, the British high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago also served as non-resident high commissioner to Grenada.\nList of heads of mission\nHigh commissioners\nTrinidad and Tobago\n*Sir Norman E.
