He then developed into Footscray's back up ruckman and played in the 1961 VFL Grand Final loss to Hawthorn. Ware was still occasionally pushed forward and kicked a bag of five goals against Geelong in 1963.\nA VFA representative at the 1966 Hobart Carnival, Ware played at Williamstown once he left Footscray.\nReferences\n*\n*Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).
