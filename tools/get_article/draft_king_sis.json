She has lightly gained popularity on platforms such as Spotify and TikTok for her song Yeah You (Thinkin Bout You) released in 2020. She is signed to Swedish record label Epidemic Sound. Her debut album, Ascension, was released in 2021, followed by its deluxe version on April 30, 2024. Sis has collaborated with other underground artists including her cousin DT Lamont, Vicki Vox, Alder and Mimmi Bangoura. Sources credit her vocal style to a lifelong history of singing in church and being influenced by gospel music, as well as by contemporary artists like Lauryn Hill and India Arie.\nEarly life\nMills was raised in the Washington metropolitan area (also known as the \"DMV\"), and attended her grandfather's church in Alexandria, Virginia, where she had her first vocal and her first dance performance at age seven; the time where she discovered her passion for the arts. After her time in high school, she founded two gospel groups, REIGN and His City.\nCareer\nIn 2014, Mills placed first at Amateur Night at the Apollo Theatre in New York with her performance of Killing Me Softly With His Song by The Fugees. She states that winning the spot at the competition was the thing that essentially gave her confidence. In recent years, Mills sang backup vocals for Kelela for her Tiny Desk concert. Mills' debut solo single was released in 2020, titled Tweet And Delete. In 2023, Mills worked with Jordin Sparks, taking credit for backup vocals on her Christmas album, The Gift Of Christmas.\n}|title=King Sis|background=solo_singer|bodyclass=hlist|above=* Discography|group1=Studio albums|list1=* Ascension\n* ''Ascension D'Luxe''|group2=Singles & EPs|list2=* \"Tweet And Delete\"\n* \"Mama's Free\"\n* \"Hiatus With You\"\n* \"Take A Number\"\n* \"Had To Be Dreaming\"\n* \"Yeah You (Thinkin Bout You)\"\n* \"Waterfall\"\n* \"Encore\"\n* \"We Could Go\"\n* \"Come Gimme Love\"\n* \"Don't Wait Up\"\n* \"All Love\"\n* \"Better (Not Bitter) (Clean Version)\"\n* \"Better (Not Bitter)\"\n* \"Big Moody (Smai Tawi)\"\n* \"Kah\"\n* \"Soul Ties\"\n* \"Vulnerable\"\n* \"Yeah You (Thinkin Bout You) (baegel Remix)\"\n* \"On My Time\"\n* \"Grow Up\"\n* \"Sacred Timeline\"\n* \"Seasons\"\n* \"ready FR\"\n* \"Pendulum\"\n* \"History\"\n* \"Golden Hour\"\n* \"Too Late\"\n* \"Foresight\"\n* \"Hindsight\"\n* \"Sundial\"\n* \"Cry an Ocean\"\n* \"Solid Ground\"\n* \"Might As Well Be on the Moon\"\n* \"LFG\"   |group3=|list3=|group4=|list4=}}\nNotes\nReferences\n:Category:1987 births\n:Category:Living people"
