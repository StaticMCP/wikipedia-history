Westervelt. It was Scottsbluff's first newspaper and was located in one of the earliest constructed buildings in the city. The first issue appeared on May 4, 1900 and the paper was originally published weekly. It was later changed to a semi-weekly paper, but eventually returned to weekly publication. Its main competitor was the Star-Herald.\nSilent film star Jacqueline Logan briefly worked as a journalist for the paper.\nIn 1945 the paper closed its own print shop and was instead printed by the Minatare Free Press newspaper (in nearby Minatare), although Westervelt continued as editor. Following the death of Westervelt in 1950, his son, John M. \"Kim\" Westervelt, became editor. By late 1964, circulation of both the Minatare Free Press and Scottsbluff Republican was so low that the papers were no longer profitable and it was decided to end their publication. The final issue of the Scottsbluff Republican was dated November 19, 1964.\nReferences"
