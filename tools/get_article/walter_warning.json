He was later converted into a football goalkeeper and became HSV's first choice goalie in 1935. With the club he won the Gauliga Nordmark in 1937, 1938 and 1939. During the Second World War he was stationed in Ukraine and rarely featured for HSV. During this period he also made appearances for VfL Köln 1899, a predecessor club to 1. FC Köln. In the post war era, Warning was again a regular player for HSV, where he won the Stadtliga Hamburg in 1946, the British Occupation Zone championship in 1947 and 1948, and the Oberliga Nord 1948, 1949 and 1950. He retired in 1950 at the age of 33, before making a brief comeback the following year as cover for the injured Otto Globisch.\nReferences"
