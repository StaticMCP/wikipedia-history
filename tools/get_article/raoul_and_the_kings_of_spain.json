It is the second and final album made without the involvement of Curt Smith following Elemental (1993), with Roland Orzabal once again employing outside musicians.\nOrzabal's primary musical collaborator for Raoul and the Kings of Spain was Alan Griffiths, who acted in the same role for Elemental, co-writing most of the album with Orzabal. Raoul and the Kings of Spain also retained producer Tim Palmer from Elemental. Raoul was a commercial disappointment for the band, becoming their lowest charting album in both the UK and US up to that point and receiving mixed reviews.\nBackground\nRaoul and the Kings of Spain was recorded between Summer 1993 and 1995 by Roland Orzabal, Alan Griffiths, and the band they toured with during the Elemental tour of August–December 1993 (Gail Ann Dorsey, Brian MacLeod, Jeffrey Trott, and Jebin Bruni). Recording sessions for the album took place in Neptune's Kitchen (Orzabal's home studio in Dyrham, England, where Elemental was recorded) and in the Record Plant in Los Angeles.\nThe album, according to Orzabal, has a recurring theme of familiar relationships and delves into his own Spanish heritage. The album's title was mooted as far back as the 1980s as a possible contender for the band's third album (which ultimately became The Seeds of Love). Raoul was originally Orzabal's first name given at birth before being anglicized by his parents to Roland (Orzabal later gave the name Raoul to his first son, born in 1991).\nThe album was originally scheduled to be released by Mercury Records but the release was postponed after Tears for Fears left the label to sign with Sony/Epic Records. The album was eventually released by Sony in October 1995 with a slightly different track listing and new cover art.\nThe album peaked at number 41 in the United Kingdom and number 79 in the United States, but was more successful in continental Europe, reaching number 13 in Belgium (Wallonia) and number five in France.\nThe album features a reunion with Oleta Adams, who had recorded and toured extensively with the band for The Seeds of Love album and here duets with Orzabal on the track \"Me and My Big Ideas\".\nThe front cover photo, titled Running Them In at Pamplona, is by Jose Galle and is a depiction of the annual \"Running of the Bulls\" festival held in Pamplona in Spain. Several inner sleeve photographs were by David Tack, taken from his book Impressions of Spain published by Quartet (the Bullfighter on Horseback on page 4 is Rafael Peralta, a renowned Spanish Rejoneador bullfighter). Inner sleeve photos of Orzabal were taken by Pamela Springsteen, shot at the historic Mission Inn in Riverside, California, where the promo video for \"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\" was filmed.\nRaoul and the Kings of Spain was re-released in August 2009 by Cherry Pop Records, complete with seven bonus tracks (see below).\nTrack listing\n| length1         = 5:17\n| title2          = Falling Down\n| writer2         = Roland Orzabal\n| length2         = 4:55\n| title3          = Secrets\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 4:42\n| title4          = God's Mistake\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 3:47\n| title5          = Sketches of Pain\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          = Mislabeled on CD back insert as \"Sketches of Spain\"; the actual title of the track is a play on the Miles Davis' Sketches of Spain album of that name\n| length5         = 4:21\n| title6          = Los Reyes Católicos\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 1:48\n| title7          = Sorry\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 4:48\n| title8          = Queen of Compromise\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 3:52\n| title9          = Don't Drink the Water\n| writer9         =\n| length9         = 4:56\n| title10         = Me and My Big Ideas\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 4:33\n| title11         = Los Reyes Católicos\n| writer11        =\n| extra11         = Mislabeled on CD back insert as \"Los Retes Catolicos\"\n| length11        = 3:43\n}}\n| length1         = 5:16\n| title2          = Falling Down\n| writer2         = Orzabal\n| length2         = 4:56\n| title3          = Secrets\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 4:42\n| title4          = God's Mistake\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 3:47\n| title5          = Sketches of Pain\n| writer5         = Orzabal\n| length5         = 4:21\n| title6          = Los Reyes Católicos\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 1:44\n| title7          = Sorry\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 4:48\n| title8          = Humdrum and Humble\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 4:11\n| title9          = I Choose You\n| writer9         = Orzabal\n| length9         = 3:26\n| title10         = Don't Drink the Water\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 4:51\n| title11         = Me and My Big Ideas\n| writer11        =\n| length11        = 4:33\n| title12         = Los Reyes Católicos (Reprise)\n| writer12        =\n| length12        = 3:43\n}}\n| length13         = 4:31\n| title14          = The Madness of Roland\n| writer14         =\n| length14         = 5:10\n| title15          = Queen of Compromise\n| writer15         =\n| length15         = 3:57\n| title16          = Until I Drown\n| writer16         =\n| length16         = 3:23\n| title17          = War of Attrition\n| writer17         =\n| length17         = 3:45\n| title18          = Raoul and the Kings of Spain\n| note18           = acoustic\n| writer18         =\n| length18         = 4:29\n| title19          = Break It Down Again\n| note19           = acoustic\n| writer19         =\n| length19         = 3:14\n}}\nNotes\n* Due to the band's label switch to Sony in 1994, none of the B-sides from the album's singles (tracks 13–17 on the 2009 reissue) are included on the Tears for Fears B-sides collection Saturnine Martial & Lunatic, which was released in 1996 by Phonogram/Mercury, the band's old record company.\n* \"All of the Angels\", \"Queen of Compromise\", and \"The Madness of Roland\" originally appeared as B-sides in the UK 2-disc single release of \"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\". \"Queen of Compromise\" had also appeared in early promo versions of the Raoul and the Kings of Spain album (which omitted two tracks that would appear in the final version of the album, \"Humdrum and Humble\" and \"I Choose You\").\n* \"Raoul and the Kings of Spain (acoustic)\" was originally released as a UK promo single and as a B-side in the single release of \"God's Mistake\".\n* \"Until I Drown\" and \"War of Attrition\" originally appeared as B-sides in the UK and US single release of \"Secrets\".\n* \"Break It Down Again (acoustic)\" originally appeared as a B-side in the European single release of \"God's Mistake\" and the US single release of \"Secrets\".\n* The only Tears for Fears B-side from this era not included in the 2009 reissue of Raoul and the Kings of Spain is a cover version of Radiohead's \"Creep\" recorded live in Birmingham during the Elemental tour on 14 December 1993. This track was included in the UK 2-disc single release of \"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\" and the US single of \"God's Mistake\".\nPersonnel\nTears for Fears\n* Roland Orzabal – lead vocals, keyboards, guitars\nAdditional musicians\n* Alan Griffiths – keyboards, guitars\n* Jebin Bruni – Hammond organ\n* Jeffrey Trott – guitars\n* Gail Ann Dorsey – bass\n* Brian MacLeod – drums, percussion\n* Oleta Adams – guest vocalist on \"Me and My Big Ideas\"\n* Mark O'Donoughue – backing vocals\nTechnical\n* Producers – Tim Palmer (tracks 1–7, 10–12); Roland Orzabal and Alan Griffiths (tracks 8, 9).\n* Engineer – Mark O'Donoughue\n* Mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering (Portland, Maine).\n* Album Coordinators – Jason Geake and Philippa Sprigg\n* Design – Gail Marowitz\n* Front Cover Photo – Jose Galle\n* Inner Sleeve Photos – David Tack and Pamela Springsteen\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Raoul and the Kings of Spain\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (Music & Media)\n| 16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (IFOP)\n| 5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
