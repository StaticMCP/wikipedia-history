The official title is 'His Majesty's Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran'.\nAlthough Britain and Iran (originally Persia) did not enter into formal diplomatic relations until 1807, the British and the Iranians had been in informal contact since the early 17th century when the East India Company developed trade links with the Safavid Empire. Initially, diplomatic missions comprised a legation until they were promoted to embassy status in 1943.\nAt various times in history during crises or disputes, Britain has had no diplomatic presence in the country, and has either relied on other nations as protecting powers, or has had a non-resident diplomat.\nHeads of mission\nEnvoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary (1807–1944)\n*1807&ndash;1811: Sir Harford Jones-Brydges, 1st Baronet, envoy extraordinary\n*1810&ndash;1814: Sir Gore Ouseley, Bt, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary\n*April 1814 – October 1815: James Morier, Minister Plenipotentiary (ad interim)\n*13 April 1814: Sir Henry Ellis, Deputy Minister Plenipotentiary (ad interim), in James Morier's absence\n*1815–22, 1823–26: Henry Willock, chargé d'affaires\n*1822–23: Major George Willock, deputy chargé d'affaires\n*29 July 1826: Colonel John Macdonald Kinneir, Envoy Extraordinary from Government of India\n*British envoy to Persia, 1830-35: Sir John Campbell\n*1835&ndash;1836: Sir Henry Ellis, ambassador\n*1836&ndash;1842: Sir John McNeill, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\n**No representation during the Siege of Herat\n*1844&ndash;1854: Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Justin Sheil, secretary of legation February 1836, Head of Mission 1839–44, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary 1844–54\n*1847–49: Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Farrant, chargé d'affaires\n*1849, 1853–55: Sir William Taylour Thomson, chargé d'affaires\n*1854&ndash;1855: Sir Charles Murray, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\n*1855&ndash;1857: No representation due to the Anglo-Persian War\n*1857&ndash;1858: Sir Charles Murray, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\n*1858–59: William Doria, chargé d'affaires\n*1859&ndash;1860: Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry Rawlinson, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\n*November–December 1859: Sir Ronald Thomson, chargé d'affaires\n*1860&ndash;1872: Charles Alison, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary April 1872\n**May–July 1860: Captain (later Colonel Sir) Lewis Pelly, chargé d'affaires\n**November–December 1862: Sir Ronald Thomson, chargé d'affaires\n**December 1862 – January 1863: Edward Eastwick, chargé d'affaires\n**1863, 1869–70: Sir Ronald Thomson, chargé d'affaires\n**April–May 1872: William Dickson, chargé d'affaires\n**1872–73: Sir Ronald Thomson, chargé d'affaires\n*1872&ndash;1879: Sir William Taylour Thomson, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\n**1878–79: Sir Ronald Thomson, chargé d'affaires\n*1879–1887: Sir Ronald Ferguson Thomson, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\n**1885–86: Sir Arthur Nicolson, chargé d'affaires\n*1887&ndash;1891: Sir Henry Drummond Wolff\n**1889, November 1890, November 1891: Robert John Kennedy, chargé d'affaires\n*1891&ndash;1894: Sir Frank Lascelles\n*1894: Sir Conyngham Greene, chargé d'affaires\n*1894&ndash;1900: Sir Mortimer Durand\n**1897–98: Lord Hardinge, chargé d'affaires\n**March 1900 – 1901: Sir Cecil Spring Rice, chargé d'affaires\n*October 1900&ndash;1906: Sir Arthur Hardinge (appointed Consul-General)\n**October–November 1902: William Erskine, chargé d'affaires\n**1904, 1905: Evelyn Grant Duff, chargé d'affaires\n*1906&ndash;1908: Sir Cecil Spring Rice\n*1908&ndash;1912: Sir George Barclay\n*1912&ndash;1915: Sir Walter Townley\n*1915&ndash;1918: Sir Charles Marling\n*1918&ndash;1920: Sir Percy Cox (ad interim)\n*1920&ndash;1921: Herman Norman\n*1921&ndash;1926: Sir Percy Loraine, Bt\n*1926&ndash;1931: Sir Robert Clive\n*1931&ndash;1934: Sir Reginald Hoare\n*1934&ndash;1936: Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen\n*1936&ndash;1939: Sir Horace Seymour\n*1942&ndash;1944: Sir Reader Bullard\nAmbassadors extraordinary and plenipotentiary (1944–1980)\n*1944&ndash;1946: Sir Reader Bullard\n*1946&ndash;1950: Sir John Le Rougetel\n*1950&ndash;1952: Sir Francis Shepherd\n*1952&ndash;1953: No representation due to the nationalisation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company\n*1954&ndash;1958: Sir Roger Stevens\n*1958&ndash;1963: Sir Geoffrey Harrison\n*1963&ndash;1971: Sir Denis Wright\n*1971&ndash;1974: Hon.
