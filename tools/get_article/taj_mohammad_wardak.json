An ethnic Pashtun, he spent some of the period of the Taliban's administration in the United States of America, and became an American citizen.\nEarly political career\nOn 19 June 1965, Wardak was appointed as the Deputy Governor of Badakhshan Province. In the 1970s, he served as Governor of Badakhshan. After serving as President of the Inspection Department in the Ministry of Interior, Wardak was appointed as Governor of Laghman on 17 June 1972.\nGovernor of Paktia\nWardak was appointed Governor of Paktia province in Afghanistan in the winter of 2002. He served for only a few months due to opposition from local warlord Pacha Khan Zadran.\nMinister of the Interior\nAccording to Guantanamo captive Hafizullah Shabaz Khail, in testimony before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal Taj Mohammed  Wardak was the first governor Hamid Karzai appointed for the Province of Paktia.\nKhail said he was appointed the District Chief of Zormat because the new governor, Wardak, trusted him. He said Wardak was replaced as governor by Raz Mohammed Dalili when Hamid Karzai asked him to assume a position in Kabul.\nAccording to the BBC the \"relatively unknown\" Wardak was appointed Interior Minister on June 19, 2002.\nAccording to Islam Online, Wardak's appointment raised controversy within the Ministry.\nThey quote unnamed Ministry officials, and sentry Mohammad Halim:\n:\"The interior ministry is on high alert because the people say why [Yunus] Qanooni Saheb has been transferred. He should come back, It is a state of high alert and strike. We do not like Wardak, because we do not know him and we want the return of Qanooni.\"\nWardak was one of several cabinet ministers Karzai appointed to a high level commission to investigate the assassination of Abdul Qadir, Vice President, and also one of Karzai's leading rivals.\nQadir, like Wardak, was a Pashtun. Analysts said Karzai picked cabinet ministers from each of Afghanistan's ethnic groups, so each group would realize he was taking the investigation seriously.\nThe commission included\nVice President Mohammad Karim Khalili, Intelligence Services Director\nMohammad Arif Sarwari,\nRural Development Minister Mohammad Hanif Atma, and former Interim\nIrrigation Minister Hajji Mangal Hussain.\nWardak and Karzai differed in their interpretation of the deaths of students shot during a demonstration.\nKarzai called the first student known to have died a \"martyr\". Wardak said that student was shot by other students.\nWardak was replaced on January 28, 2003, by Ali Ahmad Jalali.\nAn article published on the web-site of The Jamestown Foundation on June 23, 2004 described Wardak as a \"presidential aide\".\n2004 elections\nWardak was one of the running mates for presidential candidate Mohammad Yunos Qanuni.\nNational Independence Party of Afghanistan\nTaj Mohammad Wardak is listed as the head of the National Independence Party of Afghanistan on the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Ministry of Justice web-page that lists the licensed political parties.\nReferences"
