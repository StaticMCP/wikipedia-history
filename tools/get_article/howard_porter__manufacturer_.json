After three generations of Porter family ownership, it was sold in the 1990s to overseas interests. In 2004 it was purchased by Giulio and Roy Lombardi. By this stage it had relocated to Spearwood.\nFrom the 1950s until the 1990s, Howard Porter bodied buses, including many for the Metropolitan Transport Trust and its successor Transperth, and the Western Australian Government Railways and its successor Westrail. In the 1970s it built some with Custom Coaches kits. It later diversified into custom built semi-trailers and truck builds.\nIn 2006 rival semi trailer manufacturing business SFM Engineering was purchased. In 2010, Howard Porter completed a 320 trailer contract for the Gorgon gas project, reportedly the biggest trailer contract ever in Australia. In 2012 a subsidiary trading as Global Trailer Solutions was established in Asia.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://perthbus.info/prequery.php?qqid=6501869273767837000&ccid=14.0 Perth Bus Info gallery]"
