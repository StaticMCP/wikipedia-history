News University was created under the auspices of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a journalism think-tank and training center where Finberg has served in several roles since 2002.\nPersonal life\nFinberg was born on July 24, 1949. He is the son of Martin Finberg and Flora Finberg (née Lerner). His brother Kenneth Finberg is a photographer and painter.\nFinberg graduated from San Francisco State University.\nEarly career and digital journalism leadership\nFinberg's career began as a copy editor at the San Francisco Examiner. In 1987, he became an assistant managing editor with Phoenix Newspapers Inc., which published the Arizona Republic. Finberg went on to hold positions including art director and managing editor at the Republic.\nIn 1994, Finberg was named Senior Editor for Information Technology for the Republic and its sister newspaper, the Phoenix Gazette. Finberg led the creation of Arizona Central, an early online news portal. The site is now owned by USA Today.\nBy 1998, Finberg was Director of Information Technology for Central Newspapers Inc., by then the Republic's parent company.\nBy 2000, Finberg was Vice President of CNI Ventures, the investment unit of Central Newspapers. CNI invested in efforts to develop technology for e-ink newspapers.\nFinberg has also held management positions at the San Francisco Chronicle and the Chicago Tribune, where he established the graphics desk. He has also worked at the San Jose Mercury News and the New York Times.\nFinberg was the founding president of the Society for News Design Foundation.\nPoynter Institute and News University\nFinberg first joined the Poynter Institute as its Presidential Scholar in 2002, tasked with examining technology's impact on media. He joined Poynter full-time in 2003 and stayed in various roles through 2014.\nAs Poynter's Director of Interactive Learning, and supported by a five-year grant by the Knight Foundation, Finberg led the creation of the online journalism training portal News University. News University debuted in April 2005 with just 10 courses and 3,000 users. The site grew to 200,000 registered users in 2011, when it had more than 275 courses.\nWhile the departments that used it generally felt that Journalism 101 filled a useful role, the idea of outsourcing course content to a third party generated controversy on some campuses where it was used. Participating universities dropped out within a year, and by 2013 Journalism 101 was on hiatus. Commenting on the program's stall, Finberg speculated that “we got ahead of the audiences” for online college courses.\nNews U now claims 410,000 registered users, and offers more than 400 courses in 7 languages.\nIn 2012, Finberg became Poynter's Director of Partnerships and Alliances.\nFinberg retired from Poynter in December 2014, but remained a consulting affiliate.\nHonors and recognition\nIn 2000, Finberg was named a “New Media Pioneer” by the Newspaper Association of America (now the News Media Alliance).\nIn 2015, the Poynter Institute created the Finberg Interactive Learning Fellowship. The fellowship supports a recent college graduate who works to support Poynter's online learning efforts.\nReferences"
