Battlefield Vietnam employs similar point-by-point objectives to Battlefield 1942 as well as a form of asymmetrical warfare gameplay. The two teams, the U.S. and North Vietnam, are provided different equipment and vehicles. The U.S. relies on heavy vehicles, employing heavy tanks, helicopters, and bombers. The Vietnamese rely on infantry tactics, utilizing anti-tank weapons. The developers intended to reflect the actual conditions of war throughout the game. The game features a \"Sipi Hole\" as a mobile spawn point, which is representative of the vast tunnel networks utilized by Vietnam forces.  Similar to previous games in the Battlefield series, spawn tickets (reinforcements) play a vital role in defeating the opposing team.\nBattlefield Vietnam features the United States with Marines, Army and the Navy; South Vietnam with Army of the Republic of Vietnam; and North Vietnam with People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong.\nBuilt on a modified version of the Battlefield 1942 engine, Battlefield Vietnam has new and improved features compared to its predecessor. The game gives the player a variety of weapons based on the war and features various contemporary weapons and concepts, such as the AK47 assault rifle and punji stick traps. The game introduced several vehicle improvements over its predecessor, such as air-lifting vehicles and working vehicle radios. The radios feature 1960s music and an option for the player to import their own audio files into a designated directory. Unlike in Battlefield 1942, players are able to fire their weapons from vehicles when in the passenger seat of a vehicle. The game is the first in the Battlefield series to utilize a 3D map, allowing players to see icons that represent the position of control points or friendly units, giving the player increased situational awareness.\nReception\n| CGW =\n| Edge = 8/10\n| GI = 8/10\n| GamePro =\n| GameRev = B+\n| GSpot = 8.5/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 9/10(Redux) 6.5/10\n| IGN = 8.2/10\n| PCGUS = 90%\n| rev1 = Maxim\n| rev1Score = 8/10\n| rev2 = Playboy\n| rev2Score = 88%\n}}\nIn June 2004, Battlefield Vietnam received a \"Gold\" certification from the [https://usk.de/en/ Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware] Deutschland, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
