It's a natural pool that's recognized as one of the most beautiful natural pools in the world. The name originates from a legend that tells the story of a Princess who liked to bathe in the waters of Grotta della Poesia. In turn, the beautiful princess has become the muse for countless poets in the Salento peninsula.\nIn reality the caves were most likely used for religious purposes. There are Messapian inscriptions on the wall that helped to decrypt the original purpose of the caves. From these inscriptions it becomes very clear that they are was dedicated to the worship of god Taotor, a Messapian deity.\nThis natural pool has attracted a flock of tourists each year. To combat this there has been an admission price introduced recently. It is in place to help protect this significant archeological area better.\nSources\n* Guglielmino, R. 2006. \"Roca Vecchia (Lecce): New Evidence for Aegean Contacts with Apulia During the Late Bronze Age\".
