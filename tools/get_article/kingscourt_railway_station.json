In 1888, the company was purchased by the Midland Great Western Railway. The MGWR envisaged extending the line from Kingscourt to  via , ,  and , but this never materialised. (A line from Castleblayney to Armagh, via Keady, was eventually built in the early 1900s and operated by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland).)\nFollowing the creation of the Irish Free State, the MGWR became part of the Great Southern Railways in 1925, which in turn became part of Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) in 1945. In 1947, CIÉ withdrew passenger services between Kingscourt and Navan. Goods services from Kingscourt to Dublin Port via Navan and  were re-routed via  in 1958 and then largely withdrawn in 1963, following which the section to Navan was used almost exclusively for the transport of gypsum from a terminal adjacent to the station, owned and operated by BPB Gypsum Industries.\nAfter a strike by Irish Rail staff in 2001, Gypsum Industries decided to transfer its traffic to road. The last gypsum train departed Kingscourt on 30 October 2001. The last train of all to operate to and from Kingscourt was a weed-spraying train on 7 June 2002, after which the line was disconnected at Tara Junction in Navan. The line was eventually lifted to create the Boyne Valley to Lakelands Greenway, which was completed in 2024.\nThe station building at Kingscourt remains intact today, having been partially restored in the mid-2000s. Also still extant are the station's single platform, the gypsum terminal and a goods shed.\nReferences"
