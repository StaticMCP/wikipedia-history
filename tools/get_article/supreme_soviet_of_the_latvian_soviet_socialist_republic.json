The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR was established in 1940 as the People's Saeima and finally disbanded in 1990 and was briefly succeeded by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia. According to the 1978 Constitution of the Latvian SSR, representatives could serve an unlimited number of five-year terms. The Supreme Soviet consisted of 325 deputies before its dissolution.\nOrganization\nThe structure and functions of the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR were copied from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The sessions of the Supreme Soviet lasted only a few days twice a year, and decisions were made unanimously and with minimal discussion. Elections for the Supreme Soviet were held in 1947, 1951, 1955, 1959, 1963, 1967, 1971, 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990. The number of deputies in the Supreme Soviet was increased from 310 to 325 in the 1978 Constitution of the Latvian SSR. The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR gathered and met at the House of the Livonian Noble Corporation; the building currently houses the Saeima of Latvia.\nChairmen of the Supreme Soviet\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Portrait\n!Chairman\n!From\n!To\n|-\n|\n|\n|25 August 1940\n|14 October 1948\n|-\n|\n|Pēteris Zvaigzne\n|14 October 1948\n|1953\n|-\n|\n|\n|1956\n|1957\n|-\n|\n|\n|5 June 1957\n|20 March 1963\n|-\n|\n|\n|20 March 1963\n|7 July 1971\n|-\n|\n|\n|7 July 1971\n|3 July 1975\n|-\n|\n|\n|3 July 1975\n|29 March 1985\n|-\n|\n|Aleksandrs Drīzulis\n|29 March 1985\n|27 July 1989\n|-\n|\n|Anatolijs Gorbunovs\n|27 July 1989\n|4 May 1990\n|}\nChairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Portrait\n!Chairman\n!From\n!To\n|-\n|\n|Augusts Kirhenšteins(1872–1963)\n|25 August 1940\n|10 March 1952\n|-\n|\n|Kārlis Ozoliņš(1905–1987)\n|10 March 1952\n|27 November 1959\n|-\n|\n|Jānis Kalnbērziņš(1893–1986)\n|27 November 1959\n|5 May 1970\n|-\n|\n|Vitālijs Rubenis(1914–1994)\n|5 May 1970\n|20 August 1974\n|-\n|\n|(1919–2007)\n|20 August 1974\n|22 July 1985\n|-\n|\n|Jānis Vagris(1930–2023)\n|22 July 1985\n|6 October 1988\n|-\n|\n|Anatolijs Gorbunovs(born 1942)\n|6 October 1988\n|4 May 1990\n|}\nSee also\n* On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia\n* Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union\n* Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia\n* Saeima\nReferences"
