The ceremony was held annually thereafter.\nStarting from the 15th ceremony in 1997, the award was jointly organized by China Federation of Literary and Art Circles (CFLAC) and the China Television Artists Association (CTAA). It was therefore renamed the China TV Golden Eagle Award, becoming a national comprehensive television art award. Initially focused on TV drama categories, it later expanded to include TV entertainment programs, documentaries, art films, and commercials. Each category comprises two main types of awards: \"Best Work\" and \"Individual Achievement\". The selection process shifted to a combination of expert evaluations, votes from CTAA members, and audience participation. Final rankings are determined by aggregated scores from these three groups, with audience votes fixed at 40% of the total weight. In case of ties, TV drama awards prioritize audience vote counts.\nIn 2000, the 18th ceremony marked a major transition when  signed an agreement with CTAA and the . The company invested CN¥10 million to secure permanent hosting and commercial rights for the award, along with an annual payment of CN¥2.8 million to CTAA for expert evaluation fees. The award was upgraded to the China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival, aiming to become \"China's premier cultural festival brand.\" Changsha became the permanent host city, with Hunan Television as the official broadcaster. The original rotating annual awards ceremony evolved into a three-day festival, held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center from 2000 to 2020 and at Hunan Broadcasting System's \"Colourful Box\" production base in 2022.\nFrom 2005 onward, the Golden Eagle Award shifted to a biennial schedule.

Starting from the 6th China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival and the 23rd China TV Golden Eagle Award in 2006, the organizers materialized the image of the \"Golden Eagle Goddess\" by selecting a new-generation female star with outstanding representative TV drama works in the past two years to serve as the festival's spokesperson. The first actress to hold the title was Liu Yifei.\nOn the opening day of each Golden Eagle TV Art Festival, the chosen \"Golden Eagle Goddess\" performs a dance at the ceremony wearing a full-body golden gown. For the first three editions, the goddess was directly appointed by the organizers.

Liu Shishi ultimately won the title of the fourth \"Golden Eagle Goddess\" with 2.78 million votes. For the 11th China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival and the 28th China TV Golden Eagle Award, the organizers resumed directly appointing the goddess. Starting from the 12th China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival and the 29th China TV Golden Eagle Award, the title was again determined by online voting.\nSince 2022, the Golden Eagle Goddess was officially discontinued.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! width=\"6%\"|Year\n! width=\"24%\"|Actress\n! width=\"4%\"|Age\n! width=\"31%\"|Representative works\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2006\n| Liu Yifei\n| 19\n| Chinese Paladin, The Return of the Condor Heroes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2008\n| Li Xiaolu\n| 26\n| All the Misfortunes Caused by the Angel, Struggle, We Love You, Mr. Jin\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2010\n| Wang Luodan\n| 26\n| My Youthfulness, Struggle, An Xiang\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2012\n| Liu Shishi\n| 25\n| Chinese Paladin 3, Scarlet Heart, Xuan-Yuan Sword: Scar of Sky\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2014\n| Zhao Liying\n| 27\n| Legend of Lu Zhen, Boss & Me, The Journey of Flower\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2016\n| Tiffany Tang\n| 33\n| My Sunshine, Lady & Liar, Legend of Fragrance, Diamond Lover\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2018\n|Dilraba Dilmurat\n|26\n|Pretty Li Hui Zhen, ''The Flame's Daughter, Sweet Dreams\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020\n|Victoria Song\n|33\n|Find Yourself, Ice Fantasy, Moonshine and Valentine''\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Asian television awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://ent.hunantv.com/v/tv/7jyj/index.html 24th Annual Golden Eagle Awards official website]"
