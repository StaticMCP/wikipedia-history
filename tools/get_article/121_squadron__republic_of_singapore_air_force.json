The squadron goes by the motto of \"Seek and Destroy\" and the mascot is the brahminy kite.\nHistory\nSet up in 1973 with the commissioning of the SH 7 Skyvan 3M into the service of SADC. In 1993, the squadron found a new chapter to their successful career when they began operating the Fokker F50 MPA and UTL.
