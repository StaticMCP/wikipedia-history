(Art. 60 of the Internal Regulations of the Federal Senate).\nThe Dean of the Federal Senate, in this case, Oriovisto Guimarães (PODE–PR), will administer the oath of office en masse to the rest of the members of the Senate, and Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD–MG) will administer the oath of office to the new President.\nIncumbent President Rodrigo Pacheco was able to run for a second consecutive term and was re-elected for his office.\nCandidates\nConfirmed candidates\n* Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD) – Senator for Minas Gerais since 2019; Member of the Chamber of Deputies 2015–2019.\n* Rogério Marinho (PL) – Member of the Chamber of Deputies for Rio Grande do Norte since 2015, 2007–2012; Minister of Regional Development 2020–2022; Special Secretary of Social Security and Labour 2019–2020; State Secretary of Economic Development of Rio Grande do Norte 2012–2014.\nWithdrawn candidates\n* Eduardo Girão (PODE) – Senator for Ceará since 2019; Chairman of Fortaleza Esporte Clube 2017.
