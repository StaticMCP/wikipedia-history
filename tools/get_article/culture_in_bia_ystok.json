The attractions include performing arts groups, art museums, historical museums, walking tours of architectural / cultural aspects and a wide variety of parks and green spaces. Białystok in 2010 was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition, to become a finalist for European Capital of Culture in 2016.\nArts\nOne of the first Polish painters in the city was Józef Zimmerman, who was entrusted with the artistic setting of the ceremony welcoming the Polish Army in February 1919. In the same year, on September 20, the first exhibition of Jewish art was organized in the Warnholca passage. In 1926 and 1928, on the initiative of the Circle of Jewish Writers and Journalists, Oskar Rozanecki, a painter and stage designer, manager of the Jewish theatre Gilarino, presented his works. It was not until the 1930s that the participation of Białystok artists in exhibitions increased. In October 1930, a collective exhibition of the local artistic community was held in the Representative Hall of the Voivodeship Office in the Branicki Palace. Many works were collected, including: works by Józef Zimmerman and artists of the younger generation: Czesław Sadowski, Oskar Rozanecki and Ichiel Tynowicki. In March 1932 an exhibition of paintings by the Białystok Art Group \"Forma-Farba-Faktura\" took place. In addition to Sadowski and Tynowicki, it included Michał Duniec, Nachum Edelman and Bencjon Rabinowicz. Other famous artists were Salomon Białoóorski, Helena Malarewicz, Józef Sławicki, Zygmunt Stankiewicz, Piotr Sawicki and Alfons Karny.\nCinema\nIn interwar Białystok, there were five cinemas, the first two of which were established in 1919.

The intelligentsia came to Apollo (22 Sienkiewicza street), Modern (20 Piłsudskiego street) and Gryf (2 Kilińskiego street) to watch more ambitious productions in exclusive conditions, while the Polonia (18 Piłsudskiego street) and Świat attracted a less demanding audience. Interwar Białystok was practically not recorded on film. No interwar feature films were made, and there was no film studio. However, in 1939, famous Jewish filmmakers, brothers Saul and Icchak Goskind, owners of the Warsaw film studio Kinor, made the only surviving film depicting life in the city at that time. It was 'Jewish Life in Białystok'. The specificity of Białystok was that relatively many films with Jewish themes were shown there.
