For the 12th time, Stephen Fry acted as the host. The ceremony returned to the Royal Albert Hall for the first time since 1997, as the Royal Opera House, which has hosted the awards since 2008, was being refurbished.\nFollowing criticism at the lack of representation of ethnic minorities from the previous ceremony, BAFTA had announced steps to increase diversity across the industry, on both sides of the camera. However, there was again criticism at the lack of representation of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) actors, directors and films in the nominations. In the leading actor, actress and director fields, there were no BAME nominees, with the omission of director Barry Jenkins for Moonlight and actor/director Denzel Washington for Fences highlighted as particularly noteworthy.\nLa La Land won the most awards at the event, winning five—Best Picture, Best Director for Damien Chazelle, Best Actress in a Leading Role for Emma Stone, Best Cinematography for Linus Sandgren, and Best Original Music for Justin Hurwitz. Casey Affleck won Best Actor in a Leading Role for Manchester by the Sea, Dev Patel won Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Lion, and Viola Davis won Best Actress in a Supporting Role for Fences''.\nCellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason performed a solo interpretation of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" to accompany the In Memoriam section. Those remembered were Gene Wilder, Garry Marshall, Sue Gibson, Kenny Baker, Tony Dyson, Peter Shaffer, Paul Lewis, Michael White, Ken Adam, Guy Hamilton, Debbie Reynolds, Carrie Fisher, Abbas Kiarostami, Jim Clark, Simon Relph, Douglas Slocombe, Anton Yelchin, Robin Hardy, David Rose, Curtis Hanson, Clare Wise, Om Puri, Alec McCowen, Emmanuelle Riva, Andrzej Wajda, Michael Cimino, Antony Gibbs and Sir John Hurt.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Nominations\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| 11\n| La La Land\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9\n| Arrival\n|-\n| Nocturnal Animals\n|-\n| 6\n| Manchester by the Sea\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 5\n| Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\n|-\n| Hacksaw Ridge\n|-\n| I, Daniel Blake\n|-\n| Lion\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 4\n| Florence Foster Jenkins\n|-\n| Moonlight\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 3\n| Doctor Strange\n|-\n| Hell or High Water\n|-\n| Jackie\n|-\n| Notes on Blindness\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2\n| Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\n|-\n| Under the Shadow\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple awards\n! style=\"background:;| Awards\n! style=\"background:;| Film\n|-\n| 5\n| La La Land\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2\n| Lion\n|-\n| Manchester by the Sea\n|}\nIn Memoriam\n* Gene Wilder\n* Garry Marshall\n* Sue Gibson\n* Kenny Baker\n* Tony Dyson\n* Peter Shaffer\n* Paul Cowan\n* Michael White\n* Ken Adam\n* Guy Hamilton\n* Debbie Reynolds\n* Carrie Fisher\n* Abbas Kiarostami\n* Jim Clark\n* Simon Relph\n* Douglas Slocombe\n* Anton Yelchin\n* Robin Hardy\n* David Rose\n* Curtis Hanson\n* Clare Wise\n* Om Puri\n* Alec McCowen\n* Emmanuelle Riva\n* Andrzej Wajda\n* Michael Cimino\n* Tony Gibbs\n* John Hurt\nSee also\n* 6th AACTA International Awards\n* 89th Academy Awards\n* 42nd César Awards\n* 22nd Critics' Choice Awards\n* 69th Directors Guild of America Awards\n* 30th European Film Awards\n* 74th Golden Globe Awards\n* 37th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 31st Goya Awards\n* 32nd Independent Spirit Awards\n* 22nd Lumière Awards\n* 7th Magritte Awards\n* 4th Platino Awards\n* 28th Producers Guild of America Awards\n* 21st Satellite Awards\n* 43rd Saturn Awards\n* 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 69th Writers Guild of America Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
