We've admired the way she's carved her own niche in an industry that often supports bands more than it does solo artists. Her latest album is another solid body of work that has heard her diversify her song writing and incorporate some great new elements. She's pure class and she thoroughly deserves this award.\"\nAustralian Video of the Year\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"19%\" | Director\n! width=\"19%\" | Artist and Song\n! width=\"5%\" | Result\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Alex Roberts\n| Art vs. Science - \"Parlez vous Francais?\"\n|\n|-\n| Yanni Kronenberg and Lucinda Schreiber\n| Firekites - \"Autumn Story\"\n|\n|-\n| Sam Bennetts\n| Bluejuice - \"Broken Leg\"\n|\n|-\n| Pradeep Senanayake\n| Astronomy Class - \"Where You At?\"\n|\n|-\n| Ton Noakes\n| The Scare - \"Could Be Bad\"\n|\n|-\n| Chris Frey\n| Karnivool - \"Set Fire To The Hive\"\n|\n|}\nBrendan Hutchens from Triple J said \"There were some outstanding Australian music videos made in 2009 and narrowing down all possibilities to just six nominees was a tough ask. The Art vs Science clip 'Parlez Vous Francais' directed by Alex Roberts has a fantastic original concept, brilliant performances, perfect timing, great design elements, strong camera work and editing that all together produces an interesting relationship with the song and engages the viewer for the full 4 minute duration. It stood out as being brilliant amongst brilliance.\"\nUnearthed Artist of the Year\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! width=\"19%\" | Artist\n! width=\"19%\" | Notes\n! width=\"5%\" | Result\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| The Middle East\n| A musical collective based in Townsville.\n|\n|-\n| Philadelphia Grand Jury\n| Winners of the Sydney Big Day Out competition.\n|\n|-\n| Seth Sentry\n| A Melbourne hip hop artist.\n|\n|-\n| Washington\n| Winner of the Melbourne Big Day Out competition.\n|\n|}\nRichard Kingsmill said \"The Middle East won us and our listeners over with one simple thing - great songs. They really have a magical chemistry and it's exciting to have watched how they've progressed across 2009. Overseas interest is building and their debut album will be one of the anticipated releases of 2010. To think they were on the verge of breaking up before we spotted them on Unearthed makes us feel a little bit warm inside too.\"\nReferences"
