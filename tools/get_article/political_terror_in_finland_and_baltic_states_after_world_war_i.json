While there were various militant actors in the scene, including German Army and the Russian White Movement from the remnants of the Russian Imperial Army, the major polarization was between  \"the Reds\", or Bolshevik-influenced Communist revolutionaries, who wanted to establish the Soviet powers, and \"the Whites\" (not to be confused with Russian \"Whites\"), who wanted to establish independent states based on traditional democracy. Accordingly, the political terror during this period is roughly classified into the \"Red Terror\" and \"White Terror\".\nOverview\nThe four countries, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia had similar developments, all of them being the parts of the collapsed Russian Empire territorially close to each other and influenced by similar forces, with the exception of Lithuania, who had an additional conflict with Poland. Of these four, the bloodiest (and best researched) terror was in Finland (see ), where about 1,600 were killed in Red Terror and 8,100 killed in White Terror. The least organized political Red/White terror was in Lithuania, where about 100 persons were killed within this framework, mostly by anti-Bolshevik forces. The Latvian civil war was the second bloodiest conflict in the region: with about 4500–6000 terror victims. In Estonia the numbers were smaller. Tomas Balkelis writes that an apparent imbalance in death tolls, similar in all cases, may be explained by the fact that the victors had more time to carry out the killings, but it may be a more complicated issue.\nFinland\nAccording to the  database, the losses of \"the Reds\" (Red Guards),  \"the Whites\", and others in the period may be summarized as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Death toll in 1918\n|-\n!

The campaign targeted primarily Baltic Germans, who accounted for roughly 90% of prisoners, reflecting ideological, social, and ethnic motives rather than actual acts of resistance. Red Terror unfolded in two stages: an initial \"chaotic\" phase (November 1918–mid-January 1919) with sporadic violence, and a \"centralized\" phase (mid-January–May 1919), during which revolutionary tribunals, concentration camps, and investigative commissions systematically eliminated perceived enemies. Over 2,000 victims were reported, with an average of 400 per month, even though the Cheka did not operate in the territory of Bolshevik-occupied Latvia as it did in the Russian SFSR.\nThe terror was accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric, vilification, with individuals widely labeled as \"enemies\".\nAnti-Semitic incidents were relatively rare and generally ideologically motivated rather than organized pogroms. Religious persecution was also widespread: churches were desecrated, and clergy was attacked, although in Catholic Latgale local populations sometimes hid and protected religious figures from Bolshevik violence.\nDuring their four-and-a-half-month occupation of Riga, the Bolsheviks carried out extensive political repression, including arrests and executions. As anti-Bolshevik forces approached the city in May 1919, the Bolsheviks intensified executions of prisoners. At the Citadel Prison, anti-Bolshevik troops were able to free hostages, but at , the Bolsheviks managed to kill 32 prisoners, including members of Baltic German clergy, using bayonets and grenades.\nWhite Terror\nAnti-Bolshevik violence was primarily motivated by revenge rather than ideology. After joint forces of the Baltische Landeswehr, Iron Division, Latvian troops, and the White Army liberated Riga on May 22, 1919, a wave of reprisals was carried out against suspected Bolshevik supporters. Estimates of the victims vary widely: early official records cited 174, while the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party and communists claimed 4,000–5,000. Executions continued until June 1919 when Allied intervention halted them. Approximately 3,000 prisoners of war had fallen into the hands of the Landeswehr and Iron Division, some of whom were executed, while many others were released if vouched for and later joined Colonel Jānis Balodis' . Overall, about 700 people are believed to have been killed in Riga (roughly 450 after tribunal verdicts and 250 without trial) with the largest documented execution occurring on June 5 at Riga Central Prison. The Iron Division and Landeswehr were particularly noted for their brutality, while Balodis' batallion oversaw fewer casualties.\nThe execution of 18 Bolsheviks by the German troops near Riga on 26 May 1919, was captured on film by an American motion picture crew. Shown at the Paris Peace Conference, the footage reportedly influenced the Allied decision to withdraw German forces from the Baltic states. Later included in the 1920 documentary Starvation, the sequence drew criticism for its graphic content and contributed to the film's failure, though the execution footage itself survived in Hoover Institution Library and Archives and has since reappeared in historical documentaries, often misidentified as an episode of Russian Civil War.\nSee also\n*Red Terror (disambiguation)\n*White Terror (disambiguation)\nNotes\nReferences"
