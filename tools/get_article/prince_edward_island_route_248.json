Route&nbsp;248 begins at an intersection with Route 27 in the community of Cornwall just east of Route 19. The route parallels MacEwens Creek and the North River through farms and suburbs northeast of Cornwall into the village of Miltonvale Park, where it terminates at a junction with Route&nbsp;2. The route also serves as the main road through the community of Warren Grove.\nRoute description\nRoute&nbsp;248 begins at an intersection with Route&nbsp;27 (Main Street) in the community of Cornwall. Route&nbsp;248 proceeds eastward through Cornwall along Ferry Road, a two-lane residential street. Crossing over Mill Creek, the route leaves Cornwall, continuing east through the flat lands near Charlottetown. Paralleling McEwens Creek, Ferry Road reaches a junction with York Point Road, where Route&nbsp;248 turns north on York Point. Crossing through a rural section of Cornwall, the route runs north along the North River, soon reaching a commercial section of the town, where it enters an at-grade roundabout with Routes&nbsp;1 and 27, and continues north as Warren Grove Road.\nJust north of the roundabout, the route intersects with the eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;235 (Kingston Road). After Route&nbsp;235, Route&nbsp;248 crosses northwest into the town of Warren Grove, where it becomes North York River Road, a two-lane rural road. Paralleling the North River, Route&nbsp;248 bends northward into a fork with the terminus of Route&nbsp;225. North of Route&nbsp;225, Route&nbsp;248 continues north, no longer designated a collector highway, through the town of Warren Grove, soon crossing into the village of Miltonvale Park. Retaining the North York River Road moniker, Route&nbsp;248 reaches the shores of the North River, crossing between the river and numerous residences on the southbound lanes.\nAfter a curve to the northeast, the route crosses over the river and runs northeast into a junction with Route&nbsp;2. This junction serves as the northern terminus of Route&nbsp;248, just west of the center of Miltonvale Park.\nMajor intersections\n|location=Cornwall\n|lspan=3\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Roundabout\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;235\n}}\n|location=Warren Grove\n|lspan=1\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;225\n}}\n|location=Miltonvale Park\n|lspan=1\n|notes=\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougtone/sets/72157631778994769/with/8091824544/ Prince Edward Island Route 248 on Flickr]"
