There are 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe members of the 2024 Electoral College met on December 17, 2024, the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday of December as per the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022..]]\nWhile every state except Nebraska and Maine chooses the electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district. These electors are chosen by each party before the general elections. A vote for that party then confirms their position. In all states except Nebraska and Maine, each state's electors are winner-take-all. In Maine and Nebraska within each congressional district one elector is allocated by popular vote – the states' remaining two electors (representing the two U.S. Senate seats) are winner-take-both. Except where otherwise noted, such designations refer to the elector's residence in that district rather than election by the voters of the district.\nAlabama\nElectors: 9, pledged to vote for Donald Trump for President and JD Vance for Vice President:\n* Bill M.
