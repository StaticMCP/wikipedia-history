The program featured stand-up comedian Elvira Kurt and other cast members (Jean Paul, Laurie Elliott, David Reale, Ellen McKinney, Jamillah Ross and Levi MacDougall) poking fun at celebrities in the context of a mock newscast similar to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, with one interview guest at the centre of each episode.\nThe show began airing in April 2005.\nThe show was widely panned by critics, and was canceled after one season, in early 2006, due to poor ratings.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Popcultured\n\n#REDIRECT PopCultured"
