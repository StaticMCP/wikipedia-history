This is disputed however, others believe the mantle remained with his son - Grand Rabbi Dovid Chaim Erblich son of Grand Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Erblich (d. 2020), son of Grand Rabbi Moshe Yehudah Erblich (d. 1991), Sassover Rebbe, son of Grand Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Erblich, Porosover Rebbe, son of Grand Rabbi Yekusiel Shmelka Erblich (1800–1861), son of Rebbe Moshe Leib Sassover (1745–1807), founder of the Sassov dynasty.\nOther uses of the Sassover name\nRabbi Shlomo of Sassov\nIn the late 19th century, the descendants of Rabbi Moishe Leib of Sassov had become rabbis in other cities. The town people found themselves without a Rebbe. They asked Rabbi Sholom Rokeach, known as the Sar Shalom of Belz, for guidance as to whom to appoint as Rebbe. He advised them to nominate his grandson, Rabbi Shlomo. Rabbi Shlomo's father was the first Rebbe of Alesk and his mother was the daughter of the Sar Shalom. Rabbi Shlomo died in 1919. Rabbi Lipa Meir Teitelbaum, a great-grandson of Rabbi Shlomo \"of Sassov\" and the founder of Kiryat Yismach Moshe in Ganei Tikva, in Israel, was the \"Sassov\"-Keretzky Rebbe. In his first marriage, he was the son-in-law of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar. He died in March 1966, and was subsequently succeeded by his two sons (both from his second marriage to Rebbetzin Bluma): Grand Rabbi Yoseph Dovid Teitelbaum, the \"Sassover Rebbe\" in Kiryat Yismach Moshe and a son-in-law of Grand Rabbi David Moshe of Kretchnif (Rabbi Yoseph Dovid was a disciple of the previous Klausenberger Rebbe) and Rabbi Chanoch Henoch Teitelbaum, the \"Sassover Rebbe\" in Monsey, New York.\nSee also\n*History of the Jews in Poland\n*History of the Jews in Galicia (Central Europe)\n*History of the Jews in Ukraine\nReferences"
