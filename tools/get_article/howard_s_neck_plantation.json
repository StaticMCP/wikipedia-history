It was built about 1825, and is a two-story, three-bay brick structure in the Federal style. The house is similar in style to the works of Robert Mills.  It has a shallow deck-on-hip roof and a small, one-story academically proportioned tetrastyle Roman Doric order portico.\nAlso on the property are other contributing buildings: A one-story frame house, said to be the original farm dwelling dating from colonial times; a 20th-century frame house, an early 19th-century brick kitchen, two frame smokehouses, a frame tool house, two early carriage houses and a harness house, three log slave quarters, the manager's house, and a sizable tobacco barn.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nReferences"
