His father was a lawyer and attorney general for Nova Scotia. Archibald studied law in his father's office and was admitted to the bar of Nova Scotia in early 1831. The following October, Archibald was appointed chief clerk and registrar of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, replacing his brother in that position. By 1833, Archibald was an acting assistant judge of the Newfoundland Supreme Court. At the same time, he took on the additional job of chief clerk of the Newfoundland General Assembly.\nBeginning in 1857, Archibald served as British consul to New York, a position he held for twenty-six years until his retirement on 1 January 1883. From 1871 he also undertook the additional responsibility of acting as British consul-general for New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\nArchibald married Catherine Elizabeth Richardson, on 10 September 1834 at Truro, Nova Scotia. One of his daughters, Edith Archibald, became a suffragist and writer. Archibald died from pneumonia in Steyning, Sussex and is buried in the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=5343 Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]"
