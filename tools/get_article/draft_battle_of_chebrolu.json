In the end, the Western Chalukyas were victorious, and the Cholas were forced to retreat from Vengi\nBackground\nDuring the early 11th century, the Chola dynasty of Thanjavur was on the ascendant. The Chola influence in the eastern Deccan ruled by the Chalukyas of Vengi (the Eastern Chalukyas) was on the rise. With the help of the Cholas, Saktivarman had defeated Jata-Choda Bhima and gained control of the Vengi kingdom. The rise of Chola influence in the east was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas. Around c.1006 - 1007, a general of Satyashraya named Bayalnambi burnt the forts at Dhanyakataka (or Dharanikota) and Yanamandala. With these victories, Satyashraya was able to  establish himself temporarily at Chebrolu in the modern Guntur district.\nBut these early victories were temporary. The Chola King Rajaraja I mounted a two-pronged counter-attack. A large Chola army led by prince Rajendra Chola invaded and captured Donur in the Bijapur region, Banavasi, parts of the Raichur Doab (called Iditurainnadu), Unkal near modern Hubli, and Kudalasangama in modern Bagalkot district.\nAfter hearing of this, emperor Satyashraya along with his general Bayalnambi and his younger brother Dasavarman marched to face prince Rajendra.\nAfter marching to Vengi, the two armies would meet at Chebrolu\nBattle\nAt the battle of Chebrolu, Emperor Satyashraya would defeat the army under Rajendra Chola and at last reconquered these territories after defeating Chola army according to Hottur inscriptions which have also been noted by historians Suryanath Kamath  and R.C. Mujamdar. Emperor Satyashraya defeated Chola army in Chebrolu and captured it.\nAftermath\nAfter Satyashraya's victory, the Western Chalukyas would continue their battles against Rajaraja I and Rajendra, and in the end the Chalukyas would drive out the Cholas, but suffer heavy losses, including Satyashraya's younger brother, Dasavarman.\nReferences"
