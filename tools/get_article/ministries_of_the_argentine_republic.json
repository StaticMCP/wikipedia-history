The ministers are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the president. The current organization derives from the constitutional revision of 1994.\nHistory\nPrior to independence, the administration of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata was organized under the Royal Ordinance of Administrators () issued on 28 January 1782, under which there were eight , were Buenos Aires, San Miguel de Tucumán, Cuyo, Paraguay, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Potosí, La Paz, and Chuquisaca.}} each with a governor reporting to the viceroy. The governor had the police, finance, and the military under his direct control, and his lieutenant administered the courts. At first the revolutionaries retained the same system, only gradually dispersing the executive authority over a larger body of men. The first true cabinet posts in Argentina emerged in the early to mid-19th century first under the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and later under the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires. For example, the Department of Governance and War () was created on 28 May 1810 by the First Junta with Mariano Moreno as secretary, and although the First Junta sent out diplomates as early as 1810, it was not until 27 February 1813 that the Department of Foreign Business () was created under the supervision of the Secretary of State.\n;Argentine Confederation (1831–1852)\n* Ministry of War and the Navy\n* Ministry of Finance\n* Ministry of Interior\n* Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Ministry of Justice, Religion, and Public Education\n;State of Buenos Aires (1852–1861)\n* Ministry of Governance\n* Ministry of War\n* Ministry of Finance\n* Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n* Prosecutor's Office\n;Argentina (before 2023)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Logo\n!Ministry\n!Date formed\n!Fate\n!Now part of\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Defense\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Justice\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Economy\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Security\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Health\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of the Interior\n|\n|No changes\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Culture\n|1973\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Ministry of Human Capital\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security\n|1943\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Ministry of Human Capital\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Education\n|1949\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Ministry of Human Capital\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Territorial Development and Habitat\n|2019\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Ministry of Economy\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Transport\n|1949\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Ministry of Economy\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Public Works\n|1898\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Ministry of Economy\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Tourism and Sports\n|2001\n|Transformed into a secretariat\n|Secretariat of Tourism, Environment and Sports\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Women, Genders and Diversity\n|2019\n|Transformed into a provisional undersecretary until dissolving in June 2024\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development\n|2015\n|Fully dissolved\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation\n|2007\n|Fully dissolved\n|\n|-\n|\n|Ministry of Social Development\n|1955\n|Fully dissolved\n|\n|}\nCurrent ministries\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Portfolio\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Logo\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\" | Incumbent\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Since\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Coalition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Defense\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Radical Civic Union\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Together for Change\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of the Interior\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Republican Proposal\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Economy\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Justice\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" |Independent\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of National Security\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Health\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" | Independent\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Human Capital\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Union of the Democratic Centre\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ministry of Deregulation and State Transformation\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|}\nPresidential secretariats with ministerial rank\nThe 1983 Law on Ministries passed by then-president Raúl Alfonsín set the precedent for secretariats of state with ministerial rank. These secretaries respond directly to the presidency. As of the latest version of the Law on Ministries, these are the existing secretariats of the presidency counting with ministerial rank in the Argentine government.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Portfolio\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"7\" | Incumbent\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Since\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Coalition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | General Secretariat\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Legal and Technical Secretariat\n|\n|\n|\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Republican Proposal\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Together for Change\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Culture Secretariat\n|\n|\n|\n|  bgcolor=\"\" |\n| colspan=\"4\" |Freedom Advances\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Secretariat of Intelligence of the State\n|\n|\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" |Independent\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
