Koch to produce the ceremony for the eighth time. \"I am delighted that the Academy will have the benefit  of Howard Koch's experience  and creativity again this year,\" said AMPAS President Fay Kanin in a press release announcing the selection. \"We are extremely proud of the Awards programs Howard has produced for us in years past, and look forward to an equally graceful and exciting presentation this year. Five months later, it was announced that actors Walter Matthau, Liza Minnelli, Dudley Moore, and Richard Pryor would share hosting duties for the gala. According to news reports, AMPAS originally sought late night talk show host Johnny Carson to emcee the festivities again, but he declined the offer due to Carson having personal issues related to the recent breakup with his wife.\nMarty Pasetta directed the telecast; Bill Conti served as conductor and musical director. Actor John Moschitta Jr., who was known for his fast talking delivery in commercials, made an appearance at the beginning of the ceremony explaining the voting rules and procedures. Several members of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps from the University of Southern California made an appearance at the beginning of the performance of Best Original Song nominee \"Up Where We Belong\" from the film An Officer and a Gentleman. Peter Allen and Bernadette Peters performed a medley of songs in tribute to songwriter Irving Berlin. Ethel Merman was initially slated to perform alongside Allen and Peters, but she cancelled her appearance after suffering a stroke.\nBox office performance of Best Picture nominees\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 16, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $496&nbsp;million. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees, with $329&nbsp;million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Tootsie ($101&nbsp;million), The Verdict ($39.7&nbsp;million), Missing ($14&nbsp;million), and Gandhi ($11.9&nbsp;million).\nCritical reviews\nThomas Sabulis wrote in the St. Petersburg Times, \"The television show itself was one of the poorest academy presentations in recent memory.\" He also criticized production elements such as the opening number Kristy McNichol mispronouncing nominees names. Writing for the Austin American-Statesman, Diane Holoway commented, \"In the quarter of a century or so that I've been watching the gala event, this was the sloppiest production ever. And clocking in at well over three hours, it was one of the longest.\" Mansfield News Journal's Ray Dyson commented, \"The Academy Awards ceremony ran true to form Monday night. Every year when the biggest awards in moviedom are passed out there are two predictions that always come true — it will go too long and it will be boring.\" He praised the Irving Berlin tribute and actor John Moschitta's humorous and rapid recitation of the Academy voting rules, but found the telecast to be listless and filled with technical glitches.\nTelevision critic Howard Rosenberg of Los Angeles Times wrote, \"This telecast continues to be one of the best shows around, perhaps not as tightly produced as the Tonys, but unequaled for charisma and ogling charisma.\" The New York Times film critic Vincent Canby said, The 55th presentation, last Monday night, was everything one could have wished it to be, including dignified.\" However, he criticized the decision to reward Gandhi with the Best Picture award saying, \"E.T. and Tootsie are films. Gandhi is a laboriously illustrated textbook.\" The News & Observer entertainment editor Bill Morrison noted that the lack of suspense amongst the winners and repetitive \"thank yous\" in the acceptance speeches bogged down the ceremony, but he reserved praise for co-host Moore calling him \"a delightful emcee.\"\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 53.2 million people over the length of the entire ceremony. Moreover, the show drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony, with 38% of households watching with a 59% share. In August 1983, the ceremony presentation received five nominations at the 35th Primetime Emmys. The following month, it won an award for Michael Corenblith and Ray Klausen's art direction of the program.\nSee also\n* List of submissions to the 55th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
