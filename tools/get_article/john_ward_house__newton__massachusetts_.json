It was deemed eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, but its owner objected to the listing.\nThe house is a circa 1805 house built in Federal style on a  lot.\nThe house has a square plan with five bays on each side.  It has a truncated hip roof, and its entrance is flanked by elongated pilasters.\nThree comparable Federal houses along Ward street are:\n*Charles Hyde House, 175 Ward Street, c. 1801\n*Ephraim Ward House, 121 Ward Street, built in 1821\n*John Harback House, 303 Ward Street, c. 1800\nThe latter two are individually listed on the NRHP.\nReferences"
