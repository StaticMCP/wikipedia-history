Much of this military history of Canada is commemorated today with memorials across the country and around the world. Canadian memorials commemorate the sacrifices made as early as the Seven Years' War to the modern day War on Terror. As Newfoundland was a British Dominion until joining Confederation in 1949, there are several monuments in Newfoundland and Labrador and abroad which were dedicated to Newfoundland servicemen and women.\nThere are currently 6,293 war memorials in Canada registered with the National Inventory of Military Memorials, which is under the Canadian Department of Veterans Affairs. There are also war memorials across the world, some of which are operated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which are dedicated to Canada as well as the Commonwealth members. There currently are 17 in France, six in Belgium, four in the United Kingdom, two in Afghanistan and South Korea, and one each in Egypt, Hong Kong, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.\nThere are few examples of memorial art created by Indigenous peoples before the late nineteenth century. One of the best-preserved memorials is in Áísínai’pi, or Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, in southern Alberta. This UNESCO World Heritage Site houses an extensive series of small-scale petroglyphs incised on the sandstone bluffs of the Milk River, a number of them dating to thousands of years ago.\nWar memorials in Canada\nColonial period\nThere exists a number of memorials commemorating events that occurred prior to Canadian Confederation in 1867. In addition to pre-Confederation war memorials, a number of communities in Ontario also have cannons originating from the Crimean War. However, these cannons are war trophies gifted to various communities in Upper Canada after the conflict; and do not serve as a memorial. Prior to the twentieth century, Canadian memorials were dedicated to great leaders and victories, not the named deaths of ordinary service personnel.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\" border=\"1\"\n|- valign=\"middle\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Memorial name\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Map\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n|Battle Hill Monument\n|\n|Southwest Middlesex, Ontario\n|\n|Commemorates the Battle of Longwoods, fought during the War of 1812.\n|-\n|Battle of Cook's Mill Monument\n|\n|Cooks Mill, Ontario\n|\n|Commemorates the Battle of Cook's Mill, fought during the War of 1812.\n|-\n|Battle of Crysler's Farm Monument\n|\n|Morrisburg, Ontario\n|\n|Dedicated to those who fought and died in the victory at Crysler's Farm.\n|-\n|Battle of Eccles Hill Monument\n|\n|Frelighsburg, Quebec\n|\n|Commemorates the Battle of Eccles Hill, fought during the Fenian raids.\n|-\n|Battle of Lundy's Lane Monument\n|\n|Niagara Falls, Ontario\n|\n|Dedicated in 1895, the monument commemorates members of the British Army and Canadian militia during the Battle of Lundy's Lane.\n|-\n|Battle of Trois-Rivières Monument\n|\n|Trois-Rivières, Quebec\n|\n|Commemorates the British and Canadian soldiers who fought at the Battle of Trois-Rivières during the American Revolutionary War.\n|-\n|British Empire Loyalist Cairn\n|\n|Regina, Saskatchewan\n|\n|Dedicated to American settlers and the United Empire Loyalists who sided with the British during the American Revolutionary War.\n|-\n|Brock's Monument\n|\n|Queenston, Ontario\n|\n|Dedicated to Major General Isaac Brock, one of Canada's heroes of the War of 1812.\n|-\n|Canadian Volunteer Monument\n|\n|Toronto, Ontario\n|\n|Honours University of Toronto student volunteers who fell during the Battle of Ridgeway Lime Ridge, or died of wounds received in action or from disease contracted in service while defending her frontier in June 1866.\n|-\n|Defence of York Monument\n|\n|Toronto, Ontario\n|\n|In memory of officers, non-commissioned officers and men who were killed or died of wounds defending York (present-day Toronto).\n|-\n|James Wolfe Monument\n|\n|Quebec City, Quebec\n|\n|Dedicated to General James Wolfe, remembered chiefly for his victory over the French, and establishing British rule in Canada.\n|-\n|Liverpool Memorial Cairn\n|\n|Liverpool, Nova Scotia\n|\n|Highlights the role of privateers from the area during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.\n|-\n|Monument aux Braves\n|\n|Quebec City, Quebec\n|\n|Commemorates the Battle of Sainte-Foy, fought during the Seven Years' War.\n|-\n|Peace Arch\n|\n|Surrey, British Columbia\n|49°0′7.66″N\n122°45′23.49″W\n|Monument commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812.
