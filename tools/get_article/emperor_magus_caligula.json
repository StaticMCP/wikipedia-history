He has also been the vocalist of death metal bands Demonoid, replacing Christofer Johnsson, and Sanctification. He was the original vocalist for Hypocrisy and has featured in other extreme metal bands including Dominion-Caligula (with former Dark Funeral guitarist Dominion) and God Among Insects. He has also performed backing vocals for the Swedish black metal band Sportlov.\nIn July 2011, Witchery announced Caligula was joining the band, replacing Legion. In 2016, he departed Witchery due to hearing issues.\nEarly life\nBroberg was born in Ludvika.\nBeliefs\nCaligula is a practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism,  and while he has on one hand distanced himself from National Socialist black metal, like many other black metal musicians, he has generally assumed an apolitical stance, although he expressed disdain for former Islamic terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, with his audience when playing live. He has also denounced Roman Catholic priests due to widespread child molestation allegations.\nGazziero murder controversy\nCaligula was quoted as being \"somewhat impressed\" by the premeditated murder of Fr. Faustino Gazziero, a Catholic priest, by Dark Funeral fan Rodrigo Orias at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Santiago, Chile, further stating that \"He deserves some credit. You're not supposed to say that, but I don't care.\" Although he suggested the possibility that \"the music triggered him somehow,\" he denied Dark Funeral's music being the direct cause of Orias' murder of Gazziero.\nCaligula also recalled having met Orias at a Dark Funeral concert in 2003, where he burnt a cross on Orias' arm at his request with a Cuban cigar.\nFilm\nCaligula made an appearance in the Swedish zombie film Die Zombiejäger, playing a humorous part of a necrophile. Dark Funeral also provided two songs for the film, Godhate, which is played during the film's opening credits and Thus I Have Spoken, which is played during a fight scene.\nDiscography\nDark Funeral\nStudio releases\n* Vobiscum Satanas (1998)\n* Teach Children to Worship Satan (2000)\n* Diabolis Interium (2001)\n* Attera Totus Sanctus (2005)\n* Angelus Exuro pro Eternus (2009)\nLive releases\n* De Profundis Clamavi Ad Te Domine (2004)\nVideo albums\n* Attera Orbis Terrarum - Part I (2007)\n* Attera Orbis Terrarum - Part II (2008)\nSanctification\n* Black Reign\nGod Among Insects\nStudio releases\n* World Wide Death (2004)\n* Zombienomicon (2006)\nDominion Caligula\nStudio releases\n* A New Era Rises (2000)\nHypocrisy\n* Penetralia (1992)\n* Osculum Obscenum (1993)\n* Pleasure of Molestation (1993)\nThe Project Hate\n* Hate, Dominate, Congregate, Eliminate\nReferences"
