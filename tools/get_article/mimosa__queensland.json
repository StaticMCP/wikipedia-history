Mount Dawson () is part of the range and rises to  above sea level within the north-east of the locality.\nThe Fitzroy Developmental Road enters the locality from the west (Goomally) and continues north, forming most of the north-western boundary of the locality before exiting to the north (Coomoo).\nThe Dawson Range State Forest is in the north and east of the locality, extending into neighbouring Coomoo and Barnard to the north and Alberta to the east. Redcliffe State Forest is in the centre of the locality. Apart from these protected areas, the land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with a small amount of crop growing in the south of the locality.\nDemographics\nIn the , Mimosa had a population of 31 people.\nIn the , Mimosa had a population of 23 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Mimosa.
