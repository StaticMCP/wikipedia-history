The artists may be LGBTQ or allies. Artists are eligible who have released a full-length or EP-length album, or single sold through a major retail or online music store. In addition to the music itself, media interviews, public statements and other information may be considered when selecting nominees and award recipients. It is one of several categories of the GLAAD Media Awards presented by GLAAD, a US non-governmental media monitoring organization founded in 1985 (formerly called the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) at ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco between March and June.\nThe category was first presented at the 32nd GLAAD Media Awards in 2021 and is a companion to the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist. The inaugural recipient of the award was rapper Chika for her EP Industry Games. In the first two years of the category, artists were nominated for a specific album/EP however, as of the 34th GLAAD Media Awards, artists are instead nominated for their work as a whole.\nFor a music artist to be eligible, they must have achieved a breakthrough in the music industry by releasing an album or extended play during the eligibility period, and have it be sold in a major record shop or digital music store. The artist must also, through their music and live performances, have made a \"significant impact on LGBTQ visibility and acceptance\", with interviews and public statements also being taken into consideration. Artists nominated for Outstanding Breakthrough Music Artist cannot be nominated for Outstanding Music Artist in the same year.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 3 music artists. At the 34th GLAAD Media Awards in 2023, the award was given to Dove Cameron.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n| style=\"background:#99ff99; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8%\" | Award year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%\" | Artist\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%\" | Album\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30%\" | Label\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2%\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2021(32nd)\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" | Chika\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" | Industry Games\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" | Warner\n|rowspan=\"10\" align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Arca\n| Kick I\n| XL\n|-\n| Fletcher\n| The S(ex) Tapes\n| Capitol\n|-\n| Keiynan Lonsdale\n| Rainbow Boy\n|\n|-\n| Kidd Kenn\n| ''Child's Play\n| Island\n|-\n| Orville Peck\n| Show Pony\n| Columbia / Sub Pop\n|-\n| Phoebe Bridgers\n| Punisher\n| Dead Oceans\n|-\n| Rina Sawayama\n| Sawayama\n| Dirty Hit / Avex Trax\n|-\n| Trixie Mattel\n| Barbara\n| Producer Entertainment Group / ATO\n|-\n| Victoria Monét\n| Jaguar\n| Tribe\n|-\n! scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(33rd)\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" | 'Lily Rose\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" | Stronger Than I Am'\n|rowspan=\"20\"\n|rowspan=\"10\" align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| Arlo Parks\n| Collapsed in Sunbeams\n|-\n| Asiahn\n| The Interlude\n|-\n| Girl in Red\n| If I Could Make It Go Quiet\n|-\n| Jake Wesley Rogers\n| Pluto\n|-\n| Japanese Breakfast\n| Jubilee\n|-\n| Joy Oladokun\n| In Defense of My Own Happiness\n|-\n| Lauren Jauregui\n| Prelude\n|-\n| Lucy Dacus\n| Home Video\n|-\n| Vincint\n| There Will Be Tears\n|-\n! scope=\"rowgroup\" rowspan=\"10\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2023(34th)\n| style=\"background:#99ff99;\" colspan=2 | 'Dove Cameron '''\n|rowspan=\"10\" align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| colspan=2| Brooke Eden\n|-\n| colspan=2| Doechii\n|-\n| colspan=2| Dreamer Isioma\n|-\n| colspan=2| Ethel Cain\n|-\n| colspan=2| Isaac Dunbar\n|-\n| colspan=2| Jordy\n|-\n| colspan=2| Omar Apollo\n|-\n| colspan=2| Reneé Rapp\n|-\n| colspan=2| Steve Lacy\n|}\nReferences"
