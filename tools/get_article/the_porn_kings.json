      "text": "# The Porn Kings\n\nThe Porn Kings were a British dance music group, originally formed by Davy T, Paul Rowland, and Dan Evans.\nDavy and Dan were members of 2 Funky 2, best known for the 1993 hit \"Brothers and Sisters\". Davy was also a member of DJs Collective alongside Lee Butler, Paul Robertson, and Joe Da Bone, who were best known for the 1996 single \"Rock to the Rhythm\". Some vinyl copies were scratched out due to a fallout between Davy and Lee.\nThe group's first single was released as a white label called \"Pumping the Junk\". It featured an original sample from Josh Wink's \"Higher State of Consciousness\". The track was picked up very quickly by All Around the World Productions, where it was reworked and renamed \"Up to No Good\" in 1996.\nThe debut release became a hit in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The band released the album Up to No Good in 1999, recorded at P. K. Studios and PWL in Manchester, England. They also produced remixes for DJ Quicksilver, Young MC, Josh Wink, and Pamela Fernandez. Their track \"We're Watching You\" was included on the soundtrack of the 2001 film The Hole, starring Thora Birch and Keira Knightley.\nKenny Hayes joined the group to help write the second single and the group's debut album.\nFurther UK hits included \"Amour (C'Mon)\", \"Up to the Wildstyle\", \"Sledger\", and \"Shake Ya Shimmy\".\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Best of British –The Ultimate Clubbing Experience\n|\n* Released: 1998\n* Label: All Around the World (#GLOBE7)\n* Formats: Cassette, CD\n|}\nSingles\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Album\n|-\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| UK\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| UKDance\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| EUR\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| FRA\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| GER\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| NED\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| NOR\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| SCO\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| SWE\n! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| SWI\n|-\n| 1996\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Up to No Good\"\n| 28 || 2 || 40 || 30 || 20 || 70 || 8 || 37 || — || 46\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Best of British – The Ultimate Clubbing Experience\n|-\n| 1997\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Amour (C'Mon)\"\n| 17 || 2 || 33 || — || 44 || 52 || 13 || 12 || 56 || —\n|-\n| 1999\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Up to the Wildstyle\"(The Porn Kings vs DJ Supreme)\n| 10 || 8 || 43 || — || — || 50 || — || 14 || 59 || —\n|-\n| 2001\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Sledger\"\n| 71 || — || — || — || — || — || — || 59 || — || —\n| rowspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| 2003\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| \"Shake Ya Shimmy\"(The Porn Kings vs Flip & Fill)\n| 28 || 11 || 80 || — || — || — || — || 16 || — || —\n|-\n| colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:90%\"| \"—\" denotes items that did not chart or were not released in that territory.\n|}\nRock the Dancefloor\nMany of their songs are also featured on the Rock the Dancefloor compilation series of albums made by All Around the World for Preston-based radio station Rock FM.
