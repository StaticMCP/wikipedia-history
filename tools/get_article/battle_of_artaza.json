Jerónimo Valdés, at the time Minister of War, arrived at the area known as Las Amescoas with 22,000 men with the intention of definitively destroying the Carlist forces.[http://www.diariodenavarra.es/especiales/rinconessingulares/index.asp?sec=20060122 Diario de Navarra – Especial rinconessingulares de Navarra]\nZumalacárregui had 5,000 men, but had the advantage of knowing the terrain and practicing guerrilla tactics.\nFields of Artaza in Améscoa Baja seen from Zudaire.\nValdes’ troops maneuvered up the mountains in the area.
