The mountain rises  above sea level and is part of the Moogerah Peaks National Park. It lies within its namesake locality Mount Edwards, approximately 100&nbsp;km south west of Brisbane approximately 17&nbsp;km (10.5&nbsp;mi) from the town of Boonah. The mountain is the closest of the Moogerah Peaks to the Cunningham Highway and is 9&nbsp;km south of Aratula. Other prominent peaks in this Scenic Rim group of mountains includes Mount French, Mount Moon and Mount Greville.\nExplorer John Oxley named the mountain Mount Banister in 1824. Later renamed in 1828 by Alan Cunningham after Lieutenant George Edwards.\nThe Indigenous name, given by the Yugara people, is Wummun.\nThe summit is accessed by walking track that starts across the Moogerah Dam wall. The 2.7&nbsp;km walk to the top affords views across Fassifern Valley.\nBetween Mount Edwards and Little Mount Edwards (363 m) to the east, is Reynolds Creek which flows through a steeply sloped gorge.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111112215609/http://www.derm.qld.gov.au/parks/moogerah-peaks/culture.html DERM Page on Moogerah Peaks National Park]"
