The organization, which was led by Schafik Hándal, did not carry out any militant activities. A combination of targeting by the Nationalist Democratic Organization (ORDEN) on orders of President Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo and Communist Party General-Secretary Cayetano Carpio's decision to abolish the group led to the group's disestablishment in 1964.\nSee also\n*Communist Party of El Salvador\n*Unified Popular Action Front\n*Christian Federation of Salvadoran Peasants\nReferences"
