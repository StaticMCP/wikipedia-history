Both the Kojiki, and the Nihon Shoki (collectively known as the Kiki) record events that took place during Ōjin's alleged lifetime. Ōjin is traditionally listed as the first emperor of the Kofun period, and is primarily known for being the controversial son of Empress Jingū. Historians have mixed views on his factual existence; if Ōjin was indeed a historical figure, then it is assumed he reigned much later than he is attested.\nNo firm dates can be assigned to Ōjin's life or reign, but he is traditionally considered to have reigned from 270 to 310. According to the Shinto religion and Buddhism in Japan, Emperor Ōjin is the divine spirit of the deity Hachiman (八幡神). While the location of Ōjin's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Ōjin\" was used by later generations to describe this possibly legendary Emperor.\nLegendary narrative\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ōjin is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, which are collectively known as  or Japanese chronicles. These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The circumstances surrounding the future emperor's birth are controversial as they involve a supposed invasion of the Korean Peninsula as well as a biologically impossible gestation period (3 years). It is said by the Kiki that Ōjin was conceived but unborn when his father Emperor Chūai died. Empress Jingū then became a de facto ruler who allegedly invaded a \"promised land\" (Korea) out of revenge, then returned three years later to the Japanese mainland to give birth. The records state that Ōjin was born to Empress Jingū in Tsukushi Province sometime in 201 AD, and was given the name . He became the crown prince at the age of four, but was not crowned Emperor until 270 AD at the age of 70. Emperor Ōjin supposedly lived in two palaces which are now located in present-day Osaka. His reign lasted 40 years until his death in 310 AD, in all he fathered 28 children with one spouse and ten consorts. His fourth son  Ōosazaki was later enthroned as the next emperor in 313 AD.\nKnown information\nWhile the historical existence of Emperor Ōjin is debated among historians, there is a general consensus that he was \"probably real\". There is also an agreement that Ojin's three year conception period is mythical and symbolic, rather than realistic. William George Aston has suggested that this can be interpreted as a period of less than nine months containing three \"years\" (some seasons), e.g. three harvests. If Ōjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested. Dates of his actual reign have been proposed to be as early as 370 to 390 AD, to as late as the early 5th century AD. At least one Japanese historian has cast doubt on this theory though, by revising a supporting statement given in 1972. In this new narrative Louis Perez states: \"only kings and emperors after the reign of Ojin... ...are seen as historical figures\". In either case there is also no evidence to suggest that the title tennō was used during the time to which Ōjin's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Ōjin-tennō was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations.\nWhile the actual site of Ōjin's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a kofun-type Imperial tomb in Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ōjin's mausoleum, and is formally named Eega no Mofushi no oka no misasagi. At some point Ōjin was made a guardian Kami of the Hata clan, and is now also deified as Hachiman Daimyōjin. Outside of the Kiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei}} (&nbsp;– 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nFamily\nEmperor Ōjin's family allegedly consisted of 28 children, which include 2 unnamed princesses from a previous marriage. He had one spouse who bore him a son that would become the next Emperor, as well as 10 consorts.\nSpouse & concubines\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Position||Name || Father || class=\"unsortable\"| Issue\n|-\n| Kōgō ||  || Homudamawaka || Princess ArataPrince NetoriPrince Ōosazaki(later Emperor Nintoku)\n|-\n| Consort || |高城入姫命}} || Homudamawaka || Prince IzanomawakaPrincess KomukutaPrince Nukata no ŌnakatsuhikoPrincess OharaPrince Ōyamamori\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Homudamawaka || Princess AhePrincess Awaji no MiharaPrincess Ki no UnoPrincess Mino no IratsumePrincess Shigehara\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Wani no Hifure no Omi || Princess MetoriPrince Uji no WakiiratsukoPrincess Yata\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Wani no Hifure no Omi || Princess Uji no Wakiiratsu-hime\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Kawamata Nakatsuhiko || Prince Wakanuke no Futamata\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Sakuraitabe no Muraji Shimatarine || Prince Hayabusawake\n|-\n| Consort ||  ||  || Princess Hatabi no WakairatsumePrince ŌhaePrince Ohae\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Sumeiroōnakatsuhiko || Prince KatajiPrincess Kawarata no IratsumePrincess Tama no Iratsume\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Takenouchi no Sukune || Prince Izanomawaka\n|-\n| Consort ||  || Kibi-no-Takehiko ||\n|}\nIssue\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Status || Name || Mother || class=\"unsortable\"| Comments\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Nakatsu-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Nakatsu-hime || Would later become Emperor Emperor Nintoku.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Nakatsu-hime || Ancestor of , married Princess Awaji no Mihara (see below).\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Takakiiri-hime || Ancestor of .\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Takakiiri-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Takakiiri-hime || Ōyamamori died in 310 AD. and .}}\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Takakiiri-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Takakiiri-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Oto-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Oto-hime || Married to Prince Netori\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Oto-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Oto-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Oto-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Miyanushiyaka-hime || Uji was a Crown Prince.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Miyanushiyaka-hime || Metori died in 353 AD, and was married to Prince \"Hayabusawake\" (see below).\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Miyanushiyaka-hime || Yata was later married to Emperor Nintoku.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Onabe-hime || Uji was later married to Emperor Nintoku.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Okinaga Mawakanakatsu-hime || Ancestor of , and great-grandfather of Emperor Keitai.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Ito-hime || Hayabusawake was the husband of .\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Himuka no Izumi no Naga-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Himuka no Izumi no Naga-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Himuka no Izumi no Naga-hime || Hatabi was later married to Emperor Richū\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Kaguro-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Princess ||  || Kaguro-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Kaguro-hime || Very little is known about this person.\n|-\n| Prince ||  || Katsuragi no Irome || Very little is known about this person.\n|}\nFamily tree\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* Hachiman\n* Imperial cult\n* List of Emperors of Japan\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Aston, William George.
