The GAHM is sponsored by several German and American organizations. The museum, headquarters of the German-American Heritage Foundation of the USA, traces the 400-year long history of Germans in America from 1600 to now.\nHistory\nHockemeyer Hall\nJohn Hockemeyer was a German man who emigrated to the United States. After the Civil War, he became a wealthy merchant and a leader among Washington D.C.'s German community. In 1888, Hockemeyer constructed a Victorian townhouse that became a local center for the city's German-American business community and a meeting place for various German clubs and organizations, some of which Hockemeyer was a member of. In October 2008, the German-American Heritage Foundation of the USA purchased this building to establish the museum.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ugac.org/ German-American Heritage Foundation of the USA official website]"
