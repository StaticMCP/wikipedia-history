This metro station will be an interchange metro station between Pink Line and Blue Line.\nThis metro station will consist of the main Nagawara Junction which leads to Thanisandra, Yelahanka in the northside, Kalyan Nagar, Krishnarajapuram in the eastside, Bangalore East, Bangalore Cantonment in the southside and Hebbal, Yeswanthpur in the westside. It will also include prime locations like MSR Elements Mall, Bhartiya City and Manyata Embassy Business Park.\nAs per the latest updates, this metro station, under the second phase (Pink Line), covering the total distance of 13.8&nbsp;km stretch (Dairy Circle - Nagawara) is expected to be operational around December 2026  and under the Phase 2B, covering the stretch of 11.35 km (Krishnarajapura - Hebbala)  is expected to be operational around December 2027 (under Blue Line).\nHistory\nPink Line\nIn June 2017, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) sought bids for constructing the Nagawara metro station along the 4.59&nbsp;km Shadi Mahal Ramp - North Ramp stretch of the 21.25&nbsp;km Pink Line of Namma Metro. In November 2019, ITD Cementation India emerged as the lowest bidder for this stretch which aligned closely with the original estimate, thus leading to successful award for this company. They commenced the construction of this metro station as per the agreements.\nUnlike other underground stations on the Pink Line, Nagawara station features a different design. Typically, both the concourse level (ticketing and security area) and the train platforms are located underground. However, at Nagawara, BMRCL chose to construct the concourse level at ground level (at grade), while keeping the train platforms underground. The primary reason for this decision was due to the presence of a Rajakaluve (stormwater drain) near the northern end and make it easier for future expansion if it takes place.\nBlue Line\nOn November 17, 2020, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) invited bids for the construction of the  metro station, part of the 11&nbsp;km Reach 2B – Package 1 (Krishnarajapura - Kempapura) of the 37.692&nbsp;km Blue Line of Namma Metro. On September 14, 2021, Nagarjuna Construction Company Ltd. (NCC Ltd.) was chosen as the lowest bidder for this segment, with their proposal closely matching the initial cost estimates. As a result, the contract was awarded to the company, which led to the beginning of the construction works of this metro station as per the agreed terms.\nNagawara One\nNagawara one is a under construction commercial complex on top of the underground station. The commercial complex is expected to be of four floors with a toal area of 27,000 square meters.\nStation layout\nStation Layout - To Be Confirmed\n| legend = track\n| collapsible = no\n| map = ENDEa\\ENDEa\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to Train Terminates Here\n*P#\\PSTR(L)!~STRg\\PSTR(R)!~STRf\\*P#\nPSTR(L)\\PSTR(R) ~~ ~~ ~~ to Kadugundanahalli **\nHSTg\\HSTf\n| bottom = Station with two tracks and one Island platform** Under Construction\n}}}}\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 valign=top|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85 valign=top|Street level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500 valign=top|Exit/ Entrance\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|M\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control, station agent, Ticket/token, shops\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 rowspan=3 valign=top|P\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=85|Platform #Southbound\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=500|Towards → Next Station: Kadugundanahalli\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform | Doors will open on the right\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85|Platform #Northbound\n| style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"500\" |Towards ← Train Terminates Here\n|}\nStation Layout - To Be Confirmed\n| legend = track\n| collapsible = no\n| map = vCONTfgaq!~MASKa\\-STRq!~PLT-\\-STRq!~PLT-\\-STRq!~PLT-\\vCONTfgeq!~MASKa~~ ~~ ~~P# to  **\nvCONTgfaq!~MASKa\\-STRq\\-STRq\\-STRq\\vCONTgfeq!~MASKa\n\\PLT-\\PLT-\\PLT-\\~~ ~~ ~~P# to  **\n| bottom = Station with two tracks and two side platforms\n}}}}\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 valign=top|G\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85 valign=top|Street level\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500 valign=top|Exit/Entrance\n|-\n|valign=top|L1\n|valign=top|Mezzanine\n|valign=top|Fare control, station agent, Metro Card vending machines, crossover\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 rowspan=4 valign=top|L2\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform | Doors will open on the left\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85|Platform #Eastbound\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|Towards →  / Next Station: HBR Layout\n|-\n|Platform #Westbound\n|Towards ←  / Next Station: Veerannapalya\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" colspan=2 align=center|Side platform | Doors will open on the left\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=30 rowspan=2 valign=top|L2\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=85|\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=500|\n|-\n|}\nConnections\nEntry/Exit\nSee also\n*Bangalore\n*List of Namma Metro stations\n*Transport in Karnataka\n*List of metro systems\n*List of rapid transit systems in India\n*Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://english.bmrc.co.in BMRCL English]  - BMRCL Official Website\n* [http://www.urbanrail.net UrbanRail.Net] – descriptions of all metro systems in the world, each with a schematic map showing all stations.\n__FORCETOC__"
