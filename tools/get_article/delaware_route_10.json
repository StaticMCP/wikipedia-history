It runs from Maryland Route&nbsp;287 (MD&nbsp;287) at the Maryland border in Sandtown east to an interchange with the DE&nbsp;1 freeway at the North Gate of Dover Air Force Base in the southeastern part of the city of Dover. The route passes through the towns of Camden and Wyoming along the way. From the Maryland border to Camden, it is a two-lane undivided road that passes through rural areas. DE&nbsp;10 is a four-lane divided highway called Lebanon Road between U.S. Route&nbsp;13 (US&nbsp;13) in Camden and DE&nbsp;1. DE&nbsp;10 has one alternate route, DE&nbsp;10 Alternate (DE&nbsp;10 Alt.), which runs between Willow Grove and Highland Acres along an alignment further to the south, passing through Woodside and Rising Sun.\nWhat is now DE&nbsp;10 between the Maryland border and Camden was constructed as a state highway in stages in the 1920s and early 1930s. The route was first designated by 1936 to follow its current alignment between the Maryland border and Camden and current Rising Sun Road to US&nbsp;113 Alt. in Rising Sun. By 1969, DE&nbsp;10 was rerouted to follow Lebanon Road, a road completed by 1966, to US&nbsp;113 (now DE&nbsp;1) at Dover Air Force Base. Lebanon Road was improved into a divided highway by 1981.\nRoute description\nDE&nbsp;10 begins at the Maryland border west of the community of Sandtown, where the road continues west into that state as MD&nbsp;287. From the state line, the route heads east on two-lane undivided Willow Grove Road through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. DE&nbsp;10 passes through Sandtown, where it intersects Sandtown Road. The road curves northeast and runs through the community of Petersburg before coming to an intersection with the western terminus of DE&nbsp;10 Alt. DE&nbsp;10 passes to the southeast of the community of Willow Grove and continues northeast. The route heads through rural areas with increasing residential development and intersects DE&nbsp;15 at a roundabout, where the route briefly becomes a divided highway, before crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade.\nThe road continues northeast into the town of Camden and passes homes along with some businesses, becoming Caesar Rodney Avenue at the South Street intersection. DE&nbsp;10 forms the border between the town of Wyoming to the west and Camden to the east and curves north before turning east onto Camden Wyoming Avenue and fully entering Camden. The route continues through residential areas, passing north of the Camden Friends Meetinghouse and crossing US&nbsp;13 Alt. in the center of town. On the eastern edge of Camden, the road turns into a divided highway and comes to an intersection with US&nbsp;13.\nPast the intersection with US&nbsp;13, DE&nbsp;10 becomes West Lebanon Road, a four-lane divided highway, and intersects Rising Sun Road, which leads southeast to the community of Rising Sun. The road heads east-northeast and passes through areas of suburban residential development to the south of the city of Dover in Highland Acres. The route comes to an intersection with South State Street, where DE&nbsp;10 Alt. returns to the route. DE&nbsp;10 becomes East Lebanon Road and runs east through a mix of residential and commercial development. The route intersects Sorghum Mill Road, which leads south to the community of Lebanon, and curves to the northeast. The road crosses the St. Jones River in marshland and continues into a business area, reaching an interchange with access to and from the southbound direction the DE&nbsp;1 freeway. DE&nbsp;10 comes to its eastern terminus within this interchange at an intersection with Bay Road at the North Gate of Dover Air Force Base. Bay Road heads north to provide access to and from the northbound direction of DE&nbsp;1.\nThe portion of the route between the Maryland border and US&nbsp;13 Alt. in Camden and between DE&nbsp;10 Alt. and Gateway South Boulevard near Lebanon is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE&nbsp;10 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 23,644&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern terminus at Bay Road to a low of 2,774&nbsp;vehicles at the Sandtown Road intersection.\nHistory\nBy 1920 what is now DE&nbsp;10 existed as an unimproved county road. The portion of the current route through Camden, as well as the road between Camden and Rising Sun, was upgraded to a state highway by 1924. By 1925 the road was completed as a state highway between Willow Grove and Camden, while the portion between the Maryland border near Sandtown and Willow Grove was under proposal as a state highway. The portion of road west of Willow Grove became a state highway by 1931. DE&nbsp;10 was assigned to run from the Maryland border near Sandtown to US&nbsp;113 Alt. (South State Street) in Rising Sun by 1936, following its current alignment between the Maryland border and Camden and Rising Sun Road between Camden and Rising Sun. By 1964, the route was realigned to bypass Willow Grove to the southeast, with the former alignment now Willow Tree Circle. The Lebanon Road portion of DE&nbsp;10 was constructed by 1966, connecting the route east of Camden to US&nbsp;113 (Bay Road) at Dover Air Force Base. DE&nbsp;10 was rerouted to follow Lebanon Road to US&nbsp;113 by 1969.\nThe Lebanon Road portion of the route between US&nbsp;13 and US&nbsp;113 was completely widened into a divided highway by 1981. In 1993, the DE&nbsp;1 freeway was completed in the area of the eastern terminus, with an interchange to that road built that incorporated ramps to both DE&nbsp;10 and the existing US&nbsp;113, which merged with DE&nbsp;1 at this point. The US&nbsp;113 designation was removed from the area in 2004, leaving DE&nbsp;10 terminating only with DE&nbsp;1. On June&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2017, construction began for a roundabout at the junction with DE&nbsp;15 west of Camden in order to improve safety at the intersection. The roundabout was completed by September&nbsp;2017.\nThere are plans to build a bypass of the section of DE&nbsp;10 through Camden in order to improve safety and reduce congestion on the alignment through the town. The bypass is proposed to run to the south of Camden, running from DE&nbsp;10 at the western end of Camden east to a roundabout with DE&nbsp;10 and Rising Sun Road east of the town. Construction of the bypass is planned to begin in 2024 and be completed in 2026. On July 10, 2024, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for the eastern portion of the bypass east of the US&nbsp;13 intersection, with Delaware Department of Transportation secretary Nicole Majeski and state and local officials in attendance.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Maryland state line; western terminus\n}}\n|notes=Western terminus of DE&nbsp;10 Alt.\n}}\n|notes=Roundabout\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of DE&nbsp;10 Alt.\n}}\n|notes=DE&nbsp;1 exit&nbsp;95; access to northbound DE&nbsp;1 and from southbound DE&nbsp;1 via Bay Road; eastern terminus\n}}\nDelaware Route 10 Alternate\nDelaware Route&nbsp;10 Alternate (DE&nbsp;10 Alt.) is an alternate route of DE&nbsp;10 between Willow Grove and Highland Acres. The route heads east from DE&nbsp;10 on two-lane undivided Henry Cowgill Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes and crossing Tidbury Creek. DE&nbsp;10 Alt. reaches the town of Woodside and intersects DE&nbsp;15, with that route becoming concurrent with DE&nbsp;10 Alt. on Main Street. The road crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade and becomes lined with homes. At an intersection with US&nbsp;13 Alt., DE&nbsp;15 splits from DE&nbsp;10 Alt. by heading south of US&nbsp;13 Alt. DE&nbsp;10 Alt. becomes Walnut Shade Road and comes to an intersection with US&nbsp;13 on the eastern edge of Woodside. Past this intersection the route passes to the south of Polytech High School and enters a mix of farms, woods, and residential development to the north of the community of Woodside East, curving to the northeast and reaching an intersection with Peachtree Run before heading north-northeast. DE&nbsp;10 Alt. reaches the community of Rising Sun, turning northeast onto Sorghum Mill Road at the Voshells Mill Star Hill Road/Rising Sun Road intersection before making a turn to the north onto South State Street. The route passes through woods, crossing Tidbury Creek, and runs through residential development before ending at another intersection with DE&nbsp;10, with South State Street continuing north toward Dover.\nThe portion of the route between Voshells Mill Star Hill Road/Rising Sun Road and South State Street/Sorghum Mill Road in Rising Sun is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE&nbsp;10 Alt. has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 11,746&nbsp;vehicles at the eastern terminus at DE 10 to a low of 1,341&nbsp;vehicles at the western border of Woodside.\nThe road was constructed as a state highway between Woodside and Rising Sun in 1931 and between Willow Grove and Woodside the following year. DE&nbsp;10 Alt. was designated by 1988 onto its current alignment. Prior to 2004, the South State Street portion of DE&nbsp;10 Alt. was concurrent with US&nbsp;113 Alt., which was decommissioned when US&nbsp;113 was truncated from Dover to Milford. There are plans to construct a roundabout at the intersection with Peachtree Run east of Woodside. Construction is planned to begin in the later part of 2024 and be completed in 2025.\n;Major intersections\n|notes=Western terminus\n}}\n|notes=West end of DE&nbsp;15 overlap\n}}\n|notes=East end of DE&nbsp;15 overlap\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus\n}}\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-010/ DE&nbsp;10 at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.alpsroads.net/roads/de/de_10/ Delaware Roads - DE&nbsp;10 and Alt.
