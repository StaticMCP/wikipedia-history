      "text": "# Dynasty IT\n\nThe Dynasty IT was a Canadian electric car produced by Dynasty Electric Car Corporation, designed to qualify as a neighbourhood electric vehicle, primarily made for urban, recreational and light commercial markets.  It was available in five variants including a sedan, mini pick-up, van and two open air versions. The North American version has a range of up to 50&nbsp;kilometres (30&nbsp;miles) and does not exceed 40&nbsp;kilometres/hour (25&nbsp;mph). Most models have a curb weight of 653&nbsp;kilograms (1450&nbsp;lb).\nDynasty was bought by Karakoram Motors of Pakistan, who in 2018 said they planned to produce it in Pakistan.\nUse of the vehicle was legal as a low-speed vehicle (LSV) in British Columbia and 47 US states. A version of the car appeared on the American Sci-Fi Channel TV series Eureka. For the show's purposes, it is covered with photovoltaic cells to appear to be a solar-powered car.\nGallery\nFile:NEV-iT-BlueSedan-RFQ0254.JPG|Four passenger sedan\nFile:NEV-iT-RedUtil-RRQ0256.JPG|Two passenger utility\nFile:NEV-iT-RedUtil-Side0255.JPG|Load area has rear and right side doors\nFile:NEV-iT-RedUtil-FR0257.JPG|\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.itiselectric.com/ Dynasty Electric Car Corp.]"
