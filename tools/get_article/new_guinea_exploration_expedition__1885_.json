The expedition lasted for six months from 10 June to 3 December 1885, of which five months were spent in New Guinea. They named and explored the Strickland River, and made vast biological discoveries, including numerous species.\nHistory\nAn exploring expedition was sent to New Guinea on behalf of the three eastern colonies of Australia: Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. The major organisation was done in Sydney, but the other two branches of the society also contributed financially. The Australian Museum in Sydney also had the right of the expedition material choice, particularly regarding zoological collections. The party consisted of Captain Henry Charles Everill; sub-leaders Godfrey Hemsworth and R. G. Creagh; chief scientist and chief zoologist Dr. W. Haacke and his assistant W. Froggatt; surgeon, botanist and geologist Dr. Bernays; general collector and also assistant of the chief scientist Kendall Broadbent; botanic collector E. W. Bauerlen of Sydney; and photographer James H. Shaw.\nThe objects of the expedition were . . . to ascertain and fix the geographical features of New Guinea and the nature of its fauna, flora, geology, and climate, and to illustrate the same by specimens, sketches, photographs, and written descriptions. The leader has been requested to obtain and note information regarding the language, habits, and customs of the natives; the character of their implements and utensils, and, in reference to their modes of sepulture, what implements, if any, or food, are buried with their dead, also, whether periodic feasts are held at the graves, and the traditional object of such customs. He has also to note the distance and course travelled, and to describe and fix the position of all the principal physical features of the country along the line of route, and on either side of it, as far as practicable, and daily to complete, from his observations, a feature map of the country traversed, a copy of which may be furnished to the scientific officers of the party, if desired. He is to note the number, character, distance apart, and general trend or fall of all water courses, or drainage channels crossed, the quality of water, if any, in such courses or channels; the mode of occurrence of water; springs, lakes, pools or running streams, with average depth of the same; the indications relative to probable permanence or otherwise of the same; also of periodical floods.\nThe Society chartered the Australasian Steam Navigation Company's steam launch Bonito, of 77 tons gross register as its river boat. It left Sydney in tow of Egmont on 10 June, and left Moreton Bay on 17 June 1885 in tow of the company's steamer Wentworth for Townsville and thence to Thursday Island by the A.S.N. ferry Alexandra. The Queensland Government steamer Advance (Captain Williams), took her to the mouth of the Fly River, where she was met by the Hon. John Douglas and Rev. McFarlane aboard the missionary steamer Mary. From there she would make her way to Mibu Island, in the Fly delta, and take on coal and fresh provisions from the schooner Mavis before proceeding up-river.\n:Their original target, the Aird River, some 100 km further around the Gulf of Papua, was abandoned when it was learned how difficult crossing the river mouth could be.\nThey proceeded up the Fly river to about  past Ellangowan Island to a major tributary on the north-east side, which on 28 July they named Strickland River in honour of Sir Edward Strickland president of the Society. They proceeded up the Strickland to a point where the Bonito got stranded on a shoal or gravel bed, and a smaller party, consisting of Everill, Haacke, Shaw, Creagh, Froggatt and Waddick and some of the Javanese, proceeded another  in the whaleboat.\nOn returning to base they found tropical rains had lifted the Bonito off the shoal into deep water, so they steamed down the river and reached Thursday Island, and were back in Sydney on 3 December 1885.\nStories had somehow reached Thursday Island through Rev. McFarlane, that the whole expedition had been surprised and massacred during the night and the Bonito had been looted and burnt. Accounts of supposed disaster were published in Sydney and Melbourne papers of 9 November and were not contradicted until the party had returned to Thursday Island. By this time a punitive expedition had been despatched from Thursday Island and a gun-boat was on its way up from Sydney.\nExploration\nZoological specimens were collected by most of the expedition members.\nInteractions with Papuan Peoples\nCollections\nThe people\nThe Europeans of the party were:\n*Captain Henry Charles Everill (c.1847 – 7 September 1900)\nShips captain, ex-tobacco planter, spoke Malay fluently.
