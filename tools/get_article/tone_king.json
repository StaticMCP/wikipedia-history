In 1994 Mark moved the company to Baltimore.\nTone King is one of the boutique \"vintage\" amplifier companies making Fender style amps. Tone King was owned by the company Premier Builders Guild. In 2016, Premier Builders Guild went out of business and sold the Tone King brand to Boutique Amps Distribution, which now manufacturers these amps in Huntington Park, California.\nIn January 2016, Tone King introduced the new Royalist 45 Mk II amplifier, an updated version of Tone King's Royalist amplifier, known for its low-gain British sound qualities. That same month, Tone King introduced an updated version of its Ironman attenuator, the Ironman II Mini.\nThere are 4 different amplifiers in the current lineup that all feature the Ironman compensated reactive load attenuation: Gremlin Combo, Falcon Grande Combo, Imperial Head and Combo, Sky King.\nCritical acclaim\nOf the Tone King Ironman II Mini attenuator, Guitar Player magazine reviewer Dave Hunter said this in a June 28, 2016 review: \"The Ironman II Mini will go down to whisper-quiet, and sound reasonably good in the process, but the better test was in knocking off a reasonable 6dB to 9dB, at which levels I found it impressively accurate and unobtrusive.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.toneking.com Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110606131228/http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/new-tube-amps/Jan-00/6672 Guitar Player review]\n*[http://reviews.harmony-central.com/reviews/Guitar+Amp/product/Tone+King/Imperial/10/1 Harmony Central reviews]\n*[http://www.guitarworld.com/features-news-interviews/chaos-and-calm-james-bay-talks-songwriting-opening-stones-and-more/%0924583 Guitarist James Bay references his use of Tone King amplifiers.]"
