Born in England to Welsh parents, he represented Wales internationally.\nEdwards began his career with Aston Villa, making his senior debut in the Premier League. He then moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2004, where he spent four seasons at Championship level. He helped both Blackpool and Norwich to promotions to the Premier League and featured for Barnsley in the Championship before retiring due to injury in 2013. He played international football for Wales, making his debut in 2004 and winning 15 caps in total. His father also played for Wales, at U18 level. He completed his coaching badges with the Football Association of Wales and moved into management after retiring as a player.\nEdwards managed Wolves' academy and had an interim spell at the first team, before leading AFC Telford United and the England under-16 team. He guided Forest Green Rovers to promotion as League Two champions in the 2021–22 season. Watford appointed Edwards as manager in May 2022 but he was dismissed just four months later in September. He joined Luton Town later that year, leading the club to promotion to the Premier League via the playoffs. In January 2025 he left Luton Town by mutual agreement. On 24 June 2025, Edwards was appointed head coach of Middlesbrough, but left later in the year to rejoin Wolves as manager.\nClub career\nAston Villa\nEdwards was born in Telford, Shropshire. He started his career as an apprentice at Aston Villa, and worked his way up to his first-team debut on 28 December 2002, in a 1–0 home win over Middlesbrough. In January 2003, after playing in three consecutive matches at right-back he signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with the club. Edwards went on to make nine appearances in total for Villa, all during 2002–03. He was sent on loan to First Division club Crystal Palace in November 2003, where he spent one month, playing six games and scoring one goal in a 1–1 draw with Coventry City.\nEdwards then joined  fellow First Division club Derby County on loan in January 2004, where he stayed until the end of the season. He played ten games for the club, scoring a goal in a 2–1 home win over Gillingham on 17 January.\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nIn May 2004, Edwards was told by Aston Villa manager David O'Leary that he could leave the club. Edwards made the short journey across the West Midlands and joined Championship Wolverhampton Wanderers that July in a three-year deal for £150,000. After five games in August, he suffered an ankle injury and did not return until February 2005.\nEdwards gained more playing time in the 2005–06 campaign and he played the majority of the following season under new manager Mick McCarthy but suffered knee ligament damage in April 2007. that kept him out of the season's end as the team made the play-offs.\nHe again suffered knee ligament injury, in a reserve team match against Walsall in September 2007. He scored his only goal for Wolves on 9 February 2008 in a 4–2 home defeat to Stoke City. He was placed on the transfer list in May.\nBlackpool\nIn August 2008, Edwards left Wolves to join Blackpool, signing a two-year contract with an option for a further year for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for the Seasiders on 9 August 2008 in a 1–0 home defeat to Bristol City. Edwards was captain of the side for the 1–1 draw at Norwich City on 16 August as Keith Southern who had captained the side up to then in the 2008–09 season, was suspended. Manager Simon Grayson appointed him as team captain for the rest of the season. His first goal for the Seasiders came on 29 December 2008 when he scored Blackpool's second equaliser in a 2–2 draw against his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road.\nIan Holloway was appointed as Blackpool manager in June 2009, and gave Edwards 21 league appearances as the club went on to finish in 6th place, qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Nottingham Forest in the semi-finals, Blackpool won promotion to the Premier League by beating Cardiff City in the play-offs final, where Edwards was an unused substitute.   Ahead of the 2010-11 season he agreed a new contract with Blackpool, a one-year deal with an option for a further 12 months, with playing in the Premier League being the reason behind him signing. Edwards signed for Championship team Norwich City on loan until the end of the season in February 2011. He made his debut as a second-half substitute for Zak Whitbread in the 1–1 draw against Preston North End on 5 March, and made two more appearances as the club won promotion to the Premier League.\nBarnsley\nEdwards was released by Blackpool at the end of the 2010-11 season and signed for Barnsley. He made his debut for the club in a 0–0 draw against Nottingham Forest on 21 February 2012. After not making a first team appearance in 2012-13, Edwards was loaned to League Two club Fleetwood Town in 2012. The following 31 January, he returned to his home county and joined League One team Shrewsbury Town on loan for a month. Days after the deal was expanded for the rest of the season, he was ruled out with a thigh muscle injury in training. He retired from playing in October 2013.\nInternational career\nEdwards represented England at youth level, but not in a UEFA-recognised game, so qualified for Wales as his parents are both Welsh.
