In the 2024 elections, the Republican Party retained its majority in the House of Representatives and gained control of the Senate. Then-former president Donald Trump won a non-consecutive second term; he is ineligible for a third term as per the term limits imposed by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nBackground\npresident, Donald Trump. His second term will expire at noon on January 20, 2029.]]\nThe Republican Party returned to power in the United States in January 2025 with a government trifecta following the 2024 elections. Donald Trump, who was elected president in 2016 but lost a re-election bid in 2020 to Joe Biden, defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, who began her campaign following Biden's exit from the 2024 election. This election also saw JD Vance, a then-senator from Ohio, defeat Minnesota governor Tim Walz for the vice presidency. Trump's victory was credited to a post-pandemic surge in inflation,}} a migrant crisis at the U.S.–Mexico border,}} and a global anti-incumbent backlash. In addition, Republicans secured control of the Senate, flipping four seats and earning a three-seat majority, while also retaining a House majority, though the party's majority narrowed to three seats after losing two seats.\nElectoral system\nThe president and vice president of the United States are elected through the Electoral College, determined by the number of senators and representatives with an additional three representatives for Washington, D.C. A majority of 270 votes is needed to win the election. Forty-eight states use a winner-take-all system, in which states award all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote. In Maine and Nebraska, two votes are allocated to the winner of the popular vote, while each of the individual congressional districts have one vote. Electoral votes are certified by state electors in December and by Congress on January 6. Presidential candidates are selected in a presidential primary, conducted through primary elections run by state governments or caucuses run by state parties which bind convention delegates to candidates. A brokered convention occurs when a candidate does not receive a majority of votes on the first round of voting, or when a candidate withdraws.\nElection Day in the United States is held on the first Tuesday that falls after the first Monday in November. The 2028 presidential election will occur on November 7, 2028.\nEligibility\nThe United States Constitution limits occupancy of the presidency to individuals who are at least thirty-five, who have been a resident in the United States for at least fourteen years, and who are a natural-born citizen. Section three of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents current and former federal, state, and military officials from holding office—including the presidency—if they have \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" against the United States; in March 2024, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Trump v. Anderson that former president Donald Trump could seek office after challenges to his ballot eligibility were raised by several state attorneys general. A convicted felon may serve as president.\nIncumbent president Trump along with former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama are ineligible to be elected to a third term, as the Twenty-second Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice.\nElectoral map\n. Swing states are the states in lighter colors.]]Most U.S. states are usually not highly competitive in presidential elections, often voting consistently for the same party due to longstanding demographic and ideological differences. In the Electoral College, this results in major-party candidates primarily focusing their campaigns on swing states, which can swing between parties from election to election. These states are critical for a presidential candidate's path to victory. For 2028, the expected swing states likely include the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and North Carolina, all of which narrowly voted for Trump in 2024. Other possible swing states include traditional Democratic strongholds that shifted toward Trump and were only narrowly won by Harris in 2024: New Jersey and Minnesota; though 2025 polls show a reversal of pro-Trump trends.\nStates formerly considered swing states, such as Florida, Iowa, and Ohio, voted for Trump in all three of his previous election bids, as well as for Republican candidates in other state and federal elections, with increasing margins in each election and are now seen as solidly red states. Former red or swing states that, since 2008, have consistently voted Democratic include Colorado, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Virginia. Due to its recent record of voting Democratic even during Republican national victories, Nebraska's 2nd congressional district has been called \"the Blue Dot\".\nRepublican Party primaries\nCandidates\nExpressed interest\n| align        = center\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| mode         = nolines\n| height       = 160\n| width        = 160\n| captionstyle =\n|File:Bacon Don 119th Congress (3x4 cropped).jpg|(2017–present)\n|File:Rand Paul Portrait (cropped).jpg|\n|File:Official portrait of Secretary Marco Rubio January 2025 (cropped).jpg|\n|File:Consensus 2025 - Eric Trump 10 (3x4 cropped).jpg|\n|\n}}\nDon Bacon\nDon Bacon has served as the representative of  since 2017.

In December 2024, Ray Buckley, Chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, announced his intention to work towards restoring New Hampshire's status as the first-in-the-nation Democratic presidential primary for the 2028 presidential nominating calendar.
