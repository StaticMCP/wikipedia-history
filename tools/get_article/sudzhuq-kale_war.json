This was one of the largest Crimean invasions of Kabarda. The Khan demanded tribute from every household and asked Kabardian princes and their subjects to resettle along the Kuban River. The Kabardians refused to pay tribute. Crimean forces raided, plundered, and burned parts of Kabarda.\nAt the same time, the Ottoman Empire built the fortress of Sudzhuq-Kale (modern Novorossiysk) to strengthen its influence in the region. Circassian and Kabardian leaders resisted both Ottoman and Crimean demands, maintaining significant independence despite the military pressure.\nReferences"
