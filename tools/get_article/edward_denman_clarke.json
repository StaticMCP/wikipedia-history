Although he was credited with six aerial victories, he was granted a Military Cross for his valour in a ground attack mission.\nIn later life, Clarke was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire as the managing director of the aviation and shipping corporation Saunders-Roe.\nEarly life\nEdward Denman Clarke was born on 21 May 1898 in the Grand Duchy of Finland, where his St Petersburg-based family had a hunting lodge. He was educated at Eton College.\nWorld War I\nClarke joined the Royal Flying Corps in early 1916, being confirmed in the rank of second lieutenant on 19 May. On 21 August, he was appointed a flying officer and was posted to No. 45 Squadron RFC.\nHe was promoted to lieutenant on 1 August 1917, and scored six aerial victories between 23 August and 20 October.\nHe was shot down by ground fire on 26 October 1917, as he strafed enemy positions from his Sopwith Camel during the Battle of Passchendaele. His courage on that occasion earned him a Military Cross. The accompanying award citation, gazetted 23 April 1918, told the tale:\n:\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has shot down five enemy machines. In an attack he repeatedly dived to within fifty feet of the enemy infantry, firing between 500 and 600 rounds. Though struck by a piece of shell, which wounded him in both arms and shattered both petrol tanks, he succeeded in gliding back behind our lines.\"\nOn 1 August 1918 he was appointed temporary captain. On 31 January 1919, Clarke relinquished his commission in the Royal Air Force.\nAerial victories\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of aerial victories\n|-\n!No.\n! width=\"135\" |Date/time\n! width=\"150\" |Aircraft\n!Foe\n!Result\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 1\n| align=\"center\"| 23 August 1917@ 0915 hours\n| Sopwith 1 1/2 Strutterserial number A1048\n| Albatros D.V\n| Driven down out of control\n| Bellewarde Lake\n| Observer/gunner:G.
