This new award was designed for any up-and-coming artist or band who were unsigned. The award itself is differentiated from the Hope of 2010 award in that the Hope award is given to an artist or band already signed to a mainstream or independent record label. An artist or band who would like to be part of the Most Promising New Artist of 2010 nominations had to submit relevant particulars before January 11, 2010. The winner of the award is expected to perform at the event, appear at Oxegen 2010 and have 150 copies of their debut single released, including artwork.\nNominations announced on February 5, 2010:\n* Amasis\n** Ever27\n** Jody Has A Hitlist\n** Colm Lynch\n** Susie Soho\n** Three Plus Me\n** Sean Dempsey\nMultiple nominations\nBell X1, Christy Moore, Florence and the Machine (from the UK), Snow Patrol and U2 received three nominations each.\n; 3 nominations\n* Bell X1\n* Christy Moore\n* Florence and the Machine\n* Snow Patrol\n* U2\n; 2 nominations\n* Bruce Springsteen\n* The Coronas\n* Delorentos\n* Kasabian\n* Lady Gaga\n* Laura Izibor\n* Paolo Nutini\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://meteormusicawards.meteor.ie/?u=m/ Official site]\n* [http://www.mcd.ie MCD Promotions]\n* [http://www.meteor.ie/misc/MIMA.html List of winners through the years]\n* [http://www.hotpress.com/photos/photo_st.php?id=6243433 2010 photos] at Hot Press\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100310023608/http://www.state.ie/2010/02/features/the-meteors-no-funderland/ \"Meteor Awards – No Fun(derland)\": Review by Sophie Elizabeth Smith]"
