Despite the defeat, later in 1548, Yoshimoto defeated Nobuhide in the Second Battle of Azukizaka and continued to expand his territory until 1560, when he faced Nobunaga and was killed in the Battle of Okehazama.\nIn response to Oda moves into Western Mikawa, Imagawa Yoshimoto moved forces into Ikutahara in the 8th month of 1542. Oda Nobuhide responded to this by leaving his position at Anjô castle and crossing the Yahagi river taking up a position at Kamiwada, and in the 10th month, engaged in battle at Azukizaka, southeast of Okazaki castle.\nThe Imagawa vanguard was led by a warrior by the name of Yuhara of Suruga. Nobuhide was joined by his brothers Nobuyasu, Nobumitsu, and Nobuzane. The battle was quickly won by the Oda side, with credit given to seven Samurai, known as the \"Seven Spears of Azukizaka\". Kawajiri Hidetaka fought with Yuhara (由原), who was the forerunner of the Imagawa clan, and defeated him at the battle's end.\nOda's \"Seven Spears of Azukizaka\"\nDuring the First Battle of Azukizaka in 1542, seven of Oda Nobuhide's men so distinguished themselves they became known as the \"Seven Spears of Azukizaka\" (小豆坂七本槍).
