The award was established by the Young Adult Caucus of the Saskatchewan Library Association in 1980 and inaugurated by an award to Kevin Major of Newfoundland and Labrador for Far from Shore, published by Clarke, Irwin & Company of Toronto.\nThe companion CLA Book of the Year for Children Award was inaugurated in 1947 and was presented annually without exception from 1963. Its criteria included \"appeal to children up to and including age 12\" and \"creative (i.e., original) writing (i.e., fiction, poetry, narrative, non-fiction, retelling of traditional literature)\". Corresponding criteria for the YA Book Award are \"[appeal] to young adults between the ages of 13 and 18\" and \"fiction (novel, collection of short stories, or graphic novel)\".\nThe Canadian Library Association also administered a book award for illustrators, the Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon Illustrator's Award.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Canadian Library Association Young Adult Book Award winners\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Publisher\n|-\n!1981\n|\n|Far from Shore\n|Clarke, Irwin & Company\n|-\n!1982\n|\n|Superbike\n|Clarke, Irwin & Company\n|-\n!1983\n|\n|Hunter in the Dark\n|Clarke, Irwin & Company\n|-\n!1984\n|\n|\n|Penguin Books\n|-\n!1985\n|\n|Winners\n|Western Producer Prairie Books\n|-\n!1986\n|\n|\n|The Porcupine's Quill\n|-\n!1987\n|\n|Shadow in Hawthorn Bay\n|Lester & Orpen Dennys\n|-\n!1988\n|\n|Who is Frances Rain?\n|Kids Can Press\n|-\n!1989\n|\n|January, February, June or July\n|Breakwater Books\n|-\n!1990\n|\n|Bad Boy\n|Groundwood\n|-\n!1991\n|\n|\n|House of Anansi Press\n|-\n!1992\n|\n|Strandia\n|HarperCollins\n|-\n!1993\n|\n|There Will be Wolves\n|HarperCollins\n|-\n!1994\n|\n|''Nobody's Son\n|Macmillan\n|-\n!1995\n|\n|Adam and Eve and Pinch-Me\n|Lester\n|-\n!1996\n|\n|\n|Groundwood/Douglas & McIntyre\n|-\n!1997\n|\n|Takes: Stories for Young Adults\n|Thistledown Press\n|-\n!1998\n|\n|Bone Dance\n|Groundwood/Douglas & McIntyre\n|-\n!1999\n|\n|Janey's Girl\n|Kids Can Press\n|-\n!2000\n|\n|Alone at Ninety Foot\n|Orca Book Publishers\n|-\n!2001\n|\n|Before Wings\n|Orca Book Publishers\n|-\n!2002\n|\n|Stones\n|Doubleday Canada\n|-\n!2003\n|\n|True Confessions of a Heartless Girl''\n|Groundwood/Douglas & McIntyre\n|-\n!2004\n|\n|'\n|Groundwood/Douglas & McIntyre\n|-\n!2005\n|\n|'\n|Alfred A.
