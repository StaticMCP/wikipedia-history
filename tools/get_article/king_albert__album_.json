The singles \"Call My Job\" and \"Chump Change\" took 72nd and 72nd place, respectively, in the Billboard R&B Singles chart.\nCritical reception\nIn AllMusic, Thom Owens said: \"Rebounding slightly from the nadir of Albert, Albert King delivered King Albert, a record that at least sticks to the tough, soul-inflected blues that made his reputation. Granted, the sound of the album is entirely too polished, but there is genuine grit in the performances and some strong songs, such as \"You Upset Me Baby\" and \"Good Time Charlie,\" on the record. That may be enough for some hardcore fans to give a listen, but they should be forewarned that even those inspired moments aren't enough to make King Albert a worthwhile release.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
