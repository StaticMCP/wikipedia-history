In the first by-election in the history of the Medicine Hat constituency held on 24 October 2016, Glen Motz of the Conservatives was elected. Motz has been the riding's representative to Ottawa since then.\nGeography\nThe constituency covers the City of Medicine Hat and surrounding areas in the southeast corner and southern U.S. border region of Alberta, including Cypress County, the County of Forty Mile No. 8, Warner No. 5 and the Town of Warner, and Cardston County and the Town of Cardston.\nDemographics\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\"\n|+ Panethnic groups in Medicine Hat—Cardston—Warner (2011−2021)\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Panethnic group\n! colspan=\"2\" |2021\n! colspan=\"2\" |2016\n! colspan=\"2\" |2011\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n| European\n| 86,105\n|\n| 86,505\n|\n| 85,035\n|\n|-\n| Indigenous\n| 9,420\n|\n| 9,220\n|\n| 8,670\n|\n|-\n| Southeast Asian\n| 1,905\n|\n| 1,130\n|\n| 600\n|\n|-\n| South Asian\n| 1,375\n|\n| 710\n|\n| 470\n|\n|-\n| East Asian\n| 1,170\n|\n| 935\n|\n| 865\n|\n|-\n| African\n| 1,050\n|\n| 985\n|\n| 780\n|\n|-\n| Latin American\n| 610\n|\n| 740\n|\n| 490\n|\n|-\n| Middle Eastern\n| 340\n|\n| 255\n|\n| 135\n|\n|-\n| Other/multiracial\" and \"Multiple visible minorities\" under visible minority section on census.|name=Other}}\n| 310\n|\n| 330\n|\n| 175\n|\n|-\n!
