To be eligible for the award, an employer must be nominated by one of its Guard or Reserve employees, or a family member of that employee.\nThe Freedom Award was instituted in 1996 by then-Secretary of Defense William Perry under the auspices of the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR). ESGR is a Department of Defense agency established in 1972 whose mission, according to its website, is to \"gain and maintain employer support for Guard and Reserve service by recognizing outstanding support, increasing awareness of the law, and resolving conflicts through mediation.\" The award was created to recognize the ways the nation's employers support their Guard and Reserve employees, and is the highest in a series of ESGR awards that include the Patriot Award, the Above and Beyond Award, and the Pro Patria Award.\nA senior Defense Department official presents the awards at a dinner ceremony in Washington, DC; past presenters have included the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Army Vice Chief of Staff, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since 1996, over 300 employers have received the Freedom Award.\nFreedom Award website\nIn 2008, ESGR launched a website for the Freedom Award. Using videos, news articles, profiles of recipients, and tips about employer best practices, the site provides information about the support that employers across the nation provide to their Guard and Reserve employees and their families. The site also houses the nomination form for the award.\nRecipients\n1996\n*McDonnell Douglas\n*National Life of Vermont\n*Schneider National\n*Tektronix, Inc.\n*United Parcel Service, Central Florida District\n1997\n*Charles Machine Works, Inc.\n*East Penn Manufacturing Co.\n*Entec Services, Inc.\n*Fred Meyer, Inc.\n*The Home Depot, Southeastern Division\n1998\n*American Airlines\n*American Family Mutual Insurance Company\n*CSX Transportation, Inc.\n*Portland Police Bureau\n*Wiremold Company\n1999\n*British Nuclear Fuels Limited, Inc.\n*General Fire and Safety Equipment Company, Inc.\n*Hitchiner Manufacturing Co., Inc.\n*Kaiser Permanente, Northwest\n*The State of Louisiana\n2000\n*American Express\n*Framatome Connectors USA\n*Intel Corporation\n*Midwest Express Airlines\n*Technology Concepts and Design\n2001\n*BAE Systems\n*The Boeing Company\n*The City of Bedford, Virginia\n*Electronic Data Systems\n*Southwest Airlines, Inc.\n2002\n*Autoliv, Inc.\n*General Dynamics Corporation\n*Public Service Company of New Hampshire\n*State of Wyoming\n*United Parcel Service Airlines\n2003\n*Central Atlantic Toyota Distribution Center\n*D.H.
