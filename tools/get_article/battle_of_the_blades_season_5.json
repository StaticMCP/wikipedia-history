The season featured a rotation of guest judges, with Tessa Virtue & Scott Moir serving as guest judges during Week 1. The season rotated between three venues, with the first three weeks taking place at the FirstOntario Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, Week 4 taking place at the Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga, Ontario and the last three weeks in Oshawa, with two weeks at the Tributes Community Centre and the finale taking place at the Ryerson's Mattamy Athletic Centre.\nFor the first time in the show's history, viewers from outside Canada are allowed to view the dances and vote for their favourite couples. The scoring also changed from a 6.0 to a 10.0 system for Week 1, referring back to the 6.0 system from Week 2 onwards.\nCouples\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!
