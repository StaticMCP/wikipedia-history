Bruce (David Mazouz) and Selina (Camren Bicondova) reconcile with one another after fixing a problem she had with a debt.\nBullock (Donal Logue) meets with a former assassin that worked with Falcone to get info from a person Falcone trusted, discovering it is Arthur Penn (Andrew Sellon), who is also Cobblepot's accountant. After realizing Martin has been taken, Sofia (Crystal Reed) orders Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) to kill Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), accompanied by Headhunter (Kyle Vincent Terry), who managed to survive his stabbing.

Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock intercept Cobblepot in the street and after getting a possible lead on Penn, they arrest him. However, they engage in a gunfight with Zsasz and Headhunter, giving Lee a chance to escape with Cobblepot. Lee and Cobblepot go with Victor Fries (Nathan Darrow) to get him to Sofia, so he freezes Cobblepot.\nSofia has Nygma tortured but he refuses to talk.

Before she can kill him, she is shot in the head by Lee.\nCobblepot kills Nygma's assailants and saves him. Gordon wakes up from his injuries, being informed by Bullock that somehow Sofia ended up in a coma.
