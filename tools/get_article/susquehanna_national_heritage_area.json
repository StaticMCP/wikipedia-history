The national heritage area commemorates and promotes the region surrounding the Susquehanna River.\nThe national heritage area includes all of Lancaster County and York County.\nThe Susquehanna National Heritage Area was first introduced in 2008, and was established in 2019. It is administered by the Susquehanna Heritage Corporation which was created in 2002. It is based out of the Zimmerman Center for Heritage in Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, a historic home dating to the early 1700s. The corporation also manages the Columbia Crossing River Trails Center in Columbia, Pennsylvania. It is a member of the Alliance of National Heritage Areas and HeritagePA, a statewide network covering Pennsylvania's Heritage Areas.\nThe National Heritage Area began giving free boat tours of Lake Clarke starting in 2019.\nIn 2020, the National Heritage Area was awarded $1,500,000 from the state of Pennsylvania to expand and construct a new discovery center.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.susquehannaheritage.org/ Susquehanna National Heritage Area official website]"
