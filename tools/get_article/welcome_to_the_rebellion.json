It is the twenty-first episode of the series overall; it was written by Dan Gilroy and directed by Janus Metz.\n\"Welcome to the Rebellion\" was released on Disney+ on May 6, 2025 as part of a three-episode block also including \"Messenger\" and \"Who Are You?\", and received widespread critical acclaim for its writing, emotional weight, and the performance of O'Reilly. Dan Gilroy won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing the episode.\nPlot\nSenator Bail Organa witnesses as the Ghorman senator, Dasi Oran, is arrested as the Empire frames the Ghorman Massacre as an insurrection. He and Mon Mothma converse secretly, where the latter insists they publicly condemn these actions. Organa chooses to stay behind to aid the Rebellion in secret, but urges Mothma to continue with her plans and relocate to Yavin IV. He prepares a team to safely extract her, while Kleya Marki and Luthen Rael call in Cassian Andor for the same purpose.\nMothma, with the help of her aide Erskin Semaj, removes listening devices from her office. Rael intercepts a practicing Mothma outside, revealing Semaj to be his agent. Mothma refuses to trust Rael due to his constant secrets, despite his insistence that Organa's extraction team is compromised. A distraught Mothma confronts and fires Semaj. The following day, Andor, Rael, and Kleya meet to discuss the plan. Andor successfully infiltrates the Senate building under the alias 'Ronni Googe', a reporter. Semaj also enters, and the pair identify each other with a code phrase. A worried Mothma questions Organa about his extraction team, and he admits to not knowing them personally.\nIn the senate, the Senators continue to position the Ghorman Massacre as an unjustifiable attack by the Ghor, focusing on the deaths of Imperial soldiers and tourists from their worlds. Organa uses a technicality in Senate procedure to pass the floor to Mothma, allowing her to deliver a speech. Mothma condemns the treatment of the Ghorman people and the false portrayal of the massacre by other senators, describing it as 'unprovoked genocide' and calling Emperor Palpatine a monster. Imperial officers attempt to shut down the broadcast, but are hindered by obstacles from Senate staff sympathetic to the rebellion. Organa's team prepares to extract Mothma, but the Imperial mole, Beska, sends an alert to her superiors and kills a member of the extraction team who discovers her.\nAndor approaches Mothma, revealing himself as Rael's agent. He wins her trust by describing his own complex feelings about Rael, and his history with her cousin, Vel. The pair are swarmed by journalists and Organa's team reaches them, but Beska reveals a concealed blaster and attempts to arrest Mothma. Semaj distracts her, enabling Andor to kill her with his own concealed blaster. Andor escapes with Mothma while Semaj uses Beska's blaster to prevent the journalists or Bail's team from following. Andor and Mothma run through the senate avoiding the crowds, and they are approached by her driver and Imperial spy Kloris. Andor pretends to have captured Mothma before killing Kloris and escaping in Mothma's vehicle. Andor, Mothma, and Semaj reconvene in the Coruscant safe house, where the latter two reconcile. Andor reunites with Wilmon Paak and his Ghorman girlfriend Dreena, who have evacuated from Ghorman, although Wilmon is seriously wounded. Kleya greets them and prepares to have Mothma and Semaj be collected by Gold Squadron whilst the other three head to Yavin.\nOn Yavin IV, Andor gives the rebels his stolen KX unit and reunites with Bix Caleen. Andor informs her of his intentions to leave the rebellion to live a proper life with her; she is initially reluctant then seemingly agrees. The following morning, Andor awakens to find her gone, leaving a video recording iterating her belief that the rebellion is too important, and that when the war is over they can be together. A distraught Andor heads to where the KX unit is being rebooted and arms himself with a blaster. To his surprise, the unit awakens and politely greets the crowd.\nProduction\nWriting\nThe episode was written by Dan Gilroy, in his sixth writing credit for the show, and directed by Janus Metz, after directing the previous two episodes of the series. The episodes of Andor second season, like those of its first, are split up into blocks, or story arcs, of three episodes; however, unlike in season one, each arc begins with a time skip of one year from the previous episode. Series showrunner Tony Gilroy decided to structure the season this way after concluding that the original five-season plan for the show was unfeasible, and needing some way to bridge the four years between season 1 and Rogue One (2016) in a single season. As proof of concept, he wrote the first and last episodes of each would-be arc, and eventually decided on this structure for the season.\nIn May 2022, Gilroy said Cassian Andor would meet Rebel leader Mon Mothma in the second season after the pair had separate stories in the first. The two lead characters finally meet in \"Welcome to the Rebellion\", with Cassian convincing an endangered Mon that he is her best chance of escaping the Senate building. William Hughes of The A.V. Club noted, \"Andor likes to play a very long game with keeping its main characters disconnected from each other, and ... there’s a base-level charge to seeing O’Reilly and Luna getting to share a scene together that elevates the entire sequence\".\nFor K-2SO's introduction in the episode, Gilroy originally wrote an entirely self-contained story for the season's ninth episode that played like a horror film, with a KX unit hunting over a huge tanker ship on Yavin IV with K-2SO involved in the scenario, but budget issues meant the show's crew couldn't afford its production and consolidated things instead, so they opted to move up Mothma's Senate speech to \"Welcome to the Rebellion\", as it had been originally slated to occur in \"Make It Stop\". In retrospect, Gilroy was glad to scrap that story, as the need to extent existing set usage to save money meant more screen time and effort was given to the Mothma's escape from the Galactic Senate. Genevieve O'Reilly, who played Mothma, provided Gilroy with input when writing her speech denouncing the Galactic Empire's role in the Ghorman Massacre in \"Welcome to the Rebellion\". While Gilroy had initially only written sections of the monologue which were to be spliced into a bigger montage, O'Reilly convinced him to write an entire speech.\nMothma giving a speech denouncing the Ghorman Massacre was previously depicted in the Star Wars Rebels episode \"Secret Cargo\". When writing the episode, Dan Gilroy expressed frustration with having to work with the canonicity of Rebels, remarking, \"Do I have to stick to this fucking speech?\" The events of Rebels were eventually referenced in the final product, with dialogue in the episode indicating that Mothma would be handed over to the Gold Squadron of the Rebel Alliance, as depicted in \"Secret Cargo\". In line with this, Mothma was originally going to go back with Andor to Chandrila to explain to Perrin and Leida why she was doing what she was doing and Andor would have handed her over to the Gold Squadron then and there. The writers contemplated having Mothma's last scene with Perrin reveal that Perrin had been interrogated by the ISB weekly behind his wife's back all those years yet he had kept his mouth shut, all to protect her behind her back, a discovery that would have shocked Mothma and left her heartbroken for her actions at Coruscant because she would have realized that her husband had really cared about her after all and that she could have had an ally in him all along.\nCasting\nBy March 2023, Benjamin Bratt had been cast for the episode in an undisclosed role, later revealed to be Bail Organa, replacing Jimmy Smits in the role. Early on the season's development, Gilroy had some conversations with Kathleen Kennedy and Pablo Hidalgo about having Bail's adoptive daughter Princess Leia, one of the Star Wars original trilogy's main characters, make an appearance at the Galactic Senate due to her presence during the Investiture Week on Coruscant being justified in the story due to her occupation as a politician, with Gilroy trying to making \"the most\" of the sequence with the political parties involved and figuring out where Leia could appear in the Senates, thinking about a scene between a sixteen years old Leia and Mothma, but the idea didn't progress beyond that concept nor gained traction and they never went to the casting stage, as it became a distraction from the story.\nFilming\nIn March 2023, director Janus Metz filmed the episode in Xàtiva and Valencia. According to O'Reilly, filming also occurred in May 2023.\nMusic\nThe original score for \"Welcome to the Rebellion\", as with nine other episodes of the season's twelve, was composed by Brandon Roberts, replacing Nicholas Britell, the composer for the show's first season, due to scheduling conflicts.\nThe soundtrack for the episode was released alongside that of the other two episodes in its block on May 9, 2025 via Walt Disney Records as part of the third of four volumes of the second season's original score.\n| length1 = 0:43\n| title2 = Bug\n| length2 = 1:46\n| title3 = Next Year, in Yavin\n| length3 = 1:07\n| title4 = Article 17-252\n| length4 = 3:50\n| title5 = I Have Friends Everywhere\n| length5 = 2:06\n| title6 = Welcome to the Rebellion\n| length6 = 3:32\n| title7 = Bix's Message\n| length7 = 3:01\n| title8 = Senate Escape Suite\n| length8 = 3:25\n}}\nRelease\n\"Welcome to the Rebellion\" was released on Disney+ on May 6, 2025 as part of a three-episode block, alongside \"Who Are You?\" and \"Messenger\".\nReception\nCritical response\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, based on 10 reviews.\nWilliam Hughes of The A.V. Club gave a positive review, writing \"Andor reminds us how much fun it can have when it's locked into pure spy mode ... this is the stuff Andor most frequently excels at: moving parts and rising tension, moment-to-moment improvisations and whispered plans.\" Mike Redmond of Pajiba also gave a positive review, summarizing that \"I know I was really hard on this arc, but to its credit, it was a breezy watch unlike last week. Episode 9 was particularly great, and I did not feel chained to my couch\".\nAccolades\nAt the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, Dan Gilroy won for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing \"Welcome to the Rebellion\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://assets.debut.disney.com/documents/Andor%20209%20--%20POST%20FINAL%20--%203.3.24%5B1%5D.pdf \"Welcome to the Rebellion\" screenplay]\n*\n*\n*"
