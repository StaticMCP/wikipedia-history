Unlike the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), college football's governing body, the NCAA, bestows the national championship title through a 24-team tournament. The following weekly polls determine the top 25 teams at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level of college football for the 2022 season. The STATS poll is voted by media members while the Coaches' Poll is determined by coaches at the FCS level.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|+ Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background:#bbffbb; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ffbbbb; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| Selected for NCAA FCS Playoffs\n|-\n| (Italics)\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n| (#–#)\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| т\n| &nbsp;\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nSTATS poll\n|Week2Date = September 5\n|Week3Date = September 12\n|Week4Date = September 19\n|Week5Date = September 26\n|Week6Date = October 3\n|Week7Date = October 10\n|Week8Date = October 17\n|Week9Date = October 24\n|Week10Date= October 31\n|Week11Date= November 7\n|Week12Date= November 14\n|Week13Date= November 21\n|Week14Date= January 13\n|Week1-1   = North Dakota State (52)\n|Week1-2   = South Dakota State (2)\n|Week1-3   = Montana\n|Week1-4   = Montana State\n|Week1-5   = Missouri State\n|Week1-6   = Villanova\n|Week1-7   = Sacramento State\n|Week1-8   = Kennesaw State\n|Week1-9   = Southern Illinois\n|Week1-10  = Stephen F.
