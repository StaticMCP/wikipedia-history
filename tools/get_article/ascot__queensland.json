In the , Ascot had a population of 6,531 people.\nGeography\nAscot is characterised by large Queenslander homes and is located approximately  north-east of Brisbane GPO. Ascot is best known for its beautiful old homes, the picturesque poinciana tree lined shopping area of Racecourse Road (), and for the Eagle Farm () and Doomben () racecourses popular for racing carnivals. Over a third of the suburb is taken up by Doomben and its related outer buildings, Eagle Farm and Doomben racecourses.\nBartleys Hill is in the south-west of the suburb () and is  above sea level.\nHistory\nHistorically, the land was occupied by the Aboriginal Turrbal clan. The Turrbal called the area Yowoggerra, meaning corroboree place. The clan had camping grounds on the north side of the Brisbane River around the Breakfast Creek area. It was at Breakfast Creek that explorers Oxley and Cunningham met members of the clan in 1824. The clan was often called the 'Duke of York's clan' by whites. In 1858 two Aborigines, Dalinkua and Dalpie from the Breakfast Creek area, wrote letters to The Moreton Bay Courier protesting against the treatment their people.\nConvicts were used in the 1830s to clear land and build basic roads. Within a decade wealthy free settlers took land with a view of the Brisbane River. In 1855, pastoralist James Sutherland purchased a large portion of land in the Brisbane area, including Ascot and its surrounds. He built one of Ascot's surviving and historically listed homes, Windermere.\nBartleys Hill was named after writer Nehemiah Bartley who owned land in the area.\nThe Eagle Farm Racecourse was established in 1863. Horse racing was one of the earliest sports in Brisbane and the name \"Ascot\" was given to the suburb as a tongue-in cheek reference to Ascot, England, and its prestigious Ascot Racecourse. There were racing stables throughout the suburb until the late 1920s.\nDue to the popularity of the horse races, in 1882 a railway line branch was extended from Eagle Junction to the Eagle Farm Racecourse in Ascot.\nIn June 1892, the \"Lancaster Gardens Estate\", consisting of 196 allotments, was advertised to be auctioned by Arthur Martin & Co. Limited, auctioneers. A map advertising the auction states the properties are opposite the racecourse and close to Racecourse Railway Station.

It was to prepare teachers for teaching in Queensland's many one-teacher schools in rural areas. It closed in 1973.\nIn May 1938, the \"Jolimont Estate\" consisting of 4 allotments was advertised to be auctioned by Isles Love & Co., Auctioneers. The surveyor was C. F. Bennett. A map advertising the auction states the Estate had easy access to the tram and all conveniences, with beautiful easterly aspects and wonderful views.\nDuring World War II, several buildings were used by General Douglas MacArthur and the Central Bureau, which had its headquarters at \"Nyrambla\", 21&nbsp;Henry Street. In July 1942, MacArthur moved his headquarters to Queen Street in Brisbane city. The Central Bureau work of intercepting and decoding Japanese intelligence remained in Ascot.\nAlso used was the fire station at 77&nbsp;Kitchener Road and several other locations in nearby Hamilton. In 1941 military authorities took over the racecourse, then known as Camp Ascot, to house thousands of American troops. Camp Ascot was home to several US units, including the 2nd battalion of the 131st Field Artillery Regiment and the 35th Fighter Group comprising the 39th, 40th and 41st Fighter Squadrons and Headquarters Squadron.\nFrom the 1990s, the old servants' quarters of \"Nyrambla\" were home to the late Australian actor Bille Brown (1952-2013), honorary ambassador for Queensland for his stage work in the Queensland Theatre Company in Brisbane and the Royal Shakespeare Company.\nDemographics\nIn the , Ascot had a population of 4,543 people.\nIn the , Ascot had a population of 5,330 people.\nIn the , Ascot had a population of 5,730 people.\nIn the , Ascot had a population of 5,777 people, 52% female and 48% male.
