The text was initially published by W. W. Norton & Company on February 1, 1991.\nOverview\nThe book discusses issues of strategic behaviour, decision making, and game theory. The authors present the main concepts, such as backward induction, auction theory, Nash equilibrium, noncooperative bargaining, to a general audience. Each concept is illustrated by examples from common life, business, sports, politics, etc.—as applying game theory to real life may be the best way of crystallizing the best options available.\nReception\n—Review by Financial Times\nSee also\n*1984 Orange Bowl\n*Co-Opetition: A Revolution Mindset that Combines Competition and Cooperation also co-authored by Barry Nalebuff\n*Coordination game\n*Tragedy of the commons\n*Thinking, Fast and Slow\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~pswistak/GVPT%20100/Dixit%20and%20Nalebuff.pdf Excerpt from the book]\n*"
