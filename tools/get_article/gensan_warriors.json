The team competes in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) as a member of the league's South Division. The team most recently played their home games at Lagao Gymnasium.\nThe team's first incarnation began play in the Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA) as the GenSan MP PacMan Warriors from 2005 to 2008 while also playing in the National Basketball Conference (NBC) from 2007 to 2008. The team played in Liga Pilipinas from 2008 to 2011 as the MP–GenSan Warriors following the merger of the two former leagues.\nIn 2018, the team was revived as part of the MPBL's national expansion during the 2018–19 season. The team name was simplified as the GenSan Warriors, keeping the location identifier and moniker. In 2024, the team name was changed to South Cotabato Warriors, representing the entire province, before going back to their previous moniker when they joined the Pilipinas Super League (PSL) in late 2024.\nThe Warriors are one of five teams based in Mindanao and one of two based in the Soccsksargen region, the other team being the Sarangani Gripper Motorcycle Tire.\nHistory\nFirst incarnation (2005–2011)\nThe team was founded in 2005 as the GenSan MP PacMan Warriors, originally as part of the Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association (MVBA) and later the National Basketball Conference (NBC) in 2007. General Santos then became part of Liga Pilipinas in 2008 following the merger of both leagues and renamed to the MP–GenSan Warriors. Liga Pilipinas ceased operations in 2011, ending the team's first incarnation.\nSecond incarnation (2018–present)\nThe team was revived in 2018 as part of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League's national expansion in the 2018–19 season, becoming the league's first representative from the Soccsksargen region. Led by homegrown player Cris Masaglang, the team finished 4th in the South Division with 14–11 record. In the playoffs, the Warriors would be swept by the fifth-seeded Bacoor City Strikers in the First Round. General Santos then added Robby Celiz and John Raymundo into the roster for the 2019–20 MPBL season. Despite those additions and improving to 18–12, GenSan only finished seventh. Once again, the team was swept by second-seeded Bacoor City.\nBoth Celiz and Raymundo would depart from the team before the 2022 season, while also adding Nikko Panganiban. Panganiban would be declared an all-star as the Warriors once again improved, going 15–6 and finishing 4th in the South. The team would unfortunately suffer its third straight first-round exit after losing in three games to the Mark Yee-led Bacolod Bingo Plus. Panganiban would leave for San Juan, while the team added 2020 MVP John Wilson from the Pilipinas Super League's Davao Occidental Tigers. Alongside Wilson is Kyt Jimenez, coming off his rookie season with region rivals Sarangani. The 2023 season would be the team's most successful as it stands, finishing 21–7, improving their record yet again and breaking into the top three in its division for the first time. Wilson and Jimenez were both declared all-stars while Masaglang would win the Homegrown Player of the Year award. That season also saw the team's first-ever playoff series win, beating the Muntinlupa Cagers in three games in the First Round before losing to the Batangas City Embassy Chill in three during the Division Semifinals.\nHeading into the 2024 season, the team will be without Jimenez, who was drafted and signed by the San Miguel Beermen in the PBA season 48 draft. The Warriors also changed its location identifier to South Cotabato to represent the entire region.\nCurrent roster\nHead coaches\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"\" | GenSan Warriors head coaches\n|-\n! style=\"\" | #\n! style=\"\" | Name\n! style=\"\" | Start\n! style=\"\" | End\n! style=\"\" class=\"unsortable\" | Achievements\n! style=\"\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref.\n|-\n| align=center | 1 ||\n| 2018 || 2019\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n| align=center | 2 ||\n| 2019–20 || 2020\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n| align=center | 3 ||\n| 2021 || 2021\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n| align=center | 4 ||\n| 2022 || 2022\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n| align=center | 5 ||\n| 2023 || 2023\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n| align=center | 6 ||\n| 2023 || 2023\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n| align=center | 7 ||\n| 2024 ||\n| align=center | —\n|\n|-\n|}\nNotable players\nIndividual award winners\nMPBL Homegrown Player of the Year\n* Cris Masaglang – 2023\nAll-MPBL Second Team\n* Pamboy Raymundo – 2020\nMPBL All-Star Day\nAll-Star selections\n* Cris Masaglang – 2019, 2022\n* Robby Celiz – 2020\n* Nikko Panganiban – 2022\n* Kyt Jimenez – 2023\n* John Wilson – 2023\n* Christian Fajarito – 2024\n* Larry Rodriguez – 2024\nPBA players\nEx-PBA players\n* Val Acuña\n* Ronjay Buenafe\n* Mark Cardona\n* Robby Celiz\n* Jervy Cruz\n* Mark Cruz\n* Nico Elorde\n* Jammer Jamito\n* Khasim Mirza\n* Pamboy Raymundo\n* Larry Rodriguez\n* Ervic Vijandre\n* John Wilson\nDrafted to PBA\n* Mikey Williams – 4th overall, season 46\n* Kyt Jimenez – 76th overall, season 48\nOther notable players\n* Gerald Anderson\n* Bobby Pacquiao\n* Manny Pacquiao\nSeason-by-season records\nMaharlika Pilipinas Basketball League\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background:#FFFFCF; width:2em\"|\n|| League champions\n|-\n|style=\"background:#CFCFFF; width:2em\"|\n|| Division champions\n|-\n|style=\"background:#CFFFCF; width:2em\"|\n|| Qualified for playoffs\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FFCFCF; width:2em\"|\n|| Best regular season record\n|}\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! colspan=\"7\" | Regular season\n! colspan=\"2\" | Playoffs\n|-\n!
