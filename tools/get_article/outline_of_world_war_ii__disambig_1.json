The war pitted two major military alliances against each other: the Allies of the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, China and others against the Axis of Germany, Japan, Italy and others. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history.\nThe Second World War was known for modern warfare and tactics such as air warfare, strategic bombing, blitzkrieg and the first, and only, use of nuclear weapons in warfare. It is also known for the numerous war crimes committed during its duration, mostly by Axis forces but also by Allied forces, that left tens of millions of civilians dead through genocides, massacres and starvation; such as the Holocaust, Three Alls Policy, Genocide of ethnic Poles, Unit 731, Nanjing massacre, Hunger Plan and the Warsaw Uprising.\nCauses of World War II\n* World War I\n** Treaty of Versailles\n* Imperialism, expansionism and nationalism\n** Expansionist nationalism\n*** Lebensraum\n*** Japanese nationalism\n* Events preceding World War II in Europe\n**Fascism in Europe\n** National Fascist Party\n***Benito Mussolini\n** Nazi Party\n*** Adolf Hitler\n* Events preceding World War II in Asia\n** Statism in Shōwa Japan\n** Japanese invasion of Manchuria\n** Xi'an Incident\n** Second Sino-Japanese war\nParticipants in World War II\nThe Axis powers\nMajor Axis powers\n*  Germany\n*  Japan\n*  Italy\nOther Axis powers\n*  Hungary\n*  Romania\n*  Slovakia\n*  Bulgaria\n*  Croatia\n*  Finland\nThe Allied powers\nThe 'Big Five' major allies\n*  Soviet Union\n*  United States\n*  United Kingdom\n*  China\n*  France\nOther major allies\n*  Poland\n*  Yugoslavia\n*  Greece\n*  Canada\n*  Netherlands\n*  Belgium\n*  Czechoslovakia\n*  India\n*  Australia\nPeople in World War II\nLeaders in World War II\nAxis leaders\n*  Adolf Hitler – Führer (leader) of Germany\n*  Hirohito – Emperor}} of Japan\n*  Benito Mussolini – Prime Minister and Duce of Italy\nAllied leaders\n*  Joseph Stalin – Leader of the Soviet Union\n*  Franklin D.
