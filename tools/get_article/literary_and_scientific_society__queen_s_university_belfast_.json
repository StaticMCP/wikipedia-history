The purposes of the Society, as per its Laws are to \"encourage debating, oratory and rhetoric throughout the student body of the University and beyond\".\nHistory\n]]\nThe Society was founded in 1850 as a paper-reading society for students of the new Queen's College, with its first president being Edwin Lawrence Godkin. The Literific was also used, during its early years, as a democratic body which could negotiate with the College on behalf of the students until the formation of the Students' Union Society and the Students' Representative Council in 1900.\nThe Society established itself as the principal debating body of the University, however in the 1960s the Literific came under fire and was banned for several weeks in 1964 \"in view of the disorders and improprieties of conduct and obscene language\". Later in the decade the Society merged into the Union Debating Society (later the Debating and Mooting Society) from which it re-emerged in 2011.\nCurrently the Society operates as the sole debating society at QUB and has an affiliation with the Queen's University Belfast Students' Union as well as to the University itself. The Society holds weekly meetings on a particular motion of interest during term.\nPresidents\nList of presidents (1850-1967)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Presidents prior to the society's adjournment\n!Session\n!Name\n!Notes\n|-\n|1st (1850-51)\n|Mr. Edwin L.

The Event saw 12 speakers discuss the motion: “This House Believes That Ireland Has Failed Its Youth”. The debate was chaired by Lord Justice Stephens and judged by Irish Times editor Paul O’Neill, Queen’s Professor Adrienne Scullion, Pro Vice-Chancellor for Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; Margaret Elliott who is a governor of the Irish Times Trust and Professor Brent Northup, the chair of communications at Carroll College in Montana.\nLitTalks and Great Debates\nIn 2020, the Literific launched two new series called LitTalks and Great Debates. The first LitTalk took  place in February 2020 with James Brokenshire, then Minister of State for Security and former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Other LitTalks have included Mary Lou McDonald, Ian Blackford, Naomi Long and Doug Beattie.\nIn November 2020, the first Great Debate was held on the motion: This House Regrets the Decriminalisation of Abortion in Northern Ireland. The debate attracted much controversy on social media, particularly due to the inclusion of former Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe on the proposition. The motion was defeated by 472 votes to 159.\nNotable people\n*Edwin Lawrence Godkin - First president of the Society, later editor of The Nation and the New York Evening Post.\n*Robert James McMordie - President 1871-72, barrister, M.P. and Lord Mayor of Belfast.\n*Thomas Teevan - President of the Society, barrister and Ulster Unionist West Belfast MP - Youngest Chairman of a local Authority in Northern Ireland at 21 (Limavady Urban Council).
