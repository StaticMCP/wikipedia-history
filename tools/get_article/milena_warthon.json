She was raised in Lima and grew up listening to huayno music because her parents are from the countryside; she identifies as an Andean woman.

At age 13, she began taking singing classes. At age 15, she completed school and enrolled at the University of Lima to study music, but she later changed her course of study to communication.\nCareer\n2019–2020: Beginnings\nAfter being inspired by one of her classmates, Warthon's parents helped connect her with a producer and vocal coach and she began posting covers.
