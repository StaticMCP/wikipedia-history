      "text": "# Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game\n\nWarcraft: The Roleplaying Game was a tabletop role-playing game line published by Sword & Sorcery Studios, set in the fictional world of Azeroth from the Warcraft computer games by Blizzard Entertainment. The Warcraft RPG was \"100% compatible\" with the Dungeons & Dragons revised third edition rules, and was released under the Open Game License.\nNine books have been listed by Blizzard as part of the Warcraft, later World of Warcraft, tabletop role-playing games. While they have been recommended on the WoW website as providing \"a wealth of information about Warcraft lore\", Community Manager \"Bashiok\" later stated that these books sometimes diverge from the established canon of lore in the Warcraft video games, though some ideas originating in the RPG books have made their way into the official Warcraft canon.\nSecond Edition\nIn 2005, a second edition of the game rules called World of Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game was released, renamed to tie in with the success of World of Warcraft. In \"translating\" WoW into a tabletop experience, this project sought to break the limitations of the computer-programmed Azeroth, in ways such as giving players the ability to complete quests with their own imagined methods and to change the inherent setting of the game with their own ideas.\nReviews\n*Coleção Dragon Slayer\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
