It is thought to have developed after World War II when casseroles made out of canned food became popular. It bears similarities to chilaquiles, a Mexican dish that contains shredded chicken, cheese, tortillas, tomatoes, and chiles.\nKing Ranch Chicken was popular in women's clubs in South Texas and West Texas during the 1950s. The dish is often served in lunchrooms and at gatherings like funerals, church suppers, and potlucks. Frozen versions are sold in regional supermarket chains like H-E-B and Randalls.\nDescription\nThe recipe generally calls for simmering a combination of canned diced tomatoes with green chiles, canned cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken soup, diced bell peppers, diced onions, and shredded chicken. Leftover roasted or grilled chicken is often used for this recipe. Corn tortillas or tortilla chips are layered in the bottom of a casserole dish, and then covered by the chicken and canned mixture. The casserole is topped with shredded cheese before baking. The Ro-Tel brand of canned tomatoes with chiles are commonly used in recipes.\nSee also\n* List of casserole dishes\n* List of chicken dishes\nReferences"
