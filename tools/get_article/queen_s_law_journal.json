      "text": "# Queen's Law Journal\n\n}}\nThe 'Queen's Law Journal' is a Canadian peer-reviewed law review. It is published biannually by Queen's University at Kingston.\nThe journal was established in 1968 as the 'Queen's Intramural Law Journal', obtaining its current title in 1971, reflecting a change in editorial policy. While it continued to publish student work, the journal began seeking contributions from academics and other members of the legal profession. By the mid-1970s, it had evolved into its present form—a vehicle for scholarship by legal academics, practitioners, and law students. In time, the journal became a fully refereed publication. All submissions that pass the internal review process are subject to a double-blind external assessment by at least two experts in the relevant subject area.\nExternal links\n*"
