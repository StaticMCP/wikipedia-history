It aims \"to encourage the highest standards of writing biography and autobiography and to promote public interest in those genres\". It was initially awarded every two years, but from 2002 it has been awarded annually. Its administration was taken over by the State Library of New South Wales in 1998.\nHistory of the Award\nIt was originally endowed by private benefactor, Dr. Geoffrey Cains, and the original prize money was $12,500. In 2002, Cains said of endowing the award that \"I wanted to give back to literature something, it had given me so much; besides, philanthropy in this country is so overlooked and diminished\". In 2005, the prize money was increased to $20,000 with the support of Michael Crouch. Belinda Hutchinson, former President of the Library Council of NSW, expressed gratitude for this increase to \"an award that celebrates the Australian psyche through distinguished biography writing.\"\nIn 2012 the prize money for the Award has been increased to $25,000. Since 2013, each shortlisted author receives $1,000. The judging panel varies from year to year. In 2018 the Michael Crouch Award was introduced for an Australian writer's first published biography.\nThe shortlist is announced in early July each year, followed by the winner announcement in early August.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!
