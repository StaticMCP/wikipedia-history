In order to qualify, units must maintain medical readiness standards throughout the year and demonstrate the impact that the health and fitness programs have on their sailors.\nShips that earn a Force Health and Wellness Unit Award are authorized to paint a green \"H\" on their stacks or elsewhere to display evidence of the honor. For each subsequent consecutive competition won, the ship paints an angled line, or hashmark, below the green \"H\". After five consecutive awards, a green star is painted above the \"H\". The \"H\" and any hashmarks or stars are removed in the year the ship first fails to win the award.\nSee also\n*Battle Effectiveness Award\n*Battenberg Cup\nReferences"
