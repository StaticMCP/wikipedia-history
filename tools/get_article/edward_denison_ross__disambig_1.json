He was the first director of the University of London's School of Oriental Studies (now SOAS, University of London) from 1916 to 1937.\nRoss read in 49 languages and spoke in 30. He was the director of the British Information Bureau for the Near East. Ross wrote an Introduction to a reprint of George Sale's translation of the Quran. Along with Eileen Power, he wrote and edited a 26-volume series published by George Routledge & Sons, The Broadway Travellers. The series included the diary of the 17th-century naval chaplain Henry Teonge. Ross joined the staff of the British Museum in 1914, appointed to catalogue the collections of Sir Aurel Stein. He was an original trustee of the E. J. W. Gibb Memorial Series. In 1934, Edward Denison Ross attended Ferdowsi Millenary Celebration in Tehran.\nIn January 1940, shortly after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Ross was named head of the British Information Bureau at Istanbul with the rank of Counsellor. As an acquaintance of the deceased Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Ross was eager to serve his country from Turkey. However, the loss of his wife Dora in April 1940 was more than he could bear, and Sir Denison himself died in Istanbul at age 69 in September 1940. He is buried at the Haydarpasha English Cemetery in Uskudar.\nwith Lama Lobqang (probably Darjeeling, 1907)]]\nBibliography\nSome of these he was the sole author; some he was the translator; some he was a joint author:\n* 1893 - A year amongst the Persians\n* 1895 - History Of The Moghuls Of Central Asia; Tarikh-i-rashidi Of Mirza Muhammad ...\n* 1895 - The Tarikh-i-Rashidi of Mirza Muhammad Haidar, Dughlat: a history of the Mo...\n* 1895 - The Tarikh-i-rashidi; a history of the Moghuls of central Asia; an English version.
