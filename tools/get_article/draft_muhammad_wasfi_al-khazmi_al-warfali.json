He was one of the first Libyan graduates of the Ottoman Military Academy in Istanbul, and is recognized for leading one of the earliest direct armed engagements against Italian forces during the Italo-Turkish War in Tripoli in 1911. His refusal to obey Ottoman orders to retreat is considered a symbolic act of early Libyan defiance against both colonial and imperial domination.\nBiography\nAl-Khazmi was born in Tripoli between 1870 and 1875. The name \"Wasfi\" was added during his early schooling to distinguish him. He studied at the military school in Bab al-Bahr (Tripoli), then enrolled at the Ottoman Military Academy in Istanbul, graduating in 1896 with the rank of Second lieutenant. He was subsequently appointed to the Ottoman garrison in Tripoli.\nIn addition to his military duties, he volunteered as a teacher for the illiterate and was involved in early nationalist activities. He joined the al-Jami'a society, which opposed the Committee of Union and Progress—a dominant political faction within the late Ottoman Empire.\nMilitary resistance against Italy\nWhen the Italian invasion of Libya began in September 1911, al-Khazmi rejected orders from Ottoman commander Neshat Pasha to retreat. On the night of 9 October 1911, he led the first armed ambush against Italian forces in the Gargaresc area west of Tripoli.\n, Tripoli, 1912.]]\nHe subsequently participated in the Battle of Al-Hani, Battle of Sidi al-Masri, and Battle of Siwa. In the latter, he led forces under Ahmad Sharif al-Sanusi from Egypt and successfully captured the Siwa Oasis in November 1915.\nDeath\nAfter taking part in multiple military operations in Cyrenaica and Egypt, al-Khazmi migrated to Alexandria in 1923. He died there in 1924 after a long illness.\nSee also\n* Italo-Turkish War\n* Ottoman Army\nReferences\n:Category:1870s births\n:Category:1924 deaths\n:Category:Libyan resistance leaders\n:Category:Libyan military personnel\n:Category:Ottoman military personnel\n:Category:Graduates of the Ottoman Military Academy\n:Category:People from Tripoli, Libya\n:Category:People from Warfalla\n:Category:Libyan revolutionaries"
