There was an error in the first pressing of the box set.  The bonus tracks meant for Frolic through the Park ended up on The Ultra-Violence disc, while three tunes from the third disc (the \"Rarities\" disc) ended up as bonus tracks on Frolic through the Park instead.  The songs from the  \"Kill as One\" demo tape, which were meant to be a bonus on The Ultra-Violence, were excluded altogether.  This error was corrected on the second pressing by Rykodisc.\nTrack listing\nDVD\n#\"Death Angel Intro\"\n#\"Original Electronic Press Kit\"\n#\"International TV Interview\"\n#\"Guilty of Innocence (multimedia track)\" (Cavestany, Galeon, Osegueda, Pepa, Pepa)\n#\"Bored (multimedia track)\" (Cavestany, Osegueda)\n#\"Voracious Souls (Music Video)\" (Cavestany, Galeon, Osegueda)\nPersonnel\n*Mark Osegueda – lead vocals\n*Rob Cavestany – lead guitar, backing vocals\n*Gus Pepa – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n*Dennis Pepa – bass, backing vocals\n*Andy Galeon – drums, backing vocals\nReferences"
