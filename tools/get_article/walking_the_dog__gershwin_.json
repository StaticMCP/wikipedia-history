      "text": "# Walking the Dog (Gershwin)\n\nWalking the Dog is one of many musical numbers written in 1937 by George Gershwin for the score for the Fred Astaire&nbsp;– Ginger Rogers film Shall We Dance. In the film, the music accompanies a sequence of walking a dog on board a luxury liner. In 1960, the sequence was published as \"Promenade\".\nMost of the score from the film (composed and orchestrated by Gershwin) remains unpublished and unavailable in modern stereo recordings.\nOn September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be released, as a result of collaboration between the Gershwin family, the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan. The entire Gershwin project may take 30 to 40 years to complete, and it is unknown when the score to Shall We Dance (which includes Walking The Dog) will be released.\nIt is unknown whether the critical edition will include the round section heard on the soundtrack.\nSee also\n*List of compositions by George Gershwin\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t67SdkYubs4 Video&nbsp;– George Gershwin&nbsp;– Walking The Dog (03:17).]"
