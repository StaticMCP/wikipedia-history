The rulers of Iberia, Arzok and Armazel, allied with Alan leaders Bazuk and Anbazuk, along with several North Caucasian tribes including Lezgins, Vainakhs, and Pechenegs. Together they prepared a large-scale invasion of Greater Armenia.\nThe Invasion\nCoalition forces crossed into Armenian territory from the north. Georgian detachments, supported by Lezgins and other highland troops, devastated much of the Ayrarat province. The regions of Shirak, Vanand, Bagrevand, and Basean were plundered, and the invaders reached as far as Nakhichevan.\nIn response, King Artaxias assembled a new Armenian army under the command of Sparapet Smbat Bagratuni, which advanced into the Alazani valley where the coalition forces had gathered.\nDecisive Battle\nThe decisive engagement occurred in the spring on the banks of the Kura River. On the eve of the battle, Smbat killed Bazuk and Anbazuk in an archery contest, weakening enemy morale. The following day, Armenian forces launched a surprise assault, inflicting heavy losses. After seven hours of fighting, the coalition army retreated northward.\nThe Armenians pursued them into the Nosté valley, fought another engagement, and then withdrew to the right bank of the Kura.\nSummer Campaign\nIn the summer, Georgian forces once again invaded northern Armenia. Armenian troops counter-attacked, broke through the mountain defenses, and began the siege of Mtskheta, the Iberian capital.\nAftermath\nThe war ended with an Armenian victory. The northern frontier of Armenia was secured along the Kura River. The Kingdom of Iberia fell under Armenian influence, while the states of Mosinyok and Khalyb were annexed and ceased to exist.\nPeace with the Alans was consolidated through a dynastic marriage: the Alan princess Satenik married King Artaxias I.\nSignificance\nThe invasion highlighted the strategic importance of the Kura valley and Armenia’s vulnerable northern frontier. It also reflected the role of dynastic marriages in ancient diplomacy, which were used to strengthen alliances and secure peace. The victory expanded the influence of the Artaxiad dynasty in the Caucasus."
