During Operation Enduring freedom, FOB Shank was one of the most heavily rocketed forward operating bases in Afghanistan. In 2014, the base was turned over to Afghan National Army, who established Camp Maiwand at the northern end of the FOB.  American forces later returned and reoccupied the southern portion of the FOB, under the name Camp Dahlke.\nHistory\nIn 2008 FOB Shank was built by Alpha Company of the 508th Special Troops Battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division with assistance from the 555th Engineer Battalion. The FOB was dedicated after SSG Michael A. Shank, who was killed in the Logar Province in 2006. International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) used the base to train the Afghan National Police (ANP).  The Police Academy, led by a U.S. Police Mentoring Training team, cooperated daily with the Czech Provincial Reconstruction Team Logar, composed of 200 Czech Soldiers and about 10 civilians.\nThese efforts were focused on training the Afghanistan National Auxiliary Police to become members of the ANP.\nAs of 8 July 2008, Czech and Afghan instructors were teaching the fourth group of cadets at the academy. Each group attended a three-week cycle which included first-aid treatment, tactics, patrolling, weapons training, vehicle-check-point procedures and many other police-related subjects. The practical part of the training also included scenarios where cadets were ambushed by simulated oppositional forces.\nDuring 2014 the base was downsized partly by 663 Engineer Company (cbt hvy)and was turned over to the ANA. The ANA utilized the northern portion of the base only, which they renamed Camp Maiwand.\nThe last few convoys containing equipment from FOB Shank back to Bagram Airbase were completed during October 2014 by the 730th Transportation Company, 419th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 4th Resolute Support Sustainment Brigade.\nFollowing the shutdown of FOB Shank, a new American base was established at the southern end of the perimeter, called FOB Dahlke or Camp Dahlke. Camp Dahlke was expanded in 2018 to support the deployment of the 1st Security Force Assistance Brigade. Camp Dahlke had facilities to house 1200 personnel.\nDeployed units\nAviation\n*October 2008-October 2009\n**101st Airborne 159th Aviation Brigade \"Task Force Thunder\" under Col.
