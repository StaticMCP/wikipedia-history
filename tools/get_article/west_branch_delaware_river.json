It is approximately 90&nbsp;mi (144&nbsp;km) long, and flows through the U.S. states of New York and Pennsylvania. It winds through a mountainous area of New York in the western Catskill Mountains for most of its course, before joining the East Branch along the northeast border of Pennsylvania with New York. Midway or so it is impounded by the Cannonsville Dam to form the Cannonsville Reservoir, both part of the New York City water supply system for delivering drinking water to the City.\nCourse\nIt rises in Jefferson, Schoharie County, New York and flows generally southwest, entering Delaware County and flowing past Stamford and Delhi. In southwestern Delaware County it flows in an increasingly winding course through the mountains, generally southwest. At Stilesville it is impounded to form the Cannonsville Reservoir. At Deposit, on the border between Broome and Delaware counties, it turns sharply to the southeast and is paralleled by New York State Route&nbsp;17. It joins the East Branch at Hancock to form the Delaware. For the lower 6&nbsp;mi (10&nbsp;km) it forms part of the boundary between New York and Pennsylvania.\nHydrology\nThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains many stream gauges along the West Branch Delaware River.\nThe station by the Village of Delhi, in operation since 1937, but making daily measurements since November 1996, is located  upstream from the bridge on Route 28, and  upstream from the confluence of the Little Delaware River. This station had a maximum discharge of about  and a gauge height of  from floodmark on January 19, 1996 and a maximum gauge height of  on August 28, 2011 as Hurricane Irene passed through the area. It had a minimum discharge of  on September 25, 1964 and a minimum gauge height of  on September 16–17, 2016.\nThe Hobart station, in service since 2000, is located  upstream from Maple Street in the Hamlet of Hobart. This station had a maximum discharge of about  and a gauge height of  on August 28, 2011 caused by Hurricane Irene. It had a minimum discharge of  on November 13, 2001 and November 19, 2001.\nThe Walton station, in service since 1950, is located  downstream from West Brook in the Village of Walton. This station had a maximum discharge of about  and a gauge height of  on June 28, 2006 during the 2006 Mid-Atlantic United States flood. It had a minimum discharge of  on September 15 and November 22, 1964.\nThe Hale Eddy station, in service since 1912, is located  upstream from the confluence of East and West Branches. Since the construction of the Cannonsville Reseevoir this station had a maximum discharge of  and a gauge height of  on June 28, 2006 during the 2006 Mid-Atlantic United States flood. It had a minimum discharge of  on October 20, 1963. The maximum discharge, prior to the construction of Cannonsville Reservoir in 1963, was  on March 22, 1948. Outside the period of record: In the flood of October 10, 1903 this station reached a discharge of roughly\nFishing\nThe West Branch is a tailwater fishery. This means the same cold water releases that keep it cooler in the summer, keep the river a little warmer in the winter and early spring. The upper section can be cleaner than other rivers during periods of heavy runoff. During high water on the Cannonsville Reservoir, many bait fish spill over the dam. These factors all provide an excellent environment for trout to thrive in.\nThe trout population in this river is naturally reproducing. During the warm months stocked trout from smaller and warmer tributaries will seek sanctuary in their cool water. The West Branch Delaware River was divided into two sections when the Cannonsville Reservoir was formed. Downstream of the Cannonsville Reservoir, there are large numbers of wild populations of brown trout and rainbow trout and an occasional brook trout can be caught although none are stocked. Seasonal anadromous runs of American shad with reports of occasional striped bass. This section is considered one of the best fly fishing trout streams in the United States, due to the cold water released from the reservoir.\nTributaries\nNot including tributaries of Cannonsville Reservoir\nRight\n* Basset Brook\n* Lake Brook\n* McMurdy Brook\n* Betty Brook\n* Kiff Brook\n* Wright Brook\n* Kidd Brook\n* Elk Creek\n* Falls Creek\n* Steele Brook\n* Peaks Brook\n* Platner Brook\n* East Brook\n* West Brook\n* Pines Brook\n* Bobs Brook\n* Wakeman Brook\n* Cold Spring Creek\n* Butler Brook\n* Oquaga Creek\n* Sherman Creek\n* Faulkner Brook\n* Balls Creek\nLeft\n* Town Brook\n* Rose Brook\n* Little Delaware River\n* Bagley Brook\n* Mallory Brook\n* Weeds Brook\n* Beers Brook\n* Chase Brook\n* Whitaker Brook\n* Roods Creek\n* Travis Brook\n* Sands Creek\nSee also\n*List of rivers of New York\n*List of rivers of Pennsylvania\nReferences"
