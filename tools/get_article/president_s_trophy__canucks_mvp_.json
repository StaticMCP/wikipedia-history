      "text": "# President's Trophy (Canucks MVP)\n\nThe '''President's Trophy''' was awarded to the most valuable player (MVP) of the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was awarded from 1974–75 to 1995–96. It was originally presented by CP Air and later Canadian Airlines and the player won a pair of airline tickets with the trophy. Many of the names matched the Cyclone Taylor Trophy (also awarded to the MVP as selected by the fans). After the 1995–96 season the President's Trophy was discontinued and the Cyclone Taylor Trophy became the sole Canucks MVP award.\nWinners\n(1989, 1991, 1995, 1996).]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
