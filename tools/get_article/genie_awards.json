They succeeded the Canadian Film Awards (1949–1978). In 2013, the Academy merged the Genie Awards with its sister presentation for television, the Gemini Awards, to form the Canadian Screen Awards.\nGenie Award candidates were selected from submissions made by the owners of Canadian films or their representatives, based on the criteria laid out in the Genie Rules and Regulations booklet which were distributed to Academy members and industry members. Peer-group juries, assembled from volunteer members of the Academy, met to watch the submissions and select a group of nominees. Academy members then voted on these nominations.\nBroadcasting\nThe Genie Awards were aired by CBC from 1980 to 2003, before moving to CHUM Limited's networks (Citytv, Bravo! and Star!).  After CTVglobemedia purchased CHUM Limited, the Genie Awards moved to Canwest Global's E and IFC for 2008. The last two Genie Awards (2011–2012) were broadcast by the CBC.\nAwards ceremonies\nListing of all Genie Awards ceremonies:\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
