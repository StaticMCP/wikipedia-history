On June 2, 1992, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton won the 1992 Democratic nomination for President of the United States, and became the presumptive nominee. On July 9, 1992, Tennessee Senator Albert Gore Jr. was chosen as his running mate.\nClinton considered roughly forty different candidates for vice president, including those who did not hold elective office, but Clinton ultimately chose Gore, a two-term senator who had previously run for president in 1988. Former Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher led Clinton's vice presidential selection team. In making the selection, Clinton emphasized Gore's experience with foreign policy and environmental issues. Clinton's choice of a fellow young southern centrist defied conventional wisdom, but the choice of Gore was well-received, and Gore made an effective surrogate on the campaign trail.\nThe Clinton–Gore ticket would go on to defeat the Republican ticket of incumbents Bush–Quayle and the Independent ticket of Perot–Stockdale in 1992, and the Republican ticket of Dole–Kemp and the Reform ticket of Perot–Choate in 1996. The Clinton-Gore duo became the youngest ticket in history to win a presidential election. Gore went on to become the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000 but ultimately lost to George W. Bush in the close general election.\nSelection\nFinal Six\nFile:Al Gore Senate portrait (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:BobGrahamCropped.jpg|\nFile:Lee Hamilton (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Jay Rockefeller portrait (3x4).jpg|\nFile:Harris Wofford gradient background.jpg|\nFile:Bob Kerrey portrait (cropped).gif|alt=|\nMedia speculation on possible vice presidential candidates\nMembers of Congress\nFile:Bill Bradley P01255-06 a.jpg|\nFile:John lewis official biopic (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Nancy Pelosi in 1997 (cropped).gif|\nFile:Paul Tsongas (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nGovernors\nFile:Mario Cuomo 1991.jpg|\nFile:Ann Richards Texas Governor October 1992 (cropped1).jpg|\nOther Individuals\nFile:KathleenBrown (cropped).png|\nFile:Marian Wright Edelman (cropped).jpg|\nFile:Jesse Jackson portrait.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Kurt Schmoke (cropped).jpg|\nFile:John Sculley 2006 (closeup).jpg|\nSee also\n*Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign\n*1992 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n*1992 Democratic National Convention\n*1992 United States presidential election\n*List of United States major party presidential tickets\nReferences"
