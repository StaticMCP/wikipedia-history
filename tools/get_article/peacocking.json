Peacocking is very common among men, and it can happen either consciously or subconsciously. Peacocking happens subconsciously especially when a desirable female suddenly comes into sight. Prevalence of peacocking strongly correlates with woman's level of attractiveness.\nAccording to some feminist scholars, men may tend to peacock because of the patriarchal ideas created by society. This hierarchy created between men and women and this idea of men competing for women's attention leads to peacocking.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.thegentlemansjournal.com/article/gentlemans-guide-peacocking/ A Gentleman's Guide to Peacocking]"
