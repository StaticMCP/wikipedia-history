It was the last military conflict between Blancos and Colorados.\nHistory\nIt was the bloodiest of the revolutions that occurred in Uruguay, with large numbers of casualties and injuries on both sides. On June 6, 1904, took place the Battle of Guayabos (Salto Department), in which the saravista colonel Abelardo Márquez, was defeated by government troops.\nIn the Battle of Tupambaé, General Aparicio Saravia faced the troops of General Pablo Galarza in the department of Cerro Largo. Saravia was wounded during the Battle of Masoller, and died several days later in Santana do Livramento, Brazil. The armistice was signed on September 24, 1904.\nSeveral sons of Aparicio Saravia fought in the ranks of the revolutionary army. His brother Basilicio Saravia, served in the government army.\nGallery\nFile:Coronel Manuel Macedo.jpg|Colonel Manuel Macedo Fuliáo, and sons during the Revolution of 1904\nFile:Práctica de tiro de fuerzas saravistas en 1904.jpg|shooting practice of Saravistas forces\nFile:Coronel José F.
