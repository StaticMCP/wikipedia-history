      "text": "# 2007 United Kingdom floods__disambig_1\n\n| affected = (see below)\n}}\nA series of large floods occurred in parts of the United Kingdom during the summer of 2007. The worst of the flooding occurred across parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland on 14 June; East Yorkshire and the Midlands on 15 June; Yorkshire, the Midlands, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire on 25 June; and Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and South Wales on 28 July 2007.\nJune was one of the wettest months on record in the United Kingdom (see List of weather records). Average rainfall across the country was ; more than double the June average. Some areas received a month's worth of precipitation in 24 hours. It was the UK's wettest May–July period since records began in 1776. July had unusually unsettled weather and above-average rainfall through the month, peaking on 20 July as an active frontal system dumped more than  of rain in southern England.\nCivil and military authorities described the June and July rescue efforts as the biggest in the UK in peacetime. The Environment Agency described the July floods as critical and expected them to exceed the 1947 benchmark.\nMeteorological background\n.]]\nJune 2007 started quietly with an anticyclone to the north of the United Kingdom maintaining a dry, cool easterly flow. From 10 June the high pressure began to break down as an upper trough moved into the area, triggering thunderstorms that caused flooding in Northern Ireland on 12 June.\nLater that week, a slow-moving area of low pressure from the west of Biscay moved east across the British Isles. At the same time an associated occluded front moved into northern England, becoming very active as it did so, with the peak rainfall on 15 June. Rainfall records were broken across the region, leading to localised flooding. As it weakened, the front moved north into Scotland on 16 June and left England and Wales with a very unstable airmass, frequent heavy showers, thunderstorms and cloudy conditions. This led to localised flash flooding and prevented significant drying where earlier rains had fallen.\nOn 25 June, another unseasonably low pressure (993&nbsp;hPa&nbsp;/&nbsp;29.3&nbsp;inHg) depression, Cyclone Uriah, moved across England. The associated front settled over northern and eastern England and dumped more than  of rain in places. The combination of high rainfall and high water levels from the earlier rainfall led to extensive flooding across many parts of England and Wales, with the Midlands, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, South, West and East Yorkshire the most affected. Gales along the east coast also caused storm damage. RAF Fylingdales on the North York Moors reported rainfall totals of  in 24 hours, an estimated  in Hull and  on Emley Moor in West Yorkshire. Until 2007, the average monthly total for June for the whole UK was .\nOn 27 June, the Met Office released an early warning of severe weather for the approaching weekend, stating that  of rain could fall in some areas, raising the possibility of more flooding within the already saturated flood plains.\nOn 20 July, another active frontal system moved across southern England. Many places recorded a month's rainfall or more in one day. The Met Office at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire reported : a sixth of its annual rainfall. The college at Pershore in Worcestershire reported , causing the Environment Agency to issue 16 further severe flood warnings. By 21 July, many towns and villages were flooded, with Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, London and South Wales facing the brunt of the heavy rainfall.\nClimate researchers suggested that the unusual weather leading to the floods might be linked to that year's appearance of La Nina in the Pacific Ocean, and to the jet stream being further south than normal.\nAffected areas in England\naffected in June and July 2007 floods as of 24 July (marked in blue)]]\naffected in June and July 2007 floods as of 24 July (marked in blue)]]\nEngland was affected by the June and July floods, with the North badly hit in June, the West badly hit in July, and many areas hit in both.

Stoke Goldington was affected again on 3 July, with 10 houses being flooded.\nBy 21 July, seventy homes and businesses were flooded by the River Ouse in Buckingham and 30 people spent the night in the town's Radcliffe centre, but  away a system of balancing lakes prevented Milton Keynes from suffering significantly, apart from a flash flood of Stony Stratford High Street from the River Ouse.\nCambridgeshire\nOn 24 July, four bridges in St Neots were shut when the river level peaked, and the Environment Agency warned residents in the St Neots, Paxton and Offords areas to expect flooding that night. By 25 July, parts of St Ives were flooded. Later the same day, the Environment Agency advised residents near the River Great Ouse that the peak had passed and further flooding was unlikely.\nCounty Durham\nOn 15 June, heavy rainfall caused the postponement of the fourth test match between England and the West Indies at the Riverside Ground, Chester-le-Street. On 23 June, flash floods affected parts of Darlington and Stanhope Road, Northgate, St Cuthbert's Way, Parkgate and Haughton Road were closed after water levels rose by about 2&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(0.6&nbsp;m). It has also led to Woodland Road to improve its drainage to prevent such flooding on one of the main roads out the town.

Tewkesbury was completely cut off with no road access, parts of the town were under around  of water and flood waters entered Tewkesbury Abbey for the first time in 247 years. Tewkesbury's Mythe Water Treatment Works were flooded. Severn Trent Water warned that treated water would run out by early Sunday evening in Tewkesbury, Cheltenham, Gloucester and surrounding areas.\nCombined military and civil emergency services tried to prevent floods reaching the Walham electricity substation in Gloucester supplying half a million people. On 23 July, 50,000 Gloucestershire homes were left without electricity after a major electricity substation in Castle Meads had to be turned off. Efforts to stop flooding at Walham substation succeeded; the Castle Meads substation was repaired the next day.\nBy 24 July, an estimated 420,000 people were without running water, including most of the population of Gloucester, Cheltenham, and Tewkesbury. Emergency services continued repair work at the Mythe water-treatment works, but Severn Trent Water estimated that water supplies would not be restored for at least 14 days. 900 drinking water bowsers were brought in, and the Army was mobilised to distribute three million bottles of water a day and keep the bowsers filled. Coors, Carlsberg, Scottish and Newcastle, Inbev and Greene King brewing companies offered 23 beer tankers to help supply drinking water. On 26 July, Severn Trent Water organised a temporary non-potable water supply to 10,000 homes in Tewkesbury.

Following the flooding in July, the RAF said it was carrying out its biggest-ever peacetime rescue operation, with six Sea King helicopters from as far afield as RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall, RAF Valley in Anglesey and RAF Leconfield in the East Riding of Yorkshire rescuing up to 120 people. An RAF heavy lift Chinook helicopter was also employed to move aggregate to reinforce the banks of the River Don. The Environment Agency described the situation as \"critical\".\n4x4 Response groups from throughout the UK assisted councils and blue light services during and in the immediate aftermath of the flooding. During the recovery phase a number of responders from around the UK 4x4 Response assisted the Red Cross in the distribution of fresh drinking water in the Gloucestershire area after mains drinking water was contaminated.\nHealth risks\nThe Health Protection Agency advised people that the risk of contracting any illness was low but that it was best to avoid coming into direct contact with flood water. There were no reported cases of any outbreaks. In some areas bottled water was handed out where sewage works got flooded.\nCrop damage\nThe floods caused widespread crop damage, especially broccoli, carrots, peas and potatoes. In parts of Lincolnshire it was estimated that 40% of the pea crop may have been damaged, with other crops also suffering major losses. Prices of vegetables were expected to rise in the following months.\nFinancial cost\nEnvironment Agency chief executive Baroness Young said that about £1&nbsp;billion a year was needed to improve flood defences. The Association of British Insurers has estimated the total bill for the June and July floods as £3&nbsp;billion.\nA report by the Environment Agency in 2010 concluded that \"the scale and seriousness of the summer 2007 floods were sufficient to classify them as a national disaster\", and that the \"total economic costs of the summer 2007 floods are estimated at about £3.2&nbsp;billion in 2007 prices, within a possible range of between £2.5&nbsp;billion and £3.8&nbsp;billion.\nGovernment response\nOn 3 July, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn announced that the Government would increase the spending on risk management and flood defences by £200&nbsp;million to £800&nbsp;million by 2010–11.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons later that month, Prime Minister Gordon Brown promised £46&nbsp;million in aid to flood-hit councils and £800&nbsp;million rise in annual spending on flood protection by 2010–11, confirming Hilary Benn's announcement. Brown also pledged to push insurance firms to make payouts.\nOn 22 July, the Government convened COBRA to co-ordinate the response to the crisis.\nVisiting Gloucestershire on 25 July, Mr. Brown praised emergency services for their efforts, but added: \"We've got to get the supplies stepped up. We will get more tankers in, we will get more bowsers in, we will get more regular filling of them, and at the same time, more bottled water will be provided.\"\nOn 8 August 2007, Defra announced that Sir Michael Pitt would chair an independent review of the response to the flooding. On 4 September of that year the Cabinet Office website launched a comments page to let people affected by the flooding contribute their experiences to the review.\nSir Michael published his interim report on 17 December 2007.\nIn April 2010 the government passed the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which implemented many of Sir Michael Pitt's recommendations. The Act gives more power and responsibility to the Environment Agency and local authorities to plan flood defences co-ordinated across catchment areas and the wider country, to counteract the tendency for defences to be built for upstream areas without much thought for how this might be making flooding worse for downstream areas. In also brings in a new regime whereby new building activity which exacerbates flooding by reducing the capacity of land to absorb water will need to be accompanied by the construction of sustainable drainage systems such as grassy roofs, ponds and soakaways.\nCriticism of Hull City Council\nHull City Council was criticised for not insuring the city's libraries, schools and other public buildings. In response, Hull City Council said that \"Many councils do not have the feature in their budget\", but other flood-hit councils were insured. It was thought that council tax payers would be left with the bill, as emergency Government funding would not cover it.\nCriticism of government response\nIn June, councillors in Hull claimed that the city was being forgotten and had the floods occurred in the Home Counties, help would have arrived much more quickly. One in five homes in Hull was damaged and 90 out of the city's 105 schools suffered some damage. Damage to the schools alone was estimated to cost £100&nbsp;million. The Bellwin scheme for providing aid after natural disasters was criticised as inadequate by Hull MP Diana Johnson. The lack of media coverage of flooding in Kingston upon Hull led the city council leader Carl Minns to dub Hull \"the forgotten city\".\nIn July, the Government came under mounting criticism of its handling of the crisis, the fact that responsibilities were spread across four departments and no single minister could be held responsible, and the fact that the Army had not been called in to assist.\nThe Observer newspaper stated on 22 July 2007 that the Government had been warned in the spring by the Met Office that summer flooding would be likely because the El Niño phenomenon had weakened, but no action was taken.\nIn response to the criticism, Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said on BBC Sunday AM that \"This was very, very intense rainfall, with five inches in 24 hours in some areas; even some of the best defences are going to be overwhelmed\". He praised the way the emergency services had dealt with \"unprecedented\" levels of rainfall and said he had \"total confidence\" in the response of the Environment Agency.\nConservative leader David Cameron called for a public inquiry into the flooding after visiting Witney, the main town in his Oxfordshire constituency.\nThen Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell accused the government of lack of preparation leading to a \"summer of suffering\", and said, \"With sophisticated weather forecasting as we now have, particularly in relation to what's happened over the weekend, there are quite a few questions as to how it was that flood-prevention measures were not in place or were not more effective.\"\nSee also\n* List of natural disasters in Britain and Ireland\n** 2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods\n** Great Sheffield Flood\n* Flood risk assessment\n* Rihanna Curse\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080430172837/http://www.bluelinemedia.co.uk/onlinebowsermaps.php Online Bowser Maps For Gloucestershire]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071030040241/http://www.ukflood.co.uk/ UK Flood]\n* [http://www.tewkesburymedievaltown.uk/tewkesbury-flood-risk/ Tewkesbury's Ongoing Flood Risk] (Tewkesbury's new river monitoring system)\n* [http://www.tewkesburymedievaltown.uk/ Tewkesbury Medieval Town Showcase] (Tewkesbury Town recovered)"
