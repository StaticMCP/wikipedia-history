Since its creation in 2007 it has returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system.\nBoundaries\nLocated in the south-west of Glasgow adjoining the Renfrewshire region to the west and East Renfrewshire to the south, the ward includes most of Pollok (excluding the northern Lyoncross/Templeland area north of the Levern Water which falls under Cardonald ward) as well as Priesthill, Househillwood, Darnley, Hurlet, Nitshill, South Nitshill, Jenny Lind, Parkhouse, Roughmussel, Southpark Village, Deaconsbank and the southern part of Crookston.\nA 2017 boundary change removed the Arden neighbourhood which was re-assigned to the Newlands/Auldburn ward.
