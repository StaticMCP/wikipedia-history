Prior to this experience, he had played for Sydenham Barnsley in Durban.\nOn his return to South Africa, King had a short spell with Blackburn Rovers (SA), before moving to Black Leopards in November 2014. After two seasons with the Leopards, in which he featured sparingly, he moved to fellow National First Division side Santos (SA).\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Blackburn Rovers (SA)\n|2013–14\n|rowspan=3|National First Division\n|8||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||8||0\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Black Leopards\n|2014–15\n|10||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||12||0\n|-\n|2015–16\n|5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0\n|-\n! colspan=2|Total\n!15!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!17!!0\n|-\n|Santos (SA)\n|2016–17\n|National First Division\n|5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0\n|-\n! colspan=3|Career total\n!28!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0!!30!!0\n|}\n;Notes\nReferences"
