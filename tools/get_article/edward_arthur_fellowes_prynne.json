The church architect George Fellowes Prynne was his elder brother.\nPrynne attended St Mary's College in Harlow, founded in 1852 by the Anglo-Catholic cleric Charles Jonathan Goulden, from 1855 a member of the Society of the Holy Cross. He was later at Eastman's Royal Naval Academy, intended for the Royal Navy. At the suggestion of Frederic Leighton, however, he decided to embark on an artistic career. After preliminary training in art schools in London, he travelled to Antwerp, where he studied with the Belgian painter Charles Verlat. Subsequent study was undertaken in Florence, Paris and Rome.\nPrynne married Emma Mary Joll in 1888, with whom he had two sons and three daughters: Beatrice Mary Fellowes Prynne (1893–1993), Dorothy Etheldreda Prynne (1894–1983), George Michael Fellowes Prynne (1896–1973), Stella Christine Marie Prynne (1898–1957) and John Rundle Fellowes Prynne (1903–1931). On moving to London in the 1880s, he lived at 8 Avonmore Road in Kensington Olympia (later home of the author Gavin Maxwell). He subsequently lived for over 20 years at 1 Woodville Road in Ealing. Prynne and his family became part of the community of artists living in Ealing. He was a member of Ealing Art Group, and was present at their first meeting in 1911. Prynne and his family attended St Peter's Church, Ealing.\nWork\nPrynne's early paintings showed a clear debt to his teacher Charles Verlat. Soon after his return from the continent, however, the artist fell under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite school of painting, which he admired.\nPrynne painted over 60 portraits, including a commission to paint a life-size portrait of the Duke of Edinburgh, as Admiral of the Fleet. By command of Queen Victoria, he attended Osborne House to show this portrait, which was later hung in the Royal Naval Barracks at Devonport. Prynne also painted mythological and religious pictures. Notable among these were ''Cophetua's Queen, Orpheus and Eurydice, Pan and Syrinx, and Silent Voices of the Studio''.\nReligious work\nPrynne shared the ardent Anglo Catholic faith of his father and brother, George Fellowes Prynne. He is principally celebrated for his religious art, which was commissioned and purchased for churches across the county – particularly in Devon and Cornwall. In many instances, Prynne's painted altar and reredos panels and stained-glass grace the churches designed and restored by his brother.\nOne of Prynne's most striking and original works is his altar piece, 'Benedicite Domino Laudate Et Superexaltate Eum in Saecula', which includes five painted panels illustrating separate lines from the canticle of creation. Here Prynne's mythological and religious worlds combine, notably in the panel depicting a sub-marine angel garbed in scales and delicate fish fin wings. The piece was shown in the Royal Society of British Artists 114th Exhibition in 1896; a reviewer commenting, 'Mr. E. A. Fellowes Prynne shows an altar-piece, \"Benedicite,\" rich in colour and the artist's mannerisms'. Other artists highlighted for praise by the otherwise unimpressed reviewer included W. Graham Robertson, William Luker, and Tom Robertson.\nPrynne's painting 'Magnificat,' appeared in 1894 in the New Gallery on Regents Street, London. Other exhibits included 'Love among the Ruins' by Edward Burne Jones, as well as work by work by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, George Frederic Watts, Leonard Leslie Brooke, Charles Edward Hallé, Edward Matthew Hale, Walter Crane, William Laidlay, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, George Hitchcock, Frank William Brangwyn, Andrew Brown Donaldson, George Henry Boughton, Arthur Lemon, George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle, Edward Poynter, William Llewellyn (painter), William Logsdail, Philip Norman (artist), Clara Montalba, William Wontner and George Frampton. 'Magnificat' also appeared at the L'Exposition Internationale du Bruxelles in 1897, where it was thought by a reviewer to be 'an exquisite conception'.\nPrynne's 'Ecce Ancilla Domini,' painted during the same year, was praised for its beauty, delicacy and composition. It was displayed at the Royal Society of British Artists exhibition in 1895. Both of these pictures were presented by Mr. C. Lang Huggins to St Mark's Church, Hadlow Down, Sussex.\n'The Desire of all Nations', a depiction if the nativity is amongst Prynne's chief works and became extremely well-known. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1895, the reviewer in The Antiquary magazine noting that the painting would be suitable for display in a church setting. Such was the picture's destiny, for it was purchased by the Rev. Harry Wilson for St. Augustine's Church, Stepney, together with a set of Prynne's Stations of the Cross.\nThe copyrights of both the 'Magnificat' and 'The Desire of all Nations' were purchased by the Berlin Photographic Company in 1896, and subsequently reproduced in photogravure and widely circulated in all parts of the world. The paintings were included in a Berlin Photographic Company 'Catalogue of Select Publications' in 1906.\n'Christ before Pilate,' 'Christ's Entry into Jerusalem,' and 'St. Joseph's Dream,' are also amongst his most accomplished pictures. The first, painted in 1898, was exhibited in Paris, Berlin, and Düsseldorf International Exhibition of Religious Art, and was donated to St Peter's Church, Ealing, by Prynne's widow after his death. A complete set of fourteen Stations of the Cross was later painted for the Rev. H. Eardley-Wilmot for St Mary's Church, Ilford, together with three altar panels for the church. The last altar panels painted by Prynne were for St Mary's Church, East Grinstead, representing Jesus' entombment, with adoring angels on each side. His picture, 'Lux Mundi,' was the motif of a large sculptured panel in the reredos above. In the same year that 'Christ Before Pilate' appeared, Prynne painted 'Rex Judaeorum', another religious painting, which was listed for sale in 1908 for £21 (over £1500 today).\nPrynne's most ambitious scheme, and perhaps his masterpiece, was a mural painted on the walls of St. Peter's Church, Plymouth – a church designed by George Fellowes Prynne – in memory of their Father. Painted above the chancel arch, it depicted Christ triumphant, surrounded by hundreds of angels and saints. Such was the size of the painting, approximately 650 square feet, that it was executed in separate sections, pieced together. On the side walls immediately above the nave arcade were scenes from the life of St Peter, and other pictures adorn the walls of the church.\n'The colouring of the mural was original and daring – Prynne used wax to dull surface of fresco without sacrificing depth of colour. The cerulean ground at the top of the composition, and the ringed gold of the halos, recalled the joyously ecstatic art of Fra Angelico, and formed a rich harmony with the multi-hued draperies, giving also the keynote to the layers of violet cloud that separated the rows of figures.' Tragically, the paintings were destroyed when the church was damaged during World War Two.\nAnother important collaboration between Prynne and George Fellowes Prynne was at St Peter's Church, Staines, where the artist provided vibrant and complex window designs of remarkable quality and beauty for his brother's new church. The windows, created from the 1890s onwards, are considered to constitute one of Prynne's finest legacies. In 1903, his design for the Staines Nativity Window was displayed at the Royal Academy 135th Exhibition.\nPrynne often worked as an outside glass designer for various architects and designers. This included John J Jennings (as at St Peter's Church Staines), whose glassworks were on Clapham Road in South London, and Percy Bacon Brothers.\nOther notable examples of collaboration between the Prynne brothers include altar panels at Holy Trinity, Roehampton, and St Mary, East Grinstead, and a reredos at St Mary the Virgin Church, Hayes.\nIn addition to the Royal Academy, Prynne exhibited pictures at Royal Society of British Artists, New Gallery, Grosvenor Gallery, and at important galleries in Liverpool, Glasgow, Birmingham and Brussels. He was elected as a member of the Royal Society of British Artists in October 1895.\nFinal years and death\nRepresenting the pinnacle of his painted devotional work, in 1918, the Anglican religious order the Cowley Fathers, approached Prynne to create a set of 14 painted Stations of the Cross for St John the Evangelist Church, Oxford. Prynne thought that the church \"afforded a unique opportunity by reason of the splendid wall-space and regarded the commission as \"a very great pleasure and high privilege,\" and over the next few years he and the Fathers wrangled over the details. The striking – although not unproblematic – set of images was finally installed in the church in 1921. The station depicting Christ's trial is based on Prynne's earlier picture, 'Christ Before Pilate', painted in 1898. The last four 'Stations' were the final paintings on which Prynne worked – the last painting he touched was the 'Entombment of Christ.'\nOn 29 January 1921, Prynne's eldest daughter, Beatrice, was married to Yule Crosby (1889–1977) at St Peter's Church, Ealing. Crosby was a South African mining engineer who met the Prynne family whilst he was working as a billeting officer in London during the First World War. The newly married couple emigrated to South Africa, and Edward never saw his daughter again, nor meet his grandchild (also called Beatrice), born the following year.\nJust before his death, Prynne was included in an Illustrated Who's who of Notable Londoners – one of just 22 artists, including Edwin Lutyens and Philip de László. Other Londoners featured, included Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George.\nPrynne died on 28 December 1921. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin Church, Hayes (where his brother, George Fellowes Prynne was also later buried). His obituary in The Builder magazine opined that:\n''\"It is not too much to say that the death of Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne on December 28 removes from the religious art world an artist of very exceptional ability, and one whose absolute sincerity and devotion to the highest ideals of his art are stamped upon every kind of work of a religious character that he undertook. [...] In his views on art generally he was very broad-minded, and always aimed at seeing the good points in a fellow-artist's work, if such there were, rather than offering severe criticism, and he always welcomed honest criticism of his own work. [...] In private life Mr. Prynne was a very attractive character, and had the power of making and retaining the friendship of others. He was intensely fond of music, and, aided by Mrs. Prynne, constantly entertained friends in a charmingly informal manner, and there are many who will look back with mingled feelings of pleasure and regret on the delightful musical evenings spent in that interesting and altogether fascinating studio.\"''\nOn 29 September 1922, Prynne's widow, Emma Prynne, presented her late husband's famous 1898 painting of 'Christ Before Pilate' to St Peter's Church, Ealing, in his memory. (In 1947, one of Prynne's daughters additionally donated a set of photographic reproductions of his Stations of the Cross for the Cowley Fathers – now lost).\nIn 1934, Beatrice, Yule and their three children visited Emma Fellowes Prynne, who still lived at number 1 Woodville Road in Ealing. Edward Arthur Fellowes Prynne's studio in the garden remained partly furnished as before his death 23 years before. Emma Fellowes Prynne's daughter Beatrice later emigrated from South Africa to New Zealand.\nSale prices\nIn 1985 Prynne's 'Portrait of Mark Tucker' sold for £418 at auction. The same year 'a religious roundel' was sold for £4,000. In 1998, Prynne's painting, 'Enthroned', sold for $17,000.\nGalleries and public collections\n* The Bishop's Palace, Exeter, holds a portrait of Frederick Temple (1821–1902), Bishop of Exeter (1869–1885), later Archbishop of Canterbury.\n* Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum holds two pictures by Edward Fellowes Prynne.\nKnown church work\n, Essex]]\n* St Nicholas's Church Arundel (West Sussex).
