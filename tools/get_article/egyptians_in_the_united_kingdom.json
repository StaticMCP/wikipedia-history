The historical veracity of the story is greatly doubted, however. And under the Roman Empire, Britannia and Egypt were two provinces of a single empire which had considerable trade and interaction between its constituent parts. However, if any Egyptians settled in Roman Britain, there was little evidence left of their presence.\nEgyptians historically have been averse to emigrating from their country, even when suffering with significant poverty. As such, prior to the late 1960s, only small numbers of Egyptians moved to the United Kingdom, and even then mostly for the purposes of study. As the Egyptian Revolution that began in 1952 developed an increasingly socialist character under Gamal Abdel Nasser, with the nationalisation of many private businesses, some upper and middle class Egyptians sought to leave the country. However, large scale emigration did not occur until after Egypt's defeat in the Six-Day War of 1967, which left the Sinai Peninsula entirely under Israeli occupation, and placed an immense economic burden on the country.\nGiven the severity of the country's economic woes following the war, particularly after the outbreak of the War of Attrition, the Egyptian Government saw advantages in Egyptians moving overseas to work and send home remittances. Therefore, it partially relaxed the strict regulations against emigration (which included requirements for exit visas). This change in approach was extended under Nasser's successor as President of Egypt, Anwar El-Sadat. Over the course of the 1970s and 1980s, many Egyptians took advantage of the loosening of these restrictions, and moved to Western states, such as the United Kingdom, and the oil rich states of the Persian Gulf.\nOver the same period, heightened religious tension in Egypt resulted in further emigration, largely of Copts, although the numbers emigrating to the U.K. were small compared to Canada and Australia. With Egypt's economic liberalisation under Sadat in the 1970s, labour migration to the U.K. increased, as did the flow of Egyptians moving to the U.K. for higher education. Many students stayed in Britain after finishing their studies. During this time, many Egyptian businessmen migrated to the U.K. to establish businesses.\nDemographics\nAccording to the 2001 UK Census, some 24,700 Egyptian-born people were present in the UK.\nAccording to the 2011 UK Census, a total of 31,338 people born in Egypt were residing in the UK: 28,927 were recorded in England, 894 in Wales, 1,322 in Scotland, and 195 in Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the equivalent figure in 2019 was 39,000.\nProminent British-Egyptians or Egyptians residing in the United Kingdom\nOM FRS, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Imperial College London]]\n* Sir Magdi Yacoub OM FRS: British-Egyptian cardiothoracic surgeon celebrated as the surgeon that carried out UK's first heart and lung transplant in the 1980s.\n* Hosney Yosef OBE: radiologist awarded an OBE in 2006 in recognition of his services to medicine in western Scotland.\n* Anba Angaelos OBE: General Bishop in the United Kingdom of the Coptic Orthodox Church.
