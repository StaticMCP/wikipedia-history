      "text": "# Marquess of Buckingham\n\nMarquess of Buckingham was a title that has been created two times in the peerages of England and Great Britain.\nThe first creation of the marquessate was in 1618 for George Villiers, a favourite of James I of England. He had previously been made Baron Whaddon, of Whaddon in the County of Buckingham, and Viscount Villiers in 1616, then Earl of Buckingham in 1617. Later he was also created Earl of Coventry and Duke of Buckingham in 1623. With his son's death in 1687, the title became extinct.\nThe second creation came in 1784, when George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 3rd Earl Temple was made Marquess of Buckingham in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was son of George Grenville, Prime Minister of Great Britain. However, on his grandson's death in 1889 without male issue, the marquessate of Buckingham became extinct.\nMarquesses of Buckingham (1618)\n*George Villiers, 1st Marquess of Buckingham (1592–1628) (created Duke of Buckingham in 1623)\nSee Dukes of Buckingham\nMarquesses of Buckingham (1784)\n*George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham (1753–1813)\n*Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham (1776–1839) (created Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1822)\nSee Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos\nFamily tree\nSee also\n* Earls of Buckingham\nReferences"
