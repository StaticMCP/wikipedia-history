Kaguya is the daughter of a wealthy conglomerate family, and Miyuki is the top student at the school and well known across the prefecture. Although they like each other, they are too proud to confess their love, as they believe whoever does so first would \"lose\" in their relationship. The story follows their many schemes to make the other one confess or at least show signs of affection.\nHalfway through the series, they manage to confess to each other. From there, focus shifts on how they advance their relationship and deal with remaining obstacles. The presence and complexity of several other characters notably increases over time as well.\nProduction\nConception\nAkasaka was writing the manga Instant Bullets for Weekly Young Jump and wanted to come up with another series. In an interview on Livedoor News, Akasaka said the original plot for Kaguya-sama was more of a fantasy and game of death, but his editor wanted something more mainstream and, at the time, Young Jump did not have a casual romcom series. It was Akasaka's first manga in the romcom genre.\nAkasaka set the series in high school as it was a time when he did not have much experience with dating and romance himself. He was thinking of high school relationships while smoking some food, and came up with the concept of wanting to reclaim some of his emotions of his youth in a fantasy. He envisioned \"two  who like each other having battles of the mind\". He thought that was a very common concept, but was surprised to find that readers were telling him that his premise was innovative. Also at first, he wanted to do more intellectual battles like Death Note but the theme changed more to \"clashing of romantic emotions\". He has also cited School Rumble as an influence on his work.\nCharacter design\nThe characters' names were derived from the  The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (better known outside of Japan as The Tale of Princess Kaguya). Akasaka stated that he has long liked princess stories and that Kaguya-hime, the main character from the aforementioned , was one of the most famous princess stories. In developing the characters, he said that Kaguya and Miyuki initially have the same personality and thought process, like twins, which made their exposition to the reader easier to understand. He then developed more divergence between the two. Other characters were developed in the same manner, starting as shallow and template-like, but being filled with realistic feelings and drawn from the author's and his acquaintances' personal experience. He especially liked contrasting characters whose internal personalities differ from their external portrayal.\nDevelopment and themes\nIn developing a chapter or story, Akasaka would think about emotions first and then write about experiencing the emotions, such as what Kaguya would feel if she were jealous. He would then arrange the characters and events around that emotion. When he thinks of some emotion that he hasn't developed into a story yet, he writes it on a sticky note or notebook to be used later.\nAkasaka said that he originally wanted to make a manga that would help office ladies relax, but since he is an , it seems to follow in that. He also believes the manga is more about providing the reader with something exciting and conveying meaningful messages about human relationships rather than to showcase a number of character gags and reactions. Akasaka said that Kaguya and Miyuki's becoming third-year students marks the second half of the story. When asked about the ending, he said he does not know whether he will go with the bad ending as with Kaguya-hime, but wouldn't mind if it did. He also considered giving each character a curtain call chapter like they do in the dating sims, eventually deciding to do this.\nMedia\nManga\nList of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War chapters}}\nAka Akasaka launched the series in the June issue of Shueisha's  manga magazine Miracle Jump on May 19, 2015.
