For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003.  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n2 & 3 Will. 4\nThe second session of the 10th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 6 December 1831 until 16 August 1832.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 2 & 3 Gul. 4, 2 & 3 Wm. 4, 2 & 3 W. 4, 2 Will. 4, 2 Gul. 4, 2 Wm. 4 or 2 W. 4.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and Fifty-ninth Years of the Reign of His Majesty King George the Third, for establishing Fever Hospitals and for preventing contagious Diseases in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  as provides for the applotting and levying of Presentments off the Baronies.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  and to substitute other Provisions in lieu thereof.|note4= }}\n|  for punishing Mutiny and Desertion, and for the better Payment of the Army and their Quarters.|note4= }}\n|  for the Regulation of His Majesty's Royal Marine Forces while on Shore.|note4= }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and Third Years of His late Majesty King George the Fourth, respecting the Estates thereby vested in the principal Officers of the Ordnance, and to facilitate the public Business in the Ordnance Department.}}\n|\n|  for the Prevention, as far as may be possible, of the Disease called the Cholera, or Spasmodic or Indian Cholera, in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for rendering the Payment of Creditors more equal and expeditious in Scotland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  by extending the Time within which pre-existing Societies must conform to the Provisions of that Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Uniformity of Process Act 1832|public|39|23-05-1832|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for Uniformity of Process in Personal Actions in His Majesty's Courts of Law at Westminster.|note4= }}\n-\n|\n|  }}\n|  under any Act of Parliament) the letting of the Poor Allotments in small Portions to industrious Cottagers.|note4= }}\n|  for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors in India.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Reform Act 1832or the Great Reform Actor the First Reform Act|public|45|07-06-1832|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Representation of the People in England and Wales.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for regulating the Offices of Clerks of the Signet and Privy Seal.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for paving and regulating the Regent's Park, and several Streets and Places in Westminster, to certain other Streets and Places in Westminster;
