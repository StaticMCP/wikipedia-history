She lives in Oakland, California. Within her podcast, \"We Want the Airwaves,\" Nia interviews queer and trans artists about their lives and about their work. The title of her podcast was inspired from a Ramones song and played as a demand for media access and an insistence on the right for marginalized people to take up space.\nEarly life\nKing graduated from Mills College in 2011. She is originally from Boston, Massachusetts.\nCareer\nKing has created various zines covering topics such as race, self-reflection, and sexuality.

Her second book, Queer and Trans Artists of Color, Volume 2 is a collection of interviews discussing race, sexuality, and systematic oppression.
