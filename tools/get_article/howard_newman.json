He received a BA from Miami University of Ohio, where he studied architecture, Cultural Anthropology, Sociology and Classical Literature. After graduating from Miami University, Newman and his wife Mary entered Peace Corps training in a Special Forces training camp in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, where the two learned fluent Spanish and Survival Training. In 1967, Newman was accepted to the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). In 1969 he received a BFA in Industrial Design and an MFA in Sculpture with a concentration in Silversmithing under the mentorship of master metalsmith John Prip.\nNewman was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to Italy in 1961; he and his wife Mary resided in Impruneta, south of Florence. There, Newman began making bronze sculptures.  In 1973 and 1974, Newman and his wife gave birth to their children, Joshua A.C. Newman and Rachel Newman-Greene.\nNewman and his wife returned to Italy for another year between 1985 and 1986 and lived in Pietrasanta, north of Pisa, where he worked in La Fonderia Mariani, creating a series of bronzes, including two now on the grounds of the Newport Art Museum.\nAs of 2016, Newman continues to work at his private studio located in Newport, Rhode Island.\nHoward's company maintains newmansltd.com, and its Youtube channel.\nRestoration\nCurrently, Newman and his staff restore a wide range of art objects made of mixed materials, including silver, gold, bronze, tin, iron and zinc. Newman spent a decade working on projects for the Preservation Society of Newport County. He exhibited some of those restorations at the Century Association in New York City in the year 2000. Newmans’ company is responsible for the restoration of Brown University's John Hay Library collection of marble busts.\nRestoration of \"The Trinity\"\nIn 2008, Newman and his company undertook the restoration of The Trinity Crucifix, the centerpiece of The Church of St. Gregory the Great on the campus of Portsmouth Abbey. The Trinity was crafted by American sculptor Richard Lippold in the 1960s, consisting of a 22,000-foot web of gold-plated brass wire. The wires radiate from the hands of the cross above the head, suspending the crucifix ten feet above the altar. The artisans from Newmans Ltd. carefully untangled the deteriorating wire, and restrung the five miles of wire into the original configuration, along with the restored crucifix.\nThe restoration project received a 2009 Rhody Award for Historic Preservation by the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission and 2009 Honor Award for Historic Preservation from the American Institute of Architects of Rhode Island.\nInventions\nIn 2011, in partnership with Len Katzman, Howard Newman started Sigma Surfacing LLC, an intellectual properties venture. He presently holds several patents pending.\nFine art\nFile:Howard Newman sculpture torso 3 dancer front.jpg|Torso #3 (Dancer), two views: Bronze with black patina and highlighted edges, height: 11\", 1982\nFile:Howard Newman Sculpture Duet.jpg|The Violinist and Drummer Girl: Bronze with black patina and highlighted edges, 21\" and 24\", 1981\nFile:Howard Newman sculpture avant garde.jpg|Avant Garde: Bronze with dark patina and acrylic washes, height: 14\", 1986\nFile:Howard Newman mother and child -1 watercolor and ink on paper.jpg|Mother and Child #1: Watercolor and ink on paper, 11\" x 14\", 2000–01\nFile:Howard newman mother and child -5 watercolor and ink on paper.jpg|Mother and Child #5: Watercolor and ink on paper, 11\" x 14\"\nFile:Howard Newman Poet -1 Watercolor and ink on paper 1998.jpg|Poet #1: Watercolor and ink on paper, 11\" x 14\", 1998\nFile:Howard Newman Machine Head higher resolution.tif|Machine Head: Mixed media on masonite, 36\" x 42\"\nFile:Howard Newman Farsight Watercolor charcol and graphite 1990.jpg|Farsight: Watercolor, charcoal and graphite, 11\" x 14\", 1990\nFile:Howard Newman Constellation Acrylic on paper and Masonite 2002.jpg|Constellation: Acrylic on paper and Masonite, 14\" x 17\", 2002\nFile:Howard Newman Eye to Eye Acrylic on paper and Masonite 2002.jpg|Eye To Eye: Acrylic on paper and Masonite, 14\" x 17\", 2002\nFile:Howard Newman Giulia II higher resolution.jpg|Giulia II: Bronze, length: 18\", 1988 (original maquette, length: 12\", 1977)\nFile:Howard Newman Torso 1 higher resolution.jpg|Torso #1: Bronze on bronze base with black granite base, 62\", 1986, Newport Art Museum, Rhode Island\nFile:Howard Newman Torsos 4 and 5 higher resolution.tif |Partners: Torsos #4 & #5, cast pewter on black granite base,12.5\" wide x 6\" deep x 12\" high, 2003\nFile:Howard Newman Winter larger resolution.tif |Winter II: Bronze with dark patina and highlighted edges, height: 23\", 1990\nRestorations\nFile:Howard Newman Balinese Sword restoration.jpg|Balinese Sword, Ivory, brass, forged steel, semi-precious stones, wood.\nFile:Howard newman pistol restoration.jpg|English Flintlock pistol \"Spencer\" Steel, brass, and wood, The McBean Collection, Preservation Society of Newport County\nFile:Howard Newman Alexis Caswell restoration.jpg|Marble bust of Alexis Caswell, John Hay Library, Brown University\nFile:Howard Newman TOURO larger resolution.tif |Touro Synagogue, Newport, Rhode Island\nFile:Howard newman sheffield candelabra restoration.jpg|Candelabra, English, 19th century Silver, copper, steel and pitch\nFile:Howard Newman plated pewter restoration.jpg|Bellum by Emile Louis Picault (French 1833–1915) Cast pewter, patinated copper plate\nFile:Howard Newman decorative column restoration.jpg| Decorative Column from Pequot Library, Southport, Connecticut\nInventions\nHoward Newman ENVELOPE SYSTEM FOR EMERGENCY AND OTHER STRUCTURES invention.jpeg|Envelope System for Emergency and other Structures\nHoward Newman Full Scale Model Cedar Clapboards.tif|Envelope System for Emergency and other Structures; Clapboards\nHoward Newman Two-Slit folding endless chain mat.jpg|Interlocking Tile System; Folding Mat\nAwards\n* Fulbright Scholarship, 1961\n* Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship, 1978\n* American Academy of Arts and Letters Award, 1980\n* American Academy in Rome Rome Prize, 1980\n* AIA Connecticut Design Award Preservation Honor, 2013\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://ncarchitects.com/nca-pinboard/aia-ct-honors-church-of-st-gregory-the-great-with-a-2013-design-award/ ncarchitects.com]\n*[http://sigmasurfacing.com/projects/ sigmasurfacing.com]\n*[http://finemetalrestoration.com finemetalrestoration.com]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY6eojv2qus YouTube]"
