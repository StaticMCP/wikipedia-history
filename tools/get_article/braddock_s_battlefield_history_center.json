      "text": "# Braddock's Battlefield History Center\n\n'''Braddock's Battlefield History Center''' is a small American museum and visitors center that is located on the site of the Battle of the Monongahela of July 9, 1755.\nIt features a collection of art, documents, and artifacts about the Braddock Expedition and the French and Indian War as it unfolded at the Forks of the Ohio. Located  east of downtown Pittsburgh in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, it is housed in a renovated car dealership along with a small gymnastics company on a three-acre parcel on a hillside that overlooks the Monongahela River Valley and the historic Edgar Thomson Works of United States Steel.\nBackground\nThe museum was created by Robert T. Messner, a retired Pittsburgh lawyer and grandfather, with the support of local foundations, and it opened to the public on August 18, 2012.\nIn December 2018, Messner donated the History Center to Fort Ligonier, which has operated the Center since May 2019.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.braddocksbattlefield.com Braddock's Battlefield History Center website]"
