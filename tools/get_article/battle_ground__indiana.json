With their community of Prophetstown as his objective, General Harrison marched from Vincennes, Indiana, at the head of a small army of about 1,000 men.\nGeneral Harrison met with representatives of the Prophet on November 6, 1811, when he arrived at Prophetstown. He presented demands in the name of his government. Harrison was to meet with the Prophet and his council the next day about the demands of the government. Harrison set up his encampment on a ridge about a mile northwest of Prophet's Town.\nFearing a surprise attack by the Prophet's forces, General Harrison placed his troops in battle formation, instructed his men to sleep fully clothed, and assigned a large detail of men for sentinel duty. On the morning of November 7, 1811, after 4:00, the camp was attacked by the Prophet.\nAfter a fierce battle, Harrison and his army defeated the Prophet's Indian confederation at the Battle of Tippecanoe. The defeat all but ended the Indian wars in the Midwest, especially as Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813.\nBattle Ground was incorporated in 1867 when it consolidated with the Town of Harrisonville. The governments of both towns decided to name the consolidation Battle Ground. The Town of Battle Ground was named for the Battle of Tippecanoe, and the Town of Harrisonville was named after Harrison, the commander of the American forces of the Battle of Tippecanoe.\nThe Tippecanoe Battlefield monument was erected in 1908 and dedicated to the men who served and were killed in the Battle of Tippecanoe. The battlefield has been designated a National Historic Landmark and includes a museum and recreation area.
