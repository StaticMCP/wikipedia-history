      "text": "# Wha'll be King but Charlie?\n\n\"'''Wha'll be King but Charlie?\" also known as The News from Moidart''', is a song about Bonnie Prince Charlie, sung to the tune of 'Tidy Woman', a traditional Irish jig the date of which is unclear but the tune was well known by 1745. The lyrics were written by Caroline Nairne (1766–1845). Because Nairne published anonymously, the authorship of this and her other poems and lyrics was once unclear, however, late in her life Nairne identified herself and modern scholars accept that these lyrics are hers. Carolina, Baroness Nairne was a Jacobite from a Jacobite family living at a time when the last remnants of political Jacobitism were fading as Scotland entered a period of Romantic nationalism and literary romanticism. Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed in the house where Caroline Nairne was born and reared when fleeing British capture after losing the Battle of Culloden.\n'''Wha'll be King but Charlie?' was popular from the late 18th into the 20th century. The tune was borrowed for use as an African-American spiritual, with an allusion in the hymn to \"King Jesus\" suggesting that the name of the tune was known to its adaptor.  In the 1840s bestseller Two Years Before the Mast'', Richard Henry Dana, describes a gathering of sailors with the French singing \"La Marseillaise\", the Germans singing \"O du lieber Augustin\", English sailors singing \"Rule, Britannia!\" and the Scots, \"Wha'll be King but Charlie?\".\nNotable usage of the song\nIn 1867 The San Jose Mercury campaigned for the election of Charles Maclay to the California State Senate with the song ''Wha'll be King but Charlie?\nThe song is one of the dance tunes played in the final scene of the 1921 film Sentimental Tommy as dancers fill the screen.\nIn his novel The starling: a Scotch story'', Norman McLeod tells of a boy who taught his pet starling to whistle the tune of \"Wha'll be King but Charlie?\".\nThe Corries, a late 20th century Scottish singing group, performed the song in concert and recorded it. as did the Scottish folk trio The McCalmans\nMeaning\n\"Wha'll\" is the Scots word for \"who'll\" (who will). The song references Bonnie Prince Charlie, the son of James Francis Edward Stuart and from 1766 a Stuart pretender to the crown of England, Scotland and Ireland.  Prince Charlie traveled to Scotland to lead the Jacobite rising of 1745, which would prove to be the last Jacobite military attempt to capture the throne. After losing the Battle of Culloden, Prince Charlie fled to the remote peninsula of Moidart, from which, with a handful of leading Jacobites, he fled to exile in France.\nLyrics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Scots (original)\n18th century\n!English (translation)\n21st century\n|-\n|\n:The news frae Moidart cam' yestreen\n:Will soon gar mony ferlie;\n:For ships o' war hae just come in,\n:And landit Royal Charlie?\nChorus\n:''Come thro' the heather, around him gather,\n:Ye're a' the welcomer early;\n:Around him cling wi' a' your kin;\n:For wha'll be king but Charlie?\n:Come thro' the heather, around him gather,\n:Come Ronald, come Donald, come a' thegither,\n:And crown your rightfu' lawfu' king!\n:For wha'll be king but Charlie?''\n:The Hieland clans, wi sword in hand,\n:Frae John o' Groats' to Airlie,\n:Hae to a man declared to stand\n:Or fa' wi' Royal Charlie.\nChorus\n:The Lowlands a', baith great an' sma,\n:Wi' mony a lord and laird, hae\n:Declar'd for Scotia's king an' law,\n:An' speir ye wha but Charlie.\nChorus\n:There's ne'er a lass in a' the lan',\n:But vows baith late an' early,\n:She'll ne'er to man gie heart nor han'\n:Wha wadna fecht for Charlie.\nChorus\n:Then here's a health to Charlie's cause,\n:And be't complete an' early;\n:His very name our heart's blood warms;\n:To arms for Royal Charlie!\n:Come thro' the heather, around him gather,\n:Ye're a' the welcomer early;\n:Around him cling wi' a' your kin;\n:For wha'll be king but Charlie?\n:Come thro' the heather, around him gather,\n:Come Ronald, come Donald, come a' thegither,\n:And crown your richtfu' lawfu' king!\n:For wha'll be king but Charlie?\n|\n:The news from Moidart came last night\n:Will soon bring much surprise}}\n:For ships of war have just come in,\n:And landed Royal Charlie?\nChorus\n:Come through the heather, around him gather,\n:''You're all the welcomer early;\n:Around him cling, with all your kin;\n:For who'll be King but Charlie?\n:Come through the heather, around him gather,\n:Come Ronald, come Donald, come all together,\n:And crown your rightful, lawful king!\n:For who'll be King but Charlie?''\n:The Highland clans, with sword in hand,\n:From John o' Groats to Airlie,\n:Have to a man declared to stand\n:Or fall with Royal Charlie.\nChorus\n:The Lowlands all, both great and small,\n:With many a lord and landowner, have\n:Declared for Scotia's king and law,\n:and you ask, \"Who but Charlie?\"\nChorus\n:There's never a lass in all the land,\n:But those who'll always vow,\n:She'll never give heart or hand to a man\n:Who wouldn't fight for Charlie.\nChorus\n:So here's a toast to Charlie's cause,\n:And be it complete and early;\n:His very name warms our heart's blood;\n:To arms for Royal Charlie!\n:Come through the heather, around him gather,\n:You're all the welcomer early;\n:Around him cling, with all your kin;\n:For who'll be King but Charlie?\n:Come through the heather, around him gather,\n:Come Ronald, come Donald, come all together,\n:And crown your rightful, lawful king!\n:For who'll be King but Charlie?\n|}\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPU2rOPoU7s Video of the Corries singing \"The News From Moidart\"]\nReferences"
