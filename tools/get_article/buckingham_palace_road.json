It is dominated by Victoria Station.\nHistory\nIn the 18th century, the road was known as Chelsea Road and was often frequented by highwaymen. A reward of £10 was offered in 1752 for the capture of one of the worst offenders. Towards the southern end, Victoria Station was opened in 1866 and the adjacent Victoria Coach Station was built in 1932 in the Art Deco style. From 1890 to 1956 the street had a parish church in the form of St Philip's Church, Buckingham Palace Road.\nIn 1938, the Empire Terminal of Imperial Airways opened opposite the coach station, designed by Albert Lakeman, also in the Art Deco style. It allowed passengers to check-in before boarding special trains from Victoria Station to Croydon Airport or Southampton Docks for the flying boat service. The terminal continued in service until the end of the 1970s, by which time there were dedicated rail or bus connections to Gatwick and Heathrow Airports. It is now the headquarters of the National Audit Office.\nLandmarks\nRoyal Mews, King's Gallery\n]]\nThe entrances to the Royal Mews and King's Gallery are in Buckingham Palace Road.\nScouts and Girl Guides\n, 17–19 Buckingham Palace Road]]\nIn June 1917, the Imperial Headquarters of the Boy Scouts' Association (since 1967, The Scout Association) moved to 25 Buckingham Palace Road from its previous office at 116 Victoria Street. It was in that building that the Boy Scouts' International Bureau (now the World Scout Bureau) was inaugurated in 1920. The UK Scout Headquarters remained at that address until December 1974, when it moved to Baden-Powell House.\nThe Girl Guides Association (now Girlguiding) rented offices within Scout Headquarters until 1929, when there was no longer storage space for the Association's records. Following a national fundraising campaign called \"Save Our Stuff\", the Guides were able to move into their own purpose-built headquarters at 17–19 Buckingham Palace Road, which they still occupy today.\nGallery\nA3214 Buckingham Palace Road - geograph.org.uk - 999285.jpg|50 Buckingham Palace Road on the left\n8-24 Buckingham Palace Road (geograph 4753177).jpg|8–24 Buckingham Palace Road\n20110530 London 3.JPG|Victoria Station\nFile:157-167 Buckingham Palace Road (geograph 4753186).jpg|157-167 Buckingham Palace Road, originally the Imperial Airways Empire Terminal\nFile:Victoria Coach Station (London, UK).jpg|Victoria Coach Station\nFile:Victoria Library (5081895158).jpg|The Victoria Public Library, opened in 1894\nReferences"
