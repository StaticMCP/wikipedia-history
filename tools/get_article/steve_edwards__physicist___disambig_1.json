In 1960, he completed his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University with the thesis \"EXCHANGE EFFECTS IN DIRECT REACTIONS\".\nCareer\nEdwards returned to FSU in 1960 as an assistant professor of physics, rising to professor in 1969.  He remained part of the faculty in the department of physics for more than 40 years.  His research focused on theoretical nuclear physics and he helped establish the newly formed FSU nuclear physics group as one of the top programs in the nation.  He wrote the physics textbook \"Physics: A Discovery Approach.\" He served as department chair from 1973 to 1979.\nEdwards served as faculty senate president from 1983-1985  until he was appointed dean of the faculties (1985) and added the title of deputy provost in 1986. He served in this position until his retirement in 2003.\nSteve Edwards was a colleague of Paul Dirac, a Nobel Prize-winning research professor from Florida State University.\nIn 2003, Edwards was awarded the James D. Westcott Distinguished Service Award by Florida State University.  He was the sixth person to receive this honor.\nPersonal life\nSteve Edwards was born June 16, 1930, and raised in Gadsden County, Florida.
