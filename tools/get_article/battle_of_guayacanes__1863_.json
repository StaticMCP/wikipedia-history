He would desert the royal army and join the independence ranks that same day. According to José de la Gándara, it was \"one of the most heated events of the war, perhaps the most distinguished battle and the least known of that campaign.”\nWarrant of  Manuel Buceta\n]]\nOn August 20, 1863, when the news of the separatist uprising and the persecution of the independentists to the Brigadier Manuel Buceta arrived in Santiago, a column composed of 3 companies of the Vitoria battalion with 280 infantry, 50 horses of African hunters and 2 mountain pieces under the command of Captain Florentino García came to his aid, but they had no sign of Brigadier Manuel Buceta (he was in the mountains where he continued to be pursued), the only thing they found was Captain Alverola along with 3 soldiers, they also had no knowledge of his whereabouts. On August 21, 1863, they found a wounded man on the road who turned out to be one of Brigadier Buceta's companions, whom they left behind because they had given him up for dead. He would report on the battle of Guayubín and that the towns on the border line were in the hands of the revolutionaries. He also said he did not know where Brigadier Buceta was and recommended returning to Santiago because the insurrection took an unexpected turn.\nThe Battle\nIn the morning of August 22, 1863, in the town of the Guayacanes, while the Spaniards were still looking for Brigadier Buceta, they encountered the troops of the Dominicans under Benito Monción and Pedro Antonio Pimentel. There, the insurgents began their first attack, using machetes, but the Spanish artillery forced them to back off and they suffered many casualties in the first two attempts made by the independentists. After two hours, the separatist attack returned for a third attempt, and as the early hours of the morning began, the fighting became more brutal. In that battle, Lieutenant Valentín Dañoveitia, despite having received a serious wound, continued the shrapnel fire until he fell dead with most of the gunners from the two pieces he commanded. He managed to contain the separatists and save the column with his self-denial and bravery. The gunners from the section he commanded perished, along with Dañoveitia himself. The Spaniards went into the woods where they continued to defend themselves from the attack and then entered the forest, continuing to repel the independence attacks until Captain José de los Ríos ordered the retreat at night. The Spanish defeat left the field strewn with dead on both sides and the Spaniards kept their 2 pieces of artillery.\nAftermath\nThe Spanish troops were able to leave thanks to a Dominican peasant only known by the name Matías, who offered to lead them through the bushes and onto a road that led to Santiago. The Spaniards spent the night in the woods, certain that they were not being sought, waiting for dawn to return to Santiago. On August 23, 1863, the bugle call was given, the trumpet called the column to form ranks to take the roll call and begin the march back. When they were about to leave, suddenly Brigadier Buceta emerged from the bush. He was tired, half-naked, emaciated, thirsty, hungry and almost fainted, as were the two soldiers who accompanied him. He was given water and a piece of bread. He did not speak much and was distressed by what had happened. Once he had recovered, he would mount a horse and take command of the column, returning to Santiago at noon.\nReferences"
