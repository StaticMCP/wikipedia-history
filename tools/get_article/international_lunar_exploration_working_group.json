ILEWG has co-organised and co-sponsored lunar sessions at EGU, COSPAR, EPSC.\nThe 8th gathering was held on July 23–27, 2006, in Beijing, China, and agreed on the new Lunar Beijing Declaration.\nMembers\nILEWG Executive Director:&nbsp; Prof. Bernard Foing (ILEWG Past-President, 1998 - 2000)\nILEWG Vice-presidents: Prof. Tai Sik Lee (2016 - current), Prof. Jacques Blamont (2010 - 2016), Dr. Simonetta di Pippo (2006 – 2008), Dr Robert Richards (2005 - 2007)\nILEWG Past-Presidents : Dr. Michael Wargo (2008 - 2010), Prof. Wu Ji (2006 - 2008), Prof. Narendra Bhandari (2004 - 2006), Prof Carle Pieters (2002 – 2004), Prof Mike Duke (2000-2002), Prof Bernard Foing (1998 – 2000), Acad. Erik Galimov (1996 – 1998), Dr Hitoshi Mizutani\nRoadmap\nThe roadmap or timeline envisaged includes a 15-year period of robotic operations before crewed missions. Robots would pilot in-situ resource utilisation and construct habitation for later crew.\nEuroMoonMars\nAs part of research efforts towards the colonization of Moon and eventually, the colonization of Mars, ILEWG founded the EuroMoonMars initiative, which comprises field campaigns in Moon-Mars analogue environments.\nThe EuroMoonMars field campaigns have been organised in specific locations of technical, scientific and exploration interest. The campaigns started with EuroGeoMars2009 (Utah MDRS, 24 Jan-1 Mar 2009) with ILEWG, ESA ESTEC, NASA Ames, VU Amsterdam and GWU.\nEMMIHS Campaigns\nCurrently, ILEWG is collaborating with the International Moonbase Alliance (IMA) and the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) on a series of EuroMoonMars, IMA and HI-SEAS (EMMIHS) campaigns, at the HI-SEAS analogue facilities in Hawaii.\nThe Hawaii - Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) habitat is located at 8,200’ (2,500 meters) in elevation and IMA's founder, Henk Rogers, is its owner. As of 2018, IMA, an organization dedicated to building sustainable settlements on the Moon, has been organising regular simulated missions to the Moon, Mars or other planetary bodies at HI-SEAS. Dr. Michaela Musilova is the Director of HI-SEAS and she also takes part in missions as a Crew Commander, Flights Director or CAPCOM.\nThe EuroMoonMars campaigns consist of research activities for data analysis, instruments tests and development, field tests in Moon-Mars analogues, pilot projects, training and hands-on workshops and outreach activities.\nEMM IgLuna 2019 Campaign\nIgLuna is the first ESA Lab inter-University demonstrator project, and is hosted by the Swiss Space Centre (SSC) with the vision to create an analogue habitat inside lunar ice caps. The campaigns were held from 17 to 30 June 2019 and involved 18 student teams from 9 countries across Europe. The students developed modular demonstrators and tested them during a field test conducted inside the moon-like extreme environment of the Glacier Palace inside the Matterhorn glacier.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+EuroMoonMars Field Campaigns\n|Year\n|Campaign\n|Notes\n|-\n|2009\n|EuroMoonMars-Eifel\n|Collaboration between ILEWG, ESA ESTEC, VU Amsterdam, Austrian Space Forum OEWF, GWU, Ecole de l’Air\n|-\n|2010\n|EuroMoonMars-DOMMEX\n|Collaboration between ILEWG, ESA ESTEC, NASA Ames, VU Amsterdam, GWU, Ecole de l’Air, FloridaTec, UCL Louvain\n|-\n|2010\n|EuroMoonMars SALM\n|La Réunion Island\n|-\n|2011\n|EuroMoonMars2011  (MDRS)\n|First EMM-MDRS mission\n|-\n|2012\n|EuroMoonMars2012  (MDRS)\n|Crew: Stoker, Battler, v’t Houd, Bruneau, Cross, Maivald, Svendsen, Oltheten, Nebergall, Orgel\nSupport: Foing, Ehrenfreund, Elsaesser, Rammos, Rodrigues, Direito, Roling\n|-\n|2017\n|LunAres (Poland)\n|Crew: PMAS SGAC\nSupport @ESTEC/Mission control: Foing, Lillo, Authier, Blanc et al.\n|-\n|2018\n|EMM-Iceland scouting campaign\n|Crew: Foing, Heemskerk, Sitnikova et al.\nSupport: 4th Planet Logistics\n|-\n|2018\n|EMMIHS-0 (scouting campaign)\n|Crew: Rogers H&A, Foing, Wilhite, Machida\nSupport: BluePlanet: Ponthieux, Cox et al.\n|-\n|2019\n|EMMIHS-I\n|Crew: Musilova, Sirikan, Mulder, Weert, Burstein, Pothier\nSupport: BluePlanet: Foing, Ponthieux, Cox, Rogers\n|-\n|2019\n|EMM-IgLuna campaign\n|IgLuna SSC support: Benavides, EuroMoonMars VUA/ILEWG\nCrew: de Winter, Heemskerk, Albers, Clement, Bois, Daeter, Vaessen, Glukhova, Sitnikova, Dimova, Wanske, van der Sanden, Foing\nSupport: Kruijver, Dingemans, Beentjes, Korthouwer, Moritz, Grosjean et al.\n|-\n|2019\n|EMMIHS-II\n|Crew: Musilova, Kerber, Castro, Wanske, Pouwels, d’Angelo\nSupport: BluePlanet: Cox et al., support@ESTEC/VUA: Ageli, Foing, Heemskerk, Beniest, Sitnikova, Preusterink\n|-\n|2020\n|EMMIHS-III\n|Crew: Musilova M., Brasileiro L., Edison K., Heemskerk M&R, Rajkakati P.\nSupport: BluePlanet & ESTEC/VUA\n|-\n|2020\n|EMMIHS-IV\n|Crew: to be confirmed\nSupport: BluePlanet & ESTEC/VUA\n|-\n|2021\n|CHILL-ICE\n|Crew I: Kerber, Elwertowska, Poli\nCrew II: Cardinaux, Smith, Christianen\nMission Control:  Pouwels, Heemskerk, Kerber, Weert, Downes\n|}\nSee also\n*Exploration of the Moon\n*International Mars Exploration Working Group\nReferences"
