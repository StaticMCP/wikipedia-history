Edwards Run WMA is owned by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources.\nEdwards Run WMA primarily consists of low hills with steep slopes covered in forests of various species of oaks and hickories plus approximately  of scattered clearings and brushy areas. White-tailed deer, turkey, quail, squirrel, rabbit, and grouse hunting opportunities are available in the wildlife management area. A section of Edwards Run and a  lake, Edwards Pond, provide fishing for smallmouth and largemouth bass, sunfish, bluegill, and channel catfish. Edwards Run and Pond are also stocked with trout February through March and in October. The stream on the WMA is a designated catch and release trout stream. A primitive camping area is in proximity to Edwards Pond and pit toilets and trash receptacles are provided. A nominal camping fee is charged by the WVDNR.\nSee also\n*Edwards Run\n*Animal conservation\n*Fishing\n*Hunting\n*List of West Virginia wildlife management areas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160709192920/http://www.wvdnr.gov/Hunting/D2WMAareas.shtm West Virginia DNR District 2 Wildlife Management Areas]"
