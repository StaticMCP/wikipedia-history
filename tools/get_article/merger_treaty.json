The treaty was signed in Brussels on 8 April 1965 and came into force on 1 July 1967. It set out that the Commission of the European Communities should replace the High Authority of the ECSC, the Commission of the EEC and the Commission of Euratom, and that the Council of the European Communities should replace the Special Council of Ministers of the ECSC, the Council of the EEC and the Council of Euratom. Although each Community remained legally independent, they shared common institutions (prior to this treaty, they already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Court of Justice) and were together known as the European Communities. This treaty is regarded by some as the real beginning of the modern European Union.\nThis treaty was abrogated by the Amsterdam Treaty signed in 1997:\nStructural evolution of the European Commission\nEU evolution timeline\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/treaty_establishing_a_single_council_and_a_single_commission_of_the_european_communities_8_april_1965-en-be427f35-bec6-4872-9afa-e9602d628aea.html Merger Treaty] European NAvigator"
