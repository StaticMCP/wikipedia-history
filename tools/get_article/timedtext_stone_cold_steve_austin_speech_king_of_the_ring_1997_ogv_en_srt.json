Don't just get him out of the ring, get him out of the WWF! Because I've proved, son, without a shadow of a doubt, you ain't got what it takes anymore.\n3\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000\nYou sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn’t get you anywhere. Talk about your psalms, talk about John 3:16...\n4\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000\nAustin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!\n5\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nAll he's gotta do is buy him a cheap bottle of Thunderbird, and try to dig back some of that courage he had in his prime.\n6\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nAs the King of the Ring, I'm serving notice to every one of the WWF Superstars. I don't give a damn what they are; they're all on the list, and that's Stone Cold's list, and I'm fixing to start running through all of them.\n7\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nAustin pauses, looking around at the crowd, who are now fully on his side.\n8\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nAnd as far as this championship match is considered, son, I don't give a damn if it's Davey Boy Smith or Shawn Michaels; Steve Austin's time has come, and when I get the shots, you're looking at the next WWF Champion.\n9\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nAnd that's the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so!\n10\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000"
