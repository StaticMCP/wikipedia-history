The ceremony is usually held early next year.\nIn spite of receiving a lot of criticism, this is still the most popular film and television awards in Vietnam.\nHistory\nIn essence, Vietnam Cinema Association Awards is an internal awards in the award system of Literary Arts Association, which includes 7 associations: photography, architecture, cinema, music, theatre, literature, and art. In order to encourage the artists' works, every year, the government provides the funds to the associations to award them.\nThe Vietnam Film Association Awards was originally presented by the Association as an award within the framework of the Vietnam Film Festival. Since 1993, VCA officially separated from the Film Festival and organizes its own awards annually. The first awards ceremony was to consider awards for films released in the period 1991-1993.\nIn March 2003 on the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam Revolutionary Cinema (1953), VCA initiated the Golden Kite Prize, and combined with Vietnam Television station, broadcast the ceremony live with the support of the business through advertising. Since then, the Awards is held independently and usually called as Golden Kite Awards or Kite Awards. Along with Golden Kite, Silver Kite and Bronze Kite are also given, though some years they are removed.\nCategories\nThroughout the history of the awards, many categories have been changed.
