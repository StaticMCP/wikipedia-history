It was erected in 1903. Its sculpture was designed by Pompeo Coppini, and its base was designed by Frank Teich.  The sculpture was cast by Roman Bronze Works (New York City).\nThe monument consists of five bronze figures on the base that represent the Confederate Military: Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery and Navy. At the top of the monument standing far above the other figures is Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States.\nAlongside 11 other Confederate monuments at the capitol, it was largely funded by United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group of women descended from Confederate soldiers.\nHistorical inaccuracies\nThe listed sizes of the Confederate (600,000) and Union (2,859,132) forces are incorrect, greatly exaggerating the advantage held by the Union. While the inscription dedicates the statue to Confederate soldiers who \"died for states rights guaranteed under the Constitution\", the Texas Declaration Of Causes (1861) does not use the phrase “states rights”, and repeatedly cites opposition to the abolition of the slavery and granting black Americans legal rights.\nInscription\nSee also\n* Lost Cause of the Confederacy\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
