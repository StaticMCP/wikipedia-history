Each club played a differing number of fixtures, depending upon the closeness of neighbours, ease of travel etc., with Rochdale Hornets playing (and losing) only 7 games and St. Helens 18 while Wigan played 35 and several other clubs 31.\nSeason summary\nThe war was starting its fourth year and the Rugby League again continued with the Wartime Emergency League set up. This arrangement, as in other sports, meant that the sport could continue, which in turn would boost the public’s moral. The fixtures were usually quite local, thus cutting down on travelling time and costs, whilst not wasting precious war resources.\nDue to the increasing difficulty of raising a full team of 13 players, the Northern Union gave approval for clubs to field 11 or 12 players in their fixtures, on the condition that both clubs agreed to it.\nSeveral clubs did not participate during this season :-\n:Huddersfield\n:Oldham\n:Wakefield Trinity withdrew again\n:York withdrew\n:Keighley again did not take part and in fact did not re-enter the league until the first peacetime League in 1919-20.\nNo clubs  re-joined the League and no new clubs joined the league for this season.\nBarrow (90.91%) finished the regular season top of the league (40 points) although only playing 22 games, with Dewsbury (87.10%) this time in second place (with 54 points from 31 games)..\nBarrow took the title for the first time in their history.\nThere were no other trophies to play for during this season.\nChampionship\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=20 abbr=\"Position\" |\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=25 abbr=\"Played\" |P\n!width=25 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=25 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=25 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=25 abbr=\"Points for\" |PF\n!width=25 abbr=\"Points against\" |PA\n!width=30 abbr=\"Points difference\" |diff\n!width=25 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n!width=30 abbr=”Win Percentage” |%\n!width=40 abbr=\"comments” |Note\n!width=20 abbr=”Reference” |ref\n|-\n|- align=center style=\"background:#FFD700;\"\n|1||Barrow||22||20||0||2||425||59||366||40||90.91||||\n|- align=center style=\"background:\"\n|2||Dewsbury||31||27||0||4||480||149||331||54||87.10||||\n|-\n|3||Leeds||31||21||3||7||479||214||265||45||72.58||||\n|-\n|4||Hull||24||17||0||7||318||261||57||34||70.83||||\n|-\n|5||Broughton Rangers||29||19||3||7||345||130||215||41||70.69||||\n|-\n|6||Leigh||31||19||2||10||343||106||237||40||64.52||||\n|-\n|7||Halifax||26||16||0||10||233||181||52||32||61.54||||\n|-\n|8||St Helens Recs||29||16||3||10||270||132||138||35||60.34||||\n|-\n|9||Wigan||35||21||0||14||331||210||121||42||60.00||||\n|-\n|10||Warrington||31||16||4||11||236||210||26||36||58.06||||\n|-\n|11||Widnes|||20||9||4||7||189||146||43||22||55.00||||\n|-\n|12||Swinton||22||11||1||10||156||208||-52||23||52.27||||\n|-\n|13||Batley||23||10||1||12||165||191||-26||21||45.65||||\n|-\n|14||Bradford Northern||26||10||2||14||156||260||-104||22||42.31||||\n|-\n|15||Hunslet||30||11||1||18||311||314||-3||23||38.33||||\n|-\n|16||Bramley||25||6||2||17||186||262||-76||14||28.00||||\n|-\n|17||St. Helens||18||4||2||12||94||261||-167||10||27.78||||\n|-\n|18||Brighouse Rangers ||20||4||2||14||75||302||-227||10||25.00||||\n|-\n|19||Hull Kingston Rovers||25||1||1||23||125||501||-376||3||6.00||||\n|-\n|20||Salford||28||1||1||26||54||499||-445||3||5.36||||\n|-\n|21||Runcorn||19||1||0||18||51||277||-226||2||5.26||||\n|-\n|22||Rochdale Hornets||7||0||0||7||7||156||-149||0||0||||\n|}\nChallenge Cup\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was suspended for the duration of the war.\nThe majority of the trophies, such as the County Leagues and County Cups were also suspended for the duration of the First World War.\nSee also\nBritish rugby league system\n1915–16 Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1916–17 Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1918–1919 (January) Northern Rugby Football Union Wartime Emergency League season\n1919 (Feb-May) Northern Rugby Football Union Victory season\nThe Great Schism – Rugby League View\nThe Great Schism – Rugby Union View\nList of defunct rugby league clubs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=319 1896–97 Northern Rugby Football Union season at wigan.rlfans.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302024838/http://www.hullfc.com/FixturesAndResults.aspx?sg=12&gi=3 Hull&Proud Fixtures & Results 1896/1897]\n*[http://www.rugby.widnes.tv/seasonreview.php?mid=1896&smid=1896-97&mids=1896  Widnes Vikings - One team, one passion Season In Review - 1896-97]\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=9 Saints Heritage Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100706041344/http://www.warringtonwolves.org/results-archive?y=1900 Warrington History]\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/news.php Wigan Archives - Cherry and white]"
