The Nebraska primary was a semi-closed primary and awarded 32 delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention, of which 26 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary, and was one of two contests on that date.\nVice president Al Gore as the presumptive Democratic nominee won nearly 70% of the vote and 21 delegates, with senator Bill Bradley getting an overall statewide result of around 26% and won 5 delegates, although he had withdrawn 2 months prior. Lyndon LaRouche Jr. won just 3% of the vote but remained in the race.\nProcedure\nNebraska's Democratic primary took place on May 9, 2000, the same date as the West Virginia primary.\nVoting started and ended simultaneously throughout the state, with polling places in the Central Time Zone open from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and those in the Mountain Time Zone open between 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. In the semi-closed primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15 percent at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 26 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of these, between 5 and 6 were allocated to each of the state's 3 congressional districts and another 3 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 6 at-large delegates.\nThe 6 National Convention delegates consist of 5 Unpledged PLEOs and 1 Unpledged \"add-on\"s; these 6 delegates will go to the Democratic National Convention officially \"Unpledged.\" The breakdown of unpledged delegates is 4 Democratic National Committee members, 1 Member of Congress (Senator Ben Nelson), and 1 add-on.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Lyndon LaRouche Jr.\nWithdrawn\n*Bill Bradley\nThere was also an Uncommitted option.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Nebraska Democratic presidential primary\n!
