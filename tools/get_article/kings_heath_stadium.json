The first race meeting was on 21 May 1927, beating rival track Hall Green Stadium in the race to open by two months. The BGSC company also owned four other tracks in 1927, Darnall Stadium in Sheffield, Knowle Stadium in Bristol, Boulevard Stadium in Hull and St Annes in Blackpool. The new facilities included a main grandstand with a capacity of 3,000 and a concrete slope in front of the grandstand that could accommodate a further 2,000 people. The stadium capacity was estimated to be around 20,000 and the new build was overseen by Mr J. P. Hughes of the BGSC.\nA nearby football ground used by Birmingham Corporation Tramways F.C. was also called King's Heath Stadium at the time.\nPre-war\nTowards the end of 1927 greyhound racing had proven successful and a new company called the Associated Greyhound Racecourses Limited was formed and they purchased eight tracks including the five BGSC tracks.\nOn 7 October 1935, an 18 year lease was acquired by Herbert Leo Craven (the Managing Director of the Long Eaton and Perry Barr stadiums at the time) and he introduced a major new event called the Lincoln. The first running of the Lincoln was in 1936 and was won by Slightly Polly trained by Arthur Doc Callanan.\nOn 27 May 1939 a serious fire destroyed the on-site kennels killing 17 greyhounds and the actions of a local resident Fred Shaw and four others stopped further tragedy by rescuing the remaining number that were kennelled (around 100 were in the kennels at the time).\nPost-war\nIn 1949 the freehold was finally bought outright by the Kings Heath Racecourse Ltd. The track was described as a fair sized course with fairly easy turns and a good length run in despite the circuit having a small 390 yard circumference. The main distances were 480 and 675 yards and greyhounds chased an ‘Outside Sumner’ hare. On the Alcester Road South entrance there was the main stand featuring the Silver Club and Best Ring Club with matching betting rings. On the opposite side of the course were two covered stands, to the west was the popular betting ring and to the east were the racing kennels, isolation kennels and home kennels that included a rest room and surgery. Rest kennels were located at Cookhill in Worcestershire. Perspective owners had to pay kennel charges of one guinea per week and the greyhound would be accepted into the track kennels on the understanding that all greyhounds were subject to veterinary examination, National Greyhound Racing Club rules and company conditions.\nThe first track trained success came in 1948 when King Hero trained by P.E Frost won the Cambridgeshire at West Ham Stadium. Another race called the Midland Oaks was introduced and trainers included Jim Todd, Bill Bryant, Alf Gibbins, Len Bane and Mr Allen.\nFollowing the 1964 closure of the Lythalls Lane Stadium in Coventry, a major race the prestigious Eclipse Stakes was transferred to the track. Following the formation of the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) in 1967 the track was chosen as one of the first four tracks to host live betting shop race meetings along with Oxford, Park Royal and Stamford Bridge.\nClosure\nThe Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) purchased the stadium in 1970, which spelled the demise of the stadium. Under the GRA's Property Trust policy at the time, Kings Heath was one of many tracks that was to be sold for re-development.\nThe final race meeting was held on 31 March 1971 and the last race was won by Zansy Token before the developers demolished the stadium.\nThe north part of the stadium is now Wynfield and Leander Gardens and the south part is where the Cocks Moors Woods golf course stands.\nCompetitions\nThe Lincoln\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=50|Year\n!width=180|Winner\n!width=300|Breeding\n!width=250|Trainer\n!width=80|Time (sec)\n!width=50|SP\n!width=150|Notes/Ref\n|-\n!1936\n| Slightly Potty\t||Bright Brindle – Burnbrite\t||Arthur Doc Callanan (Wembley) ||36.70\t||7/4f||\n|-\n!1937\n|Hexham Bridge\t ||Rally Round – Dainty Duchess\t||Bill Cowell (Southend)\t||28.64\t||3/1||\n|-\n!1938\n| Demotic Mack\t||Beef Cutlet – Kaiti Hill\t||Charles Cross (Clapton)\t||28.72\t||7/4f||\n|-\n!1939\n| Loyal Judy\t||Erins Best – Disputed Biddy\t||Bill Cowell (Wembley)  \t||28.20||\t7/2||\n|-\n!1952\n| Sound Sprig\t||Astras Son – Nancys Sprig\t||Tom Perry (Private) ||27.10\t||6/4f||\n|-\n!1953\n| Kettle Drum\t||Smoky Cutlet – La Saqlle Street||Dal Hawkesley (West Ham) \t||26.86\t||5/1||\n|-\n!1954\n| Manganstown Major||Sandown Champion – Good Night Kentucky||Ron Chamberlain (Private)\t||26.77\t||4/5f||\n|-\n!1955\n| Manganstown Major||Sandown Champion – Good Night Kentucky||Ron Chamberlain (Private)\t||26.60\t||7/2||\n|-\n!1956\n| Suir Villa Champion||Fedamore Victory – Slaney Rut||Ron Chamberlain (Private)\t||27.18||\t6/4f||\n|-\n!1957\n| Wish Me Luck\t||Marsh Harrier - Chaser\t||Ron Chamberlain (Private)\t||26.42||\t10/1||\n|-\n!1958\n| Five Up\t        ||Nine Up - Duplicate\t        ||Ron Chamberlain (Private)\t||26.60||\t5/4f||\n|-\n!1959\n| Wincot Clifford\t||Fly Prince - Whoosh ||Jack Toseland (Perry Barr)\t||26.65\t||8/11f||\n|-\n!1960\n| Welcome Home\t||Hi There - Ophelia ||Bill Gigg (Private) ||26.38\t||4/6f||\n|-\n!1961\n| Welcome Home\t||Hi There - Ophelia ||Vivien Pateman (Private)\t||26.51||5/4f ||\n|-\n!1962\n| Poetic Licence||Knockrour Again – Tanyard Tan\t||Joe Booth (Private) ||26.36|| 2/1||Track record\n|-\n!1963\n| Blackamoor||Graceful Man – Bright and Merry||Jimmy Jowett (Clapton)\t||27.21||8/1 ||\n|-\n!1964\n| Old Berry Silent||Silent Worship – Dromin Lass\t||Fred Berrow (Private) ||26.42\t||5/2||\n|-\n!1965\n| Red Captain\t||Uncommon Man – Gower Grand\t||Ron Chamberlain (Private)\t||26.81\t||6/1 ||\n|-\n!1966\n| Kiddie Kut\t||Hi There – Carols Pride\t||Tony Dennis (Private)\t||27.42||5/1 ||\n|-\n!1967\n| Stately Boy\t||Knockrour Again – Little Margo||George Gooch (Preston)\t||27.26\t|| 9/2||\n|-\n!1968\n| Nancy's Flash\t||Prairie Flash – Biddy Mulligan||Paddy McEvoy (Wimbledon)\t||26.46\t||4/9f ||\n|-\n!1969\n| Lisamote Precept||Hi Spark – Lisamote Queen\t||Joe Kelly (Leeds)\t        ||26.73\t||4/7f||\n|-\n!1970\n| Shady Shuffle\t||Lucky Hi There – Patrician Lady||Norman Oliver Brough Park||27.07||7/2||\n|}\n1936-1970 (480 yards), 1940-1951 (not held)\nTrack records\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n|-\n!width=100| Yards\n!width=200| Greyhound\n!width=50| Time\n!width=200| Date\n!width=300| Notes\n|-align=center\n|480 ||\tDemotic Mack || 28.37 || 25 March 1938||\n|-align=center\n|480 ||\tHexham Bridge || 28.22 ||2 April 1938 ||\n|-align=center\n|480 ||\tIlsley Darkie|| 27.70||12 October 1940||\n|-align=center\n|480 ||\tSpecial Intention||27.12||September 1950||\n|-align=center\n|480 ||\tPoetic Licence||26.36||14 April 1962||Lincoln final\n|-align=center\n|480 ||\tNancy's Flash||26.24||7 September 1967||\n|-align=center\n| 495||\tPeace Sprite\t||27.08||11 July 1964||Midland Oaks final\n|-align=center\n| 660||\tKonig Seiger||37.08||17 July 1965||\n|-align=center\n| 700||\tInferior Cracker||39.94\t||25 May 1963||\n|-align=center\n| 880||\tJoystick\t||50.86||8 April 1964||TV Trophy heat\n|-align=center\n| 495 H||Happy Reveller||27.91||25 August 1965||Eclipse Hurdles semi final\n|-align=center\n| 495 H||Happy Reveller||27.79||28 August 1965||Eclipse Hurdles final\n|}\nReferences"
