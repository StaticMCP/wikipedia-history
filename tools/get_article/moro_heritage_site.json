A joint excavation was conducted by Meiji University and Musashino Museum in July of the same year. This was the second survey on the Paleolithic Age in Japan after a study of the Iwajuku archaeological site in Gunma Prefecture. It became clear that Paleolithic culture, which is older than that from the Jōmon period, had spread universally in Japan. In addition, the knife-shaped stoneware excavated in this survey had a very distinctive form and was named a .\nThe stoneware consists of burins, side-scrapers, flakes and backed points. The archaeological site was designated as a historic site of Tokyo in 1969, and as a historic site of Itabashi Ward in 1984. The 22 excavated stone tools were also designated as tangible cultural properties of Tokyo in 1999.\nLocation\nThe site is in Jōhoku-Chūō Park in Tokyo, but it is not accessible so as to protect the wooded area in the site. A stone column and information boards show the site’s location.\nReferences\n*[https://itabashi-kanko.jp/midokoro/historic/s-10.html Itabashi City Office’s webpage about the site]\nExternal links\n*[https://shakujii.jimdofree.com/%E6%9D%BF%E6%A9%8B%E5%8C%BA/%E8%8C%82%E5%91%82%E9%81%BA%E8%B7%A1/ Webpage about research near Shakujii River]\n*[https://bunkazai.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/jp/search_detail.html?page=1&id=547 Tokyo Metropolitan Government's webpage]"
