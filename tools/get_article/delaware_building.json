It is significant for being one of the few buildings to maintain its 1870s character, as an Italianate structure, in an area dominated by more modern structures.  The building is also notable for its early use of a precast concrete façade.  The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 23, 1983, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 18, 1974.\nAs built, the building had five floors with a basement.  The first two stories were primarily metal and glass to provide storefront windows for displays.  In 1889, two additional floors were added, and three bays were removed from the Randolph Avenue façade.\nReferences"
