These differed from the Republican or Democratic presidential primaries and caucuses in that they do not appoint delegates to represent a candidate at the party's convention to select the party's presidential nominee.\nThe party's nominee was subsequently chosen directly by registered delegates at the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, held through an online convention from May 22 to May 24. Jo Jorgensen was chosen as the party's presidential nominee, becoming the first woman to receive the Libertarian nomination, after four rounds of voting. Spike Cohen was nominated for vice president.\nBackground\nThe 2020 United States presidential election was the thirteenth contested presidential election in which the Libertarian Party participated. The 2016 election saw the highest vote total and percentage of votes for a Libertarian presidential ticket ever, with former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, receiving over four million votes and 3.3% of the total vote.\nCandidates\nMajor candidates have been invited to participate in at least two Libertarian Party-sponsored debates or have received substantial independent media coverage.\nNominee\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding:10px; width:120px; \" | Candidate\n!
