He sought the nomination of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) as its presidential candidate in 1995 but was eliminated in the early stages by the former President Julius Nyerere, who strongly believed that Lowassa was not then correct material for the Presidency. He retained his parliamentary seat and became a strong backbencher in Parliament until 1997 when he was appointed Minister for State in the Vice President's Office for Environment and Poverty.\nFollowing the 2000 general elections, he was appointed Minister of Water and Livestock Development and made his mark as a hardworking minister. In 2005 Lowassa chose not to seek the CCM presidential nomination but became a key campaigner for his long-time friend, Jakaya Kikwete, in his bid for the presidential seat.\nKikwete, running on a CCM ticket, won the elections by beating other contestants by a large margin. He received 82% of the votes. In return, President Kikwete nominated Lowassa as Prime Minister on 29 December 2005. Parliament overwhelmingly confirmed the nomination, with 312 votes in favour and two opposed, and Lowassa was sworn in on 30 December. Lowassa had an extensive background in both parliamentary and government affairs.\nRichmond corruption scandal\nOn 7 February 2008, Lowassa was forced to resign after being implicated in the Richmond Energy deal corruption scandal. This followed a parliamentary select committee report on an emergency power generation contract between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd (TANESCO), a public corporation, and a US company styled Richmond Development Company LLC of Houston, Texas. The five-member select committee, headed by Kyela MP, Dr. Harrison Mwakyembe, found the contract to have been fraudulently concluded, hence unconscionable. Richmond was contracted to provide 100 megawatts of electricity each day after a drought early in 2006 but the Richmond generators arrived late and did not work as expected. In spite of this, the government paid Richmond more than $100,000 a day. Lowassa's office then influenced the government's decision to extend Richmond's contract despite advice to the contrary from TANESCO. Two other cabinet ministers who had held the energy portfolio, Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha and Nazir Karamagi were forced to resign as well.\nLowassa however denied that his office was involved in improperly awarding a contract to US-based electricity company Richmond Development in 2006.\nPresidential aspirations\nIn 1995, Lowassa was among the more than 15 CCM aspirants for the presidency, but he was stopped in his tracks by retired president Julius Nyerere, who found him to have enriched himself too fast. Lowassa was eliminated by Nyerere's fiat and that contest within the party was eventually won by Benjamin Mkapa, who also won the election and became Tanzania's third president.\nIn 2005, Lowassa strongly backed his friend Jakaya Kikwete and the two were dubbed \"Boys Two Men\" because of their strong political union that eventually enabled Kikwete to defeat all his rivals within the ruling party.\nIn 2014, Lowassa faced a one-year ban from CCM after he was accused of starting his campaign for presidency ahead of the authorized time. The ban expired in February 2015, only to be extended by the CCM Central Committee on the grounds that their final report was still not ready.\nIn May 2015, Lowassa eventually launched his presidential campaign in Arusha. He stated that his top priorities would be overhauling the country's education sector, reducing poverty, boosting economic growth and fighting corruption.\nOn 11 July 2015, the CCM Central Committee eliminated Lowassa from its list of presidential aspirants. CCM shortlisted January Makamba, Bernard Membe, Asha-Rose Migiro, John Magufuli and Amina Salum Ali for the National Executive Committee (NEC) vote of 378 members. The elimination of Lowassa came as a shock to many who viewed him as an inevitable candidate.\nHaving failed to get the nomination, Lowassa denounced the CCM as \"infested with leaders who are dictators, undemocratic and surrounded with greedy power mongers.\" He left the party and instead joined Chadema, an opposition party. On 4 August 2015, he was designated as the presidential candidate of a coalition of four opposition parties, including Chadema. On 1 March 2019 Lowassa left Chadema and rejoined the CCM.\nPositions held\nLowassa held various positions in the government since the late 1980s:\n* Managing Director of the Arusha International Conference Centre, 1989–1990\n* Minister for State, Prime Minister's Office and First Vice President (Judiciary & Parliamentary Affairs), 1990–1993\n* Minister of Lands, Human Settlement Development,1993–1995\n* Minister for State — Environment & Poverty, Vice President's Office, 1997–2000\n* Minister of Water and Livestock Development, 2000–2005\n* Member of Parliament for Monduli Constituency, 1990–2015\n* Prime Minister, 2005–2008\nDeath\nEdward Lowassa died after a long illness at the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac lnstitute (JKCI) in Dar es Salaam, on 10 February 2024. He was 70. Vice president Philip Mpango announced Lowassa's death live on national television.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.friendsoflowassa.or.tz/biography]\n* [http://www.kikweteshein.com/kikwete/thumbnails.php?album=6 Edward Lowassa Photo Gallery]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180307005821/http://lowassa.org/ Lowassa Website]\n* [http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsummit/top/detail.asp?event_id=12930 Edward Lowassa Speech at FAO]\n* [https://www.un.org/socialsummit/speeches/276tan.htm Edward Lowassa Speech at the UN Social Summit in Geneva]"
