It was founded in 2023 by Leni Peterson, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Business School.\nMission\nCeIeste's mission is to solve the problem of water risk and water project management for corporations and other entities. It does this by providing an AI climate adaptation platform that streamlines water projects, including through supply chain analysis, risk quantification, data management, and multi-stakeholder collaboration.\nThe target user of the platform is corporate sustainability leads.\nUnderstanding the Need\nWhen communicating the need for a platform like Celeste, the company references increasing water risk due to climate change and other factors, as well as the CDP's assertion that companies that invest in preventative water management are taking advantage of a $436 billion opportunity; by contrast, there is a $392 billion risk for those that do not.\nRelated Projects\nCeleste's founder, Leni Peterson, has stated that she draws inspiration from existing and successful collaborative water stewardship efforts like the Charco Bendito Collaborative Watershed Project.\nReferences"
