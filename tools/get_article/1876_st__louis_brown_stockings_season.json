Although both St. Louis and Hartford finished the season 6 games behind the pennant-winning Chicago White Stockings, the Brown Stockings were officially the third place team as, in 1877, the standings were determined by number of wins, not games behind. As Hartford had 47 wins and St. Louis only had 45, Hartford finished in second and St. Louis finished in third.  Nonetheless, St. Louis had won its season series against Chicago 6 games to 4 – winning all of its season series against all National League opponents. Due to the politics between the teams at the time, an unofficial five-game post-season was created between those two teams to determine the \"Championship of the West.\"  St. Louis won the series 4 games to 1. According to Stathead, the 1876 Brown Stockings hold the lowest single-season team earned run average (ERA) in MLB history (1.22).\nRegular season\nSeason standings\nRecord vs. opponents\nRoster\n]]\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: C4C3D0; color: #964B00; text-align: center;\" | 1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #964B00; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | Pitchers\nCatchers\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Infielders\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Outfielders\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | Manager\n|-\n|}\nPlayer stats\nBatting\nStarters by position\nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pos\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg.\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI\n|- align=\"center\"\n| C ||  || 64 || 298 || 91 || .305 || 0 || 29\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1B ||  || 64 || 245 || 45 || .184 || 0 || 9\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2B ||  || 61 || 276 || 72 || .261 || 0 || 30\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3B ||  || 64 || 283 || 85 || .300 || 0 || 46\n|- align=\"center\"\n| SS ||  || 48 || 180 || 39 || .217 || 1 || 7\n|- align=\"center\"\n| OF ||  || 63 || 283 || 70 || .247 || 0 || 25\n|- align=\"center\"\n| OF ||  || 62 || 264 || 62 || .235 || 0 || 30\n|- align=\"center\"\n| OF ||  || 63 || 282 || 91 || .323 || 1 || 50\n|}\nOther batters\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg.\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI\n|- align=\"center\"\n|  || 25 || 102 || 21 || .206 || 0 || 10\n|}\nPitching\nStarting pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO\n|- align=\"center\"\n|  || 64 || 573.0 || 45 || 19 || 1.23 || 103\n|}\nRelief pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SV\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO\n|- align=\"center\"\n|  || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0.00 || 0\n|}\nReferences\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1876.shtml 1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings season at Baseball Reference]"
