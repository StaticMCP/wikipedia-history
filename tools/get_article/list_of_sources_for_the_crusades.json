These sources include chronicles, personal accounts, official documents and archaeological findings. As such, these lists provide the medieval historiography of the Crusades.\nA number of 17th through 19th century historians published numerous collections of original sources of the Crusades. These include Recueil des historiens des croisades (RHC), Monumenta Germaniae Historica (MGH), ''Revue de l'Orient Latin/Archives de l'Orient Latin (ROL/AOL) and the Rolls Series. Other collections are of interest to the Crusader period include Recueil des historiens des Gaules et de la France (RHF), Rerum Italicarum scriptores (RISc), Patrologia Latina (MPL), Patrologia Graeco-Latina (MPG), Patrologia Orientalis (PO), Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium'' (CSCO) and Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society (PPTS).\nModern reference material to these sources include Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Dictionary of National Biography, Neue Deutsche Biographie, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages, Catholic Encyclopedia, New Catholic Encyclopedia, Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle, Encyclopædia Iranica, Encyclopædia Islamica and Encyclopaedia of Islam. Contemporary histories include the three-volume A History of the Crusades (1951–1954) by Steven Runciman; the Wisconsin collaborative study A History of the Crusades (1969–1989) edited by Kenneth M. Setton, particularly the Select Bibliography by Hans E. Mayer; Fordham University's Internet Medieval Sourcebook; and The Crusades: An Encyclopedia, edited by Alan V. Murray.\nPrincipal Western sources for the history of the Crusades\nThe Western sources for the history of the Crusades begin with the original Latin chronicles. Later works on the First Crusade were mostly derived from these and are exemplified by William of Tyre's Historia and its continuations. The later Crusades produced a vast library of first-hand accounts, biographies and chronicles. Other sources include official documents and communications, personal letters and accounts, and topics such as archaeology and numismatics.\nOriginal Latin chronicles of the First Crusade\nThe major chronicles of the First Crusade by contemporaneous Western authors are listed below, referenced to RHC, Runciman and Murray.\n* Gesta Francorum. Gesta Francorum (Deeds of the Franks) is an anonymous chronicle that proved to be one of the most popular accounts of the First Crusade. The chronicle, also referred to as Anonymi Gesta Francorum, is reputed to be written by a follower of Bohemond of Taranto and covers the period from November 1095 until the battle of Ascalon in 1099. It was first published in late 1100 or early 1101. (Ges. D., RHC Oc., Volume 3.II, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;329–330, 344)\n* Peter Tudebode. Peter Tudebode was a Poitevin priest in the army of Raymond of Saint-Gilles.  His Historia de Hierosolymitano itinere, with Præfatio, was released shortly after the very similar Gesta Francorum, edited by French historian Jean Besly (1572–1644). Tudebode's version includes additional material, including the death of Crusader Rainald Porcet who died at the siege of Antioch in 1098. (RHC Oc., Volumes 3.I, 3.II, MPL 155, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;330, 346)\n* Historia belli sacri. Historia belli sacri (Tudebodus imitatus et continuatus) was a history written by an unknown monk at the Abbey of Monte Cassino around 1130. The Historia covers the First Crusade and the early days of the Principality of Antioch ending with the death of Bohemond II of Antioch in 1130. The Historia drew material from Gesta Francorum and Gesta Tancredi. (RHC Oc., Volume 3.III, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;330n, 345)\n* Raymond of Aguilers. Raymond of Aguilers (died after 1105) was a participant in the First Crusade and eventually became chaplain of Raymond of Saint-Gilles. His chronicle, Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem (History of the Franks who captured Jerusalem), known as Historia Francorum, concentrated on Raymond's exploits. The work covered the period from the journey to Constantinople in 1096 until the end of 1099, after the capture of Jerusalem. He may have had access to portions of Gesta Francorum but his work is regarded as independent. Pons of Balazun, a member of Raymond's army, is credited as a co-author of Historia Francorum.  (RHC Oc., Volume 3.IV, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;328–329, 346)\n* Fulcher of Chartres. Fulcher of Chartres (c. 1059 – after 1128) was a priest who participated in the First Crusade eventually joining Baldwin I of Jerusalem. His chronicle Gesta Francorum Iherusalem Perefrinantium (Historia Hierosolymitana) consists of three volumes. The first covers the period from the Council of Clermont in 1095 until the death of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1100. The second covers the reign of Baldwin I from 1100–1118, and the third the partial reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem from 1118–1127 when the narrative was interrupted by the plague in Jerusalem. Because Fulcher was with Baldwin I in Edessa from 1098, some material in his chronicle was derived from Gesta Francorum and Historia Francorum.  The three volumes were written from 1100–1106, 1109–1115 and 1118–1127, and compiled into a second edition by Fulcher before his death. (RHC Oc., Volume 3.V, VI, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;329, 345)\n* Albert of Aachen (Aix). Albert of Aachen (died after 1150) was a historian, presumably German, who wrote the fullest contemporaneous account of the First Crusade in his Historia Hierosolymitanae expeditionis (History of the Expedition to Jerusalem). His chronicle covers the period from the Council of Clermont until 1121. It was written between 1125 and 1150, and has long been regarded as the most authoritative source of the period, but immune from criticism. (RHC Oc., Volume 4.III, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;331, 344, Runc. Vol II, p.&nbsp;476)\n* Ekkehard of Aura. Ekkehard of Aura (died 1126) was a Bavarian abbot of Aura and participant in the Crusade of 1101. He wrote his Hierosolymita in five recensions from 1098-1125, covering first the period from 1057 through the First Crusade. The final recension is known as Chronicon universale (World Chronicle) and is an extension of the work of Frutolf of Michelsberg. The fourth recension of Hierosolymita makes use of Sigebert's Chronicon sive Chronographia providing a perspective on the Rhineland massacres of Jews in 1096. (RHC Oc., Volume 5.I, MGH Scriptores VI, MPL 156, Runc. Vol I, p.&nbsp;330)\n* Robert of Reims. Robert of Reims, abbot of Saint-Remi (1055–1122), wrote his Historia Hierosolymitana that covers his participation at the Council of Clermont until as late as 1120. His history was written between 1107–1120 and is regarded as source material for the work of Gilo of Toucy. (RHC Oc., Volume 3.IX, pp.&nbsp;717–882, MPL 155, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;330, 346)\n* Baldric of Dol.

Guibert of Nogent (1055–1124) was a Benedictine historian who wrote Dei gesta per Francos (Deeds of God through the Franks) based on Gesta Francorum and Gesta Tancredi.  The history was written in 1108 and reworked in 1121. Dei gesta includes an account of the Council of Clermont and an eyewitness account of the preachings of Peter the Hermit. (RHC Oc., Volume 4.II, Ges. D., MPL 156, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;108n, 113n, 124n, 330, 345)\nMost of the original sources were collected in Gesta Dei per Francos (Ges. D.), compiled by French historian Jacques Bongars (1554–1612). The Gesta also includes works by William of Tyre, Marino Sanudo and Pierre Dubois. (Runc.

The second covers 1051–1101, and the third covers up to 1129, with some material up to 1136 that may have been done by a collaborator. While the first two parts are a broader history of Byzantine and Caucusus affairs, the third part focuses exclusively on Edessa and its environs. Two parts of the Chronicle have received particular attention. The first is a letter from emperor John I Tzmiiskes to king Ashot III of Armenia in 975 and the second is a discourse from exiled king Gagik II of Armenia to Constantine X Doukas after 1045 on the divergence of the Greek and Armenian churches.

Augustine's De civitate Dei allowed for the possibility of God's war. (MPL 33, 51, 52, CSEL 25, 34, 40, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;40n, 84n, 344)\n* Early Eastern Bishops. Saint Gregory of Nyssa (died c. 395), bishop of Nyssa, wrote disapprovingly of pilgrimages in his Epistolae, as did John Chrysostom (died 407), archbishop of Constantinople, in his Opera Omnia. John later expressed regrets about pilgrimage in Homilies on Ephesians. (MPG 44-46, 47-64, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;40n, 347)\nSources on relics\nThe study of the relics of Christianity is closely tied to pilgrimages as well as to the Crusades where relics were obtained either from the Holy Land or by theft from Constantinople. By the 3rd century, pilgrimages to the Holy Land had begun and the search for relics started in the 4th century by Saint Helena. Additional information on the translation of relics of the saints can be found in Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina. Islam also recognizes relics dating from the time Abraham through that of Muhammad, known as the Sacred Trust, some of which are also relevant to Christianity.\n* True Cross. The True Cross is first mentioned in the pilgrimage of Saint Helena from 326-328, as described in Socrates Scholasticus' Historia Ecclesiastica, and later in Egeria's Itinerarium Egeriae.&nbsp; Held in Jerusalem, it was lost to the Sassanids in 614, and returned by Heraclius in 630. With the loss of Jerusalem to the Fatimids in 1109, the relic was hidden by local Christians.&nbsp; The Cross' recovery by the Crusaders in 1099 is described in the works of Raymond of Aguilers, Fulcher of Chartres and William of Tyre.&nbsp; It was again in 1187, this time to Saladin who also viewed it as important to Islam.&nbsp; In 1219, it was offered to the Knights Templar in exchange for the lifting of the siege of Damietta, but never delivered.&nbsp; Most relics known today came from Constantinople after 1204, including two large pieces purloined by Robert de Clari. (Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;294–295, Runc. Vol III, pp.&nbsp;53, 59, 68, 169–170)\n* Seamless Robe of Jesus. The seamless robe of Jesus was also alleged to have been claimed by Saint Helena. The biography of St. Agritius, bishop of Trier, written before 1072, describes the relic being sent by Helena to Trier.\n* Search for relics in the 4th Century. Authorities such as poet Prudentius (348 – after 405), author of Liber Peristephanon (Crowns of Martyrdom) and Carmina, and Magnus Felix Ennodius, bishop of Pavia (473/474 – 521) author of Libellum pro Synodo, taught that they Christian saints and martyrs could perform miracles and encouraged the search for holy relics. This view was continued by Saint Ambrose (c. 340 – 397), archbishop of Milan, whose Epistolae (Letter XXII) was an inspiration to acquire relics from the Holy Land; by Saint Basil (330–378) in a letter to Saint Ambrose; and by Victricius, bishop of Rouen (c. 330 – c. 407), in his Liber de Laude Sanctorum (On the Praise of the Saints). (MPL 16, 20, MPG 32, CSCO LXI, CSEL 6, 16, 56, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;40, 41n, 344-346)\n* Holy Lance. The Holy Lance is a legendary relic with competing claims of legitimacy.&nbsp; It was reported by Antoninus Martyr in his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 570, as well as other sources.&nbsp; Peter Bartholomew made claims to the discovery of the lance during the siege of Antioch in 1098, as reported in Gesta Francorum and by Raymond of Aguilers.&nbsp;Those claims were disputed by Adhemar of Le Puy.&nbsp;An account of the recovery of point of the Holy Lance by Byzantine emperor Heraclius is found in the Chronicon Paschale (7th century). (PPTS XI.1, Runc. Vol I, pp.&nbsp;241–243)\n* Holy Chalice. Relics associated with the Holy Chalice (Holy Grail) are first seen by Arculf in his Pilgrimage, mentioning a chalice used in the Last Supper in a chapel near Jerusalem. Two actual relics are known. Sacro Cationno is a hexagonal dish returned to Italy by Genoese Crusaders in 1101, as described by William of Tyre and in the 13th century work the Golden Legend. The Chalice of Valencia was first identified in 1134 and is of unknown origin, although a theory is that it accompanied Saint Peter in his journey to Rome. (Runc. Vol II, p.&nbsp;74n)\n* Documenta Lipsanographica.

The shroud is believed to be the facecloth from the tomb of Christ.&nbsp; The account claims the relic was linked to Adhemar of Le Puy, brought from Antioch by a priest of Périgord, but it is not documented at the abbey until 1215.&nbsp; (RHC Oc., Volume 5.VII.vii)\n* Tractatus Inventione Sanctorum Patriarcharum. The work Tractatus Inventione Sanctorum Patriarcharum Abraham, Ysaac et Jacob (Canonici Hebronensis), by an anonymous author was dictated by two monks of Hebron c. 1119.

Robert de Clari's La Conquête de Constantinople provides an account of the relics of Constantinople and the looting of those treasures.&nbsp; He was one of the last to see the Shroud of Turin prior to 1258 when Geoffroi de Charny and his wife reported ownership.&nbsp; Robert reportedly donated a Byzantine crystal cross reliquary to Corbie Abbey. The plunder of Nivelon of Chéris, bishop of Soissons, apparently included the heads of seven saints and the crown of St. Mark's head. Conrad of Krosigk also returned with many relics, as reported in the Deeds of the Bishops of Halberstadt.\n* Exuviae Sacrae Constantinoploitanae ( 1877–1888) is a collection of documents edited by Paul Riant relating to the status of relics at Constantinople before 1204 and their disposition after the Fourth Crusade. A further study La croix des premiers croisés; la sainte lance; la sainte couronne was published by Fernand de Mély in 1904. (Runc. Vol III, p.&nbsp;494)\n* Crown of Thorns.

His Karten und Pläne zur Palästinakunde aus dem 7 bis 16 Jahrhundert is a catalog of the eight known Crusader maps of Jerusalem.\nRelated disciplines and documents\nCrusader historians have made use of numerous religious, legal and personnel documents as well as scientific disciples such as archaeology in their attempt to accurately depict their chronicles. These include legal treatises of the Crusader States, Papal documents, and auxiliary sciences of history including genealogy, archaeological studies, numismatics and archeoseismology.\nOrganization and administration of the Kingdom\nThe organization and administration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem provides much information to the histories of the Crusades. In particular, the legal documents concerning the Crusades and later governing of the Kingdom of Jerusalem are of significance to the study of the Crusades and form the first series of the RHC, entitled Assises de Jérusalem ou Recueil des ouvrages de jurisprudence composés pendant le XIIIe siècle dans les royaumes de Jérusalem et de Chypre, edited by Auguste-Arthur, Count of Beugnot. Relevant texts are listed below.\nThe Assizes of Jerusalem are a set of six legal texts (see I-VI below) from the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus dating from the late 12th and early 13th centuries. According to legend, the court system was established by Godfrey of Bouillon in 1099, with the king serving as judge of the high court. The laws were lost when Jerusalem was taken in 1187, and were kept at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Known as Letres dou Sepulcre, Philip of Novara allegedly received the original laws from a jurist named Raoul of Saint Omer (died 1220). Regardless, the legend allowed the envisioning of a legal structure existing since the founding of the kingdom. (RHC Lois, Volumes 1, 2, MPL 155, Runc. Vol II, p.&nbsp;479, Runc. Vol III, p.&nbsp;484)\n* 'I. ''Livre de Jean d'Ibelin.' was written by jurist John of Ibelin (1215–1266), count of Jaffa and Ascalon. Ibelin wrote his lengthy legal work from 1264–1266.

Thiou of Morigny's Chronicon Mauriniacense includes the genealogy of the houses of Montlhéry and Le Puiset, families with strong ties to the Crusader armies and the kingdom.\nArchaeological studies\nArchaeological exploration has contributed to the understanding of the history of the Crusades by verifying or refuting accounts presented in original sources. Particular emphasis has been on Crusader castles, history of the art of the period, and document analysis techniques such as palaeography, diplomatics and epigraphy. Some of the more important researchers and the work are\n* Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey. Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey (1837–1913) was a French archaeologist, topographer and orientalist who wrote seminal works on the archaeology of the Holy Land including ''Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des croisés (1871), Étude historique et topographique de la tribu de Juda (1862) and Étude sur la topographie de la ville d'Acre au XIIIe siècle (1879).

He was the pioneer in the use of Arabic inscriptions in historical analysis.\n* Jean Mabillon. Jean Mabillon (1632–1707) was a Benedictine monk who wrote De re diplomatica, an analysis of medieval documents and manuscripts back to the early&nbsp;7th century that formed the foundational work for the fields of palaeography and diplomatics. He also wrote Acta Ordinis Sancti Benedicti, a collection of the lives of the Benedictine saints. (Runc. Vol I, p.&nbsp;343)\n* Bernard de Montfaucon. Bernard de Montfaucon (1655–1741) was a Benedictine monk and scholar who is considered one of the founders of archaeology and palaeography. He wrote L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures (Antiquity Explained and Represented in Diagrams) and Bibliotheca Coisliniana, an examination of ancient and medieval Greek writings. (Runc. Vol I, p.&nbsp;343)\n* Al Baghdadi. Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (1162–1231) was an Arab physician, historian and traveler who wrote numerous works including Account of Egypt in two parts that is an early work on archaeology and Egyptology.&nbsp; His work was discovered by English orientalist Edward Pococke.&nbsp; Abd al-Latif's autobiography is found in Historiens orientaux. (RHC Or., Volume 3)\n* Kathleen M. Kenyon. Dame Kathleen Mary Kenyon (1906–1978) was a British archaeologist of Neolithic culture in the Fertile Crescent, one of the most influential archeologists of the 20th century. Among her dozens of published works is Archaeology in the Holy Land (1960).\n* Moshe Sharon. Moshe Sharon (b. 1937) is an Israeli historian whose Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, published beginning in 1997, provides the epigraphy of the Holy Land relating to construction, dedication, religious endowments, epitaphs, Quranic texts, prayers and invocations. His work has been instrumental in the continued analysis of original texts of the Crusades.\n* Sheila Blair. Sheila Blair (b. 1948) is an American scholar of Islamic art who wrote the article Arab Inscriptions in Persia, in Epigraphy (Encyclopædia Iranica, 1998) and Būyid Art and Architecture (Encyclopedia of Islam, 3rd ed., 2009)\n* Hugh Kennedy. Hugh Kennedy (b. 1947) is a British historian whose Crusader Castles (1994) is an account of the history and architecture of Crusader castles in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch between 1099 and 1291.\n* David Nicolle. David Nicolle (b. 1944) is a British historian specializing in the military history of the Middle East. His Crusader Castles in the Holy Land, 1192–1302 (2005) examines the early fortifications erected by the Crusaders in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey.\n* Denys Pringle. Denys Pringle (b. 1951) is a British archaeologist and medievalist whose work Secular Buildings in the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: An Archaeological Gazeteer (1997) provides descriptive gazetteer of secular buildings (to include industrial sites) known to have existed within the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n* Camile Enlart. Camille Enlart (1862–1927) was a French archaeologist and art historian who wrote a seminal work ''L'art gothique et la Renaissance en Chypre (1899) on Crusader-era art.\nArchaeological studies of the Middle East during the Crusader period include: Medieval Fortifications in Cilicia (2019) by Dweezil Vandekerckhove, covering Armenian structures from 1198–1375; Unknown Crusader Castles (2001) by Kristian Molin provides a military history of the Holy Land, Armenia, Cyprus and Greece from the First Crusade until 1380.\nNumismatics and sigillography\nThe disciples of numismatics, the study of coins and other money, and sigillography, the study of seals of Byzantium and the Latin East, play an important role in interpreting histories. The coinage of Outremer that has been studied are the coins of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Frankish Syria, and those of the Islamic world, including Frankish imitations. Coins with Latin or Greek inscriptions and include the money the Crusaders took with them (Western European), money they encountered en route (primarily Byzantine) and coins minted in the kingdom. In the Holy Land, the Crusaders encountered monetary systems different than that in Western Europe and Byzantium. The Muslims used gold, silver and copper coinage, and the European also adopted Arabic gold and silver issues. Some researchers in this area include:\n* Louis F. de Saulcy. Louis Félicien de Saulcy (1807–1880) was a French historian, numismatist and archaeologist whose study Numismatique des croisades (1847) was a pioneering work on the coins of the Crusader era.\n* Gustave Schlumberger. Gustave Schlumberger (1844–1929) was a French historian and numismatist of the Crusades and Byzantine empire. His classic study of coins Numismatique de l'Orient Latin (1878) is the standard reference. His Sigillographie de l'empire byzantin (1884) is a compendium of Byzantine seals. He also wrote Sigillographie de l'Orient latin (1877), with a continuation by Ferdinand Chalandon (1875–1921), on the seals of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Latin Empire of Constantinople.\n* George C. Miles (1904–1975) was an Islamic numismatist whose work Fatimid Coins in the Collection of the University Museum, Philadelphia, cataloged of one major collection with references to previous work in the area.\n* Paul Balog. Paul Balog (1900–1982) was an Italian Islamic numismatic and archaeologist. His works include The Coinage of the Ayyubids (1980) and The Coinage of the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt and Syria (1964), both regarded as classic studies in Islamic numismatics. Monnaies à lé genres arabes de l'Orient latin'' (1958) by Paul Balog and Jacques Yvon (1923–1983) is the standard reference for the classifications of coins in Arabic from the Crusader era.\nAdditional topics\nPhysical phenomena, such as earthquakes and comets, have relevance in the study of history because of their depiction in written sources and correlation with archaeological finds. In the Crusader period, both Western and Arabic sources have described the chronology and impact of these natural phenomena, and the comparative analyses done by modern historians and scientists have played a role in deciphering descriptions of events. In particular, the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009 was equated with many calamities including earthquakes (in 1015, 1016) and comets (in 1029).\n* Scientific Disciplines. Archaeoseismology, the study of earthquakes' impact in archaeology, has a similar role in history in the correlation between scientific results as compared to historical documents. Numerous sources for the Crusades provide information on associated physical phenomena. Similarly, the observational history of comets and of solar eclipses can be useful in supporting or refuting suppositions in medieval texts.\n* Earthquakes. Examples of earthquakes that have been noted in Crusader historical sources including Latin historians Fulcher of Chartres, Walter the Chronicler and William of Tyre, Syriac sources Michael the Syrian and the 1224 Chronicle, and Arab historians including ibn Qalanisi, Abu Shama, ibn al-Athir (who identified 25 earthquakes in his works), and ibn al-Jawzi. Significant events include the 1114 Syrian earthquake, the 1138 Aleppo earthquake, the 1157 Hama earthquake, the 1170 Syrian earthquake, the 1202 Syrian earthquake, and the 1287 earthquake that damaged the walls of Lattakieh.\n* Comets and Meteors. The observations of comets and meteors in medieval histories includes both the physical and temporal traits of the objects as well as their view as portents of good or bad luck. The most famous of these is Haley's Comet appearing in 1066 prior to the Battle of Hastings, recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicleamong other sources. Other known sightings of comets are in 1097, 1105-1106 and 1110, and meteor storms in 1063 and 1193, as recorded by ibn Qalanisi, ibn al-Athir and others. Speculation that a sighting of the 1222 apparition of Haley's Comet, recorded by ibn al-Athir, may have caused Genghis Khan's invasion of the west are unfounded. (Runc. Vol I, p.&nbsp;190)\n* Solar and Lunar Eclipses. Solar eclipses and lunar eclipses were recorded in numerous historical texts including that of ibn al-Jawzi, ibn al-Athir and Michael the Syrian. Noted solar eclipses are those in 1061, 1176 and 1283, and lunar eclipses recorded in 1117 and 1226. (Runc. Vol II, pp.&nbsp;105, 463)\n* Nicholas Ambraseys. Nicholas Ambraseys (1929–2012) was a Greek seismologist who was a pioneer in the study of medieval earthquakes in the Middle East. His 2004 study The 12th century seismic paroxysm in the Middle East: a historical perspective is most relevant to Crusader studies. He also wrote A history of Persian earthquakes (1982) and Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia and the Red Sea (1994).\n* Al-Trabulsy. Hussain al-Trabulsy is a Saudi physicist and astronomer whose work Investigation of some astronomical phenomena in medieval Arabic chronicles is a study of Islamic observations and calculation of comets, meteors and meteor showers, and solar and lunar eclipses in the Middle Ages.\n* Johannes de Sacrobosco. Johannes de Sacrobosco (c. 1195 – c. 1256) was a medieval scholar and astronomer who wrote his De sphaera mundi (The Sphere of the Cosmos or Tractatus de sphaera) around 1230. He is still called by the name John of Holywood, a name which was constructed by post-hoc reverse translation of the Latin sacro bosco,\n* Al-Wabkanawi. Shams al-Munajjim Muhammad ibn Ali al-Wabkanawi was a 14th century Persian astronomer whose work al‐Zīj al‐muḥaqqaq is an astronomical handbook based on observations made at the Maragheh observatory established in 1259 by Persian polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201-1274). Among his accomplishments was the calculation of the solar eclipse of 30 January 1283.\nSee also\n* Art of the Crusades\n* Crusade Texts in Translation\n* Crusader States\n* Islamic view on the Crusades\n* List of Crusader Castles\n* Military History of the Crusader States\n* Military Orders of the Crusades\n* Recovery of the Holy Land\n* Travelogues of Palestine\nReferences"
