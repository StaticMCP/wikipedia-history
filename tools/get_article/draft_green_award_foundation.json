Founded in 1994, the foundation has expanded from seagoing vessels to include inland navigation. Certified vessels may receive financial incentives, including discounts on port dues, from participating ports and service providers.\nHistory\nGreen Award began in 1994 as an initiative of the Port of Rotterdam and the Dutch Ministry of Transport and Water Management to encourage higher standards among seagoing vessels. Initially focused on oil and chemical tankers, the foundation later expanded to other ship types and launched an inland navigation programme in 2011. From 1 January 2017, certification also became available to inland passenger vessels, including river cruise ships.\nProgrammes\nGreen Award operates separate certification programmes for sea shipping and inland shipping. Both assess technical, operational and managerial criteria that exceed statutory requirements, with certificates valid for three years subject to periodic audits. The inland programme includes a \"Platinum\" designation for vessels that operate with zero emissions for at least 50% of their sailing time or a minimum of three hours daily.\nCertified ships can receive financial incentives at participating ports and service providers. The Port of Rotterdam, for example, offers discounts on port dues and applies Green Award verification to certain sustainability-related fee reductions.\nGovernance and offices\nThe foundation is governed by a board comprising representatives from public and private maritime stakeholders. In 2025, Capt. Dimitrios Mattheou serves as chairman and Jan Fransen as executive director. The foundation's head office is located at Westerkade 7B, 3016 CL, Rotterdam, Netherlands.\nSee also\n* Environmental certification\n* List of environmental awards\n* Green Award (inland shipping)\n* Port State Control\n* ISO 14001\n* Inland water transport\nExternal links\n* Official website\nhttps://www.greenaward.org/\nReferences"
