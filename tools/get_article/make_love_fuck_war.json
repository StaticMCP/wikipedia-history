It was released as a single on July 2, 2004. The song is featured on Unity: The Official Athens 2004 Olympic Games Album and Public Enemy's album, New Whirl Odor. It was initially released as a protest to the 2003 Iraq War; the music video combines footage from 2002–2003 urban protests against the war with footage from previous concerts of both participants in the single.\nThe track was part of a wave of anti-war songs by popular artists in response to US action in Iraq and Afghanistan, revelations about the mistreatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and the perception that domestic needs were being neglected due to the costs of war. Make Love Fuck War called for individual resistance, grassroots struggle, and \"power to the people\" in support of peace.\nTrack listing\n| title1          = Make Love Fuck War\n| length1         = 3:24\n| title2          = Make Love Fuck War\n| note2           = Instrumental\n| length2         = 4:20\n| title3          = Make Love Fuck War\n| note3           = Acappella\n| length3         = 3:55\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!Chart (2004)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
