Jacob has always been respected by his colleagues for his ideas and had run many businesses prior to starting a steel business. After the Great Recession, Jacob strikes a deal through his colleague, Ajmal, and takes a total of 8 million dirhams from his investors. Ajmal cheats Jacob, and Jacob is left in a debt of 8 million dirhams, which he learns about on his 25th wedding anniversary. Jacob's credibility and trustful ways of business are lost and he is forced to travel to Liberia to finalize a deal, which fails and he is forced to stay there to avoid arrest. With continued complaints from investors, especially from Murali Menon, Jerry decides to solve his family's problems by stepping into his dad's shoes.\nJerry, without a trade license nor office, faces many difficulties at first. He decides to go out with what his father had taught him about business. He meets a self-made businessman, Yusuf Shah, and strikes a deal with him, eventually earning his trust and the business grows. Jerry motivates Abin to start a tours and travel company, and they succeed. Jerry is able to pay most of the debts and earns back the trust of the investors. However, Murali Menon pressurizes him for the full payment. Jerry and his mother close as many deals as they can and are able to collect money, but were only able to collect half of what they owed. Finally, Murali takes the case against Jerry to the court however the case is rejected as the case was registered against the owner of the company, which is under Jacob's name. Murali, who has also been affected by the recession, is forced to agree with Jerry's conditions.\nJerry expands his company with Yusuf Shah and clears his family's debts. He visits his father in Kerala, along with his girlfriend, Chippy. Jerry finds it difficult to communicate with his father, because he isn't the person he once knew.

S. of The Indian Express rated 3.5 stars out of 5 and stated that the director has showed discipline while handling dramatic situations and \"has used his observations to good effect as the strong relationship bonds inside Jacob's family members and their informal homely behaviour was captured with shots that impart warmth and positive vibes, like the feel of an early morning coffee\". He gave a special mention for the performance of Ashwin Kumar and praised the editing. Padmakumar K. of Malayala Manorama wrote \"Being a story based on true incidents it could have been told in a more poignant manner. But Vineeth chose to play it safe by arranging the lighter and the turbid moments at regular intervals to make it an arresting narrative rather than delving deep into the heart of the issue\" and rated 3 stars out of 5. He praised the performances of Renji Panicker, Lakshmy Ramakrishnan and Ashwin Kumar.\nGautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times awarded 3 out of 5 and stated \"The movie stays pretty much focussed – and does not stray into any romantic alleyways (though Jerry has a girlfriend) – except to include a few squabbles which one of Jerry's brothers gets into. These add a certain balance to the film's structure, and with performances by most of the cast members – particularly Pauly, Panicker and Ramakrishnan – disarmingly understated, Sreenivasan's work is captivating (sic)\". He appreciated the editing. Akhila Menon of Filmibeat rated 3.5 out of 5 and praised the performances of Renji Panicker, Nivin Pauly, and Lakshmy Ramakrishnan. She wrote \"The director has perfectly narrated the well-written script, with the right mix of light humour and emotional elements\" praising Vineeth Sreenivasan. She also lauded the cinematography, editing and the songs, especially \"Thiruvaavaniraavu\".\nAnu James of International Business Times awarded 4 out of 5 and mentioned \"Although the movie is predictable, the beautiful moments we come across make us feel relaxed, eager to know how the movie progresses. The first half is totally a Renji Panicker show, while the second half belongs to Nivin as the hero\". She praised the performances of Renji Panicker and Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, cinematography, editing, and songs. Sanjith Sidhardhan of The Times of India stated \"Vineeth has taken extra effort to tell this real-life story as honestly as possible, the added attention may have dropped the entertainment quotient a tad. The film, however, makes up with several feel-good moments that accentuate the value of relationships\". He praised the casting and performances of Lakshmi Ramakrishnan, Renji Panicker, Ashwin Kumar, and Nivin Pauly, and also cinematography and music. He rated 4 out of 5 stars.\nMani Prabhu of NDTV is written \"the first hour of the film, which brilliantly establishes the Jacobs' kind of family, despite baiting us with continuous Vishu movie cliches, superbly spins each of them in tasteful angles\", \"the second half of the film, which gives all the opportunities for unabashed melodrama and parental sentiments, is surprisingly restrained, refreshing and free of bloat. The romantic track is brushed away confidently with a two-minute exposition. Characters don't go out of their way for the sake of entertainment\". He also praised the performances of Nivin Pauly, Renji Panicker, Lakshmy Ramakrishnan, and Sreenath Bhasi. Sify described it \"Emotional roller coaster\" and wrote \"...the story has been narrated in a highly conventional manner to the extent that things get a bit predictable at times. But considering this has been a real life story that a family actually went through, it can be justified generally\".
