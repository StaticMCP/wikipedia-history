It includes experimental engines as well as those that made it to production status.\nThe Reich Air Ministry used an internal designation system that included a prefix number signifying the engine type, 9 for piston engines and 109 for jets and rockets, followed by a manufacturer's code, followed by an engine series number. Unlike the 9-prefixed piston engine designations, the 109-series of reaction-thrust, turbojet, turboprop and rocket engine designation numbers' three-place numerical suffixes had no \"firm adherence\" to any one manufacturer.\n* 090–099 – various minor manufacturers\n* 1 – Bayerische Motorenwerke GmbH (BMW); later changed to 800 block\n* 2 – Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke A.G.\n* 3 – BMW-Flugmotorenwerke Brandenburg GmbH (BMW-Bramo)\n* 4 – Argus Motoren GmbH\n* 5 – Heinkel Hirth Motoren GmbH\n* 6 – Daimler-Benz A.G.\n* 7 – Brückner or Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz A.G.\n* 8 – Bayerische Motorenwerke GmbH (BMW)\nUsing this system, the famous BMW engine used in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 would be known as the 9-801 (Piston(9)-BMW(8)Number(01)). However, this system was not widely used, even within the RLM, and a common name consisting of the manufacturer's name (often abbreviated) followed by the model number was much more common. The list below uses the common BMW 801 instead of the official 9-801.\nEngines produced before the RLM's designation system was set up are often listed using the same basic terminology. So while the interwar Argus 10 engine can be referred to as the As 10, it is not correct to call it the 9–10, this designation was never applied.\nNotable engines:\nBMW 003 —\nBMW 801 —\nHWK 109–509\nThe Luftwaffe also used engines from France, particularly the Gnôme-Rhône 14 cylinder series of radial engines for its Henschel Hs 129 (14M) ground attack aircraft and Messerschmitt Me 323 (14N) \"Gigant\" transporter.\nPiston engines (motors)\nArgus Motoren\n* Argus As 8 – air-cooled, 4-inline\n*Argus As 10 air-cooled, inverted V-8 engine\n*Argus As 401 eight-cylinder\n*Argus As 402\n*Argus As 410 12-cylinder, air-cooled\n*Argus As 411 larger development of the 410\n*Argus As 412 H-block development of the 410\n*Argus As 413\nBayerische Motorenwerke\n*BMW VI V-12 water-cooled\n*BMW 112 V-12 water-cooled, (prototype)\n*BMW 114 9-cylinder radial diesel, combined air-water-cooled (prototypes)\n*BMW 116 V-12 water-cooled\n*BMW 117 V-12 water-cooled\n*BMW 132 9-cylinder radial, air-cooled\n*BMW 139 14-cylinder two-row radial, air-cooled (prototype)\n*BMW 801 14-cylinder two-row radial, air-cooled — most-produced radial engine of the Third Reich\n*BMW 802 experimental, 18-cylinder two-row radial\n*BMW 803 experimental, 28-cylinder liquid-cooled four-row radial\n*BMW 804\nBMW-Bramo\n*Bramo 323 - 9 cylinder air cooled radial\nDaimler-Benz\n* Daimler-Benz DB 600 12-cylinder inverted-V\n* Daimler-Benz DB 601 improved DB 600 with fuel injection\n* Daimler-Benz DB 602 16-cylinder diesel powered the two Hindenburg class airships\n* Daimler-Benz DB 603 \"enlarged DB601\" (largest displacement German inverted V12) for use in bombers and fighter-bombers, little fighter use\n* Daimler-Benz DB 604 prototype 24-cylinder (X-24) engine, cancelled in September 1942\n* Daimler-Benz DB 605 improved and slightly enlarged DB601 for use in fighters\n* Daimler-Benz DB 606 First conceived in February 1937; composed of twinned DB 601 engines, a 1.5 tonne weight coupled \"power system\", derided as a \"welded-together engine\" by Goering in August 1942\n* Daimler-Benz DB 607 a four-stroke diesel version of DB 603 engine.\n* Daimler-Benz DB 609 16-cylinder version of DB 603 engine.\n* Daimler-Benz DB 610 First conceived in June 1940; composed of twinned DB 605 engines, a coupled \"power system\", to replace the DB 606\n* Daimler-Benz DB 612\n* Daimler-Benz DB 613 First conceived in March 1940; two coupled \"power system\" DB603 engines, total weight of 1.8 tonnes apiece, as with the 606 and 610, experimental only\n* Daimler-Benz DB 614 development of the DB 603G, 2000&nbsp;hp.
