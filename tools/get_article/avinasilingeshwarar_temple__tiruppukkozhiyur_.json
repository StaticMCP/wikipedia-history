Shiva is worshipped as Avinasiappar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Karunambigai. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.\nThe temple complex covers five acres and it houses two gateway towers known as gopurams, each facing the Avinasiappar and Karunambigai shrine. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Avinasiappar and his consort Karunambigai being the most prominent.\nThe temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival is celebrated during the day of the Magam (February - March) is the most prominent festival.\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend\nAvinasi indicates the one that cannot be destroyed indicating Shiva's grace to his devotees. As per Hindu legend, two boys of eight years of age took a dip in a tank when a crocodile swallowed one of them. The mother of the boy pleaded Sundarar to rescue his child and said that she was planning to do Upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) to the child when this incident happened. Sundarar, who was on his way to Tiruvanchikulam heard the incident and sung praises of Shiva in the temple. The boy was miraculously rescued from the clutches of a crocodile and  this event is commemorated during the Mudalai Vaai Pillai Utsavam on Panguni Uththiram. There is a shrine to Sundarar on the banks of the temple tank and the bottom of the flagpost carries the image of the legend. Since the boy came out of crocodile's mouth, the place is called Pukkoliyur. Brahma is said to have worshipped the Shiva here for hundred years.
