Said Poet Gould. \"I suppose I must get used to this if I am going to be any good with my verse.\" Thereupon she rattled solemnly: \"I have been writing poetry since I was 6. It's funny that I should have loved poetry, isn't it? Most of the girls I know really loathe it. ... I like horseback riding, swimming, and tennis, but I am poor at tennis. ... I like boys all right, but I don't like them my own age. They seem so stupid. ... I think it's very silly of Roosevelt to tax the rich and give it to the unemployed.\" Miss Gould posed for newscameramen, then ushered her callers to the elevator. \"You know,\" said she \"I will get 10 cents for every copy that's sold.\" Best of her 37 verses.
