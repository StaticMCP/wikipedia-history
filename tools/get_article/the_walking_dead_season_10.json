Season 10 is already off to a promising start\". Paul Tassi of Forbes praised the writing and direction, writing: \"The writing remains on point, the direction is solid. The show is still in a good place.\"\nIn further reviews based upon the first three episodes available to critics, Tassi wrote that \"they're all good episodes, and I think I liked each one more than the last\" and \"they're very solid and continue my confidence in the Angela Kang era of the show, showing that season 9 wasn't a fluke. The show is genuinely good now, and I can't wait to see what's next\". Cameron Bonomolo of ComicBook.com praised the episodes for its horror elements, writing: \"The Walking Dead Season 10 recaptures the same tone of raw realism established by first-season showrunner Frank Darabont, expanding on it with a flavoring that is deliciously eerie. Not only is The Walking Dead straight-up scary, it often feels like a genuine horror movie, a feat achieved either through atmosphere and tension-building or pop-up spooks.\"\nAccolades\nThe tenth season of The Walking Dead received five nominations for the upcoming 46th Saturn Awards—Best Horror Television Series (the series' fifth consecutive nomination, with four consecutive wins), Best Supporting Actor on a Television Series for Norman Reedus (his fourth nomination), Best Supporting Actress on a Television Series for Melissa McBride (her seventh consecutive nomination, with two consecutive wins), Best Performance by a Younger Actor on a Television Series for Cassady McClincy, and Best Guest Starring Performance on a Television Series for Jeffrey Dean Morgan (his fourth consecutive nomination, with two wins).\nAt the inaugural Critics' Choice Super Awards, the season was also nominated for Best Horror Series and Best Villain in a Series for Samantha Morton. The first half of the season was nominated for Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble a Comedy or Drama Series at the 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards (the series' eighth consecutive nomination). Additionally, Danai Gurira won the Gracie Award for Outstanding Female Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama.\nRatings\n| title2   = We Are the End of the World\n| date2    = October 13, 2019\n| rs2      = 1.3\n| viewers2 = 3.47\n| dvr2     = 0.9\n| dvrv2    = 2.16\n| total2   = 2.2\n| totalv2  = 5.63\n| title3   = Ghosts\n| date3    = October 20, 2019\n| rs3      = 1.2\n| viewers3 = 3.48\n| dvr3     = 0.8\n| dvrv3    = 2.12\n| total3   = 2.0\n| totalv3  = 5.60\n| title4   = Silence the Whisperers\n| date4    = October 27, 2019\n| rs4      = 1.1\n| viewers4 = 3.31\n| dvr4     = 0.9\n| dvrv4    = 2.20\n| total4   = 2.0\n| totalv4  = 5.51\n| title5   = What It Always Is\n| date5    = November 3, 2019\n| rs5      = 1.0\n| viewers5 = 3.09\n| dvr5     = 1.0\n| dvrv5    = 2.25\n| total5   = 2.0\n| totalv5  = 5.34\n| title6   = Bonds\n| date6    = November 10, 2019\n| rs6      = 1.1\n| viewers6 = 3.21\n| dvr6     = 0.8\n| dvrv6    = 2.23\n| total6   = 1.9\n| totalv6  = 5.44\n| title7   = Open Your Eyes\n| date7    = November 17, 2019\n| rs7      = 1.1\n| viewers7 = 3.31\n| dvr7     = 0.9\n| dvrv7    = 2.11\n| total7   = 2.0\n| totalv7  = 5.42\n| title8   = The World Before\n| date8    = November 24, 2019\n| rs8      = 1.0\n| viewers8 = 3.21\n| dvr8     = 0.8\n| dvrv8    = 2.10\n| total8   = 1.8\n| totalv8  = 5.31\n| title9   = Squeeze\n| date9    = February 23, 2020\n| rs9      = 1.2\n| viewers9 = 3.52\n| dvr9     = 0.7\n| dvrv9    = 1.86\n| total9   = 1.9\n| totalv9  = 5.38\n| title10   = Stalker\n| date10    = March 1, 2020\n| rs10      = 1.0\n| viewers10 = 3.16\n| dvr10     = 0.8\n| dvrv10    = 1.84\n| total10   = 1.8\n| totalv10  = 5.00\n| title11   = Morning Star\n| date11    = March 8, 2020\n| rs11      = 0.9\n| viewers11 = 2.93\n| dvr11     = 0.6\n| dvrv11    = 1.52\n| total11   = 1.5\n| totalv11  = 4.45\n| title12   = Walk with Us\n| date12    = March 15, 2020\n| rs12      = 1.2\n| viewers12 = 3.49\n| dvr12     = 0.8\n| dvrv12    = 1.96\n| total12   = 2.0\n| totalv12  = 5.45\n| title13   = What We Become\n| date13    = March 22, 2020\n| rs13      = 1.2\n| viewers13 = 3.66\n| dvr13     = 0.8\n| dvrv13    = 1.91\n| total13   = 2.0\n| totalv13  = 5.57\n| title14   = Look at the Flowers\n| date14    = March 29, 2020\n| rs14      = 1.1\n| viewers14 = 3.26\n| dvr14     = 0.7\n| dvrv14    = 1.72\n| total14   = 1.8\n| totalv14  = 4.98\n| title15   = The Tower\n| date15    = April 5, 2020\n| rs15      = 1.1\n| viewers15 = 3.49\n| dvr15     = 0.6\n| dvrv15    = 1.51\n| total15   = 1.7\n| totalv15  = 5.00\n| title16   = A Certain Doom\n| date16    = October 4, 2020\n| rs16      = 0.9\n| viewers16 = 2.73\n| dvr16     = n/a\n| dvrv16    = n/a\n| total16   = n/a\n| totalv16  = n/a\n| title17   = Home Sweet Home\n| date17    = February 28, 2021\n| rs17      = 0.9\n| viewers17 = 2.89\n| dvr17     = 0.4\n| dvrv17    = 1.41\n| total17   = 1.3\n| totalv17  = 4.30\n| title18   = Find Me\n| date18    = March 7, 2021\n| rs18      = 0.7\n| viewers18 = 2.26\n| dvr18     = 0.5\n| dvrv18    = 1.55\n| total18   = 1.2\n| totalv18  = 3.81\n| title19   = One More\n| date19    = March 14, 2021\n| rs19      = 0.6\n| viewers19 = 2.17\n| dvr19     = 0.5\n| dvrv19    = 1.45\n| total19   = 1.1\n| totalv19  = 3.62\n| title20   = Splinter\n| date20    = March 21, 2021\n| rs20      = 0.6\n| viewers20 = 2.11\n| dvr20     = n/a\n| dvrv20    = n/a\n| total20   = n/a\n| totalv20  = n/a\n| title21   = Diverged\n| date21    = March 28, 2021\n| rs21      = 0.6\n| viewers21 = 1.94\n| dvr21     = n/a\n| dvrv21    = n/a\n| total21   = n/a\n| totalv21  = n/a\n| title22   = Here's Negan\n| date22    = April 4, 2021\n| rs22      = 0.6\n| viewers22 = 2.12\n| dvr22     = n/a\n| dvrv22    = n/a\n| total22   = n/a\n| totalv22  = n/a\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
