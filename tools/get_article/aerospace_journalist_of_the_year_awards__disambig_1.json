Those awards were restricted to writers from Australia and New Zealand.\nOverview\nThe international Aerospace Journalist of the Year Awards (AJOYA) were awards for writers and broadcasters working in the aerospace and aviation field, including specialists and those working for non-specialist titles. The awards dinner took place in mid-July (timed to coincide with the Farnborough Air Show and the Paris Air Show), and brought together aviation media and industry representatives.\nThe awards were organised between 1996 and 2010 by Malcolm Turner and his company (the World Leadership Forum, Ltd, of the UK) under the auspices of the Royal Aeronautical Society of the U.K. and the Aero Club of France (Aéro-Club de France).\nThe awards, given annually, were typically organized in a hierarchy:\n* 1.)  All entries in each category of each award (typically varying from seven to dozens of contestants, depending on the volume of entries—commonly in the hundreds).\n...which judges narrowed down to...\n* 2.)  \"Shortlist\" finalists in each category (usually about the top 5 candidates) (Shortlists were published on the respective Awards program websites for the few months leading up to the Awards Banquet/Ceremony.)\n...from which, based on judges' scores, were selected...\n* 3.)  \"\"Best in Category\" winners\" in each topical category, announced at the Awards Banquet/Ceremony\n...from which were selected, based on judges' scores...\n* 4.)  The OVERALL \"Aerospace Journalist of the Year,\" also announced at the Awards Banquet/Ceremony\n...and an additional award...\n* 5.)  The \"DECADE OF EXCELLENCE\" Award was also awarded each year (based on judges' scores), for the most outstanding aerospace journalist of the previous ten years.\nTrophies\nThe AJOYA awards were originally trophies in the form of a bronze eagle – leading the awards to become known colloquially as 'budgies', and for the competition to become known as the 'Budgie Awards'. The design of the trophy changed several times, becoming a representation of the Aerospace Journalist of the Year logo, and then a simple engraved glass 'spike'.\nHistory\nThe aerospace industry's writing awards, previously for many years (1960s to mid-/late 1990s), had been awarded annually by the U.S.-based Aviation & Space Writers' Association, at a grand banquet gathering aviation industry leaders and luminaries.  That organization and its awards program dissolved, leaving a vacuum in the aviation media world.\nStarting in the late 1990s, until 2009–2010, that void was filled by a British enterprise—the World Leadership Forum, Ltd. – in collaboration with the world's two oldest aviation organizations: the Aero Club of France (Aéro-Club de France), and the Royal Aeronautical Society (of the United Kingdom).\nAwards were issued in several \"Category\" topic areas (see lists below).\nContest entries (copies of published articles or broadcasts) were received from publications and authors, then copied and redistributed to judges in each category, who then narrowed the submissions down to a few finalists (the prestigious \"Shortlist\") in each category, which was then published on the organization website during the months leading up to the banquet.\nThe \"Shortlist\" candidates were invited to the Awards Banquet, where they would then discover who, among them, would be awarded the \"Aerospace Journalist of the Year Award\" in that respective category. Then from the category winners, a tally of judges' scores determined the one overall \"Aerospace Journalist of the Year,\"  and one Honoree for a \"Decade of Excellence\" Award.\nThe awards were first presented in London in 1996, and throughout the years, the presentation ceremonies have alternated between Paris and London—roughly coinciding with the world's two main airshows: the Paris Air Show and Farnborough Air Show (England), held on alternate years.\nIn London, the AJOYA ceremonies have taken place at the Ballroom of the Park Lane Hotel, Piccadilly, and at the Royal Courts of Justice, and they directly preceded the biennial Farnborough Airshow.\nThe organization depended upon aerospace industry companies to sponsor the awards, and reciprocated their generosity by offering them seating with the AJOYA finalists at the awards banquet—a public-relations opportunity for aerospace industry leaders and P.R. execs to charm their industry's leading writers and opinion-shapers.\nHowever, remotely located from most of the world's aviation media (in London or Paris, far removed from the Americas, Africa and Asia), many aerospace writers who made the awards-finalist \"Shortlists\" (and were thus invited to the banquet), were unable to attend—undermining the value of the banquet, and sponsorships, to AJOYA's commercial sponsors.\nThe awards then began to be limited to only those writers who would make the trip to the banquet, sharply reducing eligibility for the awards.\nInitially, relatively few of the world's aerospace journalists competed, and the awards were almost exclusively from the U.S. and Britain, with a few contestants from Western Europe and British Commonwealth nations.\nHowever, as the years went by, many more entered the contests, and additional categories of judging were added, and non-English entries were admitted (and translated into English for the judges), drawing contest entries from throughout the world—Russia and Eastern Europe, China and East Asia, South Asia, Latin America and Africa.\nThe volume of entries began to overwhelm the limited number of AJOYA judges, creating difficulties.\nThe global economic \"Great Recession\" that started in 2007 soon collapsed the aerospace industry, and forced drastic budget-tightening on nearly all aerospace companies. \"Extras\"—such as support of aviation organizations and programs—were cut out of many companies' budgets.\nThe awards ended amid rumours that they folded due to a lack of sponsorship.\nThe World Leadership Forum, Ltd. organization dissolved in 2009, according to the business-info website Duedil.com.\nThe AJOYA.com website is now off-line and the domain name is for sale.\nThere were no awards in 2011, and in 2012 a different organiser held a new Aerospace Media Awards dinner at the Royal Aeronautical Society in London.\nJudges\nJudges were chiefly leading aerospace industry editors & writers, and business/technical leaders & experts—largely chosen from the ranks of former AJOYA winners or \"Shortlist\" finalists—from around the world.\nThe judges came from aerospace industry publications such as:\n* Aero Revue\n* Aviation International News\n* Aviation Week & Space Technology\n* Business & Commercial Aviation\n* Flight International\n* ''Jane's Defence Weekly\nTo ensure fair judging, judges were recused from voting on their own submissions, and from voting on any other submissions from any publication for whom they wrote, or any \"sister\" publication (owned by the same, or a related, company).\nThe final list of AJOYA judges (see below) finished with the note:\n\"The judges have not marked any entry from their own publication/company, or any sister publication/company\"\nThis is
