Mount Wardle is home to the largest population of mountain goats within the national park. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,600&nbsp;meters (5,250&nbsp;feet) above the Banff–Windermere Highway in three kilometers (1.9 mile). Mount Wardle is composed of Ottertail limestone, a sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period and pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains east into Wardle Creek which is a tributary of the Vermilion River, and west into Lost Creek, a tributary of the Kootenay River.\nHistory\nThe first ascent of the summit was made in 1922 by a Topographical Survey party. The mountain's toponym was applied by Morrison P. Bridgland (1878–1948), a Dominion Land Surveyor who named many peaks in the Canadian Rockies. It was officially adopted 9 September 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada to honor James Morey Wardle (1888–1971), a highway design engineer and then-director of special projects for Parks Canada. Wardle also served as superintendent of Banff National Park from 1919 through 1921.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Wardle is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20&nbsp;°C with wind chill factors below −30&nbsp;°C.\nGallery\nFile:Mount Wardle aerial.jpg|Aerial view of Mt. Wardle (centered), Mt.
