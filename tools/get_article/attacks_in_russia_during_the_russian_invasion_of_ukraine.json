The main targets have been the military, the arms industry and the oil industry. Many of the attacks have been drone strikes, firebombing, and rail sabotage. The Ukrainian intelligence services have acknowledged carrying out some of these attacks. Others have been carried out by anti-war activists in Russia. There have also been cross-border shelling, missile strikes, and covert raids from Ukraine, mainly in Belgorod, Kursk, and Bryansk oblasts. Several times, Ukrainian-based paramilitaries launched incursions into Russia, captured border villages and battled the Russian military. These were carried out by units made up mainly of Russian emigrants. While Ukraine supported these ground incursions, it denied direct involvement.\nIn August 2024, the Ukrainian military launched an offensive into Kursk Oblast and captured numerous settlements. It was the biggest attack into Russia since the war began and the first carried out primarily by Ukrainian regular forces.\nIn response to the invasion, there have also been attacks on Russian forces in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.\nShelling, drone strikes and sabotage\nFebruary–March 2022\nOn 25 February 2022, the Millerovo air base was attacked, allegedly with Tochka-U missiles.

There were claims that it was due to Ukrainian action.\nOn 23 and 24 March, Governor of Belgorod Oblast Vyacheslav Gladkov reported that Zhuravlyovka and Nekhoteyevka came under shelling from the Ukrainian side. The next day, the Moscow Patriarchate claimed that chaplain Oleg Artyomov died in Zhuravlyovka as a result of a BM-30 Smerch strike by Ukraine.\nOn 29 March, local officials reported a series of explosions outside the city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine. It was later reported that those explosions may have been caused by a fire.\nApril 2022\nOn 1 April 2022, according to regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov and an unnamed US official, two Ukrainian  Mi-24 helicopters attacked and set fire to a fuel depot in Belgorod in a low-altitude airstrike with no reported casualties. Ukraine denied and dismissed the event as Russian propaganda. Ukrainian security official Oleksiy Danilov denied Ukraine was behind the helicopter attack, with a joke in which he blamed the \"People's Republic of Belgorod\" instead. On the same day, a rocket exploded in a different part of the oblast, but its apparent trajectory and model led open-source researchers to suspect it was a failed Russian missile.\nOn 11 April, Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk, and Voronezh Oblasts all raised their terror alert system to \"yellow\", the second tier in a three-class system.

The next day, Russian security services claimed they had shot down a Mil Mi-8 helicopter during the incident.\nOn 15 April, Russia launched major missile strikes on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in retaliation for alleged cross-border attacks. The Russian strikes were the largest of their kind to take place since Russia aborted its 2022 Kyiv offensive.\nUkraine rejected claims that it was responsible for the 14 April 2022 attacks, instead asserting that Russian intelligence services were trying to \"carry out terrorist acts to whip up anti-Ukrainian hysteria\" in the country. After the attack, the Security Service of Ukraine released what it claimed were intercepted conversations between Russian soldiers showing that Russia deliberately fired on the villages in order to blame Ukraine. One of the alleged soldiers refers to the Russian apartment bombings in 1999 where he says that the \"same shit happened in the Chechen war.

The Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) and Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) claimed responsibility for the attacks. A Ukrainian spokesperson, Andrii Yusov, made the same claim, stating that the attacks were to \"liberate\" the regions and to provide a buffer zone to protect Ukrainian civilians. Russian authorities attributed the attacks to \"a Ukrainian sabotage-reconnaissance group\".\nOn 1 June, the FRL and RVC launched another raid into Belgorod Oblast, this time near the small town of Shebekino.\nMarch 2024: Belgorod and Kursk\nOn 12 March 2024, the FRL and RVC launched raids into Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts, claiming control of Tyotkino and Lozovaya Rudka.\nAugust 2024–March 2025: Belgorod and Kursk\nStarting on 18 March 2025, Ukrainian forces launched an incursion into Belgorod Oblast, near the towns of Demidovka, Grafovka and Prilesye.\nReactions\nRussia\nIn response to alleged shelling by Ukraine, Russia reportedly began reinforcing its border with Ukraine in November 2022, including building defense lines and fortifications along the border in Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk regions. A state of emergency was also declared in some villages and settlements along the border with Ukraine following repeated shelling attacks.\nISW reported in November 2022 that Russian forces could be preparing a large-scale false flag attack to gather popular support for the invasion, with Kremlin propagandists claiming that Ukraine is \"preparing to invade\" Belgorod Oblast. A senior Ukrainian officer later said that Russia may attempt to escalate the situation on the border and claim \"NATO and Ukrainian aggression\". He cited fake news being spread in pro-Russian Telegram channels about \"Ukrainian and NATO plans\" to \"attack peaceful Russian and Belarusian territory\".\nIn May 2023, Russia's Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev accused Ukraine's NATO allies of involvement in Ukrainian attacks in Russia, saying \"the terrorist attacks committed in Russia are accompanied by an information campaign prepared in advance in Washington and London, designed to destabilise the socio-political situation, and to undermine the constitutional foundations and sovereignty of Russia.\"\nAfter a Ukrainian HIMARS strike destroyed a convoy of Russian troops in Kursk Oblast in Russia on the night of 8–9 August 2024, Russian milbloggers responded with outrage. Many of them called for the commanders who authorized the movement of the column to be punished. The Ukrainian attack on the convoy was described by Russian milbloggers as one of the bloodiest of the entire war.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin threatened retaliation for attacks on Russian territory. He alleged that Western-supplied \"long-range precision weapons cannot be used without space-based reconnaissance\" and \"highly skilled specialists\" from NATO countries. Experts said Putin's threats are aimed at dissuading the United States, the United Kingdom and France from allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied long-range missiles such as the ATACMS and Storm Shadow in strikes against Russia.\nto Moscow]]\nIn December 2024, Vladimir Putin threatened to bring more \"destruction\" to Ukraine in retaliation for a Ukrainian drone attack on the central Russian city of Kazan in the Republic of Tatarstan.\nOn 25 December 2024, the Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243 crashed near Aktau International Airport, Kazakhstan, with 62 passengers and 5 crew on board. Osprey Flight Solutions, a United Kingdom-based aviation security firm which provides analysis for airlines still flying into Russia, warned its clients that the aircraft had likely been shot down by a Russian military air-defence system.  On the morning of 25 December, the head of the Security Council of the Chechen Republic, Khamzat Kadyrov, confirmed that Grozny had been attacked by drones. On 26 December, Azerbaijani government sources confirmed that a Russian surface-to-air missile, a Pantsir-S1, had fired at the aircraft above Grozny, detonating near the plane, injuring passengers and crew members. Despite the pilots' requests to perform an emergency landing, they were denied to do so at any Russian airport, instead being ordered to fly towards Aktau.\nUkraine\nUkrainian officials have rarely commented on the attacks. The Ukrainian military and intelligence services have acknowledged carrying out some of them, or have welcomed attacks without admitting involvement.\nIn April 2022, Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, referred to attacks in Russia as \"karma\" or payback for the Russian invasion. He said that Russian regions where fuel and weapons are stored were learning about \"demilitarization\", referring to one of Putin's stated goals of the invasion.\nUkraine's military denied taking part in the cross-border raids by the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps. Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence, said that Russian citizens had launched the operations to liberate territories from the \"Putin regime\", to push Russian government forces away from the border and create a \"security zone to protect the Ukrainian civilian population\". Some Ukrainian commentators wryly compared them to Russia's past use of proxy forces in Ukraine. Mykhailo Podolyak said \"As you know, tanks are sold at any Russian military store\", referencing Putin's claim that Russian troops and proxy forces in 2014 were locals who bought their equipment at army surplus stores. Ukrainian social media accounts jokingly called the Belgorod region the \"Bilhorod People's Republic\", in reference to the Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. Another popular joke online referred to Putin announcing \"another Special Military Operation to defend Russian-speaking Russians from Russians invading Russia\".\nIn response to Ukraine's 2024 cross-border offensive in Kursk, President Zelenskyy said that \"Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done\". He said: \"Everything that inflicts losses on the Russian army, Russian state, their military-industrial complex, and their economy helps prevent the war from expanding and brings us closer to a just end to this aggression\". Zelenskyy maintained that \"Russia must be forced to make peace\", adding that Ukrainian troops were helping to protect Ukraine by capturing areas from where Russia had launched numerous strikes. Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy said that \"unlike Russia\", Ukraine is not interested in taking the territory of its neighbor. Tykhy continued: \"The sooner Russia agrees to restore a just peace ... the sooner the raids by the Ukrainian defense forces into Russia will stop\".\nNATO\nFor more than two years, NATO states that supplied Ukraine with weapons, barred Ukraine from using those weapons to strike inside Russia. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said \"We haven't encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine\". However, in May 2024, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and several European leaders said Ukraine should be allowed to use Western-supplied weapons to strike military targets inside Russia in self-defense. Stoltenberg said that \"if [Ukraine] cannot attack the Russian forces on the other side of the frontline because they are on the other side of the border, then of course you really reduce the ability of the Ukrainian forces to defend\". French President Emmanuel Macron said that Ukraine must be able to take out the bases across the border from where Russian missiles are fired, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Ukraine's defense \"isn't limited to its territory\". Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she did not think it necessary to hit Russian military bases, and urged Western allies to supply Ukraine with more air defenses instead. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said it is \"wrong to increase tension\" in an already \"dramatic\" situation and underlined the need to leave open the possibility of \"peace talks in the coming months\". Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said it was a \"crazy idea because, as we've seen so far, the Russians will fire back\".\nOn 30 May 2024, in response to Russia's 2024 Kharkiv offensive, US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to strike the Russian military inside Russia with US-supplied weapons, but only to defend the Kharkiv region from \"Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them\". The same permission was given to Ukraine by Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot said that the Netherlands would not object if Ukraine used Dutch-supplied F-16 fighters to strike military targets inside Russia.\nThe US Biden administration reportedly told Ukraine to stop attacking oil refineries in Russia, believing it would raise world energy prices and bring more aggressive Russian retaliation. Ukraine's government rejected the request. The US also expressed concern at a Ukrainian drone strike against a Russian nuclear early-warning radar, believing that it could dangerously unsettle the Russian government.\nIn July 2024, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the British government would authorize the use of Storm Shadow long-range missiles against military targets in Russia.\nOn 17 November 2024, the Biden administration authorized the use of long-range ATACMS missiles for military targets inside mainland Russia.\nSee also\n* Shelling of Donetsk, Rostov Oblast\n* Crimea attacks (2022–present)\n* 2022 rail war in Belarus\n* Russian mystery fires (2022–present)\n* Hybrid warfare\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Victor Davidoff, \"[https://jamestown.org/program/why-is-the-kremlin-silent-about-attacks-on-russian-territory/ Why Is the Kremlin Silent About Attacks on Russian Territory?]\", Eurasia Daily Monitor, v&nbsp;19, n&nbsp;75, 23 May 2022."
