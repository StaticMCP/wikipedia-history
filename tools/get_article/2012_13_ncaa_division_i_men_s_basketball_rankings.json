It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week4-1   = Indiana (6–0) 27\n|Week4-1-Color =\n|Week4-2   = Duke (6–0) 4\n|Week4-2-Color = u\n|Week4-3   = Michigan (5–0)\n|Week4-3-Color =
