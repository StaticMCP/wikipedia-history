The Ghurids defeated the rebel forces and Jatwan was killed in the battle.\nIn 1192, soon after the second battle of Tarain, Jatwan, a subordinate of Prithviraj Chauhan, besieged Hansi, which came under Ghurid rule after the battle. After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan in 1192AD, Jatwan raised the standard of revolt and besieged the Muslim commander Nasrat Uddin at Hansi. On receiving this news Qutb-ud-din Aibak marched twelve farsakhs, i.e., about  in one night. Jatwan raised the siege of Hansi and prepared for an obstinate conflict. \"The armies attacked each other\", says the author of Taj-ul-Maasir, \"like two hills of steel, and the field of battle [on the borders of the Bager country] became tulip-dyed with the blood of warriors ... Jatwan had his standards of God-plurality and ensigns of perdition lowered by the hand of power\".\nReferences"
