This compilation highlights American slang from the 1920s and does not include foreign phrases. The glossary includes dated entries connected to bootlegging, criminal activities, drug usage, filmmaking, firearms, ethnic slurs, prison slang, sexuality, women's physical features, and sports metaphors. Some expressions are deemed inappropriate and offensive in today's context.\nWhile slang is usually inappropriate for formal settings, this assortment includes well-known expressions from that time, with some still in use today, e.g., , , , and .\nThese items were gathered from published sources documenting 1920s slang, including books, PDFs, and websites. Verified references are provided for every entry in the listing.\n0-9\n}}\n}}\nA\n}}\n}}, a fiver, half a }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}} }} }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}}}\n|source=1923 book by Nels Anderson\n|style=background:#F5F5F5; color: inherit; font-size:90%;}}\n}}}}\n}}\n}} }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nB\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n, the bank's closed!}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}} or brothel}}\n}}}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n; also derivative bent outta of shape;'' see }}}}}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nArea in the south and midwest where fundamentalism flourishes}}\n}}\n}}}}\n}}\n}}\nPrison}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nTough guy or strong man; see also  }}\nwalking along railroad tracks after being put off a train.
