The island is named for William Lyon Mackenzie King, local Member of Parliament and Canadian Prime Minister who established Prince Albert National Park. The island features a hiking trail and picnic facilities. Prior to its current name, the island was known locally as Devil's Island due to a Cree legend that claimed it was inhabited by supernatural creatures of a mischievous or demonic nature.\nSee also\n* List of islands of Saskatchewan\nReferences"
