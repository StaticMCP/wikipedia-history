The award for Most Valuable Player is voted on by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. Nominees for the Foundation Award are chosen by the Players Association and voted on by fans. Other awards are voted on a panel of journalists.\nFor the 2022–23 season, the league established a new Rookie of the Year award to be given to \"the top first-year player who has joined the league immediately following their collegiate career\". This was in contrast to the existing Newcomer of the Year award, which was from then on to be awarded to \"the top first-year player who has joined the league with prior professional experience\". The league also announced the new Outstanding Player of the Year award, to be voted on by members of the Premier Hockey Federation Players' Association, as well as the renaming of the Leading Scorer award to Offensive Player of the Year.\nMost Valuable Player\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
