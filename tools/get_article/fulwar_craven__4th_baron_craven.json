He became High Steward of Newbury, and was about to stand for Parliament for Berkshire when his brother William's death in 1739 brought him the Barony of Craven.\nHe was famously fond of racing and hunting, hunting on his Berkshire estates at Hamstead Marshall and Ashdown Park, keeping his own stud of racehorses and founding a racecourse at Lambourn. He and his brother William founded the Craven Hunt, and he appears in James Seymour's 1743 A Kill at Ashdown Park, a picture owned by the Craven family until 1968.\nWhen not hunting, Craven resided at Coombe Abbey, near Coventry in Warwickshire. He continued to hunt until his death at old Benham Park in 1764 after a long illness. He was buried at Hamstead Marshall, and being unmarried and childless, was succeeded by his nephew William.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999973&workid=13325&searchid=29231 A Kill at Ashdown Park]"
