Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band. It was released by Constellation Records in October 2001.\nThe title is drawn from the Book of Job: \"Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upwards\" (5:7). It could also be taken from Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, where the same passage is paraphrased.\n\"This Gentle Hearts Like Shot Bird's Fallen\" was used in the climax to the David Gordon Green film Snow Angels.\nThe album finds the band expanding from three members to six, with a similarly expanded name.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;The Silver Mt.
