A party of 1,500 Polish insurgents commanded by Marian Langiewicz and Antoni Jezioranski, heading towards the border with Austrian Galicia, clashed with a 400-strong unit of the Imperial Russian Army. The Poles, who had a numerical superiority, managed to defeat the enemy.\nThe skirmish began when Poles attacked Russian unit under Major Stozenwald, which camped at a cemetery in Skała. After a three-hour battle, the Russians retreated toward Miechów, leaving their supplies at the cemetery. Polish insurgents lost 23 men, with additional 24 wounded.\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe. Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1983. ."
