The coastline forms its eastern boundary. Eimeo Creek forms the south-east boundary. The largest residential area is along the sandy beachfront with a second residential area along the road to Mackay. The bulk of the locality is used for growing sugarcane and tropical fruit, while some of the locality (particularly surrounding the creeks) is left as swampy wetlands.\nThe beach has a northerly aspect with views to the Cumberland Islands. It is protected from strong winds and is one of Mackay's most popular beaches. The beach is a nesting site for the flatback turtle with an average of 16 nests each year.\nOffshore is Sunset Bay ().\nHistory\nIn 1874, Bucasia was originally called Marara but was later named Seaview. In 1938, it was decided that there were too many places called Seaview and so it was renamed Bucasia after Father Pierre-Marie (Paul) Bucas (born in 1840 in Saint-Jean-la-Poterie, Morbihan in France), the first Roman Catholic priest in Mackay.\nStarting in 1874, Father Bucas acquired  of land through  a series of purchases in present-day Bucasia, which he used to establish a community for displaced Aborigines. He also established the St Joseph's orphanage, operated by the Sisters of St Joseph until 1880, after which it was run by the Sisters of Mercy. In 1884, concerns about malaria resulted in the orphans being relocated in 1885 to the Meteor Park orphanage near Rockhampton (later known as Neerkol). The swamp in the west of the Bucasia locality is still known as Orphanage Swamp ().\nOver time, Bucasia developed as a holiday area but has now become a permanent residential area.\nBucasia State School opened on 29 January 1985.\nOn Sunday 2 October 1988, a monument to commemorate Bucas and his orphanage was unveiled at Seaview Park in Bucasia Esplanade, Bucasia ().\nIn 2008, the Mackay Regional Council constructed a waste water treatment plant in Bucasia, serving the northern suburbs. The two basin sequencing batch reactor can process up to 4 megalitres per day.\nIn 2015, illegal tree clearing occurred on Bucasia foreshore, a problem in many coastal communities where foreshore trees block residential views. The trees were planted to stabilise the dunes, protect the beach, and provide habitat for wildlife.\nDemographics\nIn the , the suburb of Bucasia had a population of 4,257 people.\nIn the , the suburb of Bucasia had a population of 4,771 people.\nIn the , the suburb of Bucasia had a population of 4,915 people.\nEducation\nBucasia State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 76 Kemp Street ().
