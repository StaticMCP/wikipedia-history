Each episode presents a cast of contestants with a challenge that combines baking with engineering, often described using the portmanteau \"bakineering\".\nThe first season of the series officially premiered on October 6, 2021, with judges Andrew Smyth (\"bakineering\" specialist), Joanne Chang (baking specialist), and Hakeem Oluseyi (engineering specialist). The show is presented by host Justin Willman.\nFormat\nThe contestants compete in pairs, for a grand prize of $100,000. Within each pair, one contestant specializes in baking, and the other specializes in engineering. Prior to the show, none of the pairs of contestants had met before.\nEach episode allows the contestant to work for up to 18 hours, after which their creations are stress tested and evaluated by the judges. At the end of each episode, one pair is voted off. The winning team of the episode gets an advantage in the next episode, such as being able to preview the stress test before the other teams, or being able to attempt the stress test more than once. Even such things as being immune to elimination for the next round.\nSeason 1\nContestants\n* Mario and Joey\n* Sierra and Edwin\n* Cindy and Taylor\n* Steve and Renee\n* Brandi and Menuka\n* Sara and Rodolfo\n* Nina and Hannah\n* Vanessa and Shanice\n* Randi and Jacob\nEpisodes\n| ShortSummary    =\nChallenge: Create a 2ft long sailboat that is remote-controllable, and must be cake-based and completely edible, other than steering mechanisms.\nStress Test:  Navigate a water course in 45 seconds.\nWinning Team: Cindy and Taylor\nEliminated Team: Sierra and Edwin\n| LineColor       = #64db88\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\nChallenge: Create an edible robot containing a jelly-filled dessert.\nStress Test: Navigate an obstacle course, featuring dessert-themed obstacles.\nWinning Team: Cindy and Taylor\nEliminated Team: Nina and Hannah\n| LineColor       = #64db88\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\nChallenge: Create an edible chain reaction machine, consisting of three simple machines and a large themed dessert.\nStress Test: Run the machine uninterrupted, such that it reveals the finale dessert at the end of the chain reaction.\nWinning Team: Sara and Rodolfo\nEliminated Team: Vanessa and Shanice\n| LineColor       = #64db88\n}}\n| ShortSummary    =\nChallenge: Create an edible mini golf course.
