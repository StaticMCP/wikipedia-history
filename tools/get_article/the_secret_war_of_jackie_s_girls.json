It is about female pilots who undertake secret missions in World War II. The pilot was directed by Gordon Hessler.\nCast\n*Lee Purcell\n*Mariette Hartley\n*Dee Wallace\nProduction\nThe success of ''Charlie's Angels in the 1976-77 ratings season prompted all the American TV networks to feature more sexy young women in action-orientated roles, either adding them to existing programs or introducing new shows that focused on them.  NBC picked up The Bionic Woman from ABC and also added young female characters to the 1977-78 seasons of Baa Baa Black Sheep and BJ and the Bear. They introduced several new shows with female sex symbol leads such as Quark, The Roller Girls and Who's Watching the Kids?, as well as commissioning pilots for several series which were direct imitations of Charlie's Angels: The Secret War of Jackie's Girls, The Hunted Lady and Cover Girls.\nReception\nThe Los Angeles Times'' said \"the aerial photography... is quite marvellous.\"\nReferences\nNotes\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20200125192350/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b768d50e6 Secret War of Jackie's Girls] at BFI"
