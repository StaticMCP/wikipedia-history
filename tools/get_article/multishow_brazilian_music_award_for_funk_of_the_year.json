      "text": "# Multishow Brazilian Music Award for Funk of the Year\n\n}}Multishow Brazilian Music Award for Funk of the Year is an annual award presented at the Multishow Brazilian Music Award, a ceremony established in 1994 and originally called the TVZ Award. The Funk of the Year category was created in 2023 as part of a reformulation of the Multishow Award Academy's guidelines. Previously, the Song of the Year award encompassed various musical genres within a single category. However, starting in 2023, this category was divided, giving rise to 11 new categories, each dedicated to a specific musical genre, including funk.\nThis change aimed to acknowledge the diversity of genres within Brazilian music and to provide greater visibility to popular styles like funk, which holds a significant place in the country's music scene. The Funk of the Year category highlights the most impactful songs within the genre, honoring artists who contribute to the evolution and popularity of funk in Brazil.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:5px;\" |Year\n! style=\"width:195px;\" |Winner(s)\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Nominees\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Ref.\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2023\n|\"Tá OK\" – Dennis and Kevin o Chris\n|\n* \"Faz um Vuk Vuk (Teto Espelhado)\" – Kevin o Chris\n* \"Funk Rave\" – Anitta\n* \"Namora Aí\" – MC Ryan SP, MC Daniel and Kotim\n* \"Novidade na Área\" – MC Livinho and DJ Matt D\n* \"Vai Novinha Ah, Ah, Ah\" – DJ Dyamante\n|\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2024\n| \"Joga pra Lua\" – Anitta, Dennis and Pedro Sampaio\n|\n* \"MTG Quem Não Quer Sou Eu\" – DJ Topo, MC Leozin, Seu Jorge and MC G15\n* \"Recadin No Espelho\" – Kevin o Chris and Luísa Sonza\n* \"Rolé na Favela de Nave\" – Oruam, Didi, DJ LC da Roça, MC K9, MC Smith and Mainstreet\n* \"Te Maceto Depois do Baile\" – DJ Zigão, DJ Lafon do Md, MC Rodrigo do CN and MC Rf\n* \"The Box Medley Funk 2\" – The Box, MC Brinquedo, MC Cebezinho, Mc Laranjinha, MC Tuto and DJ Oreia\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
