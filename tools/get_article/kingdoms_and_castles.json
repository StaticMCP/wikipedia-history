Players begin by placing down a castle on one of the game's islands, strategically placing it next to resources such as fertile land or iron deposits.

The peasants must be fed, which can be accomplished by building farms and granaries that store the food. Other buildings include foresters who cut and replant trees for lumber and quarries that can collect stone used to build larger homes. As the player progresses, they can begin taxing their peasants for gold, which can be used to pay workers and unlock new types of buildings.\nDisasters periodically happen in the kingdom, such as an annual winter that destroys crops, lightning strikes that cause fires, and infectious plagues. Occasionally, enemies such as dragons, vikings and ogres will attack the kingdom.
