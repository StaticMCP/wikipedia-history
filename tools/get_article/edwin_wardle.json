Nothing appears to be recorded about his youth career or his early playing days until he made his League debut on 15 September 1888.\n1888–1889 season\nEdwin Wardle, playing as one of the two winger', made his League debut on 15 September 1888 at Anfield, the then home of Everton. Notts County lost to the home team 2–1. When Edwin Wardle played as a winger against Everton on 15 September 1888 he was 18 years 248 days old; which made him, on the second weekend of League football, Notts County' youngest player. Edwin Wardle appeared in two of the 22 League matches played by Notts County in season 1888–89. Edwin Wardle played a more active role in the 1888–89 FA Cup.\n1889 onwards\nWardle left the club and retired from football (as far as the records show) early in the Spring of 1889.\nLife after football\nNothing is recorded as to what Wardle did after he left Notts County and there is no record of his death. It is possible that he left the United Kingdom and died abroad. However that is speculation.\nReferences"
