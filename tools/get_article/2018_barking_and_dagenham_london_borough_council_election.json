This was on the same day as other local elections. The Labour Party won every available council seat for the third election in a row, winning 74% of the popular vote. The Conservatives saw their vote share rise by 13 percentage points, but failed to win any seats.\nBackground\nAt the last election in May 2014, Labour won 52% of the vote share, and all 51 seats, but due to defections were reduced to 49 seats. Both Labour and the Conservatives stood candidates in all 17 wards, contesting all 51 seats. The BNP and the Greens were the only two other parties to field candidates, two and one respectively. An independent candidate also stood in Eastbrook. Despite gaining over 26% of the vote and coming second in all wards except Longbridge at the previous election, UKIP did not field any candidates.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"10\" | | access-date=2025-06-18}}\n}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Party\n! colspan=\"4\" | Councillors\n! colspan=\"4\" | Votes\n|-\n!\n!
