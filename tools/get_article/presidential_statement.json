Such statements are similar in content, format, and tone to resolutions, but are not legally binding.\nThe adoption of a Presidential Statement requires consensus, although Security Council members may abstain.  The Statement is signed by the sitting Security Council president.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/content/presidential-statements Presidential Statements of the Security Council]\n\n---\n\n## Presidential statement\n\n#REDIRECT United Nations Security Council#President"
