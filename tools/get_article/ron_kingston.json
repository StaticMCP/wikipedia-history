He was a member of what the historian Manning Clark called [http://markoconnor-australianpoet.blogspot.com.au/2016/03/a-glimpse-of-manning-clark-in-1990.html “that great half-back line of Lucas, Kingston, and Tuck”.] His spring and high-marking ability allowed him to hold the key position of center-half-back, even though he was 4 cm shorter than either of his flankers, Lucas and Tuck.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
