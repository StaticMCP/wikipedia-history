The channel was originally a joint-venture between Discovery Networks and TVN, but TVN left the venture in 2009. (Discovery later acquired Scripps, the owners of TVN.)\nIt is headed by Barbara Bilińska-Kępa.\nFrom its launch, the channel featured some Polish productions, such as Wielkie Ucieczki, Rozmowy niekontrolowane Macieja Szumowskiego, Historie z Karty and Archiwum X. Śledztwa po latach.\nOn 30 May 2009 TVN withdrew from the channel and sold its stake to Discovery Networks. Hence, the channel became fully owned by Discovery Networks Central Europe.\nBecause TVN was no longer associated with the channel and Discovery Networks has updated its corporate profile, the channel received a new logo on 1 October 2009. The new logo was created in-house by Discovery.\nDiscovery Historia used to be exclusively available on the satellite platform N, but that changed after TVN sold their share. The cable operator Jambox announced they would offer the channel in October 2009. Later in the same month it was launched on Multimedia Polska.\nLogos\nFile:Discovery Historia.svg|First Discovery Historia (TVN) logo used 2006-2009\nFile:Discovery Historia 2009.png|Second Discovery Historia logo used 2009-2016\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
