A spin-off of the Dynasty Warriors series, it was published outside Japan by Nintendo. It is the only installment in the series to be released for the Game Boy Advance as well as the first to not be released on a PlayStation console.\nCharacters\nDynasty Warriors Advance features a smaller roster of thirteen characters, a sharp decrease in comparison to the last home console title, Dynasty Warriors 5. Three members of each faction are available from the beginning of the game. Completing Musou Mode with any character from a particular faction will unlock the faction's leader as a playable character. Completing Musou Mode again with one of the faction leaders will unlock Lu Bu.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Wei\n!Wu\n!Shu\n!Other\n|-\n|Xiahou Dun\n|Sun Ce\n|Zhao Yun\n|Lu Bu (Unlockable)\n|-\n|Xu Zhu\n|Sun Shang Xiang\n|Guan Yu\n|\n|-\n|Zhen Ji\n|Zhou Yu\n|Zhang Fei\n|\n|-\n|Cao Cao (Unlockable)\n|Sun Jian (Unlockable)\n|Liu Bei (Unlockable)\n|\n|}\nReception\n| MC = 56/100\n| EuroG = 3/10\n| GI = 7/10\n| GamePro =\n| GSpot = 5.3/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 6.9/10\n| IGN = 4/10\n| NP = 7/10\n| NWR = 5/10\n| XPlay =\n| rev1 = Detroit Free Press\n| rev1Score =\n| rev2 = The Sydney Morning Herald\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nDynasty Warriors Advance received very mixed reviews upon release. IGN disliked the game, grading it 4 out of 10, criticizing the low number of on-screen enemies at any time, and the \"button-mashing\" gameplay. Nintendo Power, however, gave the game a 7 (out of 10), praising its replay value that \"ranks among the best\" on the Game Boy Advance system. The game currently has a score of 56 out of 100 at Metacritic, and 55% at GameRankings.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.koei.com Koei's Official site]\n* [http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/smusougba/ Official website of Japan]\n* [http://www.gamecity.com.tw/smusougba/ Official website of Taiwan]\n*"
