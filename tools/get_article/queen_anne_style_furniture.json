The chairs are attributed to William Savery.]]\nThe Queen Anne style of furniture design developed before, during, and after the time of Queen Anne, who reigned from 1702 to 1714.\nHistory and characteristics\nQueen Anne furniture is \"somewhat smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than its predecessors,\" and examples in common use include \"curving shapes, the cabriole leg, cushioned seats, wing-back chairs, and practical secretary desk-bookcase pieces.\" Other elements characterizing the style include pad feet and \"an emphasis on line and form rather than ornament.\" The style of Queen Anne's reign is sometimes described as late Baroque rather than \"Queen Anne.\"\nThe Queen Anne style began to evolve during the reign of William III of England (1689-1702), but the term predominantly describes decorative styles from the mid-1720s to around 1760, although Queen Anne reigned earlier (1702-1714). \"The name 'Queen Anne' was first applied to the style more than a century after it was fashionable.\" The use of Queen Anne styles in America, beginning in the 1720s and 1730s, coincided with new colonial prosperity and increased immigration of skilled British craftsmen to the colonies. Some elements of the Queen Anne style remain popular in modern furniture production.\nCurved lines, in feet, legs, arms, crest rails, and pediments, along with restrained ornament (often in a shell shape) emphasizing the material, are characteristic of Queen Anne style.  In contrast to William and Mary furniture, which was marked by rectilinearity (straight lines) and use of curves for decoration, Queen Anne furniture uses C-scroll, S-scrolls, and ogee (S-curve) shapes in the structure of the furniture itself. In sophisticated urban environments, walnut was a frequent choice for furniture in the Queen Anne style, superseding the previously dominant oak and leading to the era being called \"the age of walnut.\" However, poplar, cherry, and maple were also used in Queen Anne style furniture.\n, London, c. 1740 (Art Institute of Chicago)]]\nOrnamentation is minimal, in contrast to earlier 17th-century and William and Mary styles, which prominently featured inlay, figured veneers, paint, and carving. The cabriole leg is the \"most recognizable element\" of Queen Anne furniture. Cabriole legs were influenced by the designs of the French cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle and the Rococo style from the French court of Louis XV. But the intricate ornamentation of post-Restoration furniture was abandoned in favor of more conservative designs, possibly under the influence of the simple and elegant lines of imported Chinese furniture.\nWhen decorative motifs or other ornamentation are used in Queen Anne-style furniture, it is often limited to carved scallop or shell or scroll-shaped motifs (sometimes in relief form and often found on the crest and knees), broken and C-curves, and acanthus leaves. The use of japanning is an exception to the general Queen Anne trend of minimal ornament. When used, japanned decoration was frequently in red, green, or gilt on a blue-green field.\nThe tilt-top tea table on a tripod was first made during the \"Queen Anne\" (in reality George II) period in the 1730s.\nQueen Anne eventually was eclipsed by the later Chippendale style; late Queen Anne and early Chippendale pieces are very similar, and the two styles are often identified with each together.\nGallery\nArmchair MET DP-14061-187.jpg|Armchair, British, circa 1710\nArmchair MET DP-14061-170.jpg|Armchair, British, circa 1710\nPair of stools MET DP-14061-099.jpg|Stool, British, circa 1710\nSide chair MET DP-14061-142.jpg|Side chair, British, circa 1710–20\nSide Chair MET 85D ACF135R8.jpg|Side Chair, American, 1710–20\nArmchair MET DP-14061-157.jpg|Armchair, British, circa 1720\nSettee MET DP-14061-207.jpg|Settee, British, circa 1720\nSide chair (one of a pair) MET DP-14204-079.jpg|Side chair, British, circa 1730\nArmchair MET DP-14129-053.jpg|Armchair, British, circa 1730\nChair MET DP-14204-021.jpg|Chair, British, circa 1730–40\nChest of Drawers MET DP110113.jpg|High Chest of Drawers, American, 1730–40\nQueen Anne Burl Walnut Veneered Dressing Table MET DP265171.jpg|Dressing table, American, 1730–60\nSide Chair MET DP222432.jpg|Side Chair, American, 1730–90\nSide table MET DP-14204-109.jpg|Side table, British, circa 1735\nCard table MET DP-14129-080.jpg|Card table, British, circa 1735\nSide chair MET DP-14204-155.jpg|Side chair, British, circa 1735–40\nSide Chair MET DP363206.jpg|Side chair, American, 1735–60\nArmchair MET 85D ACF138R8.jpg|Armchair, American, 1735–60\nArmchair MET DP-14129-066.jpg|Armchair, British, circa 1740\nDressing Table MET DT3772.jpg|Dressing Table, American, 1740–50\nHigh chest of drawers MET DT258435.jpg|High chest of drawers, American, 1740–60\nSettee MET DT340532.jpg|Settee, American, 1740–60\nSide Chair MET DP222430.jpg|Side Chair, American, 1740–60\nSquare Tea Table MET DT235357.jpg|Square Tea Table, American, 1740–60\nArmchair MET DT340531.jpg|Armchair, American, 1740–60\nQueen Anne Carved Cherrywood Side Chair MET DP265159.jpg|Side chair, American, 1740–60\nHigh chest MET DP374258.jpg|High chest, American, Maker: Christopher Townsend (1701–1773), 1748\nHigh Chest of Drawers MET DP108631.jpg|High Chest of Drawers, American, 1750–90\nQueen Anne Carved Mahogany Side Chair MET DP265158.jpg|Side chair, American, 1755–75\nEasy Chair MET DP108633.jpg|Easy Chair, American, 1758\nReferences\nExternal links"
