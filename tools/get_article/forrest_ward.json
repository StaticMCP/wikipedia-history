In 1967 Ward won the New York Golden Gloves Heavyweight Open Championship after beating Thomas Connelly in the finals.  Later that year Ward won the Pan American Heavyweight Championship. Ward won the 1967 National AAU Heavyweight Championship, beating Clay Hodges by a split decision in the semifinals and Ken Norton in the finals.\nPro career\nWard had a disappointing and short career as a professional, which began in 1967 after a banner year as an amateur propelled him to professional territory. After six professional fights, he stepped up in class to face Chuck Wepner in 1968 and lost after being dropped three times in the 7th round, triggering a three knockdown stoppage.  After four consecutive wins, he faced Bill Drover and lost via a technical knockout. Ward retired after the loss.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.mediastorehouse.com.au/fine-art-storehouse/bettmann-archive/forrest-lee-ward-39067407.html American amateur boxer Forrest Lee Ward, aged 18, striking a pose during training at the 28th Street Gym in New York, August 16th 1967.]"
