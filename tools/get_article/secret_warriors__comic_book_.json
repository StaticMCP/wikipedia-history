The title has been used for two comic book series focusing on two separate teams of young superpowered characters.\nPublication history\n2009 series\nThe original team which was featured in the first Secret Warriors series was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev in Mighty Avengers #13, and debuted as a team in Secret Invasion #3, both published in 2008 and then featured in their own ongoing series. This series was co-plotted by Bendis with Jonathan Hickman writing. and was one of the titles launching as part of the Dark Reign storyline. The series was promoted by a series of passwords and clues given in solicitations for upcoming issues. A Marvel spokesman stated that further passwords would be released for the website later on.\n2017 series\nIn November 2016 Marvel announced that there would be a new incarnation of the series featuring a new young cast of heroes. The new team consists of Kamala Khan, Lunella Lafayette, Devil Dinosaur, Inferno, Karnak and Quake. The first issue was released on May 10, 2017.\nIn December 2017 it was announced that the current run of Secret Warriors would be cancelled after its 12th issue. This outcome was foreshadowed in the comic itself, by the last panel on the final page of issue #12: as Karnak rides off into the night upon Devil Dinosaur, the issue closes with the inscription “''The Secret Warriors will return... Someday. Maybe.
