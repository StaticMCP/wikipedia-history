It is exceeded only by \"Eyes of a Stranger\".\nTrack listing\n;7\" single\n;12\" single\n;CD single\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1990–91)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n| Australia (ARIA Charts)|| align=\"center\" | 150\n|-\n||UK Singles || align=\"center\" |61\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock ||align=center|22\n|}\nPersonnel\n*Geoff Tate – vocals\n*Michael Wilton – lead guitar\n*Chris DeGarmo – rhythm guitar\n*Eddie Jackson – bass\n*Scott Rockenfield – drums\nAdditional personnel\n*Randy Gane – message left on answering machine\nReferences"
