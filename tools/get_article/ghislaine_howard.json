Her father was an actor, Martin Dobson, and her mother, Maureen, a nurse.\nEarly promise as an artist lead to her taking art classes with Harold Riley. Her art studies included a foundation course at Manchester Polytechnic and a degree in Fine Art at the University of Newcastle, where she shared a flat with Debbie Horsfield\nExhibitions\nShe first came to the attention  of the wider art world in 1993 with \"A Shared Experience\" at Manchester City Art Gallery, an exhibition which looked at pregnancy and childbirth and garnered critical praise.\nLiverpool's Capital of Culture status in 2008 led the artist to produce a major new work \"The Empty Tomb\" which was unveiled by the Bishop of Liverpool on Easter Sunday 2008.\nThis was followed by the equally acclaimed \"Ghislaine Howard 365\" at the Imperial War Museum North, an exhibition which group together 365 small canvases, one for each day of the year, in which she depicted a news event of the day.\nShe has shown her large cycle of paintings The Stations of The Cross / The Captive Figure at the two Liverpool Cathedrals at Canterbury Cathedral as part of an ongoing tour of cathedral cities in UK. Her 25 foot high Visitation Altarpiece can be seen in Trinity Chapel at Liverpool Hope University.\nIn 2013, her drawing Pregnant Self Portrait was at the centre of the British Museum's exhibition, an examination of the development of western art. British Museum curator Jill Cook said the drawing had proved of the most thought-provoking in an exhibition that included Henry Moore, Matisse and Picasso.\nShe has featured in numerous publications and television documentaries including Mischa Scorer's \"Degas: An Old Man Mad about Art\", 1996 and  \"Degas and the Dance\" in 2004, which was awarded the prestigious international Peabody Award.\nOn 11 May 2020, Ghislaine Howard opened her collection at Elliot House, 151 Deansgate, Manchester, M3 3WD.
