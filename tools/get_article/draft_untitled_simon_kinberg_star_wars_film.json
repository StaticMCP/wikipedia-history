Produced by Lucasfilm and set to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, the film will be part of the Star Wars franchise and the first installment in a new trilogy.\nKinberg was set to write and produce a new trilogy of Star Wars films in November 2024.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nSimon Kinberg closed a deal in November 2024 to write a new trilogy of Star Wars films and produce them with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Kinberg previously co-created the animated series Star Wars Rebels (2014–2018) with Lucasfilm creative executive Carrie Beck and chief creative officer Dave Filoni, and his relationship with the pair was a factor in his hiring. He also consulted on the film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Mike Fleming Jr of Deadline Hollywood reported that the trilogy would comprise Episode X, XI, and XII of the main \"Skywalker Saga\" film series, which concluded with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—also known as Episode IX—in 2019. Lucasfilm insiders disputed this claim and said Kinberg's trilogy would begin \"a new saga\" following new characters. Journalist Jeff Sneider also believed the new trilogy would be positioned as Episode X, XI, and XII. Daisy Ridley was reported to potentially be reprising her role as Rey from the Star Wars sequel trilogy, taking on the mentorship role held by Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in previous films, and commentators questioned what this meant for a planned spin-off film from director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy that was set to feature Ridley in a similar role. At the time Kinberg's deal was revealed, the films were in early development and it was unclear when production would begin. Lucasfilm was surprised when the news broke due to the trilogy being \"in deep development and not nearly ready to be made public\".\nIn February 2025, Kennedy said they were \"rolling fast and furiously\" on the new trilogy. She said Kinberg had quickly segued back into the franchise and his initial work had gone \"exceptionally well\". Kinberg had begun writing the scripts and Kennedy expected to see something from him around June of that year. She said Kinberg's films would be \"the next iteration, the new saga that moves us into the future\".\nFuture\nWhen Kinberg's deal was revealed, he was expected to write and produce all three films in the trilogy.\n}}\nExternal links\n*  Star Wars }}"
