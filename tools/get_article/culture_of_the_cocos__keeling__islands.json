Many of these islanders trace their descent from the original planation workers brought to the island by John Clunies-Ross. During much of their habitation, the islands were isolated, leading to the development of a unique culture derived from Malay and Islamic traditions.\nWhen the Islands were fully integrated into Australia in 1984, it was introduced to the customs and culture of Mainland Australia, practiced predominantly by the ethnically European Australians who inhabit West Island.\nAll Islanders are governed by Australian law. Language, gazetted holidays, education, media and cuisine are also influenced by mainland Australia.\nArt and traditional crafts\nThe Islands have a strong history of art and traditional crafts influenced by Cocos Malay traditions and Australian surf culture. The Islands' tourism office encourages visitors to try their hand at traditional basket weaving and \"learn about traditional jukong (boat) building\".\nMuseums\nOn Home Island, residents have established a museum dedicated to the Islands' former copra industry and an art gallery, The Big Barge Art Centre, which sells traditional artworks, modern paintings and photographic works and hosts art workshops for tourists.\nThe Pulu Cocos Museum was established in 1987, in recognition of the fact that the distinct culture of Home Island needed formal preservation. The site includes the displays on local culture and traditions, as well as the early history of the islands and their ownership by the Clunies-Ross family. The museum also includes displays on military and naval history, as well as local botanical and zoological items.\nReligion\nIn the , 75% of the population was Muslim. Eid AlFitr (at the end of Ramadan) remains the Islands' \"biggest event\" of the year.\nThe majority of the remaining population consider themselves non-religious (13.4%) with small Christian including Anglican (3.5%) and Catholic (1.5%). 6.5% of the population chose not to state their religion.\nHolidays\nOn 6 April of each year, the Islanders celebrate Self-Determination Day, marking the date in which they voted for full integration into Australia.\nSee also\n*Culture of Australia\n*John Ross, King of Cocos Islands\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_FtAAAAMAAJ& The Cocos (Keeling) Islands: Australian atolls in the Indian Ocean] by Pauline Bunce (Jacaranda Press, 1988)\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=5sJV2XoBz5oC& Local Economic and Employment Development Culture and Local Development] by the OECD (OECD Publishing, 2005)"
