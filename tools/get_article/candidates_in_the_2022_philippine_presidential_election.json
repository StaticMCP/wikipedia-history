On September 8, the duo announced their candidacies for the upcoming election.\n*Faisal Mangondato (Katipunan ng Kamalayang Kayumanggi)\n*Bongbong Marcos (PFP), former senator\n**By January 2020, Marcos confirmed that he is running \"for a national position\" in 2022, although he did not specify which position. By September 2020, Marcos's sister Imee said that her brother was still noncommittal to which position he'd run for. A year later, Marcos himself confirmed that \"The presidency is not taken off the table.\" On September 21, the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP; ) nominated Marcos to run for president. If Marcos accepts, he will be inducted as a member of the party and be made its chairman. During the national convention of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL; ) in Binangonan, the party founded by his father, he was nominated as the party's candidate for president. Marcos, who remained a member of the Nacionalista Party, thanked KBL for the nomination, but said that he will announce his plans \"when the time comes.\" On October 5, Marcos announced his presidential candidacy. Marcos then resigned from the Nacionalistas and was sworn in at the PFP chairman. Marcos ultimately filed his presidential candidacy under the PFP.\n*Jose Montemayor Jr. (DPP)\n*Isko Moreno (Aksyon), incumbent mayor of Manila\n**At the start of 2021, pollster Pulse Asia published an opinion poll showing Moreno in second place for president, and statistically tied for first with President Duterte in the vice presidential race. The 1Sambayan convenors group then included Moreno as one of the people they are choosing to run for president. Moreno begged off, as he was concentrating on his mayoral duties. By June, Moreno informed them that they are declining their offer. On September, Moreno was named president of Aksyon Demokratiko, the party founded by the late Raul Roco. Moreno announced his candidacy on September 22; his running mate will be Dr. Willie Ong.\n*Manny Pacquiao (PROMDI), incumbent senator\n** Boxing promoter Bob Arum said in June 2020 that Pacquiao told him that he'd run for president instead of defending his Senate seat in 2022. A few days later, Pacquiao denied talking to Arum about politics. A year after that, sports official and former Bacolod mayor and representative Monico Puentebella said that Pacquiao is running for president, and that he was authorized by the latter to talk about politics. In September 2021, Pacquiao said that he only have three options in politics: run for president, run for reelection in the Senate, or retire from politics altogether. On September 19, he accepted the nomination of the PDP-Laban faction led by senator Koko Pimentel. On October 1, 2021, Pacquiao filed his certificate of candidacy for the presidency under PROMDI, the party founded by the late Cebu governor Lito Osmeña.\n*Leni Robredo (Independent), the current Vice President of the Philippines\n**On September 30, 2021, 1Sambayan coalition (the coalition of the opposition), nominated Robredo for as their standard bearer. According to Armin Luistro, one of the conveyor of 1Sambayan, Robredo accepted the nomination and will file her candidacy on October 5. Robredo's spokesman clarified that she hasn't accepted a decision yet, but will make a decision on this before October 8.  On October 7, Robredo accepted the nomination and announced she will run for president. She later filed her certificate of candidacy on the same day as an independent. Robredo explained that she is running as an independent to show that she is open to making alliances.\nCandidates for vice president\nFile:Rep.

In a statement, Laban ng Masa said it wants to \"push for an ambitious platform that focuses on the poor, prioritizes the neglected, and fights for the rights of ordinary Filipinos.\" Bello's group sought talks with Vice President Robredo's backers for three months but were ignored. This caused them to support Leody de Guzman's presidential candidacy, instead. On October 20, Bello decided to run for the vice-presidency, replacing Raquel Castillo, who had been Guzman's running mate.\n* Rizalito David (DPP)\n*Sara Duterte (Lakas), incumbent mayor of Davao City\n** On July 9, 2021, Duterte said that she is open to run for president.

When asked if he is mocking the election for serving as a placeholder for Davao City mayor Sara Duterte, dela Rosa said \"I won as a senator, number 5,\"  who did win in 2019 for senator. Dela Rosa later said that this has long been planned, but they were hiding it because it would've been criticized if it was revealed earlier. Days later, Dela Rosa revealed that he received a call from Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi that they have chosen him as the standard bearer two hours before the deadline as he is the only one who can continue the president's legacy. Dela Rosa also said that he can give way if Mayor Duterte decides to run.
