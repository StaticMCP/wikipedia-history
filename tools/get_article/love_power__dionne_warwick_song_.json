It was written and produced by Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager for Warwick's studio album, Reservations for Two (1987), and features an appearance by Kenny G playing the alto sax solo. Released as its lead single, it became Warwick's sixth number-one hit on the  US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. The track also reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Love Power\" marked her final appearance in the top 40 on the latter chart. For Osborne, \"Love Power\" was his  only number-one Adult Contemporary hit, and it would be his last appearance in the Billboard Hot 100 top 40 as well, since \"She's On the Left,\" his only number-one R&B hit, would only reach number 48 on that same chart the following year.  In 1994, heavy metal singers Glenn Danzig and Lita Ford sang a cover version of the song during the 1994 Grammy Awards ceremony.\nTrack listings\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 4:32\n| title2          = No One in the World\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          = Barry Manilow\n| length2         = 3:33\n| title3          = In a World Such as This\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 4:16\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits lifted from the liner notes of Reservations for Two.\nMusicians\n* Dionne Warwick – lead vocals\n* Jeffrey Osborne – lead vocals\n* Kenny G – alto saxophone solo\n* Greg Phillinganes – keyboards\n* David Foster – synthesizers\n* Burt Bacharach – additional synthesizers\n* Robbie Buchanan – additional synthesizers\n* David Boruff – synthesizer programming\n* Dann Huff – guitars\n* Nathan East – bass\n* Carlos Vega – drums\n* Tim Feehan – backing vocals\n* Joe Pizzulo – backing vocals\nProduction\n* Clive Davis – executive producer\n* Burt Bacharach – producer\n* Carole Bayer Sager – producer\n* Frank DeCaro – musical contractor\n* Mick Guzauski – engineer, mixing\n* Daren Klein – additional engineer\n* Tommy Vicari – additional engineer\n* Marnie Riley – assistant engineer\n* Gary Wagner – assistant engineer\n* Bernie Grundman – mastering\n* Maude Gilman – art direction\n* Ann Petter – design\n* Harry Langdon – photography\n* Luiz Archer – fashion stylist\n* Clifford Peterson – hairdresser\n* Wynona Price – make–up\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1987)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada RPM Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100\n|11\n|}\nReferences"
