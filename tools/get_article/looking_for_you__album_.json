The band released a music video for the title track in early 2020.\nThis album has more emphasis on keyboards and vocals than any of the band's previous albums. This new stylistic direction for the band has been referred to as \"ABBA-metal\". The immense popularity of their cover of that group's hit single \"Lay All Your Love on Me\" has led to fans suggesting an ABBA cover album, an idea that would serve as the basis for their next album, Take a Chance – A Metal Tribute to ABBA.\nTrack listing\n# \"United\" – 3:44\n# \"Eternal Fire Burning\" – 4:18\n# \"Looking For You\" – 3:38\n# \"Two Blades\" – 3:43\n# \"Symphony No.1, Pt.3:Awakening\" – 6:00\n# \"Go For A Ride\" – 3:56\n# \"Butterfly\" – 3:37\n# \"Universe\" – 3:47\n# \"Lay All Your Love on Me\" (ABBA cover) – 3:56\n# \"Au Revoir\" – 2:05\nPersonnel\nAmberian Dawn\n*Tuomas Seppälä – keyboards, guitars\n*Joonas Pykälä-aho – drums\n*Emil \"Emppu\" Pohjalainen – guitars\n*Päivi \"Capri\" Virkkunen – vocals\n*Jukka Hoffren – bass\nProduction\n*Emil Pohjalainen – mixing\n*Karri Harju – photography\n*Emil Pohjalainen – mastering\n*Jan Yrlund – artwork, layout\nReferences"
