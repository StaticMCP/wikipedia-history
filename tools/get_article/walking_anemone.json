It is the only member of its genus, Preactis.\nDescription\nThe walking anemone is an unusual looking anemone, which may grow to up to 6&nbsp;cm in diameter and 30&nbsp;cm in length. It has papillae covering its whole body column. Scarlet lines radiate outwards from the mouth and can be seen on the body between papillae. The background colour of the body is pale. Juveniles are pale or white in colour and have protruding rounded swellings on their bodies instead of papillae.\nDistribution\nThis anemone has only been found on both sides of the Cape Peninsula in South Africa. It is endemic to this area. It has been found from 10 to 30&nbsp;m underwater.\nEcology\nThis anemone 'walks' rather like a leech does, by creeping. It is usually found on vertical rock walls, although it may sometimes be found on sand patches. It is a voracious predator of the multicoloured sea fan, Acabaria rubra, and is often found eating these animals, which it consumes down to the skeletal support.\nReferences"
