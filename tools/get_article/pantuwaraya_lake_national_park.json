The park covers an area of 20 hectares comprising Lake Pantao Raya and the surrounding area. It was declared a national park in 1965 by virtue of Republic Act No. 4190.\nThe park's location in the Lake Lanao-Agus River Watershed Area makes it an important site for conservation efforts. This area supplies much of the region's water and powers the Agus Hydroelectric Power Plant that provides 70% of Mindanao's electricity. The park is accessible via the Iligan-Marawi road which also contains other important lakes and reservoirs in its vicinity including Basak Lake, Laguna de Calaganan, Talao Lake and Agus Lake.\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of national parks of the Philippines"
