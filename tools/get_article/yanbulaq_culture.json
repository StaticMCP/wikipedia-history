It was a Bronze Age culture, or an early Iron Age culture.\nThe cemetery at Yanbulaq contained 29 mummies which dated from 1100 to 500 BCE, 21 of which are Asian—the earliest Asian mummies found in the Tarim Basin—and the remaining 8 are of the same Caucasian physical type as found at Qäwrighul. These later and eastern \"Tarim mummies\" represented both \"Caucasoid\" and \"Mongoloid\" remains, indicating contact between newly arrived western nomads and agricultural communities in the east.\nThe Yuezhi may have been positioned around the Shirenzigou culture area, between the Subeshi culture to their west, the Yanbulaq culture to their east, the aftermaths of the Chemurchek culture to the north, and a wide desertical area to south about a thousand kilometers away from the Central Plains of China. It may also have had contacts with the painted pottery Bronze Age cultures in the Gansu and Qinghai regions.\nArchaeological finds of iron knives suggest that the Yanbulaq culture, as well as the Shajing culture further south, may have been instrumental in the transmission of iron technology to China.\nThe Yanbulaq culture waned after 500 BCE.\nThe site has been on the list of monuments of the People's Republic of China (5-189) since 2001 .\nReferences\nSources\n* Zhang Ping (among others): “Xinjiang Hami Yanbulake mudi” (The Yanbulake Cemetery in Hami, Xinkiang).
