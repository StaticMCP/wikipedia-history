Initially they only came out to mark events of great interest, but since the turn of the millennium have been minted yearly.\nUntil decimalisation crowns (five shilling coins) were used for this purpose as they were the highest denomination of the time, but due to inflation this role has been transferred to higher value coins.\nCrowns, £5 coins and (until 1996) £2 coins are non-circulating, although they are still legal tender. These denominations are only used for commemoratives. During the decimal era, crowns were converted to twenty-five pence.\n50p and £2 coins made after 1996 circulate normally and can be found in change. Usually about 5 million of each of these are the commemorative issue, the rest being of the standard design.\nSince 1982 all of these have also been produced as sterling silver and 22 carat gold proofs.\nAlthough the design of the old round £1 coin changed every year, these are not considered to be commemoratives, as they do not mark an event or its anniversary.\nCrowns\n* 1935: Silver Jubilee of George V\n* 1937: Coronation of George VI\n* 1951: Festival of Britain\n* 1953: Coronation of The Queen\n* 1960: British Trade Fair in New York City\n* 1965: Death of Winston Churchill, former Prime Minister\nTwenty-five pence\n* 1972: Silver Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh\n* 1977: Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II\n* 1980: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's 80th Birthday.\n* 1981: Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer\nFive pounds\n* 1990: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's 90th Birthday\n* 1993: 40th Anniversary of Coronation of The Queen\n* 1996: The Queen's 70th Birthday\n* 1997: Golden Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh\n* 1998: The Prince of Wales' 50th Birthday\n* 1999: Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial\n* 1999/2000: Millennium\n* 2000: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's 100th Birthday\n* 2001: Queen Victoria Centenary of death\n* 2002: Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II\n* 2002: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Memorial\n* 2003: 50th Anniversary of Coronation of The Queen\n* 2004: Entente Cordiale Centenary (Peace treaty between Britain and France)\n* 2005: Bicentenary of Battle of Trafalgar and Admiral Lord Nelson (2 coins)\n* 2006: 80th Birthday of The Queen\n* 2007: Diamond Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh\n* 2008: 60th Birthday of The Prince of Wales.\n* 2008: 450th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth I.\n* 2009: The 500th anniversary of the accession of Henry VIII.\n* 2009: Three years until the 2012 London Olympics, swimming\n* 2010: 350th anniversary of the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II\n* 2010: Two years until the 2012 London Olympic Games, athletics\n* 2011: The 90th birthday of The Duke of Edinburgh\n* 2011: Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton\n* 2011: One Year until the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic games, cycling\n* 2012: Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II\n* 2012: London 2012 Olympics\n* 2012: London 2012 Paralympics\n* 2013: 60th Anniversary of the Queen's Coronation\n* 2013: The Royal Christening of HRH Prince George of Cambridge\n* 2014: The 300th Anniversary of the Death of Queen Anne\n* 2015: The 50th anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill\n* 2015: The 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo\n* 2015: The Royal Birth of HRH Princess Charlotte of Cambridge\n* 2015: Longest reigning monarch -
