It can grow up to , but on average attains a length of  with a snout-vent (body) length of . The tail length can be equal to the length of the body from snout to the anus (SVL or Snout-Vent Length).\nIn 2004, the species was synonymized with Lygodactylus picturatus.\nThe yellow-headed dwarf gecko has a defense mechanism called tail autotomy, where they drop their tails to flee to safety when they are attacked by a predator. However, tail autotomy only gives the gecko an immediate benefit to escape because an autotomized gecko is slower without its tail and has difficulty running on vertical surfaces. Eggs can be found in places that are secure from predators.\nReferences\n* Broadley, D. G. & HOWELL, K. M. (1991). A checklist of the reptiles of Tanzania, with synoptic keys.
