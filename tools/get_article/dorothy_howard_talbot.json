After a brief acting career as Dorothy Langton, she married the musical theatre composer Howard Talbot in 1910 and left the stage. She worked in stage management during the First World War in the West End. From the 1920s to the 1950s, she was hired to direct musicals and light opera for amateur operatic and dramatic societies, at a time when there were few women performing this role.\nEarly life\nDorothy was born in Dersingham, Norfolk, the oldest daughter of Arthur Harry Cross, who was organist at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham, from 1878 until his death in 1906. Her early education was at the West Norfolk and Lynn High School for Girls. She studied at RADA for three terms during 1908, and while there she met the dramatist W. S. Gilbert.\nShe performed on the stage for a few years, using the stage name Dorothy Langton, but gave up acting after her marriage in 1910 to Howard Talbot, a composer of music for Edwardian musical comedy. She then coached for Charles Hawtry's productions.\nDuring the first world war she assisted in stage management at the Adelphi Theatre, London, at which her husband was conductor.\nTheatre director\nAfter her husband died of lung disease in 1928, Talbot enrolled with the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA), which enabled her to stage musical plays. She also lectured on courses that NODA organised.\nTalbot staged light operas, musicals and plays for the societies listed in the table below, amongst many others. She thought it best to rehearse amateur casts for 4-5 weeks before a production, with a dress rehearsal on the Sunday before opening, which was a departure from the earlier practise among amateur British societies, to avoid Sunday rehearsals.\nIn 1953 she decided to focus on directing and acting in Nottingham where she lived for the last years of her life.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |Bletchingley and District Amateur Operatic Society\n! colspan=\"2\" |Newton Abbot Dramatic Society\n! colspan=\"2\" |Bury St Edmunds Amateur Operatic and Dramatic Society\n! colspan=\"2\" |Lincoln Thespians Operatic and Dramatic Society\n|-\n!Musical/Opera\n!Year\n!Musical/Opera\n!Year\n!Musical/Opera\n!Year\n!Musical/Opera\n!Year\n|-\n|Patience\n|1925\n|Chu Chin Chow\n|1939\n|The Belle of New York\n|1948\n|The Arcadians\n|1930\n|-\n|The Gondoliers\n|1926\n|Miss Hook of Holland\n|1947\n|Show Boat\n|1949\n|My Lady Frayle\n|1931\n|-\n|The Mikado\n|1927\n|The Rebel Maid\n|1948\n! colspan=\"2\" |Torquay Operatic Society\n|The Geisha\n|1934\n|-\n|Ruddigore\n|1929\n|The Geisha\n|1949\n|Ruddigore\n|1949\n|The Maid of the Mountains\n|1936\n|-\n|A Chinese Honeymoon\n|1933\n|A Country Girl\n|1950\n|The Pirates of Penzance; Trial by Jury\n|1950\n! colspan=\"2\" |West Bridgford Amateur Operatic Society\n|-\n|The Belle of Brittany\n|1935\n|\n|\n|Utopia, Limited\n|1951\n|Ruddigore\n|1953\n|-\n|Iolanthe\n|1936\n|\n|\n|Waltz Times\n|1952\n|Patience\n|1955\n|-\n|Princess Ida\n|1937\n|\n|\n|The Mikado\n|1953\n|The Pirates of Penzance; Cox and Box\n|1956\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |Southport Orpheus Operatic Society\n! colspan=\"2\" |Cooperative Arts Centre Nottingham\n|-\n!Musical/Opera\n!Year\n!Opera/Play\n!Year\n|-\n|Madame Pompadour\n|1934\n|Before the Flood\n|1956\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |East Surrey Amateur Operatic and Dramatic Society\n|Dear Charles\n|1958\n|-\n|Veronique\n|1923\n|''L'elisir d'amore\n|1958\n|-\n|H.M.S.

The opera was performed for the first time by the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society at the Scala Theatre in London on 24 April 1928.\nShe also lectured regularly in drama courses held at the Nottingham Co-operative Arts Centre and other venues and wrote a book about stage makeup.\nDuring the second world war Talbot worked as a full time warden in Chelsea and also directed a play, The Dark Lady'', with a new theatre club called the Carlyle Players, which she helped to found.\nReferences"
