The hall was constructed to commemorate the Delhi Durbar of 1911, which marked the formal coronation of George V as Emperor of India and the announcement of shifting the imperial capital from Calcutta to Delhi.\nHistory\nThe hall was inaugurated on 16 January 1915 by Arthur Enfield Taylor . It was intended to serve both civic and cultural purposes, providing a space for public meetings, performances, and social events. The construction of the hall coincided with a period of rapid urban planning and infrastructure development in Robertsonpet, which was designed to support the growing population of KGF, one of India’s earliest industrial mining settlements.\nArchitecture\nKing George Hall was designed in a Victorian architectural style, incorporating large canopies, arched facades, and a symmetrical layout. The building is surrounded by a landscaped garden with expansive lawns, reflecting the civic design preferences of British colonial architecture.\nFunctions\nApart from serving as a civic meeting space, King George Hall housed the \"King George Hall Cosmopolitan Club,\" which was modeled after the elite KGF Club at nearby Oorgaum. The club aimed to promote the physical, moral, and intellectual development of the local community. It offered a reading room and facilities for tennis, badminton, billiards, snooker, cards, and carrom.\nThe hall was also used to host dramatic performances, musical concerts, and theatrical productions. It had strict codes of conduct-gambling and intoxicants were banned, and members were prohibited from bringing dogs into the premises.\nLegacy\nToday, King George Hall is considered an enduring symbol of the colonial civic and social infrastructure of KGF. It stands as a notable example of British town planning in southern India and continues to serve as a venue for local cultural events. The structure contributes to the heritage landscape of the Kolar Gold Fields, alongside other colonial-era buildings such as the KGF Club and mining bungalows.\nSee also\n* Kolar Gold Fields\n* Robertsonpet\n* Bharat Gold Mines Limited\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.children-of-bangalore.com/kgf.htm Info on KGF & Anglo-Indian Community]"
