The season officially started on May 15, 1997, in the Eastern Pacific—designated as the area east of 140°W—and on June 1, 1997, in the Central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W. The season officially ended in both basins on November 30, 1997. These dates typically limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, has been included.\nThe first storm formed on June 1 and the final storm crossed into the western Pacific on December 6, thus ending the season. There were 24 cyclones in both the eastern and central Pacific, including 5 unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific; 8 peaked at tropical storm intensity, while 10 reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category&nbsp;3 intensity or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the Western Pacific.\nActivity in the Central Pacific was above average; two tropical storms formed in addition to several tropical depressions. Some of the storms entered the region from the east. The 1997 season was the fourth-most active in the Central Pacific since satellite observations began. Nine tropical cyclones entered or formed in the region during that period.\nTimeline of events\nMay\nMay 15\n* The 1997 Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 1997 Central Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, May&nbsp;31) at Tropical Depression  forms from an area of unsettled weather about 345&nbsp;mi (555&nbsp;km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.\nJune 2\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;PDT) at Tropical Depression  strengthens into Tropical Storm Andres about 330&nbsp;mi (530&nbsp;km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.\nJune 4\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;PDT) at Tropical Storm Andres reaches its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , about 130&nbsp;mi (215&nbsp;km) southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.\nJune 6\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;5) at Tropical Storm Andres weakens into a tropical depression about 120&nbsp;mi (195&nbsp;km) south-southwest of San Salvador.\nJune 7\n*01:00&nbsp;UTC (6:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;6) at Tropical Depression Andres makes landfall about 45&nbsp;mi (75&nbsp;km) southeast of San Salvador with sustained winds of 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) and a barometric pressure of .\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;6) at Tropical Depression Andres dissipates inland about 35&nbsp;mi (55&nbsp;km) east of San Salvador, over the mountainous terrain of Central America.\nJune 9\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;PDT) at Tropical Depression  forms from an area of unsettled weather over the Gulf of Tehuantepec.\nJune 10\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;9) at Tropical Depression  strengthens into Tropical Storm Blanca about 90&nbsp;mi (150&nbsp;km) southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca.\nJune 11\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;10) at Tropical Storm Blanca reaches its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , about 165&nbsp;mi (270&nbsp;km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero.\nJune 12\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;11) at Tropical Storm Blanca weakens into a tropical depression about 490&nbsp;mi (790&nbsp;km) west of Acapulco.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;PDT, June&nbsp;11) at Tropical Depression Blanca is last noted as a tropical cyclone about 580&nbsp;mi (935&nbsp;km) west of Acapulco; it dissipates six&nbsp;hours later.\nJune 21\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m.&nbsp;PDT) at Tropical Depression  forms over the central portion of the Eastern Pacific basin.
