It was first established in 1895, and it covered part of the city’s dockside and nearby residential areas. The ward was abolished in 1973, re-established in 2004, and finally dissolved again in 2023 following boundary changes.\nOverview\nSandhills ward was originally established in 1895. the ward was formed from parts of the Everton and Kirkdale wards as part of boundary changes to accommodate the city's growing population. Named after the Sandhills area in north Liverpool, the ward served as a residential and industrial district close to the city’s docklands. It was abolished in 1973 following a city-wide reorganisation of electoral boundaries but was later re-established in 2004 with revised borders. The ward continued until it was again dissolved in 2023 as part of a comprehensive review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England.\nThe area takes its name from natural sand deposits along the Mersey’s edge and the Sandsills railway station is located within its vicinity.\nElections\nSandhills ward was a continuous feature of Liverpool politics through the early to mid‑20th century, with councillors elected annually, including elections in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. From 1953 to 1973, Sandhills was one of Liverpool’s 20 three-seat wards until the 1973 reorganisation, which abolished aldermanic seats and reduced ward numbers. It was later reinstated under new boundaries in 2004, remaining as a single‑member ward until its second dissolution in 2023, following a Local Government Boundary Commission review.\n1919\n1920\n1921\n1922\n1923\n1924\n1925\n1926\n1927\n1928\n1929\n1930\n1931\n1932\n1933\n1934\n1935\n1936\n1937\n1938\n1945\n1946\n1947\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\n1953\n1954\n1955\n1956\n1957\n1958\n1959\n1960\n1961\n1962\n1%}}\n5%|}}\n4%|}}\n3%|}}\n1963\n1964\nReferences"
