The Statutes of CWP were amended and approved by the FAO Council at its Hundred and Eighth Session in June 1995.\nParticipating organizations\nThe CWP is composed of experts nominated by intergovernmental organizations which have a competence in fishery statistics. There are currently 17 participating organizations in the CWP:\n* Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)\n* [http://www.ccsbt.org/ Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT)]\n* [http://www.fao.org/ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)]\n* [http://www.faogfcm.org/ General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)]\n* Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [http://www.iotc.org] (IOTC)\n* Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission\n* [http://www.iccat.int/ International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)]\n* [http://www.ices.dk/ International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110208193224/http://www.iwcoffice.org/ International Whaling Commission (IWC)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130121144822/http://www.nasco.int/ North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO)]\n* [http://www.neafc.org/ North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094414/http://www.nafo.int/ Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO)]\n* [http://www.oecd.org/ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)]\n* [http://www.spc.int/ Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)]\n* [http://www.seafdec.org/ Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040919020144/http://europa.eu.int/comm/eurostat/ Statistical Office of the European Communities (Commission of the EU/Eurostat)]\n* [http://www.wcpfc.int/ Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)]\nSecretariat\nThe FAO serves as the CWP Secretariat.
