Previously, Taiwan had diplomatic relations with Gambia, and there was an Embassy of the Republic of China in Banjul. However, these were broken off in 2013 by President Yahya Jammeh. Liberia similarly broke off diplomatic relations with Taipei in 2003.\nIt is headed by a Representative, currently Morgan Chao.\nHistory\nThe Mission was established in Lagos in 1991, before relocating to Abuja in 2001, despite requests from Beijing that it be located outside the Nigerian capital.\nIn January 2017, the government of Nigeria requested Taiwan to relocate the office back to Lagos from Abuja. On 8 December 2017, the office began the relocation from Abuja to Lagos and on 5 January 2018, the new office in Lagos was officially opened under the name Taipei Trade Office in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\nRepresentatives\n* Yang Tien-hsing\n* Morgan Chao\n* Vincent W.S.
