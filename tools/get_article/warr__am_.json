The station is currently owned by Logan Darensburg d/b/a Darensburg Broadcasting.\nWARR went on the air in 1970 in Warren County, North Carolina. Transmitter output was 1,000 watts at the time. The station was co-founded by Vernon Steed, owner of the Warren Theater. His partner was Jim Mayers, the owner of WSRC located in Durham, North Carolina at the time.  The transmitter power was later increased to 5,000 watts during the daytime, but remained at 1,000 watts during critical hours.  WARR holds a daytime-only license.\nIn 1994, the station was sold to the Johnson Media Group.  In 2002, WARR was acquired by Quad Divisions, Inc doing business as Darensburg Broadcasting, headed by Logan James Darensburg, II. Currently, Reverend Dr. Lilipiana D. Darensburg serves as General Manager and President of the station.\nDuring 2011, WARR aired some North Carolina Central University sports events.
