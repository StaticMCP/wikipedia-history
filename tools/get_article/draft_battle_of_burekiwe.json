It took place near Burekiwe (present-day Yambio, South Sudan).\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Burekiwe weakened Mahdist control in the region and bolstered Azande independence. However, the respite was short-lived. Later in 1898, the Mahdist State collapsed following the Anglo-Egyptian victory at the Battle of Omdurman.\nIn the early 20th century, Azande lands became contested by European colonial powers Britain, Belgium, and France. King Gbudwe continued to resist foreign domination until his defeat at the Battle of Yambio in 1905, after which he died in captivity."
