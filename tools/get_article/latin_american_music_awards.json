It is the Spanish-language counterpart of the American Music Awards (AMAs). As with AMAs, the Latin AMAs are determined by a poll of the public and music buyers and is produced by SOMOS Productions. The first Latin AMAs debuted on October 8, 2015, on Telemundo and was hosted by Lucero. The awards were not held in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, they resumed a year later.\nThe broadcast was moved from Telemundo to Univision in 2023.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!
