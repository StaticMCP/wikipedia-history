It served as the western capital of the Hồ dynasty (1398–1407) while also being an important political, economic, and cultural centre in the 16th to the 18th century. It is located in modern Tây Giai commune, Vĩnh Lộc District, in Thanh Hóa Province, in Vietnam's North Central Coast region.\nTây Đô castle is rectangular in shape. Its north-south side is  in length and its east-west side is  in length. There are four gates: one at the south (fore gate), one at the north (back gate), one at the east (left gate), and one at the west (right gate). The southern gate is  high and  wide. The castle was constructed from stone blocks, each of which is  in size on average. Except for its gates, the castle is mostly ruined.\nThe citadel was built in 1397. It was composed of an Inner Citadel made of limestone, the La Thanh Outer Wall and a 155 hectare altar. The design and decoration of architectural elements in terms of space management was meant to showcase a centralized imperial city ruled by royal power, based on Confucianism mixed with a Buddhist culture. The construction of the castle was built according to fengshui principles. The citadel was inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage Sites on June 27, 2011.\nGallery\nFile:Cổng Nam.jpg|General view\nFile:Tay Do castle South gate.JPG|South gate\nFile:Tay Do castle North gate.JPG|North gate\nFile:Tay Do castle East gate.JPG|East gate\nFile:Dan da thanh Tay Do.png|A stone cannonball found in Tây Đô castle\nFile:12-gieng_vua-dan_te_nam_giao.JPG|King's Well\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720122908/http://www.thanhhoa.gov.vn/web/guest/gtc/tcdl/nhaho?p_p_id=news_view_INSTANCE_zHQZ&p_p_action=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-2&p_p_col_pos=0&p_p_col_count=1&_news_view_INSTANCE_zHQZ_struts_action=%2Fnews_view%2Fview_news&_news_view_INSTANCE_zHQZ_newsId=83&_news_view_INSTANCE_zHQZ_itemIndex=3&_news_view_INSTANCE_zHQZ_columnId=152&#p_news_view_INSTANCE_zHQZ Hồ castle]"
