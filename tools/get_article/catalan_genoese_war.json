John XXII tried without success to achieve peace between the contenders.\nIn 1332 the admirals of the fleet were the Veguer of Barcelona Pere de Santcliment in spring, and Francesc de Finestres and Arnau Oliver in winter, and Bernat Sespujades repulsed the attack of 13 Genoese galleys in Cagliari, even though he had very few cash at the time.\nOttobono Marini was appointed captain of ten galleys against the Crown of Aragon in January 1333, and in April, Lanotto Cigala at the head of ten more galleys. Cigala captured in Sicily some ships from Barcelona laden with wheat, and four Genoese ships attacked three Catalan galleys and a woodwinds and the Catalans, in their turn, captured Genoese ships and thus inflicted numerous damages on each other.\nAlfonso IV of Aragon ordered that the cities of Barcelona, Mallorca and Valencia arm sixty galleys, of which at least thirty had to be ready in April 1333, ten for each city, and his admiral would be Galceran Marquet, who was re-elected in 1334.\nPeter IV of Aragon signed peace on September 19, 1336, after a truce had been established a few months earlier with the intervention of Pope Benedict XII.\nConsequences\nThe war made it possible to win the rebel city of Sassari, key for the northern domain of Sardinia and the maritime routes.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
