The rebellion lasted from January 17 to November 6, 1840 and the Republic of the Rio Grande was never officially recognized.\nOn January 17, 1840 a meeting was held at the Oreveña Ranch near Laredo. A group of notables from the  states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas advocated a rebellion seeking secession from Mexico and formation of their own federal republic with Laredo as the capital. However, those states' own congresses and governments never took any action to support the insurgents, and requested the help of the Central government in Mexico City to aid the local state armies.\nThe insurgents designated their own officials. They were:\n* Jesús de Cárdenas as President.\n* Antonio Canales Rosillo as commander-in-chief of the army.\n* Juan Nepomuceno Molano as council representative for Tamaulipas.\n* Francisco Vidaurri y Villaseñor as council representative for Coahuila.\n* Manuel María de Llano as council representative for Nuevo León.\n* Juan Francisco de Farías as Secretary of State.\n* José María Jesús Carbajal as council to the Secretary of State.\nOfficeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;  text-align:center;\"\n!width=\"300\"| In office\n!width=\"300\"| President\n|-\n| January 17, 1840 – November 6, 1840\n| Jesús de Cárdenas\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.lmtonline.com/ The Laredo Morning Times Online edition]\n* [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/mx-rgr.html “Mexico – Filibustering:  Republic of the Rio Grande,” Flags of the World.]\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100122101431/http://www.webbheritage.org/riograndehistory.htm The Republic of the Rio Grande Museum web site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100703085802/http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/riogrande.htm “The Republic of the Rio Grande:  A Story of Its Rise and Fall,” Sons of DeWitt Colony Texas.]\n*\n* [https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20071012/ts_nm/usa_mexico_mayors_dc_1 Yahoo!
