As with Ankh and Ankh: Heart of Osiris, Ankh: Battle of the Gods utilises a modified version of the Ogre 3D graphics engine.\nGameplay\nTypical to point-and-click adventure games, the characters are controlled with the mouse. Puzzles feature heavily, and are solved by identifying a keyspot within the visible area or by collecting vital items and then activating them in a given location. During the conversations between the characters, the player can select one of several dialogue options, some of which are essential to the puzzles later in the game.\nPlot\nPlayers again assume the role of Assil, the protagonist of the two earlier Ankh'' games, and must prevent Seth, the god of chaos and the desert, from subjugating Ancient Egypt. The additional characters of Thara, Assil's girlfriend, and the Pharaoh are available to control at certain points during the game.\nDevelopment\nLike its two predecessors, Battle of the Gods was developed by Deck13.\nReception\nDomestic\n| rev2 = PC Games\n| rev2Score = 80%\n| rev3 = Gameswelt\n| rev3Score = 83%\n}}\nInternational\n| rev1 = Game Boomers\n| rev1Score = B\n}}\nUpon release, Ankh: Battle of the Gods received mixed reviews. Commentators praised the stylised cartoon graphics, humour and charm retained from the earlier games in the series. Adventure Gamers remarked that the variety of in-game locations allowed the artists to creatively apply their talents. The music was credited as being excellent, providing a welcome \"atmospheric\" backdrop. In addition, the simplicity of the user interface and inventory system were noted as positive aspects. However, criticisms of the game focused on poorly developed side characters, lacklustre dialogue and the difficulty of certain puzzles.\nSee also\n* Overclocked: A History of Violence\n* Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100201175646/http://www.ankh-game.com/ Official Ankh series website]\n* [http://www.deck13.com/ Official Deck13 website]\n* [http://www.ogre3d.org/ Official Ogre 3D website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070228113708/http://www.xider-games.com/ Xider Games website]"
