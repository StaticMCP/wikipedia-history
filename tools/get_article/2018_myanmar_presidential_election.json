They are elected by the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, the national legislature.\nThe Pyidaungsu Hluttaw consists of two chambers, Pyithu Hluttaw, and Amyotha Hluttaw. Most seats are directly elected, but a quarter of the seats in both chambers are appointed by the Tatmadaw.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Chamber\n! Type\n!

The whole Pyidaungsu Hluttaw then votes, with all three nominees on the ballot together and each of the 664 MPs being entitled to one vote. The vote is a secret ballot. The candidate that receives the highest number of votes is President, the candidate with the second highest number of votes is 1st Vice-President, and the remaining candidate is 2nd Vice-President. This system guarantees the military at least one Vice-President.\nIn the event of the resignation, death, permanent disability or otherwise vacant nature of the office of the President, the constitution calls for the 1st Vice-President to serve as Acting President. An election must be held within 21 days. The committee that nominated the candidate that subsequently was elected President nominates a replacement, and the other two Vice-Presidents are automatically candidates.\nCandidates\nWin Myint was nominated by the committee from Pyithu Hluttaw. He was a member of that house from the Tamwe Township. He was also the Speaker. Thaung Aye, a member of the Pyithu Hluttaw from the Pyawbwe Township, was nominated by the USDP.\nThe nomination election occurred on 23 March 2018.\nSeven Pyithu Hluttaw seats were vacant.\nMyint Swe (USDP) and Henry Van Thio (NLD) were the Vice-Presidents, and therefore became candidates.\nResults\nThe election was held on 28 March 2018.\n.\n}}\nSeven Pyithu Hluttaw seats were vacant.\nWin Myint was sworn in as President of Myanmar on 30 March 2018.\nNotes\nReferences"
