In the , Shailer Park had a population of 12,182 people.\nGeography\nShailer Park is a suburb of mainly middle class residential areas, and sits on hilly terrain between the Pacific Motorway and extensive forest and bushland to the north. The north-eastern part of the suburb is sometimes known as Kimberley Park, after a residential estate located in the area.\nShailer Park is a centre for employment, entertainment, and leisure in southeast Queensland. The Logan Hyperdome, a major regional shopping centre, is located in Shailer Park, and other commercial and community facilities have developed nearby. Largely because of this, the Queensland Government listed the suburb as a major activity centre in the South East Queensland Regional Plan 2005–2026. The Loganholme bus station, a major bus interchange is located at the Logan Hyperdome.\nHistory\nThe suburb is named after Francis Frederick Rising Shailer and his wife Catherine, who arrived with their children in the area in 1866. Like many farmers in the area, they first grew cotton and later sugar. The Shailers were probably best known for their fruit growing and operated the first citrus orchard in southern Queensland, situated in Slacks Creek. The land selected by Francis Shailer was situated to the north of the current Shailer Road. Francis Shailer was a teacher at the first and second Slacks Creek Provisional Schools. He was also the first Clerk of the Tingalpa Divisional Board in 1880. The Shailers intermarried with other pioneering families in the district including the Dennis family, who were related to the Markwells, as well as the Murrays, who had an adjoining property along the Logan River. The property still exists at the end of Murrays Road.\nFrancis’ son Alfred later farmed the area now known as Daisy Hill. At that time it was called Oakey Mountain and was owned by his grandfather, James Dennis. Alf's son Glen Shailer also farmed this property. Glen carried on the family's tradition of involvement in local government. He was elected to the Albert Shire Council in 1961 and served almost continuously until 1985. He was elected Mayor of Logan City in 1982 and served for one term.\nShailer Park was originally named as a district on 1 September 1971, then as a sub-district of Slacks Creek on 1 September 1977.
