It is on the Bakerloo line between Maida Vale and Paddington stations, and is located in London fare zone 2.\nHistory\n|zoom=15 |text=Location of Warwick Avenue station }}\nWarwick Avenue opened on 31 January 1915 on the Bakerloo tube's extension from Paddington to Queen's Park.\nThe ticket hall and its ticket machines were destroyed by fire overnight on 17 September 1985, causing the station to be closed for the day.\nLocation and layout\nThe station is located at the junction of Warwick Avenue, Warrington Crescent and Clifton Gardens. For a time prior to its opening, the proposed name for the station was Warrington Crescent.\nThere is no surface building and the station is accessed by two sets of steps to a sub-surface ticket hall. It was one of the first London Underground stations built specifically to use escalators rather than lifts. A plain, utilitarian brick ventilation shaft has been built on the traffic island in the middle of the road to improve ventilation of the tunnels.\nConnections\nLondon Bus Routes 6, 46 and 187 serve the station.\nA regular waterbus service runs from nearby Little Venice along the Regent's Canal; during the summer months boats depart hourly towards London Zoo and Camden Lock.\nIn popular culture\nThe song \"Warwick Avenue\" by British singer Duffy makes reference to the station.\nGallery\nFile:Warwick Avenue stn northbound look south.JPG|Northbound platform looking south\nFile:Warwick Avenue stn southbound look north.JPG|Southbound platform looking north\nFile:Warwick Avenue tube ticket office.jpg|Ticket office (now closed)\nFile:Warwick Avenue stn ventilation tower.JPG|Ventilation tower\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/collections/collections-online/photographs London Transport Museum Photographic Archive]\n**\n**\n**\n**\n**"
