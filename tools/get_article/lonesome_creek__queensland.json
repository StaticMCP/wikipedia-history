There is some rural residential housing, mostly on the outskirts of Theodore.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lonesome Creek had a population of 170 people.\nIn the , Lonesome Creek had a population of 173 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Lonesome Creek. The nearest government primary and secondary school is Theodore State School (Prep to Year 10) in neighbouring Theodore to the south-west.

No regular scheduled services operate from it. The community has raised funds to install solar-powered lighting so the runway can be used for medical emergency flights at night.\nThere are two cemeteries in Lonesome Creek:\n* Theodore Pioneer Cemetery at 600 Goolara Heinickes Road ()\n* Theodore Cemetery at 241 Woolthorpe Road ()\nAmenities\nDespite the name, Theodore Golf Course is at 271 Woolthorpe Road ().\nReferences"
