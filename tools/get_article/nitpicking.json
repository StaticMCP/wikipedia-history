A person who nitpicks is termed as a nitpicker.\nThe terminology originates from the common act of manually removing nits (the eggs of lice, generally head lice) from another person's hair.\nAs nitpicking inherently requires fastidious attention to detail, the term has become appropriated to describe the practice of meticulously searching for minor, even trivial errors in detail.\nNitpicking has been used to describe dishonest insurers and bullying employers, or even bullying family members.\nReferences"
