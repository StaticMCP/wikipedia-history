Faber built the house about 1832 in a  Palladian style reminiscent of  Southern plantations. The house was converted into a hotel for African-Americans after the American Civil War and then a middle-class residence.\nThe house was photographed in 1958 before it was restored by the Historic Charleston Foundation.\nIn 1964, the Historic Charleston Foundation bought the house and undertook a restoration of the then-abandoned building.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Jonathan H.
