He is likely to have been a son of pharaoh Amenhotep II.\nHe is mentioned on two graffiti on the Sehel Island along with the throne name of Amenhotep II. One of the graffiti depicting the prince is mistakenly thought to depict Senenmut by locals.\nKhaemwaset is titled Overseer of cattle, which was a rare title for a prince.\nSources"
