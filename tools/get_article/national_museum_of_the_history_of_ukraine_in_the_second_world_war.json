On 21 June 1996, the museum was accorded its current status of the National Museum by the special decree signed by Leonid Kuchma, the then-President of Ukraine.\nIt is one of the largest museums in Ukraine (with over 300,000 exhibits) centered on the 62-metre tall Mother Ukraine statue, which has become one of the best-recognized landmarks of Kyiv. The museum has been attended by over 21 million visitors.\nMemorial complex\nThe memorial complex covers the area of 10 hectares (approximately 24.7 acres) on the hill, overlooking the Dnieper River. It contains the giant bowl \"The Flame of Glory\", a site with World War II military equipment, and the \"Hero Cities\". This \"Alley of the Hero Cities\" displayed all the Hero Cities in the Soviet Union; until 27 December 2024 when the names of Russian and Belarusian cities were removed.\nOne of the museums also displays the armaments used by the Soviet army post World War II. The sculptures in the alley depict the defence of the Soviet borders from the 1941 German invasion, the Nazi occupation, partisan struggle, devoted work on the home front, and the 1943 Battle of the Dnieper.\n\"]]\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine the museum underwent thematical changes. The museum's leadership stated in March 2024 it intended \"to get rid of traces of the Soviet narrative about the myth of the \"Great Patriotic War\".\nMother Ukraine monument\nThe monumental sculpture of Mother Ukraine (), built by Yevgeny Vuchetich and Vasyl Borodai, stands 62 metres tall upon the museum building with the overall structure measuring 102 m and weighing 530 tons. The sword in the statue's right hand is 16 m long, weighing 9 tons, with the left hand holding up a 13 m by 8 m shield with the coat of arms of Ukraine (formerly the emblem of the Soviet Union). The memorial hall of the museum displays marble plaques with carved names of more than 11,600 soldiers and over 200 workers of the home-front honored during the war with the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union and the Hero of Socialist Labor. On the hill beneath the museum, the traditional flower shows are held.\nName change\nUntil July 2015, the official name of the museum was the National Museum of the History of the 1941–1945 Great Patriotic War (). In April 2015, the Verkhovna Rada outlawed the term \"Great Patriotic War\" as well as Nazi and communist symbols, street names, and monuments. On 16 May 2015, Minister of Culture Vyacheslav Kyrylenko announced that the museum would change its name, and this was done two months later.\nAwards\nIn May 2023, the museum received the Judges' Special Recognition Prize at the Museum + Heritage Awards (London, UK) for the exhibition project \"Ukraine — Crucifixion\" (curator — Dr. Jurii Savchuk, artist — Anton Logov) and professional resilience in the times of warfare.\nGallery\nImage:Загальний вид комплексу Українського державного музею ВВВ - 1.JPG|\nImage:Комплекс Українського державного музею Великої Вітчизняної війни 12.jpg\nImage:Комплекс Українського державного музею Великої Вітчизняної війни 11.jpg|\nImage:Комплекс Українського державного музею Великої Вітчизняної війни 13.jpg|\nImage:Комплекс Українського державного музею Великої Вітчизняної війни 08.jpg|\nImage:Комплекс Українського державного музею Великої Вітчизняної війни 05.jpg|\nImage:Комплекс Українського державного музею Великої Вітчизняної війни 02.jpg|\nSee also\n*Mamayev Kurgan\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110128015907/http://panovision.com.ua/panokiev/mvov/index.html 360 degree panorama virtual tour to Museum of the Great Patrotic War]\n* [http://www.korrespondent.net/main/153213/ 'The Kyiv \"Mother-Motherland\" marks the 25th anniversary'], May 8, 2006, Korrespondent.net\n* [http://podrobnosti.ua/culture/2004/05/09/119872.html 'The Kyiv \"Mother-Motherland\" marks the 23rd anniversary'], May 8, 2004, podrobnosti.ua\n* [http://www.worldwalk.info/en/catalog/1620/ Photo 1024x768 (1)]\n* [http://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-war-museum.html In a Museum Show, Ukraine Tells the Story of a War Still in Progress – New York Times]\n* [http://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/10/arts/design/kyiv-museum-ukraine-war-notebook.html How the War Changed a Kyiv Museum’s View of Its Past – New York Times]\n*"
