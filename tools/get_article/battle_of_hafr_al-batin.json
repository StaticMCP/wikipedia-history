The Ikhwan had already suffered a massive defeat at the Battle of Sabilla on March 29, and another defeat at the Battle of Jabal Shammar in August.\nThe battle consisted of a surprise night attack against the Ikhwan positions.\nAfter the battle, the Ikhwan would attempt a raid on Awazim, but their forces had no fight left in them. In January of 1930, the remaining Ikhwan leaders would surrender to British forces.\nReferences"
