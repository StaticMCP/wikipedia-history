Created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns, the show follows the life of Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore), a single woman in her thirties working as the associate producer, later producer, of a local news station WJM. Working at the news station is her gruff boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner), newswriter Murray Slaughter (Gavin McLeod), and the vain and nit-witted anchorman Ted Baxter (Ted Knight). Mary rents a studio apparent from acquaintance and landlady Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman), and neighbors her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper). Other major characters in the series include Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White), the host of The Happy Homemaker show, and Ted's girlfriend, later wife, Georgette Franklin (Georgia Engel).\nMary Tyler Moore has garnered critical acclaim for its honest and serious portrayal of a single working woman in the 1970s. Since its debut, the series has been nominated for 67 Primetime Emmy Awards (winning 29) and 22 Golden Globe Awards (winning three) among others. Several cast members, including Moore and Asner, have received recognition for their roles, winning several Emmy and Golden Globe awards.\nAwards and nominations\nDirectors Guild of America Awards\nPresented by the Directors Guild of America since 1938, The Directors Guild of America Award honors excellence in the field of direction.
