The treaty followed the armistice of Leoben (18 April 1797), which had been forced on the Habsburgs by Napoleon's victorious campaign in Italy. It ended the War of the First Coalition and left Great Britain fighting alone against revolutionary France.\nThe treaty's public articles concerned only France and Austria and called for a Congress of Rastatt to be held to negotiate a final peace for the Holy Roman Empire. In the treaty's secret articles, Austria as the personal state of the Emperor promised to work with France to certain ends at the congress. Among other provisions, the treaty meant the definitive end to the ancient Republic of Venice, which was disbanded and partitioned by the French and the Austrians.\nThe congress failed to achieve peace, and by early 1799 France and Austria were at war again. The new war, the War of the Second Coalition, ended with the Peace of Lunéville, a peace for the whole empire, in 1801.\nLocation\nCampo Formio, now called Campoformido, is a village west of Udine in the historical region of Friuli in north-eastern Italy, in the middle between Austrian headquarters in Udine and Bonaparte's residence. The French commander resided at Villa Manin, the country mansion of Ludovico Manin, the last Doge of Venice, near Codroipo. The treaty was signed in an old house in the main square of the village, property of Bertrando Del Torre, a local merchant.\nOn 18 January 1798, Austrian troops entered Venice, and three days later, they held an official reception at the Doge's Palace, where Ludovico Manin was a guest of honour.\nTerms\nBeyond the usual clauses of \"firm and inviolable peace\", the treaty transferred a number of Austrian territories into French hands. Lands ceded included the Austrian Netherlands (most of modern Belgium). Territories of the Republic of Venice were divided between the two states: certain islands in the Mediterranean, including Corfu and other Venetian possessions in the Ionian Sea were turned over to the French.\nThe city of Venice with the Terraferma (Venetian mainland), Venetian Istria, Venetian Dalmatia and the Bay of Kotor region were turned over to the Habsburg emperor. Austria recognized the Cisalpine Republic and the newly created Ligurian Republic, formed of Savoyard state and Genoese territories, as independent powers.\nThe Italian states formally ceased to owe fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor, ending the formal existence of the Kingdom of Italy, which, as a personal holding of the emperor, had existed de jure but not de facto since at least the 14th century.\nThe treaty contained secret clauses signed by Napoleon and representatives of the Holy Roman emperor, which divided up certain other territories, and agreed to the extension of the borders of France up to the Rhine, the Nette, and the Roer. Free French navigation was guaranteed on the Rhine, the Meuse and the Moselle. The French Republic had been expanded into areas that had never before been under French control.\nThe treaty was composed and signed after five months of negotiations. Its terms largely reflected those agreed upon earlier in the Treaty of Leoben in April 1797, although the talks were prolonged by both parties for various reasons. During this period, the French had to suppress the Coup of 18 Fructidor, a royalist uprising in September, which served as a pretext for the arrest and deportation of royalist and moderate deputies from the Directory.\nNapoleon's biographer, Felix Markham, wrote \"the partition of Venice was not only a moral blot on the peace settlement but left Austria a foothold in Italy, which could only lead to further war.\" In fact, the Peace of Campo Formio, though it reshaped the map of Europe and marked a major step in Napoleon's fame, was only a respite. One consequence was the Peasants' War, which erupted in the Southern Netherlands in 1798 following the French introduction of conscription.\nAs a result of the treaty, Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, a prisoner from the French Revolution, was released from Austrian captivity.\nBy passing Venetian possessions in Greece, such as the Ionian Islands, to French rule, the treaty had an effect on later Greek history neither intended nor expected at the time.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/siv/UD/FRAN_IR_055193/A1_45 Traité de Campo-Formio] (original document in French)\n* [https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_campoformio1.html Treaty of Campo Formio] (extracts in English)\n* [https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_campoformio2.html Background to the Treaty]"
