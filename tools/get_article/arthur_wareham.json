      "text": "# Arthur Wareham\n\nArthur Wareham (24 April 1908&ndash;10 May 1988) was a British newspaper editor.\nWareham attended Queen's College, Taunton, then entered journalism with the Western Morning News.  In 1935 he moved to the Daily Mail, rising to become editor in 1955.  As editor, he reversed the drive of previous editor Guy Schofield to imitate  The Daily Telegraph'', instead taking the paper in a more populist direction.\nHe was replaced as editor in 1959 and left the newspaper the following year to found a public relations company, Arthur Wareham Associates Ltd.\nReferences"
