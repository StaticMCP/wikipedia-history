It was converted to tanks on 3 August 1941 in the Middle East and joined the 10th Armoured Division.\nSecond World War\nEl Alamein\nDuring the North Africa campaign, the Brigade was commanded by Brigadier J.C.Currie and fought at the Second Battle of El Alamein. Its units were:\n* 3rd Hussars\n* Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry\n* Warwickshire Yeomanry\n* 9th Armoured Brigade Signal Squadron (Middlesex Yeomanry), Royal Corps of Signals\nThe Brigade was nominally independent but was placed under command of the 2nd New Zealand Division specifically for the El Alamein battle. Following permission given by the New Zealanders, they proudly painted the Kiwis' divisional sign on their tanks. The NZ infantry gained their objectives, but as with Operation Lightfoot on the first day of the battle, lanes could not be cleared through the minefields until night was almost over. 9th Armoured Brigade was forced to make its attack silhouetted by the early daylight. As dawn came on 2 November, tank after tank was hit by the German 88&nbsp;mm guns that kept firing through seven air attacks. The 9th never reached their objective. In fact, they took 75 percent casualties and lost 102 of their 128 tanks. Nevertheless, they breached the gun line and the 1st Armoured Division of X Corps, under the command of Raymond Briggs, was now able to engage.\nAfter the Brigade's action, Brigadier William Gentry of the 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, 'Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to know where your tanks are?' Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him, replying 'There they are.' Gentry was puzzled. 'I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?' Currie waved his arm and again replied, 'There are my armoured regiments, Bill.'\nNevertheless, the assault of 2nd New Zealand Division had drawn in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, with the result that there was a wide gap in the Axis lines to the southwest. Through this gap, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, commander of 8th Army, pushed the remainder of his armour, breaking the Afrika Korps line and pushing westwards into its rear areas and supply lines. By 4 November, the battle was won, and Montgomery was entertaining the captured Afrika Korps commander, Wilhelm von Thoma, to dinner in his caravan.\nIn an account of the battle published to mark its 25th anniversary, Montgomery wrote:\nI must mention the magnificent fight put up by 9th Armoured Brigade – 3rd Hussars, Wiltshire Yeomanry, Warwickshire Yeomanry.... If the British armour owed any debt to the infantry of 8th army, the debt was paid on 2 November by 9th Armoured Brigade in heroism and blood....\nGeneral Bernard Freyberg, the NZ Division's commander, also paid tribute to the gallant support provided by the brigade.[https://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Doc-c7-33.html 174 – General Freyberg to the Minister of Defence | NZETC]\nPost Alamein\nAfter the battle, the 9th Armoured Brigade, which had been reduced to a handful of operational tanks, was withdrawn to Syria to regroup and undertake internal security duties. In 1944, the Brigade (with the same three regiments) fought in the Italian campaign in support of the 78th Infantry Division, the 4th Indian Division and the 10th Indian Infantry Division.\nPost War\nAfter the reformation of the Territorial Army in 1947, the brigade was reformed as an independent formation within Northern Command. It was almost certainly disbanded by the time that the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve was formed in 1967.\nSee also\n* British armoured formations of the Second World War\n* List of British brigades of the Second World War\nNotes\nReferences\n* Graham Watson, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131205080733/http://www.orbat.com/site/history/library-new/1946-1990/britishempire/ta47.html United Kingdom: The Territorial Army 1947], v 1.0, 10 March 2002\n*\nFurther reading\nDuring Operation Supercharge (the battle of El Alamein):\n* Field Marshal Lord Carver, El Alamein Wordsworth Editions Ltd; New Ed edition, 2000\n* Hector Bolitho, ''The Galloping Third: The story of the 3rd the King's Own Hussars'', 1963"
