Men were often viewed as the appropriate professionals to attend to healthcare needs in the United States, including those of women which in a way made healthcare in the United States a sexist system. The modernization of societies in the twentieth century worked towards reducing the gap of women's involvement into various power driven functions such as politics. With this change, women holding positions of power within our government as well as some men, would use their political stance to better address the needs of women. Policies were being revoked and new ones were being put in their place; policies that include women from minority groups that face racial prejudice not only from within the workforce but from healthcare institutions as well. In the 1950s into the 1960s, these healthcare institutions had scientists and doctors working on producing contraceptives, despite their controversial public opinions. Feminists within the U.S. were speaking out against the injustices, and inequality women were facing in the twentieth century to bring awareness to the needs of women and ensure that, as a country, the U.S. better address those needs within the twentieth century.\nThe feminist movement’s effects on women’s healthcare\nAs feminist activists became more prevalent in the 20th Century, they challenged disparities in education, employment, and social rights, and improved women's healthcare by eliminating sexism in healthcare. Many circumstances of sexism being apparent revolve around doctors dismissing women's pain or not addressing their pain as seriously as their male counterparts. The efforts of feminists exposed historical issues such as the ignorance of women’s pain and concerns by doctors, which often led to misdiagnoses or inadequate treatment. A major catalyst for change came in the 1970s when over 1,200 self-help healthcare groups were established across the United States. These groups empowered women to take control of their healthcare and demand more equitable treatment from medical professionals. Many women were thus inspired to practice careers that specifically focused on women’s health. By 1980, the number of women entering gynecology had notably increased, with women comprising about 30% of gynecological residents. Despite this progress, men still dominated the field, and women often faced significant barriers in having their voices heard, both as patients and as medical professionals. It was not uncommon for a male doctor to misdiagnose a woman in the 1900s. In response to these challenges, feminist activists and healthcare advocates worked to establish women-centric medical institutions. These efforts were crucial in addressing and reducing the pervasive sexism in healthcare, striving for a more inclusive and responsive system for women's health needs.\nWomen of minority races and their health treatments\nHistorically, women of color in the U.S. had to face sexism as well as racial prejudice which added to the barriers they experienced. As the 20th century progressed, women’s health became an important and integral part of the healthcare system within the U.S. Women’s rights activists pushed for more women-oriented healthcare facilities that could provide primary care for women. Such care involved reproductive care, breast care programs, pregnancy and childbirth care, etc. By 1997, it was calculated that approximately one-third of hospitals had added a healthcare unit specifically catered to the needs of women in the United States. However, once these women-centered health programs were established, women of color still had to fight for access to the same quality of care as their white counterparts.  Many medical experimentations were done on women of color during the 20th century; in third-world countries and parts of U.S., using women of color for medical learning was a common practice and considered socially acceptable to their communities. These inhumane experiments were a reflection of the deeply rooted racism displayed in our history of medical research and practice within the United States. Studies show that in the early 1900s, African-American women had shorter life expectancy than white women, with an average of 33.2 years compared to 48.7 years, highlighting the stark disparities in healthcare access and treatment. During the early 20th century, the eugenics movement had a significant influence on healthcare policies, particularly in regard to women of color and women with disabilities. The practice of forced sterilizations, especially targeting women of color and poor women, is an important historical issue in this context. Eugenics-based policies were justified under the guise of improving public health, but they were deeply rooted in racial and class-based discrimination.\nThe fight for women’s health insurance\nThroughout the twentieth century, healthcare policy in the United States was frequently discriminatory toward women, limiting their access to health insurance and healthcare services. Many women faced significant barriers in obtaining health insurance, as numerous insurance companies had policies that either excluded women from coverage or imposed higher premiums due to gender. In many cases, women could not obtain individual health insurance unless they had a male relative, typically a husband, or an employer who provided coverage through group plans. This system placed women in a vulnerable position, as their access to healthcare was contingent on the decisions made by their male family members or employers. Because women were far less likely to obtain and hold health insurance. The inability to independently obtain health insurance or control healthcare choices was a significant factor in women's delayed advocacy for healthcare rights. It was not until the feminist movements of the mid-20th century, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, that women began to actively demand equal access to healthcare and the elimination of gender-based discrimination in health insurance. The passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which prohibited insurers from charging women higher premiums based on gender, marked a significant milestone in the ongoing struggle for women's health rights.\nWomen’s reproductive healthcare\nIn the early 1900s, topics concerning women's reproductive rights were taboo. By the 1960s, this fight for reproductive rights was known throughout the United States. The reproductive rights issue included the freedom to use birth contraceptives, the freedom and access to legal abortions, and the right to birth their children in environments, and with the method, that they found suitable. One specific example of a method not popular in public opinion in the late 1900s, but had been common in the early 1900s was natural childbirth. Women activists who fought for these reproductive rights were key in the passing of decision by the Supreme Court to legalize abortion in 1973 in the case Roe vs Wade. That court decision was overturned in 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.\nBirth contraceptives\nWomen faced the challenge of freely speaking about and being provided with birth contraceptives. Any kind of talk of contraceptives was more often than not avoided in the early twentieth century as it was a very controversial subject. With the feminist movements came a push for more rights for these preventative methods to become accessible to women. The first birth control in the form of a pill came to market in 1960. Margaret Sanger and Katherine McCormick were two key women in the making and distribution of this form of birth control. Because the distribution was limited in terms of who healthcare facilities would give this pill to, McCormick started a business selling birth control which received an incredible response from about 2.3 million women at the time.\nAbortion\nAbortion was another controversial topic during the twentieth century. In the 1960s, it became a topic of heightened awareness in the United States because of a woman named Sherri Finkbine. Finkbine got approval from her oral contraceptives physician to receive an abortion because of a medicine she took, thalidomide, that was known to cause fetal deformities. The hospital denied Finkbine the abortion, so she found approval in Sweden, where she went ahead with the abortion. Making news in the United States, many started to take sides and feminist groups began to push harder for the legality of abortions. By 1973, abortions were legalized but only by the approval of medical practices. Extreme amounts of women went through illegal abortions in the 1960s, and because of this, nearly 1000 women died every year from these illegal abortions.\nSee also\n* Contraceptive mandate\n* Feminist movement\n* Abortion-rights movements\n* Women's Health Initiative\nReferences"
