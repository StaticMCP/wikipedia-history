It is the only church designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh to have been built; hence, it is also known as The Mackintosh Church'''.\nHistory\nIn 1896, the Free Church of St Matthew, Glasgow, commissioned a new church and hall from the experienced Glasgow architectural practice of Honeyman and Keppie, to be located within the developing area of Springbank, near Maryhill. John Honeyman allocated the job to his young, talented, trainee architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The site was an awkward one, being on a corner plot and butted by tenements and a large warehouse. In keeping with their beliefs, the Free Church required simplicity in design.  A memorial stone was laid on 23 June 1898 and the church held its first service on 10 September 1899.\nAlthough he designed an Anglican Cathedral for Liverpool, as part of a competition, it was never built, so Queen's Cross was the only Mackintosh church to be completed. Building started shortly after Mackintosh finished his competition design for the Glasgow School of Art. It is built at Queen's Cross, at the junction of Garscube Road and Maryhill Road in Glasgow's Maryhill area.\nMackintosh Design\nExterior\nUnlike many churches in Glasgow, Mackintosh's church doesn't have a huge towering spire, and is rather squat and more like a Norman Castle, called 'Modern gothic' by other architects. The main south-west tower was modelled on one at Merriot in Somerset which Mackintosh visited in 1895.\nInterior\nAlthough the stained glass windows are not 'spectacular' compared to other churches and cathedrals, they are distinctly Mackintosh in design. The style is still used on many Mackintosh-style windows and stained glass souvenirs available today.\nThe roof is made up by a striking timber-lined barrel-vaulted roof, which spans the entire forty feet of the nave.\nThe pulpit is carved in Mackintosh designs, which repeat five times around the curved front. It has been suggested that it represents the wings of a bird protecting young shoots - sown on fertile ground.\nThe design contains gothic influences, such as the magnificent stained glass blue-heart window, and pre-Reformation style elements, such as the replica of the original rood beam, which is unique in Scotland. It is even possible to find Japanese influences in the double beams and pendants inside the church.\nHome of Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society\nAfter the church was decommissioned in the 1970s, unlike many churches which were converted to theatres, apartments or demolished and because of the popularity of Mackintosh's work, the church became home of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society, which owns and operates the church as a tourist attraction.\nThe adjoining church hall provides tearoom facilities, and there is a display area under the balcony with many artifacts including replicas of the chairs he designed for the Willow Tearooms.\nSee also\n*Culture in Glasgow\n*List of Church of Scotland parishes\nNotes\nGallery\nImage:Queens Cross Church07c.jpg|west window\nImage:Queens Cross Church07d.jpg|west window\nImage:Queens Cross Church07e.jpg|pulpit\nImage:Queens Cross Church07f.jpg|east window over main balcony\nImage:Queens Cross Church07o.jpg|south aisle and west window\nImage:Queens Cross Church07p.jpg|south aisle and balcony\nImage:Queens Cross Church07q.jpg|south aisle\nImage:Queens Cross Church07h.jpg|west stair\nImage:Queens Cross Church07i.jpg|east stair\nImage:Queens Cross Church07k.jpg|hall roof\nImage:Queens Cross Church07l.jpg|keyboard in hall\nImage:Queens Cross Church07m.jpg|hall detail\nExternal links\n*[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20061116174843/http://www.crmsociety.com/ Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316153909/http://www.crmsociety.com/Attraction.aspx?NavPage=51&AttId=9#openingtimes The Mackintosh Church]\n*[http://www.gerryblaikie.com/mackintosh/queensx.htm Queens Cross Church - Illustrated Guide]"
