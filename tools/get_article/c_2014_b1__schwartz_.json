Schwartz, discovered the comet in the early evening of 28 January 2014 using an astrograph from the Tenagra Observatory near Nogales, Arizona. At the time of discovery, it was about  from the Sun. Subsequent observations from several other observatories across the world confirmed its cometary nature on 29 January.\nFollow-up observations\nThe comet reached perihelion on September 2017, reaching its maximum recorded brightness as a 15th-magnitude object. In 2021, the comet was already  from Earth and was observed near the galaxy PGC 48046, where it was expected to remain brighter than magnitude 20.0 until 2023 at the earliest.\nPhysical characteristics\nObservations from the NEOWISE mission revealed that due to the comet's large perihelion distance, which is too cold for water ice to sublimate, cometary activity in this object is mostly driven by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gases. This phenomenon is also observed from other comets with similarly distant perihelia, like C/2010 U3 and C/2017 K2.\nIt is noted that from ground observations, the comet had a morphologically stable discus-shaped coma, which had increased in brightness by 1.0 by the time it reached perihelion in 2017.\nInitial estimates of the size of its nucleus in 2019 were roughly  in radius. Reanalysis of a 2017 photographic observation of the comet about a year later has refined its effective radius to  km, using a new method where the absolute brightness of the nucleus is inferred from the measured brightness distribution in the coma using a mathematical model.\nSpectral and polarimetric observations of the comet from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) reveal the color of the jet structures is much redder than that of the ambient coma, and the nucleus itself also has a reddish color.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.aerith.net/comet/catalog/2014B1/2014B1.html C/2014 B1] at Seiichi Yoshida's website"
