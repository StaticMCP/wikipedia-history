The album was released on July 16, 1982, by Asylum Records. The album's lack of commercial success caused Zevon's label to terminate his recording contract.\nThe title track was inspired by veteran American diplomat Philip Habib's shuttle diplomacy during the 1982 Lebanon War.\nZevon later said of the album's lack of success, \"I would start a record more or less as soon as I'd finished the one previous to it, and they took longer, cost more and more, and actually did sort of less and less well. Particularly The Envoy. I was a little discouraged after that.\".\nDespite the fact that \"Let Nothing Come Between You\", a love ballad written by Zevon, charted as high as 24 on the Mainstream Billboard Rock chart, Asylum dropped Zevon after the commercial failure of The Envoy. It would be five years before Zevon made another studio album, 1987's Sentimental Hygiene, released on Virgin Records.\nActors Ted Shackelford and James Houghton appeared on the album's cover.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Warren Zevon except as indicated.\nPersonnel\n* Warren Zevon – vocals, guitar on 1 and 7; piano on 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9; synthesizer on 1 and 5–8; electric piano on 3\n* Waddy Wachtel – guitar on 1–5 and 7–9; percussion and harmony vocals on 5\n* David Landau – guitar on 1, 2, 5, and 6; backing vocals on 6\n* Leland Sklar – bass guitar on 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6\n* Jeff Porcaro – drums on 1–3, 5, and 8; log drums on 3; puili sticks on 3\n; Additional personnel\n* Don Henley – harmony vocals on 1\n* Lindsey Buckingham – harmony vocals on 2\n* Jim Horn – recorders on 3, saxophone\n* Jordan Zevon – harmony vocals on 3\n* Steve Lukather – guitar on 5\n* Jorge Calderón – harmony vocals on 5\n* Danny Kortchmar – guitar on 6\n* LeRoy Marinell – guitar on 6\n* Mike Botts – drums on 6\n* Steve Forman – percussion on 6\n* JD Souther – backing vocals on 6, harmony vocals on 8\n* Bob Glaub – bass guitar on 7 and 9\n* Rick Marotta – drums on 7\n* Kenny Edwards – bass guitar on 8\n* Graham Nash – harmony vocals on 8\n* Russ Kunkel – drums on 9\n;Technical\n* Jamie Ledner, Wayne Tadouye – engineers\n* Jimmy Wachtel – design, cover photography\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1982)\n!PeakPosition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|Billboard Pop Albums\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|93\n|}\nReferences"
