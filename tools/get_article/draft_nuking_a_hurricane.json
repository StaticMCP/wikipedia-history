The idea dates to as early as 1956, and is frequently suggested by the American general public every hurricane season. Scientists are highly skeptical of this proposal, noting that the impact on the hurricane would be minimal and there would be risk of nuclear fallout. Furthermore, usage of large nuclear bombs is prohibited by the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which the United States has been a party to since 1990.\nHistory\n20th century\nTo add: Teller, Huxley\nJack W. Reed, an American meteorologist, was the first individual known to have seriously considered using nuclear bombs to disrupt hurricanes. He conceived of it in 1952, after watching the Ivy Mike test. (Reed himself claimed that the idea originated with the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.) Reed, an early hurricane hunter, had worked in the U.S. nuclear test program and studied the atmospheric effects of nuclear explosions.\nHe authored the paper \"Some Speculations on the Effects of Nuclear Explosions on Hurricanes\", containing two proposals: Plan A and Plan B. Plan A envisioned using one or two 20-megaton nuclear bombs to destroy a hurricane's symmetry, weakening it and redirecting it back towards the ocean. Plan B envisioned using a single 20-megaton nuclear bomb, or many smaller bombs, to blow the eye of the storm into the stratosphere, which would slow or halt the hurricane. He was amenable to both dropping the bomb from an airplane or launching it from a submarine. He acknowledged radiation concerns but argued that they would be minimal, and did not address potential harm to marine life. He presented these proposals to the 1959 symposium on Project Plowshare and an American Meteorological Society conference, and unsuccessfully sought its inclusion in the International Geophysical Year. His ideas were never tested, likely due to skepticism from other scientists, prohibitive cost, and the risk to nuclear diplomacy between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.\nSince then, NOAA meteorologists have thoroughly rebutted Reed's ideas. They note on their website that a hurricane is orders of magnitude more energetic than a hurricane, releasing the equivalent of a 10-megaton nuclear bomb of heat 20 minutes, meaning that a nuclear bomb would have minimal impact on a hurricane. Furthermore, to reduce a Category 5 hurricane to Category 2, the bomb would need to displace half a billion tons of air, which is not feasible. The NOAA also expresses concern over radioactive fallout reaching land via trade winds.\nIn 1990, the United States ratified the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty,\nReferences"
