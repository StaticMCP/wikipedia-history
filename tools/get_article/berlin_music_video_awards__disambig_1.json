The festival brings together music video enthusiasts, directors, producers, and musicians worldwide to showcase their work and network with other professionals.\nThe festival includes a variety of activities such as screenings of nominated music videos, fashion show, various workshops, DJ sets and live performances. Awards are given in a variety of categories, including Best Music Video, Best Director, and Best Cinematography.\nThe Berlin Music Video Awards provide a platform for emerging artists and established professionals to showcase their work and gain recognition for their cinematographic creativity and skills. The BMVA highlights that anyone can participate, and that quality, originality, and diversity are all valued.\nHistory\nAviel Silook, the producer and manager, founded the Berlin Music Video Awards (BMVA) in 2013. The founder initiated the festival and award ceremony because the concept did not yet exist in Berlin. Initially, it was aimed to be local but in the first year of existence, it became international with participants from Europe and North America. More award categories have been added since then, and international recognition has grown. With the final award coming along with the prize of 6000 euros.\nIn the past, the Berlin Music Video Awards have featured a diverse range of nominees and jury members. Some of the notable nominees have included music videos by artists such as ASAP Rocky, Rammstein, Little Big, Coldplay as well as up-and-coming artists from around the world. However, winners are judged solely on the quality of their work, not their fame or fanbase, and that is what makes this festival truly inclusive. The jury has included industry professionals from various backgrounds, including directors, producers, musicians, and journalists. The Berlin Music Video Awards continue to attract a wide range of talented nominees and industry professionals each year.\nThe BMVA is distinguished by a diverse lineup that includes low-budget productions, newcomers, and internationally recognized artists. As a result, it highlights the state of the art in the current music video industry and recognizes outstanding productions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"5\" |Berlin Music Video Awards (2013–2023)\n|-\n!Year\n! colspan=\"2\" |Category\n!Name\n!Director\n|-\n|2013\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2jn_lxrrPg MeTube (Carmen – Habanera)]\" by August Schram\n|Daniel Moshel\n|-\n|2014\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABS-mlep5rY Fear & Delight]\" by the Correspondents\n|Naren Wilks\n|-\n|2015\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQu-rJEoYQY Can't help myself]\" by Brodinski Feat SD.\n|Megaforce\n|-\n|2016\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_JBKf6IVEA Not Butter]\" by Dillon Francis\n|Brandon Dermer\n|-\n|2017\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktiONWfSL48 Kolshik]\" by Leningrad\n|lya Naishuller\n|-\n|2018\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld92cq6tNFA \"Не Париж (Not Paris)]\" by Leningrad\n|Pavel Sidorov\n|-\n|2019\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRfSM-lv55I We've got to try]\" by the Chemical Brothers\n|Ninian Doff\n|-\n|2020\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkRkuI0ZgX0 Horse]\" by Salvatore Ganacci\n|Vedran Rupic\n|-\n|2021\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddnjNMv6-Ts Остин (Austin)]\" by Zemfira\n|Alexey Krupnik\n|-\n|2022\n|Best Music Video\n|Winner\n|\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK87AKIPyZY This is Not America]\" by Residente ft.

The nominees and awardees of the various music video categories are presented during the ceremony, and the winners of each category are announced and awarded. The festival is usually held in one of Berlin's popular clubs, such as Club Gretchen (2019/2018) or Nuke Club (2017). After-show parties are organised in connection with the award ceremony.\nThe BMVA also provides individuals and professionals in the music industry a lot of networking opportunities. Through a variety of events participants can engage with like-minded artists, producers, directors, and other key industry figures.\nIn the years 2020 and 2021, the award ceremony took place digitally as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The show was recorded at the KitKat Club(2020) and Alex Berlin (2021), who had been cooperating with the BMVA since its early years. In 2020/21, the hosts were Alexandrine Yetundey  and David Hailey.\nAfter two years of online editions, the Berlin Music Video Awards celebrated its 10th anniversary from 8 to 11 June (2022) in Club Gretchen.\nActivities and festivities\nPerformances\nThe show consists of onstage live performances from renowned bands and musicians, like  Little Big (band), Vitalic, and members of The Prodigy. While, Dj sets are also being held at the outdoor area of the festival, with names like Lawya and Jacques being on the decks.\nSilver Screenings\nOne of the most prominent activities during the BMVA is the Silver Screenings, a showcase of music videos that, while not officially nominated, are still recognized for their creativity and artistic merit. In 2024, in the duration of the three days of the festival 160 videos were featured, and the number only grew in 2025, with 250 videos and their creators given the space to be acknowledged and celebrated.\nAfter Party\nDuring the festival days, the BMVA throws its annual After Party, a wild celebration that, in recent years, has taken over the KitKat Club. Known for bold outfits, immersive performances, and an open-minded and free atmosphere, it is a fitting extension of the festival's fearless creative energy.\nThemed dress codes\nEach day of the Berlin Music Video Awards features a different themed dress code, adding to the festival's dynamic and visually engaging atmosphere. One of the highlights is the Experimental Culture Day, known for its bold “Kinky Dress Code” theme. Other themes, such as “Glam & Glitter,” “All-White Elegance,” and “DIY & Sustainable Fashion,” reflect the event's ongoing emphasis on creativity, self-expression, and innovation.\nSomething extra that verified the events' creativity and authenticity was the creation of a tattoo zone at the 2025 awards, where winners could commemorate their achievement with a tattoo. The space was also open to the general attendees as well.\nCategories\nMusic Videos are awarded in the following categories at the BMVA:\n# Best Music Video\n# Best Animation\n# Best Art Director\n# Best Cinematography\n# Best Editor\n# Best Concept\n# Best Director\n# Best Experimental\n# Best Low Budget\n# Best Narrative\n# Best Performer\n# Best Production Company\n# Best Song\n# Best Visual Effects\n# Most Bizarre\n# Most Trashy\n# Best AI Video\nFirst-place winners in all categories receive a BMVA trophy, and the winner of the Best Music Video category receives a cash prize as well.\nThe Best AI category was introduced in the 2025 BMVA ceremony to celebrate innovative use of artificial intelligence in music video production and creative direction powered by AI.\nThe independent jury members are experts in their fields of the (music) video industry or previous awardees. Some of the jury members over the years have been Cheng-Hsu Chung, Alexander Dydyna  and Federico Abib. With new additions being made every year.\nGallery\nFile:Berlin Music Video Awards -.jpg\nReferences"
