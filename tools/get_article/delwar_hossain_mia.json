DELWAR HOSSAIN MIAN is a Bangladeshi police officer and chief of the Highway Police. The Awami League government sent him into forced retirement and reinstated him after the Muhmmad Yunus-led interim government took power.\nCareer\nMia joined the 12th batch of the Bangladesh Civil Service as a police cadre in 1991. He was trained at the Bangladesh Military Academy.\nMia was the superintendent of Dinajpur District. In August 2006, seven people were killed and 300 injured after police under his command and Bangladesh Rifles personnel opened fire on protestors, part of the Nonviolent movement opposing open pit mining in Bangladesh, marching to Asia Energy Corporation (Bangladesh) Pvt Limited to protest the activities at Phulbari coal mine. Mia said, \"The police were forced to open fire after being attacked by the demonstrators equipped with lethal weapons.\"\nMia was appointed deputy commissioner of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police on 6 November 2006.  He enjoyed good postings during the Bangladesh Nationalist Party rule from 2001 to 2006. He was transferred to the Armed Police Battalion in Bogra District, and its commander, M Mahbubur Rahman, replaced him in Dhaka in February 2007.\nIn October 2022, Mia was forced into retirement by the Awami League government, along with Mirza Abdullahel Baqui and Shahidullah Chowdhury. Mia had been deprived of promotions during the Awami League government, citing public interest. The officers were let go because of their alleged ties with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. Days before them, Md Mokbul Hossain, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Secretary, was forced into retirement.\nAfter the fall of the Sheikh Hasina led Awami League government, Mia was brought out of retirement and appointed chief of the highway police.
