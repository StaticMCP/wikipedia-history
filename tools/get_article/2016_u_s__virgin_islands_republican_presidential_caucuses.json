Territorial Caucuses met from noon to 6 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time on St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John as a Convention to vote for Presidential Preference and select at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention.\nThree party leaders—the National Committeeman, the National Committeewoman, and the chairman of the Virgin Islands's Republican Party—attended the convention by virtue of their position. On election day all six delegates were voted to be uncommitted to the national convention in Ohio.\nAll 6 delegates were disqualified by the territorial party and were replaced.  Rubio received 2 delegates, 2 delegates were uncommitted, Ted Cruz received 1, and Donald Trump received 1. At the convention, nominee Donald Trump received 8 of 9 total delegates.\nResults\nTrump's 5th-place finish was his worst performance in the Republican primaries, although all the delegates decided to back him after he was determined as the presumptive nominee.\nDelegates\nRNC Delegates\n# John Canegata (Republican Party Chairman) (automatically a delegate)\n# Lilliana Belardo de O'Neal (RNC Committeewoman) (automatically a delegate)\n# Holland Redfield, II (RNC Committeeman) (automatically a delegate)\nOriginal\n# John P.
