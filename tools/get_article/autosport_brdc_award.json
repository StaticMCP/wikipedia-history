As well as the prestige of winning the award, a test drive in an Aston Martin Formula One car and £200,000 – increased from £50,000 in 2010 – cash prize, the award winner is also presented with the Chris Bristow Trophy.[http://www.brdc.co.uk/sub_page.cfm/title/BRDC%20Awards/section/aboutus/editID/58 British Racing Drivers' Club – Awards]\nMcLaren ended its longstanding partnership with the accolade in January 2019, and was replaced by Aston Martin. The 2019 winner received a test in a Red Bull Racing car at Silverstone, as Aston Martin was the team's sponsor, and test in an FIA World Endurance Championship Aston Martin Vantage GTE car. The Award was not held in 2020, but since 2021, the winner has received a test in an Aston Martin F1 Team car and an overall £200,000 prize fund.\nIn August 2025, it was announced that the 2025 award would not take place, with organisers stating a review of the award would take place before a future relaunch.\nProcedure\nMembers of the public are invited to nominate drivers for the award and a shortlist of six finalists is decided upon by the award's judging panel. The finalists then spend two or three days at a British circuit in mid-November driving different types of car to evaluate their performance as well as interview sessions with the panel. The winner is announced at the annual Autosport Awards in early December.\nPast winners and nominees\n* A total of 134 drivers have been nominated for the prize since it was first handed out.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
