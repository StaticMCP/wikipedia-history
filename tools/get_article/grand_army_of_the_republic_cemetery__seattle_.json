The G.A.R. posts maintained the cemetery until 1922, when they gave the property, excluding of the 526 gravesites, to the city of Seattle.  The association deeded the gravesites to the Stevens Post who hired neighboring Lake View Cemetery to maintain the grounds.\nThe cemetery fell into decline over the following decades, because of confusion over land title, the failure in 1939 to secure WPA project, the imposition during World War II of the Coast Artillery on the grounds, and so on. In 1960, the city attempted to transfer maintenance to the Veterans Administration, either in situ or by moving the graves to Fort Lawton in Magnolia, now Discovery Park, but the VA was unable to allocate  money on cemeteries it did not own, and the graves were never moved. The land surrounding the graves came under the jurisdiction of Seattle's Department of Parks and Recreation.\nIn 1996, the parks department proposed that the park become an off-leash dog-run; in response to this, the Friends of the GAR Cemetery Park formed the next year. Members of the group now staff monthly work parties, are involved in headstone replacement, and perform daily flag raising.\nThe cemetery holds the remains of Medal of Honor recipient Frank Bois (1841–1920), who was honored for heroism while aboard the USS Cincinnati during the Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi during the Civil War.\nSee also\n* Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery (Portland, Oregon)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fgar.org Friends of the GAR Cemetery Park]\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040926013134/http://home.comcast.net/~suvcw1/cemetery/graves/seacem.html Seattle GAR Cemetery – Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, Stevens Camp #1]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040926053422/http://home.comcast.net/~suvcw1/cemetery/graves/seattle.pdf Internees list (PDF)]\n*\n*"
