Similar stupas have been discovered in neighboring Ghazni Province, including in the northern Samangan Province.]]\nCommunities of various religious and ethnic backgrounds have lived in the land of what is now Afghanistan. Before the Islamic conquest, the south of the Hindu Kush was ruled by the Zunbil and Kabul Shahi rulers. When the Chinese travellers (Faxian, Song Yun, Xuanzang, Wang-hiuon-tso, Huan-Tchao, and Wou-Kong) visited Afghanistan between 399 and 751 AD, they mentioned that Hinduism and Buddhism were practiced in different areas between the Amu Darya (Oxus River) in the north and the Indus River in the south. The land was ruled by the Kushans followed by the Hephthalites during these visits. It is reported that the Hephthalites were fervent followers of the Hindu god Surya.|Istakhri|921 AD}}\nThe first mention of a Hindu in Afghanistan appears in the 982 AD Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam, where it speaks of a king in \"Ninhar\" (Nangarhar), who shows a public display of conversion to Islam, even though he had over 30 wives, which are described as \"Muslim, Afghan, and Hindu\" wives. These names were often used as geographical terms by the Arabs. For example, Hindu (or Hindustani) has been historically used as a geographical term to describe someone who was native to the region known as India, and Afghan as someone who was native to a region called Bactria.\nArcheology\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 653-4 AD, General Abdur Rahman bin Samara arrived from Zaranj to the Zunbil capital Zamindawar with an army of around 6,000 Arab Muslims. The General \"broke off a hand of the idol and plucked out the rubies which were its eyes to persuade the Marzbān of Sīstān of the god's worthlessness.\" He explained to the worshippers of the solar deity, \"My intention was to show you that this idol can do neither any harm nor good.\" The people of southern Afghanistan began accepting Islam from this date onward. The Arabs then proceeded to Ghazni and Kabul to convert or conquer the Buddhist Shahi rulers. However, most historians claim that the rulers of Ghazni and Kabul remained non-Muslim. There is no information on the number of converts, although the Arabs unsuccessfully continued their missions of invading the land to spread Islam for the next 200 or so years. It was in 870 AD when Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar finally conquered Afghanistan by establishing Muslim governors throughout the provinces.\n|Nancy Dupree|1971}}\nBy the 11th century, when the Ghaznavids were in power, the entire population of Afghanistan was practicing Islam, except the Kafiristan region (Nuristan Province) which became Muslim in the late 1800s.\nSee also\n* Gandharan Buddhism\n* Gandhāran Buddhist texts\n* Ancient history of Afghanistan\n* Pre-Islamic scripts in Afghanistan\n* Buddhism in Afghanistan\n* Hinduism in Afghanistan\n* Buddhas of Bamiyan\n* Kandahar Greek Edicts of Ashoka\n* Kandahar Bilingual Rock Inscription\n* Gandhara Kingdom\n* Nava Vihara\n* Zabulistan\n* Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.alamahabibi.com Professor Abdul Hai Habibi] See article The Cultural, Social And Intellectual State Of The People Of Afghanistan In The Era Just Before The Advent Of Islam by eminent Afghan historian Abdul Hai Habibi\n* Shahi Coins in the Standard Catalog of World Coins 1901-2000 By Colin R.
