If they fail to agree on these texts, the texts selected by each judge are referred to a deciding judge to select three winning texts from among them. Their decision is final.\n* The judging committees provide reasons for their selection of the winning texts and provide the winners with comments on their texts, if any, for necessary modifications before they are published.\nReferences"
