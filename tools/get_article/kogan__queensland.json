In the , the locality of Kogan had a population of 211 people.\nGeography\nThe locality of Kogan is shaped like an upside-down U with the locality of Beelbee almost enclosed by Kogan. The town of Kogan is in the north-west of the locality. From the town there are four arterial roads:\n* Kogan Condamine Road towards the north-west to Montrose and eventually to Condamine\n* Warra Kogan Road towards the north-east to Warra\n* Dalby Kogan Road towards the south-east to Macalister and eventually to Dalby\n* Tara Kogan Road towards the south-west to Tara\nIn the north-east of the locality, the Condamine River flows from south to north along Kogan's boundary with Warra, while Wilkie Creek flowing from south to north (a tributary of the Condamine) forms Kogan's boundary with Macalister. Wambo Creek flows from south to north-west through the south-western part of the locality and is eventually a tributary of the Condamine River.\nKogan Creek flows from south to north through the locality passing through the township of Kogan; it is also a tributary of the Condamine River.\nThe lower flatter land in Kogan (approx 350 metres above sea level) is used for grazing, while higher peaks of approx 400metres remain as bushland. Most of Kogan is freehold land with the exceptions of Dalby State Forest (), Braemer State Forest (), both in the eastern part of the locality.\nGeologically, Kogan is part of the Surat Basin.\nThe predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe name Kogan derives from an early pastoral run called Kogan Creek owned variously by J.E. Barney (-1848), Joseph King (1838-1849), and Colin J. McKenzie (1849-). The name probably comes from Kogai, one of the Aboriginal tribes from the district.\nIt was a changing station on the Dalby-Roma coach route prior to the construction of the Western railway line. It had a hotel, the Kogan Inn, at that time, but this closed after the demise of the coach route.\nKogan Provisional School opened on 4 October 1897 and closed about 1899. It reopened in 1905 and became Kogan State School in 1910.\nPerth Provisional School opened circa November 1910. In 1922 it became a half-time school (meaning a single teacher shared between two schools) with Brooklyn Provisional School, which opened circa October 1922. Circa November 1925 the Brooklyn school closed and Perth school returned to full-time status, only to close circa November 1926. The location of these schools were described as \"via Kogan\".\nKogan North State School opened on 18 June 1936 and closed on 30 April 1944. The school's location was described \"via Kogan\".\nMillbank State School opened on 24 January 1938 and closed on 28 January 1957. The school's location was described \"via Kogan\".\nThe Wilkie Creek coal mine commenced operation in 1994.

He often painted murals on local buildings to pay his bills. He first visited the town after he returned from military service in World War II, seeking work on cattle stations. He painted murals for the lounge of the Kogan Hotel and the ceiling of the Kogan post office.\nIn 2009, a documentary was made about Sawrey titled Banjo Paterson with a Paintbrush. On 3 October 2009, the documentary premiered at the Art at Kogan festival in the presence of the Queensland Governor, Penelope Wensley.\nSawrey is commemorated in Kogan with a sculpture and walkway. The sculpture titled Bush Friendship is on the Kogan-Condamine Road () and features Sawrey with his friend Nelson \"Darkie\" Dwyer, the former publican in Kogan. It is a lifesize sculpture in bronze and depicts the two men sitting across a table from one another, playing cards (as they often did). The sculpture forms part of the Hugh Sawrey Walk of Fame, which was funded by the Queensland Government as part of the Q150 celebrations. A sculpture of a horse with a rugged stockman on his back and the whip cutting up above his head (themes that Sawrey often painted) forms the entrance to the Kogan Community Centre.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*  — [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/tqqf2h/alma99183592384002061 via State Library of Queensland] — includes brief coverage of Braeside, North Kogan and Millbank Schools.\nExternal links\n*"
