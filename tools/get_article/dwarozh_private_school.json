The school belongs to the Ministry of Education.\nRaising Kurdistan flag\non the Kurdish National Flag Day 17-12-2014]]\nEvery Saturday in this school, three students raise the Flag of Kurdistan, and the principal with the physical education teacher perform the raising of the flag, while performing the Kurdish National Anthem Ey Reqîb. The picture shows the raising of the flag in 2013 and 2014.\nHistory\nIn 2010 many students began to attend the school, both from local and international background. In this year, the school also split into two independent schools.\nOne of the schools is the Dwarozh Typical School, whose name was recently (2007) changed to Hawcharkh. The typical school is for those students who rank top of their classes, with an average of 85 or above when they pass primary school.\nThe other school, Dwarozh Private School, is for those students who come from outside the country, with no regard to their average scores.\nBoth schools are housed in the same building but attendance times are different for each school.\nCurrent state of the school\nIn 2013 the school was renamed \"Dwarozh Private School\" and has both secondary and preparatory school. It still accepts students from outside and inside Kurdistan, and has many non-Kurdish students (Arabic, English, Persian, etc.). Later, it was renamed into Dwarozh Secondary School, and is now only one school where students from local and foreign backgrounds study in the same school.\nReferences"
