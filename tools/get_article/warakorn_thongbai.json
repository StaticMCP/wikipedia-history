After six games in the league, he played three times in the promotion play-offs, scoring the winning penalty to send Khon Kaen United to the Thai League 1.\nThe following year, he was loaned again, this time to Nongbua Pitchaya of Thai League 1. He made eight appearances in the league, scoring once.\nInternational career\nWarakorn has represented Thailand at under-14, under-16 and under-19 level.\nWarakorn scored 4 goals in total in the 2018 AFC U-16 Championship qualification while playing for Thailand U16 against Northern Mariana Islands U16 and Timor-Leste U16.\nIn the 2018 AFC U-16 Championship, he scored 2 goals for Thailand U16 against Japan U16 and Malaysia U16.\nIn the 2020 AFC U-19 Championship qualification, Warakorn scored 2 goals for Thailand U19 against Brunei U19 and Northern Mariana Islands U19.\nHe was called up to the under-23 squad for the first time in August 2021.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Chonburi\n|2020–21\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Thai League 1\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|2021–22\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0\n|-\n|Banbueng (loan)\n|2020–21\n|Thai League 3\n|colspan=\"2\"|–||1||2||colspan=\"2\"|–||0||0||1||2\n|-\n|Khon Kaen United (loan)\n|2020–21\n|Thai League 2\n|6||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||3||0||9||0\n|-\n|Nongbua Pitchaya (loan)\n|2021–22\n|Thai League 1\n|8||1||2||0||1||1||0||0||11||2\n|-\n|Samut Prakan City (loan)\n|2021–22\n|Thai League 2\n|6||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||0||0||7||0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!20!!1!!4!!2!!1!!1!!3!!0!!28!!4\n|}\n;Notes\nReferences"
