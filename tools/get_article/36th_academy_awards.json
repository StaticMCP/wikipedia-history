This ceremony introduced the category for Best Sound Effects, with ''It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World being the first film to win the award.\nBest Picture winner Tom Jones is the only film to date to receive three Best Supporting Actress nominations; it also tied the Oscar record of five unsuccessful acting nominations, set by Peyton Place at the 30th Academy Awards.\nPatricia Neal won Best Actress for her role in Hud'', despite having a relatively small amount of screen time.  Melvyn Douglas won Best Supporting Actor for the same film, making it the second and, to date, last film to win two acting awards without being nominated for Best Picture (the other being The Miracle Worker the previous year).\nAt age 71, Margaret Rutherford set a then-record as the oldest winner for Best Supporting Actress, a year after Patty Duke set a then-record as the youngest winner. Rutherford was also only the second Oscar winner over the age of 70 (the other was Edmund Gwenn), as well as the last person born in the 19th century to win an acting Oscar. This was the only year in Academy history that all Best Supporting Actress nominees were born outside the United States.\nSidney Poitier became the first African American actor to win Best Actor, and was the only winner in an acting category present at the ceremony, as all the other winners were abroad. Upon receiving the wrong envelope, Sammy Davis Jr. remarked, \"wait until the NAACP hears about this!\"\nAn Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge was the first Oscar-winning film to have aired on network television prior to the ceremony.\nAwards\nNominations announced on February 24, 1964. Winners are listed first and highlighted with boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Tom Jones – Tony Richardson, producer'\n**America America – Elia Kazan, producer\n**Cleopatra – Walter Wanger, producer\n**How the West Was Won – Bernard Smith, producer\n**Lilies of the Field – Ralph Nelson, producer\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Tony Richardson&nbsp;– Tom Jones'\n**Federico Fellini&nbsp;– 8½\n**Elia Kazan&nbsp;– America America\n**Otto Preminger&nbsp;– The Cardinal\n**Martin Ritt&nbsp;– Hud\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Sidney Poitier&nbsp;– Lilies of the Field as Homer Smith'\n**Albert Finney&nbsp;– Tom Jones as Tom Jones\n**Richard Harris&nbsp;– This Sporting Life as Frank Machin\n**Rex Harrison&nbsp;– Cleopatra as Julius Caesar\n**Paul Newman&nbsp;– Hud as Hud Bannon\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Patricia Neal&nbsp;– Hud as Alma Brown'\n**Leslie Caron&nbsp;– The L-Shaped Room as Jane Fosset\n**Shirley MacLaine&nbsp;– Irma la Douce as Irma la Douce\n**Rachel Roberts&nbsp;– This Sporting Life as Margaret Hammond\n**Natalie Wood&nbsp;– Love with the Proper Stranger as Angie Rossini\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actress in a Supporting Role\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Melvyn Douglas&nbsp;– Hud as Homer Bannon'\n**Nick Adams&nbsp;– Twilight of Honor as Ben Brown\n**Bobby Darin&nbsp;– Captain Newman, M.D. as Corporal Jim Tompkins, USAAF\n**Hugh Griffith&nbsp;– Tom Jones as Squire Western\n**John Huston&nbsp;– The Cardinal as Cardinal Glennon\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Margaret Rutherford&nbsp;– The V.I.P.s as the Duchess of Brighton'\n**Diane Cilento&nbsp;– Tom Jones as Molly Seagrim\n**Edith Evans&nbsp;– Tom Jones as Miss Western\n**Joyce Redman&nbsp;– Tom Jones as Mrs. Waters/Jenny Jones\n**Lilia Skala&nbsp;– Lilies of the Field as Mother Maria\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Writing (Story and Screenplay -- Written Directly for the Screen)\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Writing (Screenplay -- Based on Material from Another Medium)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'How the West Was Won&nbsp;– James R.

This came five years after his first nomination for Best Actor in 1958's The Defiant Ones. Poitier had been aware of the significance of Hattie McDaniel having won an Oscar in the 1940 ceremony at the time that he accepted his Best Actor Oscar, and he was the only winner of an acting award present at the ceremony.\nIt would take almost forty years for another African-American male to win Best Actor, when Denzel Washington won in 2001 for Training Day.\nSammy Davis Jr. envelope error\nSammy Davis Jr. was accidentally given the wrong winner's envelope when he was supposed to announce the award for Best Music Score for an Adaptation or Treatment, instead announcing the winner for Best Music Score - Substantially Original: John Addison for Tom Jones. After a confused round of applause followed by silence, Davis acknowledged his mistake (joking, \"Wait 'til the NAACP hears about this!\"), and, having been given the right envelope, read the actual winner: Andre Previn for Irma la Douce.\nDavis Jr. then presented Best Music Score - Substantially Original, sarcastically asking \"Guess who the winner is?\" after reading all the nominees.\nSee also\n*21st Golden Globe Awards\n*1963 in film\n* 6th Grammy Awards\n* 15th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 16th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 17th British Academy Film Awards\n* 17th Tony Awards\n* List of submissions to the 36th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nReferences"
