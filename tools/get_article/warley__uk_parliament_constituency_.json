The constituency was represented since its creation in 1997 and until its abolition in 2024 by John Spellar, a member of the Labour Party.\nAs a result of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. Subject to moderate boundary changes, including expansion to include most of the Blackheath ward, it was reformed as Smethwick, first contested at the 2024 general election.\nConstituency profile\nThe constituency had a wide range of housing on the gently hilly West Midlands terrain, with fast transport links to Birmingham, Dudley and Wolverhampton. Workless claimants, registered jobseekers, were in November 2012 significantly higher than the national average of 3.8%, at 7.7% of the population based on a statistical compilation by The Guardian however female unemployment, reflecting a central West Midlands pattern, perhaps with more women homemakers, unusually exceeded male unemployment at 10.1%.\nBoundaries\n|frame=yes|frame-height=270|text=Map of boundaries 1997–2024}}\nWarley was one of four constituencies covering the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, covering the south and south-east of the borough.
