Most of his short stories and novels are set in Canada's Maritime Provinces. He has written several translations of Algonquin, Cree,  and Inuit folklore. His books have been translated into 12 languages.\nEarly years\nNorman was born in Toledo, Ohio.  His parents were Russian-Polish-Jewish; they met in a Jewish orphanage. The family moved several times, and Norman attended four different elementary schools, including in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His mother watched other children while his father was away most of the time. He is one of three brothers.\nAfter dropping out of high school, Norman moved to Toronto. Working in Manitoba on a fire crew with Cree Indians, Norman became fascinated with their folkstories and culture. He spent the next 16 years living and writing in Canada, including  the Hudson Bay area and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. During this time, he received his high school equivalency diploma, and studied later at Western Michigan University Honors College where he received Bachelor of Arts degrees in zoology and English in 1972. In 1974, he earned a Master of Arts degree from the Folklore Institute of Indiana University linguistics and folklore; his Masters thesis was entitled, Fatal Incidents of Unrequited Love in Folktales Around the World.\nFor the next three years, he participated in the Michigan Society of Fellows;  The Cree personal name was published in 1977. Shortly after, his father died in 1996, who Norman had not seen in 20 years.\nCareer\n;Writer\nNorman has been a prolific writer in a variety of styles. How Glooskap Outwits the Ice Giants, The owl-scatterer, and Between heaven and earth are written for juvenile audiences. His books on Canadian folklore include The wishing bone cycle (Cree), Who met the ice lynx (Cree), Who-Paddled-Backward-With-Trout (Cree), The girl who dreamed only geese (Inuit) Trickster and the fainting birds (Algonquin), and Northern tales (Eskimo). Northern Tales, translated into Italian and Japanese, was Norman's first book translated into a foreign language. In Fond Remembrance of Me is not only an English translation of Noah and the Ark stories as told by a Manitoba Inuk elder, it is also a memoir of the friendship that Norman kindles with Helen Tanizaki, a writer who is translating these same stories into Japanese before her death.\nNorman describes The Bird Artist, a novel, as his most conservative book structurally, though not psychologically. Time magazine named The Bird Artist one of its Best Five Books for 1994. It also was awarded the New England Booksellers Association Prize in Fiction, and Norman received a Lannan Literary Award for this book. The Bird Artist and The Northern Lights were finalists for the National Book Award. The Northern Lights was completed with assistance from the Whiting Award. He received the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award from the Academy of American Poets for The Wishing Bone Cycle. In On the trail of a ghost, an article published by National Geographic, Norman writes about Japan's haiku master, Matsuo Bashō's 1200-mile walk in 1689, and the journey's epic log, entitled Oku no Hosomichi. His book, My Famous Evening: Nova Scotia Sojourns, Diaries & Preoccupations was published under National Geographic's \"Directions\" travel series. It includes a chapter on the Nova Scotia poet Elizabeth Bishop.\nThere are also several early books published in small numbers. These include: The Woe Shirt, Arrives Without Dogs, and Bay of Fundy Journal, amongst others.\n;Teacher\nIn 1999, Norman taught at Middlebury College in Vermont.\nNorman became Goucher College's Writer in Residence in 2003. In 2006, he was appointed a Marsh professor at University of Vermont. Norman now teaches creative writing in the Masters of Fine Arts program at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n;Professional affiliations\nNorman has contributed to book review periodicals (The New York Times Book Review; Los Angeles Times Book Review; National Geographic Traveler), participated on literary journals' editorial staff (Conjunctions: Ploughshares), and been a member of the board of directors for PEN New York and PEN/Faulkner group, Washington, D.C.\nPersonal life\nNorman met poet Jane Shore in 1981, and they married in 1984. They have a daughter, Emma.\nNorman and Shore lived in Cambridge, New Jersey, Oahu, and Vermont, before settling into homes in Chevy Chase, Maryland near Washington, D.C. during the school year, and East Calais, Vermont in the summertime. Their friend, the author David Mamet, Shore's Goddard College classmate, lives nearby.\nDuring the summer of 2003, poet Reetika Vazirani was housesitting the Norman's Chevy Chase home.  There, on July 16, she killed her young son before committing suicide.\nHoward Norman's [https://swco.ttu.edu/Sowell/HowardNorman.php papers] are housed in the [https://swco.ttu.edu/Sowell/SowellCollectionSWC.php Sowell Collection] in the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library of Texas Tech University.\nAwards\n*Guggenheim Fellowship\n*National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships (x3)\n*National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship\n*2001, Distinguished Alumni Award, Western Michigan University\n*1996, Lannan Literary Award for Fiction\n*1986, Whiting Award\n*1978, Harold Morton Landon Translation Award\nPartial list of works\n*(1976).
