Its development followed the rise of the study of medieval women in the 1970s and 1980s, and sought to increase the number of and sponsor papers about medieval women, and feminist theory driven scholarship, at the largest international medieval studies conferences, International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo and Leeds IMC.\nIn 2007, the Society had over 1000 members from around the world.\nHistory\n1985 Medieval Feminist Newsletter\nThe origins of SMFS lay in the Medieval Feminist Newsletter, begun in 1985 by the organization's founders, Elizabeth Robertson, E. Jane Burns, and Roberta (Bonnie) Krueger, who were later joined by Thelma Fenster who organised the \"Commentary Column\", and assisted by Colleen Anderson who typed the first newsletters. The founders met at the airport after the 1985 International Medieval Congress at Kalamazoo, Michigan, where \"few sessions had considered women and none had been feminist\".\nRobertson remembers that:\nThe Newsletter was the \"first publication to consider the relationship between feminism and medieval studies\". The Newsletter was illustrated with the image of a dragon chasing the Virgin Mary as she read a Book of Hours, which was drawn by Megan Brill to avoid copyright infringements.\n1992 Society for Medieval Feminist Scholarship\nThe group became SMFS in 1992, driven by a desire to establish more formal networks for communication, funding, and with a view to producing publications. Jacqueline Murray was the first president.\nMedieval Feminist Forum\nSince 1999, SFMS has produced Medieval Feminist Forum, a peer-reviewed journal which became an online-only journal in 2009.\nConnections with other scholarly societies\nThe organization is affiliated with the MLA and the AHA  and has sponsored sessions at annual meetings of these societies. SMFS has also sponsored sessions at other major international conferences, including the International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo, the International Medieval Congress at the University of Leeds, the Medieval Academy of America's annual meeting, and the Australia & New Zealand Association for Medieval & Early Modern Studies.\nThe scholarly organisations and projects Feminist Art History Project and the Society for the Study of Homosexuality in the Middle Ages were founded following SMFS Kalamazoo meetings.\nServices and prizes\nSMFS provides a Mentoring Exchange at most major conferences where it has a presence. It also awards several annual prizes, including one for the Best Graduate Essay, Best First Article of Feminist Scholarship on the Middle Ages, and Best First Book of Feminist Scholarship on the Middle Ages. It also manages a Listserv, MEDFEM-L.\nIn 2014, SMFS hosted a Wikipedia Write-In at the 49th Annual International Congress on Medieval Studies at Kalamazoo, where members were encouraged to contribute their time and expertise to adding and editing articles in their fields.\nSMFS members contribute to the maintenance of the Feminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index, which is hosted by the University of Iowa.\nSMFS is affiliated with the UK-based and regularly sponsors sessions at the GMS annual conference.\nNotable SMFS Members\nMore about notable SMFS Members:\n* Geraldine Heng\n* Jacqueline Murray\n* Jennifer Summitt\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://wmich.edu/medievalpublications/journals/mff Medieval Feminist Forum]"
