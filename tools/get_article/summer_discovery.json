The company is headquartered in Roslyn, New York.\nHistory\nSummer Discovery was founded in 1966 when Mike and Judy Musiker founded Musiker Student Tours. Their sons, Bob and Jimmy Musiker, joined the organization in the early 1980s and assumed ownership in 1992. That year, the organization changed names from Musiker Student Tours, Inc. to Musiker Discovery Programs, Inc. to reflect the multiple offerings available.\nThe first Summer Discovery program began at UCLA in 1986. In 2009, Summer Discovery formed a partnership with Jeter's Leaders, awarding scholarships to attend Summer Discovery programs at colleges and universities in the U.S.\nIn 2010, Summer Discovery partnered with Dream Careers to acquire Career Explorations and form Discovery Internships LLC. In 2020, Summer Discovery ceased offering its Discovery Internships program to focus more on pre-college programs worldwide.\nIn 2018, Summer Discovery was acquired by Verlinvest, which is now the majority owner of Summer Discovery.\nIn 2020, Summer Discovery launched Summer Discovery Online in response to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. This program partners with universities to provide virtual pre-college courses.\nIn 2020, Summer Discovery acquired Summer Institute for the Gifted (SIG). Through Summer Institute for the Gifted (SIG), Summer Discovery provides academic summer programs for gifted, academically talented, and creative students ages 5–17.\nAcademic programs\nSummer Discovery Educational Programs began in 1986 on the campus of UCLA.
