The award was presented to weekly newspaper editors. Named after Elijah Parish Lovejoy, the award was established in 1956.\nPurpose\n}}\nHistory\nThe International Society of Weekly Newspaper Editors (or ISWNE) moved from Southern Illinois to Northern Illinois in 1975. The University of Southern Illinois notified ISWNE that the Lovejoy Award was the property of the university, rather than the organization. Thereafter, the award was not issued, although the award for journalists is still issued by Colby College.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n! Year\n! Name\n!
