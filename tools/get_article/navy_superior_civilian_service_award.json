This is the second highest honorary award under the Department of the Navy Civilian Awards program.\nThis award recognizes employee contributions that are exceptionally high in value, but affect a smaller area than the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award and are more significant than those for which the award of the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award is made.  The Superior Civilian Service Award may be awarded for contributions that serve as a model for other commands. The award consists of a certificate, citation, medal, and lapel bar.\nThe award is presented for:\n:* Indications of innovative leadership of highly successful programs or projects that had impact beyond the employee’s command.\n:* Accomplishments/achievements that have had as a minimum, a wide impact in the Department of the Navy.\n:* Scientific or technical advances, or suggestions of significant value.\n:* Accomplishments that show unusual management abilities, innovative thinking, and/or outstanding leadership, which benefit the Department of the Navy.\n:* Responsibility for major cost savings/reductions/avoidance.\n:* Unusual acts of heroism.\n:* Exceptional cooperative efforts with other Navy offices, Naval civilian employees, Federal agencies, or the private sector.\nNotable award recipients\n* Byron Sjoblom, Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport, 2023\n* Theresa B.
