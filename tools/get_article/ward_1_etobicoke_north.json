It was last contested in 2022, with Vincent Crisanti being elected councillor.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\n2022 municipal election\nMichael Ford resigned his seat in June 2022, after winning election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 2022 provincial election. Vincent Crisanti, who finished second behind Ford in 2018, and who had held Ward 1 prior to the amalgamation of Wards 1 and 2 in 2018, was elected.\nGeography\nEtobicoke North is part of the Etobicoke and York community council. The ward occupies the northwestern part of Toronto. The eastern boundary is the Humber River from Steeles Avenue south to a point just to the east of the Dixon Road. The southern boundary runs west from the Humber River along Dixon Road to Martin Grove Road to Eglinton Avenue to the western limit of the city. The western and northern limits of the ridings are formed by the city limits.\nThe ward contains the neighbourhoods of Rexdale, The Elms, Humberwood, Kingsview Village, Thistletown, and Willowridge.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Council term\n! colspan=\"2\" |Member\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Rexdale-Thistletown (Metro Council)\n|-\n|1988–1991\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Lois Griffin\n|-\n|1991–1994\n|-\n|1994–1997\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ward 5 Rexdale-Thistletown\n|-\n|1997–2000\n| colspan=\"2\" |Elizabeth Brown, Bruce Sinclair\n|-\n!\n!
