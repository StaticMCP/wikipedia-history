He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Kansas City Royals. He also played in the KBO League for the Doosan Bears.\nAmateur career\nSwarzak attended Nova High School in Davie, Florida. As a sophomore, Swarzak pitched to an 11–1 win–loss record with a 1.16 earned run average and 120 strikeouts and was named to the All-County team and second team All-State. In 2003, he finished 14–1 with 142 strikeouts. In his senior season, in which he went 14–2, with 147 strikeouts, Swarzak was named to the 2004 All-County and Class 5A All-State teams. He had committed to attend Louisiana State University (LSU) to play college baseball for the LSU Tigers, but instead chose to sign with the Twins on June 22, 2004, for a $575,000 bonus.\nProfessional career\nMinnesota Twins\n]]\nThe Minnesota Twins selected Swarzak in the second round, with the 61st overall selection, in the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. Swarzak was #15 on the Baseball America Top Gulf Coast League Prospects list in 2004. He was Midwest League Pitcher of the Week (from May 16–22, 2005), the Twins' Pitcher of the Month (May 2005), Midwest League All-Star, and #8 on the Baseball America Top Midwest League Prospects list in 2005. In 2006, he was Florida State League Pitcher of the Week (from August 7–14, 2006) and a FSL Post-Season All-Star.\nSwarzak was one of the top rated prospects in the Twins' farm system before a fifty-game suspension for violation of Minor League drug policy on April 20, 2007, sidetracked his career. He tested positive for marijuana. After having started the season with the Double A New Britain Rock Cats, upon his reinstatement from the restricted list on June 11, he was reassigned to the Class A Advanced Fort Myers Miracle. After three games with Fort Myers, he returned to New Britain.\nHe began the 2008 season with the Rock Cats, and went 3–8 with a 5.67 earned run average. After a promotion to Triple-A, his record actually improved to 5–0 with a 1.80 ERA in seven starts. He was added to the Twins' 40 man roster, and spent his first spring with the Twins in 2009. Following Spring training, he was reassigned to Rochester. Swarzak suffered from a lack of run support in Rochester to start the season. Despite an ERA of 1.59 in his first three starts, his record stood at 0–3.\nHis record improved to 3–4 with a 2.25 ERA when he got the call to the majors on May 20.

His ERA finished at 6.21 in Triple-A Rochester.\nSwarzak rebounded in 2011, contributing both in long relief and in spot starts for the Twins. He pitched a total of 102 innings, going 4–7 in 27 games.\nIn 2012, Swarzak started five games for the Twins while making 39 appearances out of the bullpen, pitching to a collective 96 innings of work.\nSwarzak began 2013 on the disabled list with fractured left ribs he suffered while \"wrestling around a little bit.\" He was activated on April 7 and used primarily as a long reliever for the rest of the season.
