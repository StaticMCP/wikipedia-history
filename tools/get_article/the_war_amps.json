Initially founded to serve war veterans with financial and advisory supports, the non-profit has since expanded their services to assist to all amputees in Canada.\nThe association provides multiple programs that specifically target the needs of child, adult, and veteran amputees. The charity generates funding through the offering of their Key Tag and Address Label services, in which donations are made optional.\nHistory\nThe organization began as The Amputation Club of British Columbia. However, it later became The War Amputations of Canada, eventually shortening to the War Amps.[http://www.waramps.ca/opleg/in_the_field/mary_riter_hamilton.html The War Amps – Operation Legacy – Mary Riter Hamilton]\nServices\n*Key Tags:  Beginning in 1946 war amputees were given work by producing key tags. In 1972, this program began to serve year-round employment for disabled staff. If a bunch of keys is found with a War Amps tag, dropping the keys in a Canadian mailbox will allow the keys to be returned to their registered owner. War Amps reports that the key service has returned more than 1.5 million lost keys.\n*Operation Legacy: A program designed to preserve and commemorate Canada’s military heritage by teaching youth about Canadian wartime history.[http://www.ngnews.ca/Opinion/Letter-to-the-Editor/2012-11-02/article-3113243/History-lesson-available-in-War-Amps-heritage-series/1 History lesson available in War Amps heritage series – Letter to the Editor – The News]\n*Documentaries: War Amps has produced a number of documentaries about Canada's military heritage.[http://blogs.windsorstar.com/2012/10/31/77852/ Learn about Canada’s history from The War Amps Military Heritage Series | Windsor Star]\nNotable contributors\n*Adrian Anantawan, active member and spokesperson\n*Mary Riter Hamilton painted for 'The Gold Stripe', a collection of work chronicling the Great War with all proceeds going to War Amps.\n*Mark Arendz, Canadian Paralympian\n*Talli Osborne, Canadian musician and public speaker\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
