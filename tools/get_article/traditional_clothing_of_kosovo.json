These characteristic Kosovar clothes, are made with a type of loom called a vegjë or vek, which resembles the English spinning jenny and flying shuttle. The motifs and patterns on these garments can be interpreted through prehistoric religion. Triangles, rhombuses, circles, and crosses appear often and symbolize health and fertility. Chromatically, there are three main colors in these clothes, the most symbolic of which is red.\nHistorical origin\nAmong 140 types of traditional Albanian costumes, the Podgur's attire  is Kosovar, differentiated by its variety and is an influence in all other regions. This costume belonged to the majority of the Illyrian and Albanian regions included in the international framework. The clothing items consist of the shirts of men and women, which are wide sleeved with a narrow collar which was buttoned up and a white traditional hat worn by men called plis, leather moccasins or . According to archaeologists of the Museum of Pristina, Podgur's clothing dates back to the 5th and 4th&nbsp;century BC. However, transformations of this costume happened due to different social and cultural situations, technical inventions and also element exchange between the ethnic groups. From field investigation, it has been reported that in the 19th&nbsp;century and the first two decades of the 20th&nbsp;century, women's clothing went through morphological changes.  The 19th-century look consisted of the combing of their hair and braiding them. They also wore red semi-spherical shaped hats which were embellished with tiny gold coins. Around the crown of the hat they wore a tight lace, lidhëse, which was 60&nbsp;cm long. It was tied so that their hair remained hidden. Marhama is a type of material which was worn along their neck and chin, but the embroidered tail of marhama was laid down along the right shoulder, and it was called masdorja.

Their colors were very characteristic and different, such as red, green, yellow and black. Children of rich families had their clothes knitted by tailors and that made them look like any other grown man. From puberty and on, children's clothing becomes more detailed. In this age boys start to wear plis, where as in cold days they wore scarfs and , traditional white woolen pants. In the celibacy age boys wore  (which were always white ), plis and vests. However, children clothing in general is characterized by its simplicity. It consists of a knee length shirt which is made of white fabric combined with vertical shokë which was of chestnut color. The wearing of shokë by children was very rare ; it was only worn during the years they were celibate and wanted to impress women their social circle.

During cold weather, youngsters also wore a certain type of hat called . It was made of woolen threads which were skull-shaped and they covered every part of the head and face except the eyes and nose. Blazers were also part of the youngster attire and were made of soutane, resembling the adult costume. Boys wore shoulder-length hair.\nBefore costumes were knitted by tailors, the models were first cut out in Peć. This was done once a year,  during fall or winter.\nMen's clothing\nMen's clothing was the symbol of beauty at the time. This attire includes a shirt, tëlinat which were long underpants,  a scarf and . There were differences among the clothing of adults, based on their economical standing.

Men of Podgur used to wear white semi-spherical plis. Along with it there was also a scarf made of white fabric which consisted of a few horizontal shokë of different colors. This scarf was circled around plis and covered a part of their head and ears. Scarfs were worn by men of older age, around their forties.
