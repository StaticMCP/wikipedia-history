The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was Georg Heinrich Pertz (1795–1876), who was succeeded by Georg Waitz (1813–1886).\nMany eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen,  (\"Sacred love for the fatherland gives the spirit\"), is explained as linking Romantic nationalism with professional scholarship.\nIn 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in Berlin.\nIn 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the  (\"National Institute for Older German History\"). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of World War II.\nThe institute was later revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings.\nDuring the late 1940s, Margarete Kühn used her work on the MGH as cover for taking the Wiesbaden Codex from Soviet control in Dresden and having it returned to Eibingen and then to the State Library of Wiesbaden.\nThe MGH moved into its current premises in the building of the Bavarian State Library in 1967.\nThe project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.\nDivisions\nThe series falls into five main divisions,  (\"Antiquities\"),  (\"Documents\"),  (\"Letters\"),  (\"Laws\"), and  (\"Authors\"), with an additional smaller division of  (\"Necrology\"). Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use () and special studies ().\nSee also\n* Historiography of Germany\n*Wilhelm Levison\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*  Reprinted in\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mgh.de/fileadmin/Downloads/pdf/MGH-Gesamtverzeichnis_2015_web-2.pdf 2015 list of publications]\n*[http://www.mgh.de/ The MGH homepage]\n*[http://www.dmgh.de/ Digital MGH homepage] , from which the digitized texts can be searched\n*[https://archive.org/search.php?query=monumenta%20germaniae%20historica Monumenta Germaniae Historica on Archive.org]\n* The [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRkUFBfVVqv5Tr2aZS4apFNpTJ-ys6VqeQxgsAI1v7cH5putIgchYWJAVGHuu0lWGmdD2DU7Vb1o7XH/pubhtml?gid=518815483 list of links to scans of MGH volumes] in the \"Links Galore\" spreadsheet"
