Ahmad Shah Durrani was seeking to return to Afghanistan after campaigning in the Punjab. While his forces crossed the ford of the Ravi River, they were ambushed by Sikh armies. The Afghans defeated the Sikhs in the engagement and successfully crossed the river.\nBackground\nAhmad Shah Durrani was leading his sixth invasion of India. After his campaign, his forces traveled through the Punjab and began crossing the Ravi River to return to Afghanistan, when suddenly they were ambushed.\nBattle\nAhmad Shah's forces had begun crossing the Ravi River, when they were ambushed and the Sikhs began seizing much of the Afghan luggage train. Ahmad Shah stood on the bank of the river with his personal contingent of 12,000 men but did not engage in any skirmish until all troops crossed the river. The Afghan forces crossed the river but the Sikhs only continued to grow bolder in their hit and run attacks. Eventually, the Sikhs rode close to Ahmad Shah's camp and unloaded matchlocks near it. After finishing his afternoon prayer, Ahmad Shah rode on horseback with his men and attacked the Sikhs, beginning battle.\nAhmad Shah's troops were quick and made a sally with drawn swords, charging the Sikh forces. With this, the Sikhs retreated from the battlefield, and Ahmad Shah did not pursue them.\nAftermath\nAhmad Shah Durrani returned to Afghanistan following this, and would not return to Punjab until his seventh invasion in 1764–1765.\nReferences"
