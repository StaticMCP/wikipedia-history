Motifs from all these regions would be expected in Chimariko oral literature. (See also Traditional narratives (Native California).)\nSources for Chimariko narratives\n* Dixon, Roland B. 1910. \"The Chimariko Indians and Language\". University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology 5:293-380. Berkeley. (Brief myths, including Theft of Fire, recorded by Alfred L.
