Dedicated to the men and women from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died defending Singapore and Malaya against the invading Japanese forces during World War II, it comprises the War Graves, the Memorial Walls, the State Cemetery, and the Military Graves.\nOverview\nThe War Memorial represents the three branches of the military – the Air Force, Army and Navy. The columns represent the Army, which marches in columns, the cover over the columns is shaped after the wings of a plane, representing the Air Force, and the shape at the top resembles the sail of a submarine, representing the Navy.\nThe Memorial's walls inscribe over 24,000 names of Allied personnel whose bodies were never found, spread over both sides of 12 columns of the war memorial itself. On the Kranji War Memorial the names of 191 Canadian airmen are inscribed.\nThe grounds of the memorial is set on a hilly terrain. The grounds are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and accessible only from Woodlands Road, the same road that the Imperial Guards Division of the Japanese 25th Army had marched down on 9 February 1942.\nKranji War Memorial and Cemetery has been included into the photographic archive by the War Graves Photographic Project in association with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Each individual grave has been recorded together with each and every column on the memorials.\nKranji War Cemetery\nThe War Cemetery is the final resting place for 4,458 Allied servicemen in marked graves laid out in rows on maintained and manicured lawns. Over 850 of these graves are unidentified.\nTowards the north end of the cemetery grounds is the State Cemetery, where Yusof bin Ishak and Benjamin Henry Sheares, the first and second presidents of Singapore, are buried. To the west are the Military Graves for Commonwealth soldiers who died during the Konfrontasi and Malayan Emergency. 69 Chinese servicemen who served as members of the Commonwealth forces and who were killed by the Japanese in February 1942 were buried at the Chinese Memorial. There are also 64 burials for World War I, including special memorials for three men who were buried in civil cemeteries in Singapore and Saigon, and whose graves were impossible to locate until this day.\nPreviously a hospital burial ground during the Japanese occupation of Singapore, it became a military cemetery at the end of the war. Military servicemen buried elsewhere in Singapore were exhumed and reburied at the memorial. The names of Indian servicemen were inscribed on the memorial walls as they had already been cremated, as is customary in Hinduism.\nGallery\nFile:Kranji War Memorial 03.jpg|The Kranji War Memorial during the Remembrance Day Ceremony proceedings on 13 November 2005\nFile:Kranji War Memorial Cross.jpg|Kranji War Memorial Cross\nFile:Kranji War Memorial Inscription.jpg|Kranji War Memorial inscription\nFile:Kranji War Memorial 02.jpg|Kranji War Memorial Cross of Sacrifice\nFile:Inscription on the Kranji War Memorial.jpg|The inscription on the Kranji War Memorial\nFile:Kranji War Memorial 01.jpg|The Catafalque Party mounted by the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police at the Kranji War Memorial during Remembrance Day\nSee also\n* The Cenotaph, Singapore\n* Former Indian National Army Monument\n* Civilian War Memorial\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909153554/http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/what_to_see/world_war_ii_sites/kranji_war_memorial.html Tourism board information]\n* Peter Chou's PBase Gallery [http://www.pbase.com/kepha/kranji/ Kranji War Memorial]"
