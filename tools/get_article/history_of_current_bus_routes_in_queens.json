This change had been approved by the New York City Board of Estimate on April 4.\n*On January 22, 1957, service was extended on a 90-day trial basis by  from the Queens Village LIRR station to the intersection of Springfield Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard, as part of a series of bus changes citywide. The change was approved by the NYCTA on November 29, 1956.\n*On June 30, 1957, service was extended on a 60-day trial basis by  from Springfield Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard to Merrick Boulevard and 233rd Street. The extension was made to encourage more people to use the bus route. Ridership on the temporary extension to Springfield Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard was low, with revenues averaging 23 cents per mile, lower than the 80 cents per mile needed to break even. On August 26, 1957, the NYCTA announced that service would resume terminating at Springfield Boulevard an Merrick Boulevard on September 8, since it was losing $120 a day on the extension to 233rd Street.\n*For a few months in 1957, service was extended to 136th Avenue.\n*On September 26, 1982, wheelchair-accessible buses began operating on the Q27 and 17 other city bus routes.\n*Between 1980 and 1985, buses were rerouted off of Parsons Boulevard between 46th Avenue and Kissena Boulevard, the path it shared with the Q26, onto Holly Avenue and Kissena Boulevard.\n*Peak-direction limited-stop service was introduced in September 2001.\n*Service to Queensborough Community College began on September 9, 2002.\n*Extended to 120th Avenue and Springfield Boulevard in Cambria Heights from Queens Village on January 4, 2004 to replace Q83 service on Springfield Boulevard between Murdock Avenue and Queens Village LIRR station.\n* Overnight trips were extended from Queens Village to Cambria Heights on January 6, 2013.\n*The northern terminal was shifted from Main Street and 39th Avenue to 39th Avenue and 138th Street in August 2014.\n* On June 30, 2024, Flushing-bound Q27 buses were shifted to start at 121st Avenue and Springfield Boulevard.\n*Q27 Limited service was replaced by Rush service on Parsons Boulevard and 46th Avenue which began on June 29, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q28\n|\n* Originally operated by North Shore Bus Company in April 1928.\n* On May 22, 1933, North Shore Bus Company officials said that buses used State Street instead of the route specified in the franchise on Crocheron Avenue between Northern Boulevard and 164th Street due to the poor condition of the roadway. Queens Borough President George U. Harvey had asked Police Commissioner James Bolan to stop the buses from using State Street to the west of 164th Street.\n* On June 6, 1933, it was announced that the route would be revised on June 10, 1933, to go off of State Street between 164th Street and Whitestone Avenue, and instead run along 164th Street, Crocheron Avenue, and Northern Boulevard in accordance with franchise requirements for the route laid out by Queens Borough President George U. Harvey. North Shore, right after being awarded the franchise for the route, submitted an application to modify the service to continue operating along the more direct State Street route. A hearing on the application would be held by the Board of Estimate's Committee of the Whole on June 13. North Shore President Joseph Rauschwerger did not want the route to be shifted to Northern Boulevard as adding the route, which operated every four minutes, to Northern Boulevard, which saw buses every two minutes, would increase congestion. With the June 10 change, service would run from 32nd Avenue and 201st Street in Bayside West, along 32nd Avenue, Cross Island Boulevard (later renamed as Francis Lewis Boulevard), State Street (later renamed 35th Avenue), 164th Street, Crocheron Avenue, Northern Boulevard, and Main Street to the Central Terminal Building on Roosevelt Avenue. Ridership on the route was 1.9 million in 1932.\n* On June 13, the Board postponed action on the request for a week after Mayor O'Brien suggested that the views of residents along State Street should be obtained first. At the meeting, a petition from residents of 164th Street was submitted in favor of the North Shore's application. The North Shore had previously been operating along State Street under a temporary permit from the city. At the meeting, Harvey said he was opposed to the proposed change and that he would ask the police department for permission the route to use 162nd Street instead of 164th Street. At a later meeting of the board on June 20, residents along State Street testified against the restoration of service to State Street. Following that meeting, it was reported that the engineer in charge of the Division of Franchises and the chief engineer of the Board of Estimate were studying the potential rerouting of the route along a street other than Northern Boulevard or State Street. On June 27, 1933, the Division of Franchises issued a report recommending that the Board of Estimate make no changes to the route until the franchise expired in February 1934. It also stated that requests to change the route could be brought up with Borough President Harvey, and that he could request that the Police Department permit service to run along another street to the west of 164th Street. The report said it would make sense to have the bus route run along a better alternative route, potentially straight along Crocheron Avenue.\n* On July 20, 1942, service was rerouted from 32nd Avenue to 33rd Avenue between Corporal Kennedy Street and Francis Lewis Boulevard.\n* On December 21, 1961, the Board of Estimate approved an extension of the Q28 requested by the NYCTA. The proposed extension had mixed support from the Bay Terrace co-ops it would serve, with some residents opposing it since they believed having buses travel down the area's narrow streets would lead to the implementation of parking restrictions and one-way traffic, and would risk the lives of children, while some residents supported it for shortening their walks to the bus. On February 18, 1962, the route was extended from Corporal Kennedy Street and 32nd Avenue to Corporal Kennedy Street and 18th Avenue during a six-month test period to provide bus service to new co-ops. Northbound service would be extended north along Corporal Kennedy Street to 18th Avenue. Southbound service would run along 18th Street to 211th Street, 211th Street to 23rd Avenue, and along 23rd Avenue to return to Corporal Kennedy Street, Service would run every 14 minutes in the morning rush hour, 16 minutes during the evening rush hour, and every 20 minutes other times. This extension was made permanent after the test period.\n* On July 11, 1966, the NYCTA moved the terminals of the Q13, Q14, Q16, Q28, and Q44FS from downtown Flushing to the Flushing Parking Field surrounded by 37th Avenue, Union Street, 138th Street, and 39th Avenue on a six-month pilot basis. The change, which was made at the request of multiple Queens elected officials, was intended to provide shelter for riders and reduce downtown congestion. However, due to immediate opposition from shoppers, who complained that the change forced them to walk four blocks to get from the subway to the buses, businessmen, and elected officials, on July 20, 1966, the NYCTA announced that it would undo the change on July 24. Q13, Q16, and Q28 service would go back to terminating on the north side of Roosevelt Avenue to the east of Main Street, while Q14 and Q44FS service would resume terminating on the east side of Main Street at 39th Avenue.\n* On September 12, 1983, weekday service between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. was extended from 211th Street to the Bay Terrace Shopping Center at 213th Place, running along 23rd Avenue.\n* On July 15, 1988, the MTA Board approved the expansion of the span of service to the Bay Terrace Shopping Center from weekdays between 9:30&nbsp;a.m. and 3:30&nbsp;p.m. to all times the route operated. Previously, service outside those hours had terminated at 23rd Avenue and 211th Street other times.\n* The change was implemented as part of a phased elimination of multi-special school bus service not available to the general public prompted by new federal funding requirements. With the changes in Q28 service, special trips operating over the Q13 and Q28 to Intermediate School 25 and Bayside High School service would be eliminated in September 1988. The extended service would permit transfers to the Q13 route. In addition, westbound service to the shopping center would be rerouted to operate along 18th Avenue and 211th Street between 23rd Avenue and Corporal Kennedy Street, matching the route used by eastbound service. The changes took effect on September 11, 1988.\n* On September 11, 1989, service was modified to have trips start at Bell Boulevard and 23rd Avenue instead of at the Bay Terrace Shopping Center.\n* Limited-Stop Rush service on Northern Boulevard began on June 29, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n* Transferred from NYCT to MTA Bus Company on June 29, 2025 because of the Queens Bus Redesign.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q29\n|\n*Service began in 1921.\n*Formerly operated by Kings Coach Company, and then by Triboro Coach Corporation.\n*Route transferred from MTA Bus Company to NYCT on June 29, 2025.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q30\n|\n*Q17A service began as a New York City Transit route on September 7, 1947, running between Jamaica Avenue and 169th Street to Horace Harding Boulevard and Springfield Boulevard. Service began at 6a.m.\n*The route was then extended along Horace Harding Boulevard between Springfield Boulevard and Little Neck Parkway at the Nassau County Line on August 21, 1949.\n*The Q17A was renumbered to Q30 and extended from Jamaica Avenue-169th Street to Jamaica LIRR station via Archer Avenue on December 11, 1988.\n*On August 29, 1993, two-way traffic on Archer Avenue and Jamaica Avenue was restored between 138th Street and 168th Street, undoing changes that took effect in November 1990. The change was made to alleviate heavy traffic on Jamaica Avenue. Q30 service began running on Archer Avenue in both directions; eastbound buses had been running along Jamaica Avenue between Parsons Boulevard and 168th Street.\n*Short run trips terminating at Horace Harding Expressway and Springfield Boulevard converted into branch to Queensborough Community College on January 7, 2013.\n*Limited-Stop Rush service on Utopia Parkway began on June 29, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n*Queensborough Community College branch was renamed to the Q75 on June 30, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q31\n|\n*Service began in 1932 on the Q31, Jamaica-Bayside West route, by the Bayside Community Bus Corporation. On December 2, 1932, the New York City Board of Estimate had received an application to operate the route from S & C Bus Company. Its application would have the route operate with a five-cent fare instead of the existing two zones of five cents, with the zone split being at Kissena Park. A review of the application would take place on December 9. With S&C's application, the petition of Bayside Community Bus was put off to be done along with the application of S&C. Acting Borough President John J. Halleran opposed this move  as he believed that Bayside, being the existing operator, should get the franchise. Halleran did not support the five-cent fare as he did not believe good service could be provided at that fare level.\n*The Board of Estimate denied Bayside's application to get a one-year franchise for the route on January 23, 1933. Bayside's attorney noted that Controller Charles W. Berry's recommendation to the Board on how Queens bus franchises should be awarded called for the award of franchises to existing operators on a one-year contract to permit the values of franchises to be figured out before final awards for the routes could be awarded.\n*On February 14, 1933, Justice Henry G. Wenzel Jr. of the Queens Supreme Court denied an application by Bayside Community Bus for an injunction against the S&C from operating buses over the route. Wenzel Jr. ruled that the court could not act on a dispute between two bus operators where neither had official authorization. The attorney representing Bayside argued that the company was entitled to exclusive operation of the route, having operated the route since 1930, while S&C began running service over the same route in October 1932.\n*On February 17, 1933, the New York City Board of Estimate provided its final approval to award a one-year franchise to operate the route to S & C Buses with its approval of the form of contract, over the opposition of Queens Borough President Harvey. The company was incorporated on November 17, 1932. The Bayside Community Bus Corporation had petitioned for an additional one-year franchise for the route, and had requested a ten-cent fare for it. The counsel for the Bayside Community Bus Corporation had stated that it had lost money on the route on a ten-cent fare for the previous two years. The attorney for the company had stated that every other existing operator of buses in Queens got one-year franchises from the Board. S&C's attorney had stated that the Bayside company had not been operating the route for four months and had no buses. S & C began operating the S&C's route on February 19, 1933. Service operated every 20 minutes, and would operate every 10 minutes once the company received additional buses.\n*In September 1933, Flushing Heights Bus Corporation applied to the Board of Estimate for permission for the S&C to transfer the franchise for the route to it. On November 17, 1933, the request was denied by the Board of Estimate at the request of Acting Queens Borough President John J. Halleran. He believed the line was unprofitable at its five-cent fare and that the route would end up being abandoned. A Flushing Heights representative stated that the company believed that cost reductions could be obtained and that the route could be operated profitably if it were transferred.\n*Service was discontinued by S&C on September 7, 1935. On September 11, 1935, attorneys for the Bayside Bus Company were told that Mayor LaGuardia was opposed to granting a franchise to any route with fares over five cents. The company had applied to restore service on the route with two fare zones. Officials at the Department of Plant and Structures told the company that it could get a franchise for the route within a day if it agreed to run the route with a five-cent fare.\n*On November 30, 1935, the North Shore Civic Alliance sent a letter to the Department of Plants and Structures requesting that it implement an emergency bus service to replace the discontinued Q31, which had run between Jamaica station and Bayside West.\n*On November 9, 1936, the North Shore Bus Company restarted service on the route as part of its new franchise for all bus routes in Zone B (Flushing and Northern Queens), except those operated by the New York and Queens Transit Corporation. Bayside business owners and residents had requested the restoration of this route. Service would operated from Horace Harding Boulevard and Fresh Meadow Road to 32nd Avenue and 201st Street. Buses would operate along Fresh Meadow Lane, Auburndale Lane, 46th Avenue, Hollis Court Boulevard, 47th Avenue, Rocky Hill Road, 48th Avenue, Bell Boulevard, 35th Avenue, 208th Street, 33rd Avenue, and 201st Street. Weekday service operated every 12 to 16 minutes during rush hours, and every 20 minutes during other times. Service operated between about 6 a.m. to 1 a.m.. Transfers were provided at Horace Harding Boulevard to other North Shore routes to Jamaica and other destinations.\n*In February 1950, the Flushing Heights, Queens, Civic Association requested that the New York City Board of Transportation modify the southern terminal loop of the Q31, arguing that its existing route, which ran along a street with P.S. 173, endangered the lives of children and other people. The Q31's terminal loop had run via Fresh Meadow Lane, 67th Avenue, 173rd Street, and 65th Avenue. The group endorsed a proposal by the Horace Harding Civic Association to move the terminal loop a full block away from 67th Avenue.\n*On November 29, 1956, the NYCTA approved a large number of changes to city bus service to take effect January 22, 1957. As part of the changes, the former Q31 and Q31A routes were consolidated into the new Q31. The Q31A had run from 32nd Avenue and 201st Street to the Queens Village LIRR station. The changes took effect February 3, 1957.\n*On June 30, 1963, service was extended from Fresh Meadow Lane and 65th Avenue to Jamaica Avenue and 169th Street. Service was later extended north from 32nd Avenue and 201st Street. This extension was done on a six-month pilot basis. Buses would run via 201st Street, 33rd Avenue, 202nd Street, 32nd Avenue, 208th Street, 35th Avenue, Bell Boulevard, 48th Avenue, Rocky Hill Road, 47th Avenue, Hollis Court Boulevard, Utopia Parkway, Homelawn Street, 169th Street, and Jamaica Avenue. Service ran every 30 minutes on weekdays, operating between 7:02&nbsp;a.m. and 10:32&nbsp;p.m. southbound, and between 7:47&nbsp;a.m. and 11:20&nbsp;p.m.. Saturday service operated southbound between 11:32&nbsp;a.m. and 6:02&nbsp;p.m., and northbound between 12:17 and 6:47&nbsp;p.m. The extension was  approved on a permanent basis in February 1964.\n*On December 11, 1988, the route was extended on both ends. At the north end, service was extended to 29th Avenue and Francis Lewis Boulevard to allow transfers to the Q76. At the southern end, service was extended from Jamaica Avenue and 169th Street to the Jamaica LIRR station via Archer Avenue. Some trips would start or end at Merrick Boulevard in the morning or early afternoon. On September 16, 1989, service was extended slightly on its northern end to 27th Avenue and Francis Lewis Boulevard.\n*On August 29, 1993, two-way traffic on Archer Avenue and Jamaica Avenue was restored between 138th Street and 168th Street, undoing changes that took effect in November 1990. The change was made to alleviate heavy traffic on Jamaica Avenue. Q31 service began running on Archer Avenue in both directions; eastbound buses had been running along Jamaica Avenue between Parsons Boulevard and 168th Street.\n*Weekend service was eliminated on June 27, 2010, but was restored on April 6, 2014.\n*Service was rerouted along Bell Boulevard to the Bay Terrace Shopping Center on June 29, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign. Service to 27th Avenue and Francis Lewis Boulevard and on 35th Avenue and Corporal Kennedy Street was discontinued. 32nd Avenue service was replaced by the Q28.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q32\n|\n*FACCo began operating the 15 on July 9, 1925.\n* Original southern terminus was Fifth Avenue and 25th Street.\n* Taken over by Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority on March 22, 1962.\n* Became the M32 on July 1, 1974.\n*Renumbered in the 1980s to the Q32.\n*Became shared with MABSTOA and NYCT on June 26th, 1994.\n*In December 2000, the MTA announced plans to extend the span of eastbound service following weekday and Saturday service from 12 a.m. to 1 a.m., and to extend Sunday service from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. to allow western Queens residents to use the bus to return from evening events in Manhattan.

This service, which was requested by Queens Borough President Mario J. Cariello, would run weekdays between 6 a.m. and 12 a.m., and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends and holidays. Rush hour service would be every ten minutes, and every 20 minutes during weekdays off-peak, and Sundays and holidays, and every 15 minutes on Saturdays. Early morning service on this branch was added at some point afterwards.\n*On September 10, 1973, to better serve Rosedale, Q5A service was scheduled to be extended a half-mile to 253rd Street and 149th Avenue, and Jamaica-bound service was rerouted off of Brookville Boulevard and onto 243rd Street.

Many local residents were opposed to NYCTA's plan to consolidate the Q5A and Q5AB routes. Bus service along the seven blocks on Farmers Boulevard between Bedell Street and Merrick Boulevard would be discontinued.\n*On September 13, 1987, the NYCTA implemented a series of service reductions in Southeast Queens, including the combination of the Q5A, which ran to 243rd Street and 147th Avenue in Rosedale via Conduit Avenue, with the Q5AB Bedell Street route, which ran to Rochdale, to form the Q85, with reduced service on Merrick Boulevard. These routes were operated as a single service during late evenings and early mornings.\n*Original western terminus was the 169th Street subway station.\n*Service was rerouted to Jamaica Center on December 11, 1988.\n*In March 1992, merchants in Jamaica criticized a NYCTA proposal to extend the Q85 to Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream as they believed it would divert shoppers from their stores to promote economic development in Nassau County. The proposal was spurred due to surveys showing that people in Southeast Queens wanted additional service to the mall. This extension took effect on September 20, 1992, with buses running to the mall every 25 minutes between 9 a.m. and 12 a.m.\n*On August 29, 1993, two-way traffic on Archer Avenue and Jamaica Avenue was restored between 138th Street and 168th Street, undoing changes that took effect in November 1990. The change was made to alleviate heavy traffic on Jamaica Avenue. Q85 service began running on Archer Avenue in both directions. Outbound trips had run on Jamaica Avenue between Parsons Boulevard and Merrick Boulevard.\n*Q85 limited-stop service began on the Rosedale branch on January 10, 1994 during rush hours eastbound between 4:00&nbsp;p.m. and 7:20&nbsp;p.m. and westbound between 6:35&nbsp;a.m. and 8:50&nbsp;a.m. Limited-stop buses would make local stops between Bedell Street and Rosedale. Service to Green Acres Mall continued to run local.\n*On January 12, 2004, Jamaica-bound limited-stop service in the a.m. rush hour was rerouted to Liberty Avenue and 160th Street from 168th Street and Archer Avenue to match the travel path during the p.m. rush hour.\n*Q85 Limited service was discontinued on June 27, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n*Limited-Stop Rush service on Merrick Boulevard began on June 29, 2025 due to the Queens Redesign.\n*Green Acres branch was renamed to the Q89 on June 29, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q86\n|\n*Service started on June 29, 2025 as part of the Queens Bus Redesign; brand new route replacing the Rosedale LIRR portion of the Q5, supplementing Q85 service on 243rd Street, and bringing new service to Rosedale on 149th Street.

Additionally provides Limited-Stop Rush service on Merrick Boulevard north of Springfield Boulevard.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q88\n|\n*New route created by the New York City Transit Authority.\n*On January 25, 1974, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the route, given that the NYCTA provide annual ridership, loss, and profit data to the city's Franchise Bureau. At the time, it was expected that free transfers would be provided to the Q17, Q17A, Q31, and Q44 bus routes. While Queens Borough President Donald Manes had been assured that bus service would begin in two to three months, the NYCTA's general manager refused to begin service as the city demanded some financial records it did not want to release. The NYCTA had held that its bus operations were only subject to review by the city controller's office, and had fought against efforts by the Franchise Bureau to provide oversight. While the Franchise Bureau previously had no clear authority to mandate that the NYCTA provide financial data, the resolution approving the Q88 route required the NYCTA to provide relevant data after one year of operation. A NYCTA spokesperson, in June 1974, said that it was up to the Franchise Bureau to get an opinion from the corporation counsel to resolve the issue. In August 1974, the city was about to take away NYCTA's authorization for the route and instead award it to Triboro Coach on an experimental basis until August 31, 1975.  The Board of Estimate approved the route after the NYCTA agreed to informally provide the data for the new route without having to allow the city to audit its records.\n*Service started on September 16, 1974, after the New York City Board of Estimate approved a franchise for the route on September 12. The route's original eastern terminal was Springfield Boulevard and Union Turnpike. Bus service initially ran daily except Sundays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 11 p.m.. It ran every ten minutes during rush hours, and every twenty minutes at other times.\n*In November 1974, the NYCTA studied extending the route to serve Queensborough Community College to address the lack of student parking. In December 1974, a free transfer was instituted between the Q88 and the Q17A. The Board of Estimate had approved the Q88 route in January 1974 on the condition that this free transfer be provided.\n*In January 1979, it was announced that Q88 service would be extended from Union Turnpike to Hillside Avenue, with those buses heading along Springfield Boulevard to Jamaica Avenue, on the way to Queens Village Bus Depot, running in service, making stops along Springfield Boulevard, instead of deadheading. Free transfers would also be provided to the Q1 and Q27 for riders continuing south along Springfield Boulevard. The NYCTA decided against extending all Q88 trips to Jamaica Avenue due to a lack of buses. The changes took effect on March 4, 1979.\n*In September 1983, bus service was increased due to increased ridership and the proliferation of gypsy cabs along the route. One additional bus was added to the route to make short-run trips between Queens Boulevard and Queens College.\n* On July 15, 1988, the MTA Board approved the extension of all trips on the route along Springfield Boulevard from Hillside Avenue to Jamaica Avenue to  simplify service. At the time, 40 percent of trips operate to and from Jamaica Avenue, on an irregular basis. The change took effect on September 11, 1988.\n*In April 2001, the MTA announced that the span of Sunday service from 7:10&nbsp;p.m. to 11:15&nbsp;p.m. would be extended. The change, which was estimated to cost $30,000 a year, was to be implemented in June 2001.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q89\n|\n*Service started on June 29, 2025 as part of the Queens Bus Redesign, replacing the Green Acres portion of the Q85.

Prior to the creation of the Q101R, this route was the only local bus route to traverse three boroughs, since Rikers' Island is located in The Bronx.\n*On October 10, 2010, the route's Manhattan terminal was moved from Second Avenue and East 58th Street to avoid obstructing the bus lane for the planned M15 Select Bus Service. The new last stop was moved to East 61st Street between First Avenue and Second Avenue, while a new first stop was established at the southwest corner of East 61st Street and Second Avenue.\n*Q101 service cut from Manhattan and rerouted to Hunters Point Ferry on August 31, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:white; color:black; vertical-align:top;\"|Q102\n|\n*Service started on September 29, 1939, to replace a Steinway Streetcar.\n*Formerly operated by Steinway Transit until 1988, and then by Queens Surface Corporation until takeover in 2005.\n*Starting on April 18, 2010, all service began traveling through Roosevelt Island in the same direction and some closely spaced bus stops on the island were discontinued.\n*Newtown Avenue, Crescent Street, and Astoria Boulevard segment discontinued in favor of operating via 30th Avenue on June 29, 2014\n*Service cut from Astoria and rerouted to Court Square on August 31, 2025 due to the Queens Bus Redesign.
