It is situated on the southern edge of Queen Sirikit Park, opposite Sunday Market (an ornamental fish Market, part of Chatuchak Weekend Market).\nIt was founded after the initiation of Queen Sirikit in order for Thai youth to receive a broader learning. Governor of Bangkok Bhichit Rattakul under instructions from the queen arranged a 2-acre part of Queen Sirikit Garden to build the Children's Discovery Museum. The project started in early 2000, and finished in mid-2001 under governor Samak Sundaravej.\nThe museum consists of three exhibiting buildings, a conference room and service areas indoor and outdoor. The total area is more than 10,000 square metres. It is utilized for activities, learning and recreation. There is a Bangkok Children's Discovery Museum Foundation.\nReferences"
