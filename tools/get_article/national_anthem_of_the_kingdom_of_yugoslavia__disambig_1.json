Accordingly, the official language was thus called Serbo-Croato-Slovene.\nHistory\nAlthough a law on the national anthem did not exist, the anthems of all three South Slavic nations were unified into a single anthem of the Kingdom. It started with the first part of the Serbian anthem \"Bože pravde\", continued with the first verse of the Croatian anthem \"Lijepa naša domovino\", which were in turn followed by first verse the  de facto  Slovenian anthem \"Naprej zastava slave\". The anthem finished with the refrain of the first verse of the Serbian anthem again.\nIt was officially used between 1919 and 1941; there was no official document that declared it invalid or void. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was not in effect after the April capitulation.\nLyrics\n{|\n!Serbo-Croatian and Slovene lyrics\n!English lyrics\n|- style=\"text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\n!Cyrillic script!!Latin script\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|Боже правде, ти што спасе\nОд пропасти до сад нас,\nЧуј и од сад наше гласе,\nИ од сад нам буди спас!\nЉепа наша домовино,\nОј јуначка земљо мила,\nСтаре славе дједовино,\nДа би вазда сретна била!\n𝄆 Напреј застава славе,\nНа бој јунашка кри!\nЗа благор очетњаве\nНај пушка говори! 𝄇\nБоже спаси, Боже храни\nНашег Краља и наш род!\nКраља Петра, Боже храни,\nМоли ти се сав наш род.\n|Bože pravde, ti što spase\nOd propasti do sad nas,\nČuj i od sad naše glase,\nI od sad nam budi spas!\nLijepa naša domovino,\noj junačka zemlja mila,\nStare slave djedovino,\nDa bi vazda sretna bila!\n𝄆 Naprej zastava slave,\nNa boj junaška kri!\nZa blagor očetnjave\nNaj puška govori! 𝄇\nBože spasi, Bože hrani\nNašeg Kralja i naš rod!\nKralja Petra, Bože hrani,\nMoli ti se sav naš rod.\n|}\n|God of Justice; Thou who saved us\nwhen in deepest bondage cast,\nHear Thy Serbian children's voices,\nBe our help as in the past.\nOur beautiful homeland,\nOh heroic, dear land,\nFatherland of old glory,\nMay you be forever blissful.\n𝄆 Onward, banner of glory,\nto battle, heroic blood!\nfor the sake of the fatherland\nlet the rifles sound! 𝄇\nGod save, God sustain,\nOur king and our people!\nGod sustain King Peter,\nAll our people pray to you.\n|}\nSee also\n* „Hej Sloveni“\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
