Krebs (born January 13, 1944) is a former Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.\nBiography\nKrebs is a 1961 graduate of Annville-Cleona High School. He earned a degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1965, an M.S. from University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1967, and a Ph.D. from Michigan State University in 1970.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, he served as a professor of economics at Lebanon Valley College in Annville.\nHe was first elected as a Democrat to represent the Lebanon-based101st legislative district in 1990 and joined the Republican party in December 1993. He became known for his expertise in education.\nTo date, he is the last Democrat to represent a significant portion of traditionally heavily Republican Lebanon County at the state level.\nIn 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of \"Smartest Legislators,\" noting that \"His moderate, common sense approach to solving problems will be missed in the House.\" He retired prior to the 2002 election.\nIn 2021, Krebs announced he would launch a campaign as an independent for the special election in the 48th senatorial district after the death of Dave Arnold. Krebs came in last of the four candidates on the ballot.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* official PA House profile (archived)"
