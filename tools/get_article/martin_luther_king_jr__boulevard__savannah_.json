Located to the west of Montgomery Street, at the western edge of Savannah's downtown, it runs for about  from West River Street in the north to Exchange Street in the south. Originally called West Broad Street, it was renamed for Martin Luther King Jr. in 1991. A memorial bust of King Jr., designed by Italian sculptor Franco Castelluccio and approved by his family, was officially unveiled at Martin Luther King Jr. Park in Savannah's Plant Riverside District on January 15, 2022. The memorial is located at the northern terminus of the boulevard, overlooking the Savannah River.\nThe section between West Bay Street and West Oglethorpe Avenue is part of State Route 25.\nThe street's northern section passes through the Savannah Historic District, a National Historic Landmark District.\nThe Savannah Tribune formerly had its offices on West Broad Street.\nFrogtown\nat the turn of the 20th century. It was demolished in 1963]]\nAfter the American Civil War, freed slaves began to settle in the area, which had become known as Frogtown, due to the proliferation of frogs that appeared in the neighborhood after rains. It became a thriving black business district, with movie theaters, markets, grocery stores, funeral homes, shoe repair, tailors, insurance companies and financial institutions; in the 1960s, however, an overpass was built, connecting the eastern terminus of Interstate 16 to Montgomery Street. This negatively affected trade. Savannah's Union Station, which once stood on what was then West Broad Street, was demolished in 1963 as part of the development. The area is now known as an Enterprise Zone, with the City of Savannah offering financial incentives to businesses that opt to invest in the area via land improvement and/or the creation of jobs.\nIt is believed Savannah singer/songwriter Johnny Mercer used to visit West Broad Street to listen to \"race\" music.\nNotable buildings and structures\n, 227 Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, completed in 1856]]\nBelow is a selection of notable buildings and structures on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, all in Savannah's Historic District.
