Following an impressive training camp and preseason, Warren made the final roster on August 31, 2022.\nAfter signing with Pittsburgh, it was revealed that Warren is a cousin of former NFL RB Willie Parker, who also signed with the Steelers after going undrafted.\nWarren got his first professional start in Week 1 against the Cincinnati Bengals. In the 23–20 Steelers victory, Warren had three carries for seven yards. He scored his first career touchdown on December 18, 2022 on a two yard rushing touchdown against the Carolina Panthers in a 24–16 win for the Steelers.\nOn New Years Day, 2023, Warren had 12 carries for 76 yards, he also caught three passes for 22 yards, totaling 98 all purpose yards in the narrow 16–13 road victory. Though he did not score a touchdown, it was statistically Warren's best game during the season.\nAs a rookie, he finished with 77 carries for 379 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go along with 28 receptions for 214 receiving yards.\n2023 season\nDespite a slow start to the season, 2023 would prove to be a breakout year for Warren. On September 10, against the San Francisco 49ers, Warren only had three carries for six yards. He also caught five passes of six targets for 12 yards. In total for the game, Warren was only able to eclipse 18 all purpose yards in the 30–7 loss.\nThe following week on Monday Night Football, Warren made six carries for 20 yards. However, he caught four passes for 66 yards. This would be the first game of his professional career where he had more receiving yards than rushing and totaled 86 all purpose yards. He wouldn't record his first touchdown of the season until Week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams in which he recorded a 13 yard rushing touchdown.\nAhead of Week 12 against the Green Bay Packers, Warren was named the starting running back over Najee Harris. In the game, Warren had 15 carries for 101 yards and a touchdown. This was the first game of his professional career to surpass 100 rushing yards in the Steelers victory.\nWarren was able to clinch another 100+ yard game the following week against the Cleveland Browns. He had nine carries for 129 yards and one rushing touchdown. His single touchdown was a 74 yard run to put the first score on the board for the team. It was also the only touchdown scored by the Steelers in a narrow 13–10 loss. Despite the loss, the game eclipsed any previous performance Warren had statistically with 145 all purpose yards.\nIn a must-win scenario for the Steelers to keep their playoff hopes alive against the Seattle Seahawks on New Year's Eve, Warren was able to score the first touchdown of the game from either team when he was able to score on an 18 yard touchdown run. Warren finished the road victory with 13 carries for 75 yards and one touchdown. He also caught four passes for 23 yards.\nWarren got to see the field during the post-season for the first time of his career in the AFC Wildcard Round against the Buffalo Bills. During the game, Warren had eight carries for 38 yards. He was able to make two receptions on two targets as well for 16 yards. Warren and the Steelers finished their season losing to the Bills 31–17.\nHe finished his sophomore season having played in all 17 regular season games and one post-season game. He had 149 carries 789 yards, four touchdowns and caught 61 passes for 370 yards. He had amassed 1,229 all purpose yards throughout all 18 games.\n2024 season\nEarly in the 2024 offseason, Warren and fellow running back Najee Harris were praised by Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin as \"strong-minded runners\" who \"run to the fight\".\nDuring a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills, Warren left the field with a hamstring injury, knocking him from the final preseason game and leaving it questionable whether he would play in Week 1 or not. Ultimately, Warren played in Week 1's matchup against the Falcons, getting two carries for seven yards as well as catching two passes for 13 yards. Warren had his best statistical game of the season during the Steelers' 28–27 victory over the Washington Commanders. In the game, he had 14 carries for 66 yards and caught two passes for 29 yards, accumulating 95 all purpose yards, the closest he came to the century mark following his preseason injury. On November 21, 2024, Warren scored his first touchdown of the season on a three yard run for the Steelers' first touchdown of the game in the fourth quarter. Warren and the Steelers finished the game with a 19–24 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Monday Night Football.\nHe finished the regular season with 120 carries for 511 yards and one touchdown as the team finished with a 10–7 record, giving Warren another playoff appearance. In the AFC Wild Card round against division rivals Baltimore Ravens, Warren had two carries for six yards while also catching four passes for 19 yards as the Steelers lost 28–14, ending their season.\n2025 season\nduring training camp in 2025]]\nOn April 22, 2025, Warren re-signed with Pittsburgh on a one-year restricted free agent tender worth $5.3 million. Since the team did not re-sign Najee Harris in the 2025 offseason, Warren was anointed the starting running back position ahead of Kenneth Gainwell as well as Kaleb Johnson. On September 1, he signed a two-year contract extension through the 2027 season.\nWarren made his first start of the season on September 7 against the New York Jets. During the game, he had 11 carries for 37 yards (3.4 Y/A), he also had two catches for 22 yards. He scored a touchdown on a four yard pass from Aaron Rodgers in the fourth quarter, helping the Steelers claim a narrow 34-32 victory. Through his following two games of the season, Warren recorded a total of 25 carries for 85 yards, averaging 3.4 yards per carry. Prior to Week 4's victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Ireland, Warren was ruled out with a knee injury.\nHe returned from his knee injury following Pittsburgh's Week 5 bye to play against the Cleveland Browns. During the Steelers' 23-9 division win, Warren recorded 11 carries for 52 yards, his most yards on the season up to that point, as well as catching two passes for 11 yards.\nNFL career statistics\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"2\"| Fumbles\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! 2022 !!PIT\n| 16 || 0 || 77 || 379 || 4.9 || 31 || 1 || 28 || 214 || 7.6 || 26 || 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n! 2023 !!PIT\n| 17 || 0 || 149|| 784|| 5.3|| 74|| 4|| 61|| 370|| 6.1 || 30 || 0 || 4|| 2\n|-\n! 2024 !!PIT\n| 15 || 0 || 120 || 511 || 4.3 || 22 || 1 || 38 || 310 || 8.2 || 29 || 0 || 2 || 1\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WarrJa01.htm Career] !! 48 !! 0 !! 346 !! 1,674 !! 4.8 !! 74 !! 6 !! 127 !! 894 !! 7.0 !! 30 !! 0 !! 7 !! 3\n|}\nPostseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"5\"| Receiving\n! colspan=\"2\"| Fumbles\n|-\n!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!  !!\n|-\n! 2023 !!PIT\n| 1 || 0 || 8 || 38 || 4.8 || 12 || 0 || 2 || 16 || 8.0 || 16 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WarrJa01.htm Career] !! 1 !! 0 !! 8 !! 38 !! 4.8 !! 12 !! 0 !! 2 !! 16 !! 8.0 !! 16 !! 0 !! 0 !! 0\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.steelers.com/team/players-roster/jaylen-warren/ Pittsburgh Steelers bio]\n*[https://okstate.com/sports/football/roster/jaylen-warren/9688 Oklahoma State Cowboys bio]\n*[https://utahstateaggies.com/sports/football/roster/jaylen-warren/8623 Utah State Aggies bio]\n*[https://snowbadgers.com/sports/football/roster/jaylen-warren/2393 Snow College Badgers bio]"
