It was part of the 13th Infantry Division.\nFormation and campaigns\nThe infantry regiment was formed on 29 October 1811 from the companies of the Uglich infantry and Moscow, Arkhangelsk and Kazan garrison regiments.\nFor participation in the Patriotic War of 1812 and War of the Sixth Coalition, the regiment was awarded the \"campaign for military distinction\". On 14 February 1831, one battalion of the Vilnius Regiment was separated to form the Prague Infantry Regiment, which was replaced by a battalion of the Yaroslavl Regiment.\nOn 28 January 1833, the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 48th Jaeger Regiment were added to the infantry formation, and the Vilnius Regiment was renamed into a Jaeger Regiment. On 22 February 1845, the regiment was assigned a battalion of the Jaeger Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich Regiment, and on 16 December of the same year, the 2nd and 3rd battalions were detached from the regiment to form the Kuban Jaeger Regiment.\nOn 14 November 1853, the regiment defeated the Ottomans at Akhaltsikhe, for which it was awarded the St. George Banner with the corresponding inscription. For its participation in the Crimean War, the regiment was awarded badges on its headdresses with the inscription - for the 1st and 2nd battalions: \"For distinction in 1854 and 1855\", for the 3rd and 4th battalions: \"For distinction in 1853, 1854 and 1855.\"\nOn 17 April 1856, the regiment was redesignated an infantry regiment. On 25 March 1865, the troop number 52 was added to the regiment's name, and from 30 September 1876 to 5 October 1905, the regiment's chief was Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, who was again appointed chief of the Vilnius Regiment on April 14, 1909.\nFrom 4 December 1873, the regiment was stationed in Feodosia, in the rifle barracks on Voennaya (now Viti Korobkova) Street. The transfer was carried out gradually, initially the camp assembly was near Kerch, and the general divisional assembly near Sevastopol. Only the headquarters and two battalions were stationed in Feodosia. Later, after the entire regiment was transferred to Feodosia, it was allocated two barracks complexes for accommodation - the so-called \"gray\" barracks (Fedko Street, house No. 38) and the \"Vilno\" barracks (Viti Korobkova Boulevard, house No. 14), as well as the buildings of the bankrupt mechanical establishment of engineer Maslyannikov, converted to accommodate the regimental supply train. From 7 to 11 companies of the regiment were housed in the \"gray\" barracks at different times.\nDuring the Russo-Turkish War, the regiment guarded the Crimean coast from Feodosia to Sudak. During peacetime, the regiment played a major role in the public life of Feodosia, organized parades on holidays, the regiment's orchestra played on the city boulevard during public festivities (on Sundays, Tchaikovsky's ceremonial overture \"The Year 1812\" was always performed, accompanied by the ringing of bells and pistol shots), the regiment's officers were eligible bachelors in the city.\nOn 23 June 1905, the 2nd company of the regiment fired on the Potemkin, which was loading coal in the Feodosia port, after which the ship weighed anchor and sailed to the shores of Romania.\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1905, individual companies of the regiment were repeatedly called upon to disperse strikes and demonstrations in the Taurida Governorate.\nIn August 1914, as part of the 13th Infantry Division, the regiment left for the front of World War I. The regiment participated in the Battle of Yanchinsky and Brusilov Offensive.\nRussian Revolution and Civil War\nThe regiment began to disintegrate after the publication of Order No. 1 and agitation by socialist parties. In the spring of 1917, the regiment's royal titles were stripped and the regiment's reserves refused to obey orders to the front. Later, the soldiers were finally persuaded to obey the order.\nThe regiment was disbanded after the October Revolution. Many of the regiment's servicemen returned to Feodosia. Some of them formed the Union of St. George Cavaliers and participated in the April uprising, which was suppressed by the Bolsheviks.\nThe regiment was revived in December 1918 in the Armed Forces of South Russia and the Army of Wrangel. It was part of the 13th Division of the 2nd Army Corps. Initially, in October 1918, the Vilnius residents were part of the Combined Crimean Infantry Regiment, then they formed a company in the combined battalion of the 13th Infantry Division. In February, they were already fighting at Perekop, in March, with the partisans in the Feodosia district, then, at the Ak-Monay positions.\nOn , the Vilnius Regiment landed on the Kagul near Koktebel, attacking Red Army units from the rear, and thus contributing to their defeat and occupation of Feodosia. By 1 August, the Vilnius regiment already comprised a battalion of three companies with 80 bayonets each, and fought against the Bolsheviks, the Ukrainian People's Army, and Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine. The regiment was restored on 23 November 1919, consisting of six companies.\nOn , the remnants of the Alekseev partisan regiments, the Combined Grenadier Division, and the Simferopol officer regiment (50 officers) were incorporated into the regiment as the 2nd Battalion. The Alekseevites again became an independent unit, and the regiment, as part of the 13th Division, participated in the Northern Taurida Operation and the Siege of Perekop.\nDuring the Evacuation of the Crimea, the rear units of the regiment located in Feodosia did not depart and were captured by units of the 9th Rifle Division of the Red Army under the command of Nikolay Kuibyshev. On the very first night, from 16 November to 17 November 1920, by order of the commissar of the 9th Division M. Lisovsky, all wounded officers and soldiers of the regiment's convalescent team, about a hundred people in total, were shot at the Feodosia railway station. Perhaps this was revenge on the captured enemy, since the 9th Red Division repeatedly met with the Vilnius Regiment on the fields of Northern Taurida.\nRegiment Chiefs\n* 27.04.1812 – xx.08.1812 — Colonel Alexander Yakovlevich Guberti\n* 30 September 1876 – 5 October 1905 - Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich\n* 14 April 1909 – 4 March 1917 - Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich\nRegiment commanders\n(In pre-revolutionary terminology, a commander meant an acting chief or commander).\n* 29.10.1811 – 10.11.1811 – Colonel Bykov, Alexander Nikolaevich\n* 10.11.1811 – 27.04.1812 – Colonel Guberti, Alexander Yakovlevich\n* 27.04.1812 – 01.06.1815 — Colonel Fyodor Konstantinovich Fomin\n* 01.06.1815 – 05.03.1817 – Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Ermolaevich Burman\n* 15.03.1817 – 28.02.1829 – lieutenant colonel (since 04.10.1820 colonel) Ustin Vasilievich Levandovsky\n* 01.04.1829 – 21.05.1829 – Colonel Novitsky 2nd\n* 12.05.1829 – 15.06.1832 – Colonel Andrei Varfolomeevich Aslanovich\n* 15.06.1832 – 11.11.1835 – commander lieutenant colonel 2nd, Ivan Kuzovlev\n* 11.11.1835 – 25.11.1836 – commanding colonel Egor Egorovich von Brink\n* 14.12.1836 – 01.01.1845 – colonel (since 08.09.1843 major general) Vasily Vasilyevich Gubarev\n* 04.01.1845 – 11.04.1855 – lieutenant colonel (since 22.07.1846 colonel, since 19.04.1853 major general) Arkady Bogdanovich von Leringhof Freytag\n* 30.06.1855 – 17.09.1855 – Colonel Victor Maksimovich Shlikevich\n* xx.xx.1855 – 30.08.1863 – colonel Zakhariy Nikiforovich Altukhov\n* 21.09.1863 – 15.04.1866 – Colonel Georgy Dmitrievich Skordulli\n* 25.04.1866 – xx.xx.1866 – Colonel Alexander Petrovich von Klosterman\n* 1866 – 22.03.1875 – Colonel Dmitry Aleksandrovich Spichakov\n* 22.03.1875 – 23.06.1878 – Colonel Sakerdon Alekseevich Gordanov\n* 23.06.1878 – 20.12.1881 – Colonel Nikolai Dmitrievich  Ivanov\n* 20.12.1881 – 02.05.1882 – Colonel Nikolai Lvovich Boltin\n* 02.05.1882 – 13.05.1886 – Colonel Georgy Aleksandrovich Kushakevich\n* 25.05.1886 – 22.01.1892 – Colonel Andrei Konstantinovich Huck,\n* 22.01.1892 – 14.01.1898 – colonel (since 14.05.1896 major general) Alexander Yakovlevich Ivanitsky\n* 05.02.1898 – 12.10.1902 – Colonel Golembatovsky, Mikhail Grigorievich\n* 03.11.1902 – 23.06.1906 – Colonel Alexander Antonovich Gertsyk\n* 24.07.1906 – 04.12.1912 – colonel (since 29.10.1911 major general) Evgeny Yakovlevich Kotyuzhinsky\n* 04.12.1912 – 19.08.1915 – colonel (since 16.05.1915 major general) Alexander Alexandrovich Shvetsov\n* 19.08.1915 – 28.09.1916 – Colonel Pyotr Gavrilovich Vasiliev-Chechel\n* 28.09.1916 – 10.06.1917 – Colonel Konstantin Konstantinovich Dorofeev\n* 19.08.1917 – xx.xx.xxxx – Colonel Mikhail Matveevich Korolev\nOther formations of this name\n* Vilnius Musketeer Regiment – formed on 29 August 1805.
