Mosquitia\n| combatant2        = Naso people\n}}\nBefore the Mosquitian conquest of Boca Toro in 1758, the island—called by the natives as Tojar and its surrounding coastal territories—was inhabited by the Toxares (Naso) and Dorasque. These Indigenous groups occupied the area extending from the Teribe and Changuinola rivers to Bahía del Almirante and Bocas del Toro, maintaining active trade and cultural exchange networks across the Caribbean and Pacific slopes of Veragua.\nSpanish colonial sources from the 17th century describe these communities as numerous, warlike, and independent of Spanish authority. Repeated conflicts among the native polities, coupled with Spanish missionary relocations, gradually weakened their resistance. In 1697, Franciscan friars, fearing the growing influence of the Miskito and English coastal raids, forcibly resettled many Térraba families to the Pacific side, founding new mission towns such as San Francisco de Térraba and Cabagra. This displacement reduced the Indigenous population along the Caribbean littoral but did not bring the region under effective Spanish control.\nBy the early 18th century, the Bocas del Toro archipelago had become infamous as a refuge for independent native groups who fiercely resisted all outsiders. The Toxares, described by contemporary British sources as “perfidious and savage,” were said to attack foreign traders and seafarers who entered their domain. In 1757, when a Miskito crew was massacred near Boca del Drago, Superintendent Robert Hodgson urged King George I of Mosquitia and his governor Timothy Briton to suppress the hostile groups.\nThe following year, in August 1758, a coordinated Mosquitian expedition led by the King and Governor Briton attacked and destroyed the Toxares strongholds on Tojar Island (Colon). The assault—carried out with hundreds of Zambo-Miskito warriors and a small number of British mariners—resulted in the annihilation or enslavement of the island's inhabitants. Contemporary Spanish and British accounts describe the campaign as marking the end of the Toxares dominance and the establishment of Mosquitian sovereignty over Boca Toro and its adjoining islands and lagoons.\nThis conquest consolidated Mosquitian influence across the western Caribbean frontier, extending its recognized domain from the Aguán River to Boca Toro. It was later acknowledged by Spain in 1803, which officially admitted the territory to be “in the power of the Mosquito Indians.”\nReferences"
