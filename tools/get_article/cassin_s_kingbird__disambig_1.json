The name of this bird commemorates the American ornithologist John Cassin.\nTaxonomy\nCassin's kingbird was formally described in 1826 by English naturalist William Swainson under the current binomial name Tyrannus vociferans. The type locality is Temascaltepec, Mexico. The specific epithet vociferans is Latin for \"shouting\".\nTwo subspecies are recognised:\n* T. v. vociferans Swainson, 1826 – southwest USA to central Mexico\n* T. v. xenopterus Griscom, 1934 – southwest Mexico\nDescription\nAdults have a gray head with slightly darker cheeks; a dark unforked tail with a buffy fringe and gray-olive underparts. They have a pale throat and deep yellow lower breast.\nJuveniles are duller and have pale edges on their wings.\nMeasurements:\n* Length:\n* Weight:\n* Wingspan: 41&nbsp;cm\nSimilar species\nComparison of a Cassin's (on the left) and western kingbird\nCassin's kingbird and the western kingbird are similar in appearance. Cassin's is a little larger than the western and the upper parts are a darker gray than the western. The most distinctive difference between these birds is that the Cassin's has a thin white edge along the distal end of the tail feathers, while the western kingbird has a thin white edge that runs along the side of the tail feathers. This difference can be seen in the adjacent image.\nDistribution and habitat\nU.S. Government lithograph of Cassin's kingbird\nIn the summer, these birds can be found in California and from Montana to Utah, along the eastern Rocky Mountains. Their habitat includes rangelands and savannas.\nThese birds migrate to their winter quarters between Southern California and northern Central America. They are permanent residents in south-central Mexico, and their main wintering ranges are west of the Gulf of California on Baja California Sur, and east of the sea on the mainland of western Mexico.\nBehavior\nThey build a bulky nest on a horizontal tree limb in mid-story or the canopy of trees. The three to five spotted white eggs have an incubation period of 18 to 19 days.\nThe Cassin's kingbird primarily feeds on insects it preys upon from high perches by hawking. It also eats berries and fruits in lesser quantities.\nThe call is a high-pitched shorter followed by a longer chirp, sounding like chi-beer.\nLike many other flycatchers, Cassin's kingbirds will often pump their tail up and down while perched in order to deter predators.\nMating ritual\nIn early spring, presumably after having chosen (or shown up with) their mate, they launch into a peculiar dance. With excited high-pitched calls, they hover in unison, wings outstretched, over a favorite perch. This dance takes place several times a day over several days, over several separate sites in an area covering . The sites chosen for the dance appear to be the same sites used as hunting perches during the spring and summer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140116073506/http://coaloilpoint.ucnrs.org/COPRAlbum/FieldBirds/DAlbum8/pages/eCassinsKingbird_jpg.htm Photo of Cassin's kingbird at Coal Oil Point Reserve - UCNRS.org]\n*\n*\n*"
