The graphics are thrown in indiscriminately, without proper placement. No serious thought seems to have gone into how, and where it should be placed. So we have graphics – that too of the mediocre variety – intruding almost throughout the narration\". S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu wrote, \"Dialogue by Pugazhmani is crisp. Produced by N. Radha, the story, screenplay and direction have been taken care of by Ramanarayanan. It is a low budget bhakti sentiment film for women\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
