Barky (Marty Denniss) is 25 years old and returning to Sydney after two years of living in the northern sugar cane growing areas. He has returned home to attend the funeral of his father. The film begins with Barky's arrival at Central station at dawn, seeking the whereabouts of his brother, Wace (Hugh Jackman). We learn from flashbacks that he left home two years ago to escape the clutches of his father's violent rages. Wace, the older brother, is not too happy about Barky's prolonged absence, having been left to manage looking after their father in his last years of life. After walking through the streets he finds an old mate of his, Wayne (Joel Edgerton), who informs him of the location of his brother. He succeeds in finding his brother through the help of Wayne and friends, who all end up at a pub where it is revealed that Barky and Wace's mother left the family fifteen years earlier and that Wace hastened his father's death after he was struck down by a stroke. Barky also crosses paths with his ex-girlfriend, Lanny, and manages to rekindle the relationship.\nCast\n* Marty Denniss as Barky\n* Hugh Jackman as Wace\n* Joel Edgerton as Wayne\n* Andrew Wholley as Coppa\n* Leah Vandenberg as Lanny\n* Aaron Blabey as Trunny\n* Paul Dawber as Father\n* Roy Billing as Ticket Officer\n* Roxane Wilson as Eve\n* Mercia Deane-Johns as Barmaid\nProduction\nThe film was shot in the streets of Newtown, Millers Point, and Chippendale, New South Wales, including inside Bob Gould's bookshop in Newtown and the Hollywood Hotel in Surry Hills.
