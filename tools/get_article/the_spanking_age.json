McGowan. It was the 80th Our Gang short to be released. The film was considered lost until a copy surfaced in 1990. It was the first film in the series to be released with a synchronized orchestral musical score with sound effects.\nPlot\nMary Ann and Wheezer are the children of a widowed inventor who are forced to endure the cruelties of their stepmother (Lyle Tayo) and stepsister.
