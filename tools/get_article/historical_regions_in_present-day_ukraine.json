The map on the right shows the approximate locations of some broad-brush regions. The terms \"Central Ukraine\", \"Eastern Ukraine\", \"Southern Ukraine\", and \"Western Ukraine\" occur in common usage. There is no clear definition of the boundaries of such regions, but rather a general reference. Lists of what may constitute such regions might include:\n* Central Ukraine, a more vague term, often denotes what is not included in Western or South-Eastern definitions.\n* Eastern Ukraine may mean either the Don basin, Sloboda Ukraine, continental Taurida regions etc.\n* Southern Ukraine often includes the whole Taurida, the Kryvyi Rih basin, and the regions of Mykolayiv and Odesa oblasts. Alternatively it may include the Don basin, in particularly the adjacent land to the Azov Sea.\n* Western Ukraine may mean either the historic region of Galicia, or may also include Volhynia, Podolia, Transcarpathia, and/or Bukovina.\nOther terms are rarely used – such as \"South-western Ukraine\", which can denote either Transcarpathia, or Budjak. Sometimes the term \"South-eastern Ukraine\" is used to define both regions of the Southern and Eastern Ukraine. Due to the shape of the country, in narrow definition, term \"Northern Ukraine\" is often used to denote either the bulge of Chernihiv/Sumy oblasts or, in broader terms, the whole of Polesia. \"North-western Ukraine\" almost exclusively refers to the historic region of Volhynia. This makes the term \"North-eastern Ukraine\" rarest of them all – it is either used as synonym for the narrow definition of Northern Ukraine, or as synonym for Sloboda Ukraine (particularly Sumy Oblast).\nFile:Central Ukr.png|Central Ukraine\nFile:Eastern Ukr.png|Eastern Ukraine\nFile:Northern Ukr.png|Northern Ukraine\nFile:Southern Ukr.png|Southern Ukraine\nFile:Western Ukr.png|Western Ukraine\nHistorical states\n* Kievan Rus (a state of Early East Slavs), (879–1240)\n* Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (1199–1349)\n* Cossack Hetmanate (1649–1764)\n* Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1918)\n* Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets (1917–1918)\n* Odesa Soviet Republic (1918)\n* Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic (1918)\n* Ukrainian Soviet Republic (1918)\n* Hetmanate of the Ukrainian State (1918)\n* West Ukrainian People's Republic (1918–1919)\n* Kholodny Yar Republic (1919-1922)\n* Directorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic (1918–1920)\n* Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (1919–1991)\n* Galician Soviet Socialist Republic (1920)\n* Carpatho-Ukraine (1938–1939)\n* Ukrainian national government (1941)\n* Reichskommissariat Ukraine (1941-1944)\n* Ukraine (1991–present)\nSee also\n* Geography of Ukraine\n* ISO 3166-2:UA\n* List of places named after people (Ukraine)\nReferences\n* Paul Robert Magosci, Ukraine: A Historical Atlas, 1985.
