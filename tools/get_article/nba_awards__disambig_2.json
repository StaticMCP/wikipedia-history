Finalists for each individual award were announced during the NBA playoffs on NBA on TNT telecasts. Winners were revealed during the ceremony. Additionally, the open public could decide the winner for fan-voted categories online by voting through the league's official website and on social media.\nThe ceremony occurred in late June, following the conclusion of the NBA Finals, and were broadcast live on TNT. Hosting duties were shared with the Inside the NBA studio team. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show was not held in 2020 and 2021. Since 2020, award winners were instead announced on TNT during their coverage of the playoffs.\nList of ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Season\n!| Date\n!| Venue\n!| Host city\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Host\n! style=\"width:27%;\" class=\"unsortable\" | NBA Most Valuable Player\n! style=\"width:4%;\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2017\n| align=\"center\"| 2016–17\n| June 26\n| Basketball City at Pier 36\n| New York City\n| Drake\n| Russell Westbrook — Oklahoma City Thunder\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2018\n| align=\"center\"| 2017–18\n| June 25\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Barker Hangar\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Santa Monica, California\n| Anthony Anderson\n| James Harden — Houston Rockets\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2019\n| align=\"center\"| 2018–19\n| June 24\n| Shaquille O'Neal\n| Giannis Antetokounmpo — Milwaukee Bucks\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nSee also\n*List of National Basketball Association awards\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
