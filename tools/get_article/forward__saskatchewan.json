      "text": "# Forward, Saskatchewan\n\nForward is a hamlet in the Rural Municipality of Norton No. 69, Saskatchewan, Canada. It previously held the status of a village until December 31, 1947. It is situated along Highway 13.\nDemographics\nPrior to December 31, 1947, Forward was incorporated as a village, and was restructured as a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Norton on that date.\nCairn\nA cairn marks the former site of the town, off Highway 13 about 43&nbsp;km West of Weyburn. The plaque was installed in 1995 by the Saskatchewan History and Folklore Society and reads:\nTown of Forward\nNW 12-8-19 W2M\nEstablished 1911\nIn 1913 an entire town moved to this site, the junction of the Canadian Pacific-Canadian National rails. Visions of thriving commerce inspired the move of businesses and homes from the original location 4.8 km north east.\nForward, population near 1200, flourished. Town services: A lumber yard, notary public, printing-publishing shop, post office, implement agency, jail, school, church, firehall, drugstore, cafe, blacksmith, & livery barn.\nForward gradually declined. Structures were not rebuilt after fires. It lacked a grain elevator and other towns growing along the railway provided competition. The last house was removed from the site in 1966.\nSee also\n*List of communities in Saskatchewan\n*List of hamlets in Saskatchewan\nReferences"
