American ships were then found in 1785 attacked by the privateers of what the West then called Barbarism, corresponding to the Ottoman provinces of the Maghreb (modern Tunisia, Libya and Algeria). The United States Senate decided to propose a \"Treaty of Peace and Friendship With the States of Barbaria\", an amendment to which was initiated on 5 September 1795 in Algiers and again on 3 January 1797.\nThe treaty was unanimously ratified by the United States Senate in early June and signed by John Adams, the second American president, and appeared in what was the then US Official Gazette, the Philadelphia Gazette, on June 17, 1797.\nTribute\n, signed September 5, 1795 (21 Safar A.H. 1210).;]]\nThe United States federal government was to be annually charged the equivalent of 12,000 Algerian sequins (i.e US dollars 21,600, 64,800 gold francs) to protect its trade from piracy. This toll was served uninterrupted until 1810, and payment was suspended in 1811, and it was also to provide a 32-gun frigate and three otherPaul H.

This demand was repulsed and the pasha with his allies from the Barbary Coast declared war on the United States on 14 May 1801.\nUS President Thomas Jefferson then sent United States Navy ships shelling the cities of Tripoli and Algiers and renegotiated the treaty in 1805.\nIn April 2006, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered Washington a copy of the original of the treaty to Algerian Foreign Minister Mohammed Bedjaoui.\nReferences"
