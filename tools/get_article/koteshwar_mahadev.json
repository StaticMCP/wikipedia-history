According to local mythology the temple has existed since the time of Bhasmasura.\nThis was the demon who turned to ashes anyone whose head he touched. Lord Shiva went into hiding to escape this threat, resting in various places before coming to the cave at Koteshwar Mahadev. Shiva rested here for some time, meditating, before confronting and defeating the demon. A similar legend is associated with Shrikhand Mahadev and Kinner Kailash in Himachal Pradesh.\nHospital\nA modern 60-bed hospital is attached to the temple and serves the local population. This hospital is managed by the Jyotishpeethadheeshwar Jagatguru Shankracharya Swamy Madhavashram Charitable Trust.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC1d8YS8C1o Shankaracharya Madhvasharm Ji Maharaj Hospital Rudraprayag – YouTube]\nReferences"
