It is characterized by a highly melodramatic style and reoccurring themes of Korean nationalism and glorification of socialism, the Kim dynasty, and the working people, as well as a focus on socialist realist themes. Composers of North Korean revolutionary opera are employed by the North Korean government and the fundamental principles of North Korean revolutionary opera were dictated by Kim Jong-Il in his speech (later transcribed to book) On the Art of Opera."
