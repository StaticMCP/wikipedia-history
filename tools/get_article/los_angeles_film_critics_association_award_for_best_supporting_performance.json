It was first introduced in 2022, after it was announced that the four acting categories would be retired and replaced with two gender neutral categories, with both Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress merging into the Best Supporting Performance category. Two awards for Best Supporting Performance and two awards for Best Lead Performance, each with two winners and two runners-up, are handed out.\nWinners and runners-up\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"68%\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! width=\"100\"| Year\n! width=\"300\"| Winner(s)\n! width=\"300\"| Film(s)\n! width=\"300\"| Role(s)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Dolly de Leon || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Triangle of Sadness || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Abigail\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Ke Huy Quan || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Everything Everywhere All at Once || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Waymond Wang\n|-\n| Jessie Buckley || Women Talking || Mariche\n|-\n| Brian Tyree Henry || Causeway || James Aucoin\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023|| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Rachel McAdams || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| 'Are You There God?
