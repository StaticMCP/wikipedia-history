The most recent influences in Dominican cuisine are from the British West Indies and China.\nDishes and their origins\nThe Taíno cultivated many types of tubers such as yuca, yautia, and batata. An important staple of Dominican cuisine adopted from the Taíno people is casabe, made from cassava root and important to the diet of the Taíno. Casabe is served with soups and stews in the Dominican Republic. Spices such as vanilla, nutmeg, and pepper most often used by Dominican cooks derive from Spanish cuisine.\nThe Dominican Republic was formerly a Spanish colony. Many Spanish traits are still present in the island. Many traditional Spanish dishes have found a new home in the Dominican Republic, some with a twist. African and Taíno dishes still hold strong, some of them unchanged.\nAll or nearly all food groups are accommodated in typical Dominican cuisine, as it incorporates meat or seafood; grains, especially rice, corn (native to the island), and wheat; vegetables, such as beans and other legumes, potatoes, yuca, or plantains, and salad; dairy products, especially milk and cheese; and fruits, such as oranges, bananas, and mangos. However, there is heaviest consumption of starches and meats, and the least of dairy products and non-starchy vegetables.\nSofrito, a sautéed mix including local herbs and spices, is used in many dishes. Throughout the south-central coast bulgur, or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in quipes and tipili, two dishes brought by Levantine Middle Eastern immigrants. Other well-known foods and dishes include chicharrón, squash, pastelitos or empanadas, pasteles en hoja (ground roots pockets), chimichurris, plátanos maduros (ripe plantain), wasakaka, and tostones/fritos (fried plantains).\nBouillon cubes are used heavily in the preparation of Dominican lunch food.\nTaíno dishes\n*Mabí – a root beer-like drink made from the roots of a local tree\n*Casabe – Flatbread made out of yuca. Resembles a round cracker.\n*Pera piña – Pineapple peels drink.\n*Guarapo de piña – Fermented pineapple juice.\n*Guanimo – Same as tamales with no filling or stuffed with picadillo.\nSpanish dishes\n*Arroz con dulce – rice pudding made with long-grain rice, milk, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, star anise, clove, and nutmeg.\n*Buñuelos de bacalao – a codfish fritter popular throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Also known as bacalaíto in the Dominican Republic.\n*Crème caramel – sweet egg custard known as flan. Coconut flan is known as quesillo de coco.\n*Gofio – sweet cornmeal powder from the Canary Islands.\n*Longaniza—a type of spicy sausage originally from Spain.\nAfrican dishes\n*Mangú – mashed, boiled plantains can be traced back to west Africa where it is known as fufu. This is a typical and official national breakfast in the Dominican Republic but can also be served at lunch and dinner. Mangú is typically served with queso frito (white cheese fried in a pan), fried Dominican salami, fried eggs, and topped with onions cooked in vinegar. This combination is also known as los tres golpes (the three hits). Plantains can be replaced with green bananas or squash.\nMiddle Eastern dishes\nA few dishes have been adopted from a wave of Lebanese immigration into the Dominican Republic. These dishes reflect significant changes from the traditional Middle Eastern, including the preparation, using beef instead of lamb, and leaving out many spices (cumin, cardamom, coriander seeds, saffron, and others), herbs (rosemary, mint, dill, marjoram, Greek oregano, and others), spice blends (za'atar and baharat), seeds, and nuts (pine nuts, pistachios, sesame seeds, hazelnuts, and others). Many of these dishes are traditionally served with a sauce in the Middle East, while in the Dominican Republic they are served alone. Many of these spices and flavoring have been replaced with Dominican oregano, bell peppers, and chicken bouillon.\n*Pilaf – Rice with raisins and almonds. It is usually eaten around Christmas.\n*Arabic rice – Rice cooked with toasted pasta.\n*Kipes or quipes – Deep-fried bulgur roll filled with picadillo.\n*Niño envuelto – Cabbage roll filled with beef and rice.\nCocolo influence\nCocolo is a term used in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean to refer to non-Hispanic African descendants, or darker skin people in general. The term originated in the Dominican Republic, and was historically used to refer to the Anglophone and Francophone Caribbean descendants. The Cocolo cuisine brought over through various parts of the Caribbean have influenced Dominican cuisine. Some recipes have changed but most have stood the same but with different names.\n*Dumplings – Dumplings in the Dominican Republic are eaten with braised meats or seasoned tomato sauce. They came from the British Caribbean mostly in and around San Pedro de Macorís. A simple recipe is based on all-purpose flour, water, and salt made into a thick dough before boiling. When cornmeal is added they are known as bollitos de maíz (boiled cornmeal dumplings).\n*Guavaberry – Guavaberry is used to make jams and drinks. Guavaberry liqueur, which is made from rum, is a common Christmas drink on many of the islands, particularly in Sint Maarten and the Virgin Islands. The colonists from Denmark and Holland found it could flavor rum by infusion similar to infused schnapps. In the Dominican Republic it is associated with the eastern town of San Pedro de Macorís which has a large population of Eastern Caribbean descent.\n*Yaniqueque – Jonnycakes, a dish brought by sugarcane workers from the Lesser Antilles over a century ago.\nCuban and Puerto Rican influences\nDominican cuisine has adopted from Puerto Rico and Cuba, though the dish names differ sometimes. Because of the historic migration between Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, its three cultures are closely related. It is unclear for most dishes between these countries on where it originated from. Dishes like mofongo and pasteles de hola originated from Puerto Rico, Moros y Cristianos and yuca con mojo from Cuba have become part of Dominican cuisines and culture.\n*Majarete – Pudding made with blended corn, cornstarch, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon.

In either case, most Dominican meat dishes tend to involve pork, as pigs are farmed quite heavily on the island. Meat dishes tend to be very well cooked or even stewed in Dominican restaurants, a tradition stemming from the lesser availability of refrigeration on the island.\nSeaside Dominican fishing villages will have great varieties of seafood, the most common being shrimp, marlin, mahi-mahi or dorado, and lobster. Most villagers more commonly dine on cheap, lesser-quality fish, usually stewed with la criolla, a type of rice. Premium seafood tends to be too expensive for the many locals, and is saved for the island's upper class and the tourist resorts.\nDifferences between Dominican cuisine and those of other parts of the West Indies include the milder spicing, which mainly uses onions, garlic, cilantro, cilantro ancho (culantro), ají cubanela (cubanelle pepper), and lippia micromera (a.k.a. oregano). Dominican sofrito is known on the island as sazón.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dominicancooking.com/ Dominican Cooking]\n* [http://www.dominicanheat.com/ Dominican Heat]\n* [http://www.elfogoncito.net/ El Fogoncito]"
