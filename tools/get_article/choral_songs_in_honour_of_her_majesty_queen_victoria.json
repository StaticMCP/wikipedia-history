He recruited 13 British composers, and in 1899 a limited edition of only 100 copies was produced entitled Choral Songs in honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria.\nThe actual title on the front of the book is Choral Songs by Various Writers & Composers in Honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria.\nContents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! order\n! composer\n! poet\n! piece\n|-\n| 1\n| Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie\n| Alfred Austin\n| With wisdom, goodness, grace\n|-\n| 2\n| Sir Charles Villiers Stanford\n| A.
