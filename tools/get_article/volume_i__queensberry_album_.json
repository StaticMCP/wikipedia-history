Released by Starwatch Music, Cheyenne Records, and Warner Music on 12 December 2008 in German-speaking Europe, a week prior to the announcement of the fourth member of quartet line-up on the show's finale, the album produced three versions, each featuring a different Popstars – Just 4 Girls contestant competing to become part of the Queensberry group, including Katharina \"KayKay\" Kobert, Patricia Ivanauskas or eventual band member Antonella Trapani.\nStarwatch consulted several producers and songwriters to work with the finalists on Volume I, including Alexander Geringas, Henrik Menzel, Tommy \"Petone\" Peters, John McLaughlin, Pete Kirtley, and British production team Snowflakers, some of which re-produced their material which had previously been recorded by other international artists such as Katharine McPhee, Emily Haines, Shaznay Lewis, Anna Abreu, Margaret Berger, and Clea for their respective albums.\nUpon release, Volume I debuted and peaked at number three on the German Albums Chart, while reaching the top ten in Austria and the top twenty in Switzerland. It was eventually certified gold by both the BVMI and IFPI Austria, indicating sales in excess of 110,000 copies. The original version produced the double A-single \"I Can't Stop Feeling\"/\"No Smoke\", while follow-up \"Too Young\" appeared on the deluxe edition of Volume I, which was released in June 2009,  featuring seven additional tracks.\nTrack listing\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 3:21\n| title2          = Bike\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 2:53\n| title3          = Sorry\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 3:31\n| title4          = Dr. Blind\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          =\n| length4         = 3:28\n| title5          = Over It\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 3:31\n| title6          = End of Love\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 3:34\n| title7          = Sprung\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          =\n| length7         = 4:25\n| title8          = I Can't Stop Feeling\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          =\n| length8         = 3:46\n| title9          = Beautiful Thing\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          =\n| length9         = 3:17\n| title10         = Stiletto Heels\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         =\n| length10        = 3:35\n| title11         = Jump\n| writer11        =\n| extra11         =\n| length11        = 3:10\n| title12         = Butterfly\n| writer12        =\n| extra12         =\n| length12        = 4:00\n| title13         = Why Should I Believe in You\n| writer13        =\n| extra13         =\n| length13        = 4:00\n}}\n| extra14         =\n| length14        = 3:42\n| title15         = Glamorous\n| writer15        =\n| extra15         =\n| length15        = 3:48\n| title16         = Naive\n| writer16        =\n| extra16         =\n| length16        = 3:22\n| title17         = Dance\n| writer17        =\n| extra17         =\n| length17        = 3:13\n| title18         = Flow\n| writer18        =\n| extra18         =\n| length18        = 3:22\n| title19         = Too Young\n| note19          = M.A.T.
