The presidential election was conducted in accordance with the 1945 Constitution. Because the MPR (People's Consultative Assembly) had not yet been formed, its duties were carried out by the MPRS (Provisional People's Consultative Assembly).\nBackground\nActually, the second presidential election was intended to be held after Indonesia's independence. However, this was not possible because of the Indonesian National Revolution throughout the 1950s, so that (the Legislative Election and the Presidential-Vice Presidential Election) were temporarily postponed. In addition, due to the change of the 1945 Constitution to the Provisional Constitution of 1950 (which was used from 1950 to 1959), the presidential election could not be held because the president at that time was only the holder of state power, not also the holder of government.\nHowever, this changed since the Presidential Decree 1959, namely the return of the 1945 Constitution as the State Constitution, and the MPRS as the temporary holder of the duties of the MPR-RI.\nSukarno was finally proposed to be nominated at the MPRS General Session dated 15–22 May 1963. Many of Soekarno's supporters proposed Sukarno's nomination as president for life. This proposal was also supported by AM Hanafi, Chaerul Saleh, and voiced to the MPRS by Colonel Suhardirman, one of the ABRI members in the MPRS who also proposed the idea.\nFinally, a presidential election was held. Because Sukarno was also elected, this idea was unanimously approved because Sukarno won the presidential election for the 1963–1968 term. Therefore, his term of office was changed to life. Sukarno was officially made President for Life through the session.\nResults\nPresident\nReferences"
