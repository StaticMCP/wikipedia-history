The Kazakhs, led by batyrs Kabanbay, Kozhabergen, and Bogenbay, defeated the forces led by Generals Dardan and Khadakh. The site of this battle has retained the name \"Shurshit kyrilghan\" (\"place of the defeat of pursuts, i.e., the Manchurian-Chinese\").\nThe decisive Kazakh-Chinese battle erupted in the headwaters of the Shiderty River to the west of Bayan-Aul. Only 3,000 out of 20,000 Chinese soldiers remained alive. Significant losses, food shortages, and the onset of harsh winter forced the Chinese authorities to recall the remnants of their troops. The victory of the Kazakhs was costly but nonetheless significant.\nReferences"
