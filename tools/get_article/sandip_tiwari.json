His previous roles were Director of National Nanotechnology Users Network, Director of the National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network, and research scientist at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. He is best known for his pioneer research in the fields of SiGe transistor and nanocrystal memory.\nEarly life and education\nSandip Tiwari was born in Ahmedabad, India, received his BTech from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 1976. He received his M.Eng. at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and PhD at Cornell University in 1980.\nWork and academic career\nHis early research career was at IBM's Research Division until 1999. During this period, he did the early work on compound semiconductor transistors and co-developed the first SiGe transistor. He also pioneered various quantum and nanoscale devices, such as the nanocrystal memory. The first demonstration of SiGe transistor was honored as IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) Top Industry Innovation of 1987. His work on nanocrystal memory was one of the 50 most-cited papers in the history of Applied Physics Letters in 2013.\nAt Cornell University, his Nanoscale ElectroScience Research Group focused on adaptive approaches for low power design, three-dimensional integration, inexact computing, and Bayesian implementations\nSelected awards and honors\n* IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award, 2007\n* IIT Kanpur Distinguished Alumni Award, 2003\n* International Symposium on Compound Semiconductors (ISCS) Young Scientist Award, 1991\n* Founding Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology, 2002\n* Guest Editor of Proceedings of the IEEE, 2015\n* Fellow of American Physical Society, 1998\n* Life Fellow of IEEE, 1994\nSelected publications\nBooks\n* S.
