The Cougars, led by seventh year head coach Lennox Forrester, played their home games at the Vadalabene Center and were members of the West Division of the Ohio Valley Conference. They finished the season 11–20, 7–9 in OVC play to finish in a tie for third place in the West Division. They lost in the first round of the Ohio Valley tournament to Tennessee Tech.\nPreseason\nFive players returned from the 9–18 team of 2012–13; two redshirt transfers, a transfer from a top NCAA Division II program (who had also played in Division I), and four junior college transfers are newly eligible.\nDuring the summer of 2013, Kris Davis and Donivine Stewart, along with assistant coach Deryl Cunningham, were part of a goodwill tour sponsored by Global Sports Academy that spent eight days in Europe, playing games in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands.\nAfter three eligible junior class lettermen did not return for the Fall semester, open tryouts were held on September 13 to fill out the roster with walk-on players. Juniors Akintoye Okunrinboye and Keaton Scheer were added to the team.\nSeason\nDuring the early season, the Cougars were blown out by some strong teams such as St.Louis and Arkansas, and played close, but mostly lost to more evenly matched opponents. When OVC play began, they came together and became a tough match, gaining upset wins at home over eventual division champion Murray State and OVC tournament champ Eastern Kentucky to go with a couple of road wins. But, as the season wound down, they lost three of the last four while still qualifying for their first OVC tournament, which ended with a first round loss.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, Cougars point guard Donivine Stewart was named to the Ohio Valley Conference All-Newcomer Team.\nRoster\nSource =\nPink background indicates returning players from 2012–13\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!#\n!Name\n!Position\n!Height\n!Weight\n!Year\n!Hometown\n!High School\n!Transfer from\n|-  style=\"background:pink;\"\n| 1\n| Kris Davis\n| Guard\n| 6–2\n| 190\n| Junior\n| Detroit, Michigan\n| Detroit Cass Technical\n|\n|-  style=\"background:pink;\"\n| 2\n| Maurice Wiltz\n| Guard\n| 6–2\n| 190\n| Junior\n| Houston, Texas\n| Stafford HS\n| Colorado State\n|-\n| 3\n| Keaton Jackson\n| Forward\n| 6–10\n| 205\n| Junior\n| Vancouver, Washington\n| Prairie High School\n| Missouri State University–West Plains (JC)\n|-  style=\"background:pink;\"\n| 4\n| Tim Johnson\n| Guard\n| 6–4\n| 200\n| Senior\n| Harvey, Illinois\n| Lee Academy (ME)\n| George Washington\n|-\n| 5\n| Grant Fiorentinos\n| Forward/Center\n| 6–10\n| 225\n| Sophomore\n| Cape Town, West Cape, South Africa\n| Hun School of Princeton (NJ)\n| Tulane\n|-\n| 10\n| Cameron Craig\n| Guard\n| 6–0\n| 190\n| Junior\n| Coffeyville, Kansas\n| Field Kindley High School\n| CoffeyvilleCommunity College (JC)\n|-\n| 11\n| Akintoye Okunrinboye\n| Guard\n| 5-11\n| 180\n| Junior\n| Florissant, Missouri\n| McCluer North High School\n|\n|-\n| 15\n| Christian Salecich\n| Guard\n| 6–3\n| 190\n| Senior\n| Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia\n| Australian Institute of Sport\n| St. Louis &Missouri Southern (DII)\n|-\n| 20\n| Keaton Scheer\n| Guard\n| 6-5\n| 188\n| Junior\n| Germantown, Illinois\n| Breese Central High School\n| Southwestern Illinois College (JC)\n|-\n| 23\n| Rozell Nunn\n| Guard/Forward\n| 6–4\n| 205\n| Junior\n| Kansas City, Kansas\n| F.
