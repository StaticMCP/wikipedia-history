Dentaa, GUBA President, got the idea to create the awards because she thought that \"nothing out there\" encouraged and appreciated the hard work and achievements of British Ghanaians.\nThe GUBA Awards was the first ceremony of its kind specifically to recognize Ghanaian achievement and the only awards to be endorsed by the Ghana High Commission in the UK and the British High Commission in Ghana. More recently, the organizers have sought to also involve the wider African communities as they attempt to gain international attention. The GUBA Awards ceremony attracts a high calibre of African political luminaries as well as business and entrepreneurial personalities.\nIn July 2013, the GUBA Awards received an International Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Excellence Award, beating more than 100 nominees from the UK corporate sector.\nOrganisation\nCategories in the GUBA Awards are divided into sections that represent the Ghanaian flag: Red (Business & Enterprise); Gold (Popular Culture); Green (Community) and Black Star (Recognition Awards).\nHundreds of recommendations for nominees are received annually. A vetting process is in place along with a clear criterion that each candidate has to satisfy prior to being accepted as a nominee. Only the activities of the candidates in the 12 months leading up to the awards are considered, so that everyone stands a fair chance.\nA panel of judges comprising prominent members of the Ghanaian community is responsible for compiling the final shortlist of nominees. In both the 2010 and 2011 GUBA Awards there were three judges: Charles Thompson MBE (CEO of the Screen Nation Awards), singer Rhian Benson and solicitor Maame Biama Asante. For the 2012 awards there were four judges: Charles Thompson, Mavis Amankwah (managing director of communications firm Rich Visions), Freddy Annan (CEO for BASE Management Group) and Sandra Teichman (a director in the London arm of US law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman).\nFor the GUBA Awards 2013, the categories were: Business of the Year; IIA Sustainability Award; Efie Ne Fie Award; Young Entrepreneur of the Year; Rising Star of the Year; Fashion Fusion Designer of the Year; Music Act of the Year; Ghanaian Association of the Year; Inspirational Personality of the Year; Unsung Hero of the Year; and Charity of The Year.\nWith the exception of the Recognition Awards category, the winners in each section are decided by public vote and announced at the awards ceremony.\nDirectional shift\n2019 marked a monumental moment for the GUBA Awards, with the awards being held for the first time in the United States. The awards were held in New York alongside the 74th UN General Assembly, which saw a change in direction of the awards' scope.\nThe 2019 United States edition of the GUBA Awards was held under the theme \"African Diaspora, the Catalyst for Growth and Innovation\".\nIn 2021, the awards were held in Ghana for the first time since its inception to celebrate the centenary of the death of Ghanaian historical warrior and hero Nana Yaa Asantewaa.\nThe 2023 award ceremony was held at London's Grosvenor House Hotel in November.\nGUBA Awards 2010 winners\nThe 2010 launch ceremony took place in London at the Ghana High Commission.\n*Best Business – Kumasi Market.\n*Best Entrepreneur/Innovator – Arnold Sarfo Kantanka: Me FiRi Ghana.\n*Best African Fusion Designer – Ohema Ohene.\n*Best Hair & Beauty – Josh Hair & Beauty.\n*Best Restaurant – The Gold Coast.\n*Best Shipping Company – Speedlink.\n*Best DJ – Teddy Abrokwa.\n*Best Radio Station – Rainbow Radio.\n*Best TV Programming – ''The World's Strictest Parents.\n*Best Media Personality – Ama K.
