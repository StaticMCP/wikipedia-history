In the Southern United States, where severe winter weather is much less common and any snow is a more significant event, warning criteria are lower, as low as  in the southernmost areas: as one goes from north to south, the accumulation estimates needed to meet warning criteria lessen. A warning can also be issued during high impact events of lesser amounts, usually early or very late in the season when trees have leaves and damage can result.\nWinter Storm Warnings for snow events are issued when winds are less than ; if the storm is expected to produce winds above this speed for at least three hours accompanying moderate to heavy snowfall, a blizzard warning will be issued instead or as an upgrade to the winter storm warning. Usually, a large accumulation of ice alone with little to no snow will result in an ice storm warning, or in the case of light freezing rain, a winter weather advisory, a freezing rain advisory, or a freezing drizzle advisory. In lieu of issuing such a statement separately, Winter Storm Warnings can include verbiage indicative of a wind chill advisory or a wind chill warning, if potentially life-threatening wind chill values (determined by local criteria) are forecast to accompany winter precipitation during the warning's duration.\nBeginning with the 2008–09 meteorological winter, the National Weather Service consolidated individual precipitation-specific bulletins for winter storms expected to create heavy snowfall (heavy snow warning), lake-effect snow (lake effect snow warning) or sleet accumulations (sleet warning or heavy sleet warning) within the warned area, replacing them with variants of the Winter Storm Warning product outlining the accordant hazards being forecast:\n; Winter storm warning for heavy snow : Replaced the heavy snow warning\n; Winter storm warning for heavy wet snow : Same as above, except when the snow will also be wet\n; Winter storm warning for heavy snow and blowing snow : When the criteria for both a WSW for heavy snow and a winter weather advisory for snow and blowing snow are met [near-blizzard conditions]\n; Winter storm warning for heavy sleet : Replaced the sleet warning\n; Winter storm warning for heavy snow and ice : When both the criteria for a WSW for heavy snow and an ice storm warning are met\n; Winter storm warning for snow and ice : When both the criteria for a winter weather advisory for snow and an ice storm warning are met\n; Winter storm warning for sleet and freezing rain : When both the criteria for a winter weather advisory for sleet and an ice storm warning are met\n; Winter storm warning for heavy lake-effect snow : Replaced the lake effect snow warning in some NWS county warning areas. (2017-2018 season)\nAdditionally, all of the above warning types may also include verbiage indicative of a wind advisory to indicate strong winds that are expected to accompany the precipitation (e.g., \"winter storm warning for heavy wet snow and strong winds\").\nThe generic \"winter storm warning\" terminology may be used on its own, typically to indicate that all types of winter precipitation (as a mixture or in periods before transitioning between types) are expected in high amounts; however, it may be defined generically at the forecaster's discretion regardless of whether or not this condition is met.\nExample of a winter storm warning\n596\nWWUS44 KLIX 192043\nWSWLIX\nURGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE\nNational Weather Service New Orleans LA\n243 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025\nLAZ034>037-039-046>048-056>060-064-065-070-071-076>090-MSZ068>071-\n077-083>088-200445-\n/O.UPG.KLIX.WS.A.0001.250121T0600Z-250122T0600Z/\n/O.NEW.KLIX.WS.W.0001.250121T0600Z-250122T0600Z/\nPointe Coupee-West Feliciana-East Feliciana-St. Helena-Washington-\nIberville-West Baton Rouge-East Baton Rouge-Assumption-St. James-\nSt. John The Baptist-Upper Lafourche-St. Charles-Upper St.\nBernard-Upper Terrebonne-Lower St. Bernard-Northern Tangipahoa-\nSoutheast St. Tammany-Western Orleans-Eastern Orleans-Northern\nSt. Tammany-Southwestern St. Tammany-Central Tangipahoa-Lower\nTangipahoa-Northern Livingston-Southern Livingston-Western\nAscension-Eastern Ascension-Upper Jefferson-Lower Jefferson-Upper\nPlaquemines-Central Plaquemines-Wilkinson-Amite-Pike-Walthall-\nPearl River-Northern Hancock-Northern Harrison-Northern Jackson-\nSouthern Hancock-Southern Harrison-Southern Jackson-\nIncluding the cities of Escatawpa, Port Allen, Laplace, Jean\nLafitte, Saucier, Chalmette, Tickfaw, Prairieville, Sellers,\nCentreville, Independence, Donaldsonville, Marrero, Labadieville,\nGulfport, Franklinton, New Roads, Sorrento, Geismar, Gramercy,\nKiln, Houma, Bayou Sorrel, Thibodaux, Metairie, Pass Christian,\nBayou Cane, Salem, Plaquemine, Tylertown, Shell Beach, Slidell,\nBrusly, St. Martin, Livingston, Paincourtville, Kentwood, Moss\nPoint, Dolorosa, Wade, Westwego, Bogalusa, Jackson, Livonia,\nGreensburg, Norco, Montpelier, Gautier, Harahan, Necaise, Gretna,\nRoseland, Amite, Denham Springs, Picayune, Pascagoula,\nDarlington, Lutcher, Lyman, Walker, McNeil, Ocean Springs, Baton\nRouge, Meraux, Delacroix, Bay St. Louis, Crossroads, Destrehan,\nPoplarville, Wilmer, Felps, French Settlement, Robert, Acy,\nVancleave, Clinton, Madisonville, Braithwaite, Fort Adams,\nLarose, Long Beach, Barataria, Pierre Part, Lettsworth,\nCovington, Yscloskey, Belle Chasse, Smithdale, Pearlington,\nAddis, White Castle, Waveland, Diamondhead, Reserve, Gonzales,\nWhitehall, Akers, Spillman, Folsom, Ponchatoula, Easleyville,\nWoodville, Alliance, Violet, Raceland, Convent, Killian, Gloster,\nDexter, Kenner, Biloxi, Lafitte, Enon, Gillsburg, St.\nFrancisville, Liberty, Mandeville, New Orleans, Bush,\nSpringfield, McComb, Hammond, East New Orleans, and Wakefield\n243 PM CST Sun Jan 19 2025\n...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM MIDNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT TO\nMIDNIGHT CST TUESDAY NIGHT...\n* WHAT...Winter precipitation causing moderate to major impacts is\nexpected.
