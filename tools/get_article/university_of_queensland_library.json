It developed from a small provincial university library into a major research library. It was first housed in the Old Government House building of George Street from 1911 to 1923. From 1923 to 1948, it was housed in the Art Block of the Central Technical College in George Street, next to the university. In late 1948, the library moved to the new St Lucia campus, residing in the Duhig Building. By 1954, it had already exceeded its capacity.\nFor decades the library suffered from neglect. Some of this was due to the lack of a formal librarian, and other problems were due to the lack of funds during the early decades of the university's history. The early building in George Street was riddled with white ants and borers, and later lack of space. After the move to St Lucia, the Duhig building was expanded in 1964, and smaller libraries sprang up to support Department needs. In 1974, the Duhig building had exceeded its capacity and hence the Central Library was built, under the direction of then University Librarian, Derek Fielding. A four-storey Biological Sciences Library building, to accommodate the growing science collections, was built in 1976. The same year, the Architecture and Music libraries were amalgamated into one place, the Zelman Cowen building, named for the Vice-Chancellor and soon-to-be Governor-General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowen.\nThe Herston Medical Library was opened in 1984 at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, an amalgamation of many smaller medical libraries. The Physical Sciences and Engineering Library was opened in 1990, and the Law Library gained another floor that same year.\nAfter the closure of the Thatcher Memorial Library and Ringrose Libraries in 1993, which specialised in distance education resources, the university acquired the library of the Queensland Agricultural College at Gatton, as part of its amalgamation with the university in 1989.\nToday the UQ Library is the University of Queensland's network of libraries, encompassing thirteen distinct branches.\nBranches\nThe library has numerous branches reflecting the many locations and disciplines of the university, including:\n* Architecture and Music Library\n* Biological Sciences Library\n* Central Library\n* Dorothy Hill Engineering and Sciences Library, including:\n** C.S.
