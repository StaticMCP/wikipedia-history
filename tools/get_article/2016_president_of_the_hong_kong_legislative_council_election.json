However, the Pro-Beijing camp candidate Andrew Leung had been British since the 1980s and hence would not be eligible to run for president should he not renounce his British citizenship. Pro-democracy camp lawmakers questioned his nationality and demanded the \"declaration of renunciation\", a document issued by the UK Home Office.\nProceedings\npresided over the election]]\nSince James To who was the most senior member contested in the election, Leung Yiu-chung presided over the special forum and the election. Held on 11 October 2016, the special forum allowed candidates to present their manifesto and answer questions from other members. During the actual election on 12 October, Leung said the absence of provisions in the Rules of Procedures meant that no legal clarifications or explanations could be sought from the legal adviser or other staff. As such, he claimed that he could not preside over the meeting if his questions were not resolved and left the meeting.\nAs the second most senior member who did not run for president, Abraham Shek took the chair for the rest of the election. Shek swiftly ordered the ballots to be distributed despite some members shouting in protest. Opposition councillors boycotted the election and walked out the chamber without attending the vote count.\nCandidates\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 120px;\" | Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 140px;\" | Party affiliation\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 140px;\" | Political camp\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 180px;\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 480px;\" | Political office\n|-\n|\n|\n|Pro-Beijing\n| (age )Hong Kong\n|Chairman of the House Committee of the Legislative Council  Member of Legislative Council for Industrial (First)  Chairman of the BPA\n|-\n|\n|\n|Pro-democracy\n| (age )Hong Kong\n|Member of the Legislative Council for District Council (Second)  Member of the Yau Tsim Mong District Council  Member of the Legislative Council for Kowloon West  Member of the Legislative Council for Kowloon South-west  Member of the Legislative Council for Kowloon West\n|}\nResults\nAbraham Shek announced that Andrew Leung was duly elected at 17:30.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! style=\"width: 50px\" | Votes\n! style=\"width: 40px\" | %\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" |Andrew Leung\n| align=\"center\" |38\n| align=\"center\" |58.46\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n| style=\"width: 170px\" | James To\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\"|Blank ballots\n| align=\"center\" | 3\n| align=\"center\" | 4.62\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"left\"|Other spoilt/rejected ballots\n| align=\"center\" | 24\n| align=\"center\" | 36.92\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Turnout (out of 67)\n| align=\"center\" | 65\n| align=\"center\" | 97.01\n|}\nBefore adjourning the meeting, Leung said he accepted the position with a heavy heart and hoped there would be more communication across both camps.\nNotes\nReferences"
