After his father's death, Charlotte in 1716 remarried the writer Joseph Addison, who had been her son's tutor. Edward and Addison are said to have quarrelled; according to a well-known story they did not meet for years until Addison was dying, when he invited his stepson to \"see how a Christian dies\".\nIn 1718, he was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George, Prince of Wales, and on 19 May 1719, he became a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to George I.\nBecause he died so young it is perhaps difficult to form any firm judgment on his character. Even during his short life there seem to have been two opposing views. On one view he was a notorious wastrel, and the despair of his stepfather, hence Addison's deathbed remark to him about dying like a Christian. The other view was that he was \"an exceptionally studious and intellectual young man\", who in his short life was much loved by his friends and family. The fact that Addison's close friend Thomas Tickell dedicated his elegy on Addison's death to Warwick suggests that he was sincerely moved by his stepfather's death.\nHe died in 1721 and was succeeded by his cousin Edward Rich.\nReferences"
