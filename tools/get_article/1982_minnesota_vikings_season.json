Humphrey Metrodome. The team was looking to improve on its 7–9 record from 1981. However, a players strike meant seven of the team's 16 games were canceled, and each NFL team was only able to play nine games. The Vikings won their opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before losing the next week to the Buffalo Bills, a game in which they had a 19–0 lead before the Bills pulled off a comeback to win 23–22.\nAfter the strike ended, the Vikings lost 26–7 to the Packers in Green Bay before beating the Bears 35–7 the following week to sit at 2–2. After a loss to the Dolphins, the Vikings won their next two games to sit at 4–3. In their final game of the season, they upset the Dallas Cowboys 31–27 to clinch the NFC's fourth place spot in the playoffs In the playoffs, the Vikings defeated the Atlanta Falcons 30–24 to reach the divisional round. However, in that game, they lost 21–7 to the eventual champion Redskins.\nOffseason\n1982 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1982 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1 || 7\n| Darrin Nelson || Running back || Stanford ||\n|-\n! 2 || 39\n| Terry Tausch || Guard || Texas ||\n|-\n! 3 || 66\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New Orleans Saints ||\n|-\n! 4 || 92\n| Jim Fahnhorst || Linebacker || Minnesota ||\n|-\n! 5 || 120\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Miami Dolphins ||\n|-\n! 6 || 147\n| Greg Storr || Linebacker || Boston College ||\n|-\n! 7 || 179\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Steve Jordan || Tight end || Brown ||\n|-\n! 8 || 206\n| Kirk Harmon || Linebacker || Pacific ||\n|-\n! 9 || 233\n| Bryan Howard || Defensive back || Tennessee State ||\n|-\n! 10 || 260\n| Gerald Lucear || Wide receiver || Temple ||\n|-\n! 11 || 286\n| Curtis Rouse || Guard || Chattanooga ||\n|-\n! 12 || 318\n| Hobson Milner || Running back || Cincinnati ||\n|}\nNotes\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"\"| Week\n! style=\"\"| Date\n! style=\"\"| Opponent\n! style=\"\"| Result\n! style=\"\"| Record\n! style=\"\"| Venue\n! style=\"\"| Attendance\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 1\n|\n| Baltimore Colts\n| W 30–14\n| 1–0\n| Fawcett Stadium\n| 23,379\n|- style=\"background:#fcc\"\n! 2\n|\n| at Atlanta Falcons\n| L 17–20\n| 1–1\n| Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium\n| 49,831\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 3\n|\n| Seattle Seahawks\n| W 7–3\n| 2–1\n| Hubert H.

A close loss to Buffalo on the road followed.\nThe season was then interrupted by the players' 57-day strike that reduced the NFL regular season to nine games. Upon resumption of play in November, the Vikings went 4–3 to close out the abbreviated regular season and closed the campaign with a 5–4 record. Games against Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, New Orleans, San Francisco, Tampa Bay and Washington were canceled.\nAs three of Minnesota's losses were to AFC opponents, their 4–1 conference record put them at the top of a logjam of teams with similar records in the playoff seedings. In 1982, the NFL took the top eight teams from each conference regardless of division record for playoff consideration. The Vikings earned the #4 seed based on this tiebreaker and home field advantage in round one.\nIn their opening round playoff game, the Vikings took on the Atlanta Falcons. The game was a back-and-forth affair that saw Minnesota take a 13–7 halftime lead, only to see the Falcons retake the lead late in the final period on a 41-yard field goal by Mick Luckhurst. With just under two minutes remaining, the Vikings began a game-winning drive that culminated in a Ted Brown 5-yard touchdown run to win the game and send the Vikings on to round two.\nIn the second round, the Vikings were defeated by the eventual Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins, 21–7, at RFK Stadium. The Vikings trailed 14–0 after one quarter. Ted Brown's touchdown run in the second period cut it to 14–7, but Joe Theismann hit Alvin Garrett late in the quarter with an 18-yard touchdown strike to make it 21–7. Neither team scored in the second half.\nQB Tommy Kramer threw for 2,037 yards and 15 touchdowns in the short season. RB Ted Brown had 515 yards to lead all rushers, and WR Sammy White tallied 503 yards and five touchdowns to lead receivers.\nLB Matt Blair anchored the Vikings defense and also made the 1982 Pro Bowl.\nSchedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Week\n!style=\"\"| Originalweek\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n!style=\"\"| Attendance\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n! 1\n! 1\n| September 12\n| Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n| W 17–10\n| 1–0\n| Hubert H.
