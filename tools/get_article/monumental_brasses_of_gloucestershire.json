Many have been lost to theft over the ages. The first complete listing of brasses in Gloucestershire was made by Cecil T Davis who stated that they may be divided into three categories: ecclesiastical, military and civil.\nList of monumental brasses of Gloucestershire\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
