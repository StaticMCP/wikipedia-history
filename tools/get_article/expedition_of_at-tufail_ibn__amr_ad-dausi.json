The Banu Daws, one of the tribes living in the south of Makkah, had a knowledge of how to use a catapult and testudo, so Muhammad dispatched Tufail ibn 'Amr Ad-Dausi to request their assistance to break the fortifications using a catapult.\nMuhammad also commanded Tufail to destroy the idol Yaguth, worshipped by his tribe. When Tufail approached to destroy the idol, the men, women and children gathered and were troubled that the idol was  going to be burnt. They were waiting to see if any evil would befall Tufail should he harm the idol. As he set fire to it, he proclaimed:\n\"O Dhu-l Kafayn, of your worshipers I certainly am not. Fire have I inserted into your heart.\"\nThen according to Muslim sources, the whole tribe became Muslim. 400 men from his tribe then marched with him to help Muhammad. The catapult and tetsudo was brought by Tufail and then used in the Siege of Taif.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nReferences"
