This and the next three seasons are on dual sided DVDs (Three discs per set instead of the previous six). Special features were also dropped, perhaps due to a waning interest in DVD seasons in the series.\nThe Complete Fourth Season\nThis is the fourth King of the Hill box set, released on May 3, 2005.
