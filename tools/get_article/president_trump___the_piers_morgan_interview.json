In the programme, presenter Piers Morgan interviewed then-President of the United States Donald Trump. The interview was recorded while Trump was attending the 2018 meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which took place between 22 January and 25 January 2018.\nDuring the programme, which was watched by 3 million people at 10:00pm (fewer than the number of viewers watching the rival BBC News at Ten), Trump tells Morgan that he would not call himself a feminist, and would have taken a \"tougher\" approach to Brexit than that of British Prime Minister Theresa May.\nReferences"
