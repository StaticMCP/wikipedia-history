The kingdom is ruled by Kofi Offeh \"King Atehene\" who claims to be the descendant of King David and includes his wife Jean Gasho \"Queen Nandi\" and their handmaiden Kaura Taylor \"Asnat\", who was previously reported missing in Texas.\nThe inhabitants claim to be a lost tribe of the Hebrews reclaiming their ancestral land which they allege was stolen from them 400 years ago when Elizabeth I deported the black Jacobites from Scotland. They also believe that their king is descended from \"David the Messiah\" and worship their God \"Yahowah\".\nThe group have gained notoriety online with more than 100,000 followers on TikTok and Facebook as well as becoming the subject of media attention around the world.\nBackground\nKing Atehene\nKing Atehene (born Kofi Offeh) is a 36-year old Ghanaian former opera singer and the self-proclaimed king of Kubala..\nQueen Nandi\nQueen Nandi (born Jean Gasho) is a 42-year old Zimbabwean woman and the self-proclaimed queen of Kubala.\nAsnat\nAsnat (born Kaura Taylor) is an 21-year old American woman from Dallas, Texas who was reported missing in May and was found to be living with the tribe. Her mother, Melba Whitehead has branded the group a cult and claims her daughter has been \"brainwashed\" to live in the forest.\nLegal status\nThe residents of the Kingdom of Kubala were evicted from their first encampment on privately-owned land near Jedburgh by sheriff officers on 16 September 2025. Following their eviction they decided to set up a new encampment on council land a few metres away. Sheriff officers have since given the group notice of a fresh eviction application from Scottish Borders Council. By 22 September 2025 they were still reported to be sitting at a campfire singing songs and showed no intention of leaving. On 2 October, the members of the tribe were arrested by police on suspicion of breaking immigration laws.\nReferences"
