Joy (Howard Primrose Grahame Joy, born 1923 – died January 17, 2012) was a Canadian\nmunicipal politician who served as a Toronto City Councillor from 1994 to 1997 and later as a\nCouncillor in the Township of The Archipelago from 2000 to 2003. He was known for his\nadvocacy of heritage preservation, urban environmental protections, and cycling safety\ninitiatives.\nEarly Life\nJoy was raised in Toronto. During World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force. After the\nwar, Joy pursued a career in business administration and became involved in local civic affairs.\nCivic activism\nDuring the early 1990's Joy chaired the Confederation of Resident and Ratepayer Associations of Toronto\n(CORRA). CORRA is an umbrella organization of the City of Toronto resident and ratepayer groups. He advocated against the introduction of market value assessment.  Joy also served as Ontario Chair of the Consumers’ Association of Canada.​\nCity of Toronto\nIn the 1994 Toronto municipal election, Joy ran for City Council in Ward 14 (Forest Hill). He\ndefeated the incumbent councillor Howard Levine.  Joy took office as a Toronto City Councillor on January 1, 1995. During his single term on the pre-amalgamation City Council, he served on several key committees and boards. He was\nappointed to the City’s Planning and Development Committee and was an advocate within City\nHall for heritage conservation and neighborhood preservation.\nWhile a councillor he focussed on:\n Heritage Preservation: Joy supported strengthening the Toronto Historical Board’s\npowers and moved motions to designate heritage properties. He worked with local\ngroups to preserve sites in his ward, such as the St. Clair Carhouse, and backed\ncitywide heritage initiatives.\n Urban Forestry – Private Tree By-law: Joy was an early proponent of Toronto’s private\ntree protection by-law. The by-law, enacted in the mid-1990s, made it illegal to remove or\ninjure large trees on private property without a permit. Joy supported this measure as a\nway to curb the loss of mature trees in older neighborhoods and spoke in Council about\nthe environmental and community benefits of a healthy urban tree canopy.\n Cycling and Pedestrian Safety: He was, in the words of the  City Council Condolence motion passed after his death, “an advocate for safe cycling and the expansion of a network of bicycle lanes and routes throughout Toronto”​\nJoy ran again in the 1997 Toronto municipal election to be a councillor for a newly created ward -  Ward 23 Midtown - arising from the new amalgamated City of Toronto.\nHe placed third and as a result only served a single term as a Toronto city councillor.\nToronto Harbour Commission\nDuring his city councillorship, Joy’s role on the Toronto Harbour Commission (THC)(now PortsToronto) was a\nsignificant aspect of his political activity. He became Vice-Chair of the THC and was involved in\nthe 1995–1997 negotiations and controversies surrounding the future of Toronto’s port. When\nthe federal government introduced the Canada Marine Act to create autonomous port\nauthorities, Joy supported including Toronto’s port in the new system. In April 1997, Joy\nappeared (with THC Chair Charles Parmelee) before a Senate committee to argue in favor of\nestablishing the Toronto Port Authority (TPA), on the grounds that it would help the port\n“operate more like a business” and attract investment​.\nTownship of the Archipelago\nAfter the 1997 election Joy ran again for elected office this time as a councillor for The Archipelago a township located on the eastern shore of Georgian Bay in the 2000 Ontario municipal elections and served a term ending in 2003.   While on the Archipelago Council, Joy served on the Planning and Building Committee and the Environment Committee of the Township.\nReferences"
