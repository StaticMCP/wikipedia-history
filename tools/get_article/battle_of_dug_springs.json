It was fought on August 2, 1861, near Clever, Missouri.\nThe battle was fought between several Union companies under the command of  Nathaniel Lyon and Missouri State Guardsman supported by Confederate Regulars. The Union forces were led by Capt. Frederick Steele, the Fourth artillery under Lieutenant Lathrop, and a company of cavalry under Captain Stanley, and finally Totten's battery, with two pieces from Sigel's brigade. The Missouri Forces were led by Brig. Gen. James S. Rains and the Confederate support was made up of men from the 17th Arkansas Infantry Regiment commanded by Capt. Americus V. Reiff. Future Congressman Jordan E. Cravens, fought with Capt. Reiff's company.\nBattle\nNews reached the Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon on August 1 that the Confederates were advancing on his force, in 3 columns, numbering 12,000 men. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon immediately led his 5,800 soldiers out of Springfield where they had been encamped. Lyon's force reached Dug Springs August 2. Confederate pickets encountered Lyon's advance force made up of four companies. The Southerners quickly retreated before Union artillery could be fired at them and rejoined an advance force led by Capt. Americus V. Reiff. Capt. Reiff's force of 120 men began to skirmish with Federal forces. Brigadier General Rains was encamped just South of Dug Springs with a 400 man advanced guard. Around 5 P.M. Rains started advancing his troops toward Dug Springs and starting fighting on the opposite side of the road from Reiff. The Federal troops held firm so Reiff sent an aide to Rains to coordinate an assault on the Federals. Reiff advanced his men and the Federals began to retreat but at the same time a portion of Company C, 1st U.S. Cavalry charged Reiff. The cavalry broke through Reiffs command. Reiff later recalled \"the most gallant act I saw during the war.\" about the charge. Federal artillery began again causing the Missouri State Guardsman and Confederate Regulars to flee which resulted in a Union victory.\nThe battle served as an important milestone in what culminated in the Battle of Wilson's Creek.\nSee also\n* Battle of Wilson's Creek\n* Missouri in the American Civil War\n* Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1861\nReferences"
