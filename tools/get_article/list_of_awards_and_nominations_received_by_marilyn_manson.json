Formed in 1989 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida by Manson and the band's original guitarist Daisy Berkowitz, their highly visualized concerts quickly gained them a reputation in the South Florida area. The Miami New Times named Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids – the earliest incarnation of the band – the 'Best Local Heavy Metal Band' in 1992. The following year, the band – who, by now, had shortened their name to Marilyn Manson – won two awards at the second annual South Florida Slammies. They would go on to win a further seven Slammies over the next three years, making them the second-most decorated band in the awards' history.\nThe band had its first legitimate hit in 1995 with a cover of Eurythmics' \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\". Its video was nominated in the Best Rock Video category at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards. The lead single from the band's second studio album, \"The Beautiful People\", was nominated for three awards at the 1997 ceremony, while Marilyn Manson was named 'Best New Artist' by Rolling Stone. \"The Dope Show\" was released the following year, and the band received the first of a total of four Grammy Award nominations, this time for Best Hard Rock Performance. \"The Dope Show\" won two awards at the 1998 Billboard Music Video Awards, as well as the award for Best Cinematography at the 1999 VMAs.\nThe band's frontman has received nominations for his work as a music video director. He was nominated, along with co-director Robert Hales, for 'Best Modern Rock Clip of the Year' at the 2000 Billboard Music Video Awards for his work on Nine Inch Nails' \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" The band have also received numerous international awards and nominations throughout their career, including NME and Q Awards, MTV Europe Music Awards and the Echo Music Prize. They have won six Kerrang! Awards from a total of eight nominations, and were inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2000. Their ninth studio album, The Pale Emperor, was released in 2015 and was nominated for 'Album of the Year' at both the Alternative Press Music Awards and at online magazine Loudwire, while Rolling Stone dubbed it the 'Best Metal Album of 2015'.
