The Eagles would go on to win the title again in 2008 defeating The Crew Wrocław 26:14.\nIn 2009 the team signed contracts with its first two import professional players from the United States.\nIn the 2012/2013 season the Eagles signed four American import players.\nUniforms\nThe Warsaw Eagles’ navy blue home jersey has orange numbers, letter outlines and vertical stripes on opposite sides.
