It is located south of the main built-up area of Waltham Abbey, lying between Epping Forest, Chingford and Enfield. It is 11.6 miles north-northeast of Central London and is in the London commuter belt.\nHistory\nThe name of the hamlet is derived from \"Seward’s ton\", with 'ton' meaning a farmstead.\nSettlement at Sewardstone could date back to the Iron Age, indicated by the discovery of a dugout canoe.\nSewardstone formed part of the ancient parish of Waltham Holy Cross. It was one of the four ancient subdivisions of the parish. Sewardstone was the only part of the parish of Waltham Holy Cross that had not formed part of the manor of Waltham and instead formed the Sewardstone manor. Waltham Abbey owned most of the land in the parish from the 12th century. The whole parish adopted the Public Health Act 1848 (11 & 12 Vict. c. 63) in 1850 which created the Waltham Holy Cross Local Board of Health. The hamlet was recorded as being  in 1888.\nIn 1874 the Waltham school board built a school at Sewardstone with about 100 places. Attendance declined after the First World War and it closed in 1939.\nIn 1934, an area near Yardley House of 58 acres with a population of 23 (in 1931) was transferred from Sewardstone to Chingford.\nIn 2013 a new community of 119 homes was built at Gillwell Hill on the boundary with Chingford. The land was formerly used as kennels for the greyhound racing at Walthamstow Stadium.\nGovernance\nThere are three tiers of local government for Sewardstone. The parish council is Waltham Abbey Town Council, the district council is Epping Forest District Council and the county council is Essex County Council.\nGeography\nThe area has scattered development, with large sections of open land. It is more or less linear, being centred on the A112 road (Sewardstone Road), which connects Waltham Abbey and Chingford. The King George V Reservoir and Sewardstone Marsh form the boundary with the London Borough of Enfield, to the west. There is a connection to Enfield Island Village by a footpath but not by road. A section of Epping Forest forms the boundary with the London Borough of Waltham Forest to the south, aside from in the southwest where the built-up area of Chingford extends into Sewardstone at Gilwell Hill. To the east is High Beach.\nThe headquarters of the world Scout movement, Gilwell Park, is in Sewardstone.\nNearest places\n*Sewardstonebury\n*High Beach\n*Chingford\n*Walthamstow\n*Loughton\n*Waltham Abbey\nTransport\nTo the south of the hamlet, London Buses Route 215 offers a frequent service from Lee Valley Camp Site to Walthamstow Central.
