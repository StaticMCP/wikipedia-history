All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1972 United States presidential election. Hawaii voters chose 4 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.\nHawaii was won by incumbent United States President Richard Nixon of California, who was running against Senator George McGovern of South Dakota. Nixon ran for a second time with former Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland, and McGovern ran with former U.S. Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver of Maryland.\nNixon won the election in Hawaii with a decisive 25-point landslide, with a clear majority in all four counties. Nixon was the first Republican to win the state of Hawaii and the only one until Ronald Reagan won the state in 1984. Hawaii's result was 1.76% more Republican than the nation at large. This marks the only time in which Hawaii voted to the right of Alaska, and the last time Hawaii voted more Republican than the nation. It is also the first of only two times in the state's history that a Republican candidate for any office has won over 60% of the state's vote (alongside the re-election victory of Governor Lingle in 2006), or has even won 60% of the vote in any of the state's counties.\nNixon was the first Republican to carry Honolulu County. This was the first of three times in which Oahu supported the Republican candidate for president.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1972 United States presidential election in Hawaii\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Richard Nixon (incumbent)\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 168,865\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 62.48%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 4\n|-\n! style=\"background:#33f; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| George McGovern\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 101,409\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 37.52%\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FFCC00; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Libertarian\n| John Hospers\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| -\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c00; width:3px;\"|\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | American Independent\n| John G.
