During his tenure, he emphasized modernizing the Republican Party's campaign infrastructure, improving voter outreach, and addressing the party's weaknesses identified in the aftermath of the 2012 presidential election.

Priebus ran unopposed for re-election, reflecting widespread support within the party. He received 166 out of 168 votes, representing 98.8% of the total.\nImpact\nPriebus's re-election positioned him to lead the RNC through the 2016 presidential election cycle.
