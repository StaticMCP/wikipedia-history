Loosely based on the 1988 film of the same name starring Melanie Griffith, the series stars Sandra Bullock as Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith's character), a role that was initially meant as a starring vehicle for Nancy McKeon.\nSynopsis\nTess McGill is a spunky, independent secretary who has suddenly become a junior executive after she charms company owner A.J. Trask. Tess' first challenge is to survive working with her antagonistic, uptight immediate boss, Mrs. Bryn Newhouse, otherwise known as the \"company witch.\" Tess's best friend, Lana Peters, is a secretary who is more interested in doing her nails and rooting for Tess than in getting ahead herself. Meanwhile, Everett Rutledge is a fellow junior executive who is charming but eager to please. Libby Wentworth is Tess's world-wise \"permanent temporary\" secretary who is also a moonlighting musician. Back home each night on Staten Island, Tess has to contend with her doting parents, Joe and Fran. Tess also has to contend with Sal Pascarella, the blue-collar neighborhood Romeo who constantly pursues her.\nReception and cancelation\nDebuting as a midseason replacement, Working Girl drew low ratings and was canceled after eight of the twelve episodes produced aired.\nCast\n*Sandra Bullock as Tess McGill\n*Patrick Brock as Office Regular\n*Nana Visitor as Bryn Newhouse\n*Judy Prescott as Lana Peters\n*George Newbern as Everett Rutledge\n*Eyde Byrde as Libby Wentworth\n*Tom O'Rourke as A.J.
