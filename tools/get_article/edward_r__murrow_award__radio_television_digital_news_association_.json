Murrow Award (Radio Television Digital News Association)\n\nThe Radio Television Digital News Association (formerly the Radio-Television News Directors Association) has been honoring outstanding achievements in electronic journalism with the Edward R. Murrow Awards since 1971. The Murrow Awards recognize local and national news stories that uphold the RTDNA Code of Ethics, demonstrate technical expertise and exemplify the importance and impact of journalism as a service to the community. Murrow Award winning work demonstrates the excellence that Edward R. Murrow made a standard for the broadcast news profession.\nJudging\nSubmissions are judged by a panel of professional journalists. Entries from individual stations are judged regionally. The winners from each region are given a Regional Edward R. Murrow Award and entered into judging for the national awards.  National award winners are recognized each October at the RTDNA Edward R. Murrow Awards Gala in New York City. It is possible for the judges to decide that none of the entries in a given category merit an award, in which case none will be offered.\nEntry divisions\nStarting in 2015 with the addition of student awards, there were nine divisions of National Edward R. Murrow Award winners.  There are two divisions of local radio, local television, and online organizations based on the size of the media market they serve.  These media market sizes are determined by Nielsen for radio and television.\n* Radio Small Market:  local radio stations located in markets 50+\n* Radio Large Market:  local radio stations located in markets 1–50\n* Television Small Market:  local TV stations located in markets 50+\n* Television Large Market:  local TV stations located in markets 1–50\n* Network Radio:  A radio network, syndication service, or program service that programs to multiple markets.\n* Network Television:  A radio network, syndication service, or program service that programs to multiple markets.\n* Small Digital News Organization:  2,499,999 or fewer unique visitors per month.\n* Large Digital News Organization: 2,499,999 or more unique visitors per month.\n* Student:  Anyone enrolled in a high school, college or university in the United States, Canada or any other country.\nCategories\nThe RTDNA website lists the following categories for the Edward R.

Some of the prominent journalists responsible for stories that won Edward R. Murrow awards include Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, Ted Koppel, Holly Williams, Keith Olbermann, Bryant Gumbel, Brian Williams, Michael Moss, Serena Altschul, Richard Engel, and Jeremy Young.
