The Constitution states that the president is the embodiment of executive power, commander-in-chief, \"representative of Azerbaijan in home and foreign policies\", and \"shall have the right of immunity [from prosecution].\" The president rules through his executive office, the Presidential Administration, consisting of a group of secretaries and departmental ministers. Additionally, there is a Cabinet of Ministers regarding economic and social policy and a Security Council regarding foreign, military, and judicial matters.\nThe primary workplace is the presidential building (also known as the presidential apparatus) on Istiglaliyyat Street in Baku. Ilham Aliyev, son of the former president, Heydar, was elected the 4th and current president on 31 October 2003 after his father's resignation due to his deteriorating health.\nSelection process and term\nEligibility\nCandidates for the position must be Azerbaijani citizens without age restrictions and have lived in Azerbaijan for at least 10 years. According to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, the same person can be on the post of President an unlimited number of terms.\nElection\nEach faction in the National Assembly has the right to nominate a candidate for the presidential elections. The minimum number of signatures for a presidential candidate fielded by a political party with no parliamentary representation is 40,000, before amendments to the law.\nTerm of office\nPrior to 2009, the term of office was five years, with a maximum of two terms. A referendum in 2009 removed the limit on the number of terms, and in 2016, another referendum increased the term to seven years. According to the Azerbaijani administration, a longer term would provide for more continuity in decision-making. The Venice Commission, of which Azerbaijan is a member, warned that this and other provisions of the referendum gave \"unprecedented\" authority to the president, and could severely upset the balance of power.\nInauguration\nThe official inauguration ceremony of the president is not publicly held, occurring with the participation of officials of the Azerbaijan state (representatives of political parties, public organizations, military personnel, religious figures), members of the government, deputies of the National Assembly, members of the president's family, as well as foreign representatives and other invited guests.\nIt is held within three days after the confirmation of the elected president by the Constitutional Court, during which the president takes the following oath:\nThen the person elected president of Azerbaijan puts his right hand on the Koran and takes the following oath:\nThen the president-elect of Azerbaijan bows and kisses the Azerbaijani flag. The ceremony ends with a speech by the president-elect of Azerbaijan. The following is a list of presidential inaugurations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Place\n!
