Nozaki and Chiaki continued to tag up for the next months, making their debut in a pay-per-view on the first night of the Marigold Winter Wonderful Fight 2024 from November 14, where they defeated Selene Flora (Victoria Yuzuki and Kizuna Tanaka) in tag team competition. They won the Marigold Twin Star Championship on the second night of the same event from December 13, 2024, by defeating Mirai and Mai Sakurai.
