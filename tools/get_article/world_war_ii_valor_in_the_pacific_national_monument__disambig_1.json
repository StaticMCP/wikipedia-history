It was created by presidential proclamation in 2008 as a united site and was abolished in 2019 when each part was given their own individual identity.\nHistory\nPrior to establishment, the only public monument dedicated to the Pacific Theatre in World War II in the region was the USS Arizona Memorial. The monument was created on December 5, 2008, through a proclamation issued by President George W. Bush under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. The proclamation date was selected in anticipation of the 67th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 2008.  This was the first proclamation of a national monument in Alaska since the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) in 1980. ANILCA limited new land withdrawals in Alaska without Congressional approval to 5,000 acres.\nThe John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, signed into law March 12, 2019, abolished the national monument. It split the monument into three individually distinct memorials. The World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument was replaced with the Pearl Harbor National Memorial, Aleutian Islands World War II National Monument, and Tule Lake National Monument.\nSites\nand the mooring quays of Battleship Row, at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii]]\n, Modoc County, California]]\non Atka Island, Alaska]]\nThe national monument included nine sites in three states, totaling :\n:: – sites administered by the National Park Service (21.3 acres).
