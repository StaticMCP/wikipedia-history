N. Reddi and starring V. Nagayya, B. Jayamma and Bhanumathi. The film marked the debut of Ghantasala as a playback singer and Marcus Bartley as a cinematographer.\nReleased on June 6, 1945, Swargaseema celebrated a successful run of 200 days in theatres across Telugu-speaking regions as well as in present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. Bhanumathi's role marked a significant comeback in her career following a hiatus from acting after her marriage. Swargaseema was among the first Telugu films to be screened at an international film festival, held in Vietnam.\nPlot\nMurthy (Nagayya) is a publisher happily married to Kalyani (Jayamma) and the father of their children. After watching a street play in his village, he notices the talented Subbalakshmi (Bhanumathi) and advises her father to take her to Madras to pursue a career in theatre. Subbalakshmi travels to Madras, where she is offered a lead role and adopts the name Sujatha. Murthy becomes infatuated with Sujatha, leading him to neglect his family. Meanwhile, Kalyani struggles to support their children through small tailoring jobs. Ultimately, Murthy realizes his mistake and returns to his family.\nCast\nCast according to the film titles:\n* V.

Reddi, was inspired by the American film Blood and Sand (1941), directed by Rouben Mamoulian. Chakrapani adapted the story for the Telugu audience, with the character of the street dancer being inspired by Rita Hayworth's role in the original film.\nCast and crew\nBhanumathi, who had made her film debut at 14 and gained fame as a singer-actress, retired from acting by the age of 18 to focus on her marriage to P. S. Ramakrishna Rao. In 1944, she was persuaded by B. N. Reddi to return to acting for Swargaseema, drawing inspiration from Hayworth's performance in Blood and Sand. The film also marked the debut of Ghantasala as a playback singer and Marcus Bartley as a cinematographer.\nMusic\nThe music for Swargaseema was composed by V. Nagayya (also the male lead) and Ogirala Ramachandra Rao, with lyrics penned by Samudrala Raghavacharya and Balantrapu Rajanikantha Rao, who worked under the pseudonym Nalinikath. Bhanumathi contributed to the film’s iconic song \"Oho ho paavuramaa\" by recalling the Spanish tune \"Varde Luna\" from Blood and Sand and humming it to inspire the music composition. The song was praised for its melodious tune and became a significant highlight of the film.\nReception\nReleased on June 6, 1945, Swargaseema celebrated a successful run of 200 days in theatres across Telugu-speaking regions as well as in present-day Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. The film’s song sequence \"Oho ho Paavuramaa,\" shot with exceptional panache by cinematographer Marcus Bartley, was particularly acclaimed. It was noted for its visual appeal, leading actor Sivaji Ganesan to watch the film multiple times just to see Bhanumathi's performance. The film’s success marked a significant comeback for Bhanumathi and solidified her legendary status in Indian cinema.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259604/ Swargaseema at IMDb.]\n* [https://indiancine.ma/EGI/info Swargaseema] on Indiancine.ma\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoqF-KPGcyk Swargaseema] on YouTube\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160308030331/http://www.idlebrain.com/nosta/swargaseema.html Swargaseema] at Idlebrain"
