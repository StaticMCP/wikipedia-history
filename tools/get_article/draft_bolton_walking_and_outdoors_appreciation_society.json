There are currently free outings that are held in and around the West Pennine Moors in South Lancashire every Monday and Wednesday evening.\n\"BWOAS\", for short, has helped hundreds of people enjoy walking in the outdoors in a supportive, friendly and inclusive environment. The group has also been responsible for organising several charity fundraisers for Macmillan Cancer Care, Manchester Childrens Hospital, Bolton Mountain Rescue, Rivington Heritage Trust, the Woodland Trust and Bolton Hospice.\nThe group was established in March 2011 by a collective of like minded outdoor enthusiasts, including current Club Chairperson Colin Liptrot. Colin operates his own private informative guided walks and offers navigation tuition as his business Moors to Mountains. Activities take place across the West Pennine Moors, the Peak District and the Lake District.\nBWOAS walks have a maximum capacity for safety and environmental reasons. There is an allocated committee and a team of regular volunteers who collaborate to plan walks and manage the group.\nReferences"
