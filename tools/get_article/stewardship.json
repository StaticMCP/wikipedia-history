The concepts of stewardship can be applied to the environment and nature, economics, health, places, property, information, theology, and cultural resources.\nEtymology\nStewardship was originally made up of the tasks of a domestic steward, from stiġ (house, hall) and weard, (ward, guard, guardian, keeper). In the beginning, it referred to the household servant's duties for bringing food and drink to the castle's dining hall. Stewardship responsibilities were eventually expanded to include the domestic, service and management needs of the entire household.\nNotable councils\n* Forest Stewardship Council, since 1993\n* Marine Stewardship Council, since 1996\n* Aquaculture Stewardship Council, since 2010\nSee also\n* Antimicrobial stewardship\n* Data steward\n* Environmental ethics\n* Environmental stewardship\n* Nuclear stockpile stewardship\n* Patient blood management\n* Product stewardship\n* Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative\n* Stewardship (theology)\n* Stewardship theory\n* Unnecessary health care\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/planet-stewards//link_1 NOAA Planet Stewards Educational Project]\nThe NOAA Planet Stewards Education Project (PSEP) is an example of an environmental stewardship program in the United States to advance scientific literacy especially in areas that conserve, restore, and protect human communities and natural resources in the areas of climate, ocean, and atmosphere. It includes professional teachers of students of all ages and abilities, and informal educators who work with the public in nature and science centers, aquaria, and zoos.
