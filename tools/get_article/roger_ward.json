In his late teens he travelled to Tahiti to begin writing what became the controversial novel and film, The Set. The film was produced in 1970 but the novel was not published until 2011.\nHe was script editor for Homicide, adapted his novel Reflex into the film Brothers and wrote other documentaries and specials. Ward has appeared in over one hundred television shows and films, some of which featured stars such as Marlon Brando, Trevor Howard, Richard Harris, Barry Sullivan, Robert Lansing, Ryan O'Neal, Richard Benjamin, Tom Selleck, Paula Prentiss, Peter Graves, Alan Rickman, Steve Railsback, Olivia Hussey and Laura San Giacomo.\nIn Stone (1974) he played the comedic biker Hooks and in The Man From Hong Kong (1975) he played bumbling Australian policeman Bob Taylor. In The Irishman (1978) he was an Irish mounted policeman, and in Mad Max (1979), he played the police hall captain Fifi. Turkey Shoot (1982) saw him as Ritter the guard from hell, and in The Pirate Movie (1982) he was an all-singing, dancing pirate. In Quigley Down Under (1990) he played Brophy, one of the outlaw gang.\nHe played popular characters in TV series including long-running character Frank 'Weppo' Smith, the Shakespeare-spouting garbage collector in Number 96, who has a romance with Norma Whittaker (Sheila Kennelly) a boxer in Boys from the Bush and also appeared in The Sullivans.\nLater independent films in which he was featured include Long Weekend (2008), Bad Behaviour (2010), the remake of Turkey Shoot (2014), Boar (2017) and The Faceless Man (2018).\nHe has a prominent role in the upcoming Indian film Thariode: The Lost City directed by Nirmal Baby Varghese.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
