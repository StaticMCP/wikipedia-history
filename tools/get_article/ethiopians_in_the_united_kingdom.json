Many of these were political refugees who left behind high paid and respectable jobs. The second, larger wave of Ethiopians to the UK was in 1991, when Ethiopians of all walks of life claimed asylum in the UK. Another civil war 1998 in the country, and continuous political unrest even today means that more and more Ethiopians are leaving their homeland to seek better lives abroad.\nPrior to the civil wars, Ethiopians were free to come to the UK to study, many of whom stayed and are undoubtedly amongst the thousands who now form an ageing population. The Ethiopian community in the UK is now an extremely well integrated group that consists of many generations.\nDemographics\nThe 2001 Census recorded 6,561 Ethiopian-born people residing in the UK. According to the 2011 UK Census, there were 15,058 Ethiopian-born residents in England, 151 in Wales, 258 in Scotland, and 27 in Northern Ireland. Of this total of 15,494 Ethiopian-born residents, 10,517 lived in Greater London.\nCommunity and culture\nThere are now many Ethiopian churches set up across London, including St Mary's Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Battersea Park.
