Virginia's historic culture was popularized and spread across America by Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, and their homes represent Virginia as the birthplace of America. Modern Virginia culture is largely part of the culture of the Southern United States, however, Northern Virginia has become increasingly similar in culture to the Northeastern United States within the past few decades.\nRegional aspects\nThe Smithsonian Institution divides Virginia into nine cultural regions.\n*Eastern Shore\n*Hampton Roads\n*Chesapeake Bay\n*Northern Virginia\n*Central Virginia\n*Southern Virginia\n*Shenandoah Valley\n*Blue Ridge Highlands\n*Heart of Appalachia\nLanguage\nEnglish was passed as the commonwealth's official language by statutes in 1981 and again in 1996, though the status is not mandated by the Constitution of Virginia. English is the only language spoken by , though it is spoken very well by an additional 570,638 (7.9%) for a total of 94.6% of the Commonwealth which speaks English. Spanish has the most speakers of other languages, with 424,381 (5.9%).  Asian and Pacific Islander languages, including Vietnamese and Filipino.\nThe Piedmont region is one of the most famous for its dialect's strong influence on Southern American English.

It is mostly pork with a vinegar-based sauce, ranging from almost all vinegar in the east spiced with red pepper flakes, to a vinegar-based sauce that has some tomato and a bit of sweetness to it the further west one goes.\nMarble cake originated in Rockingham County, Virginia from a Mennonite community.  Shoofly pie is popular in the Shenandoah Valley and was brought to that area from the Pennsylvania Dutch.  Fried peaches, cut in half and simmered in butter with brown sugar melted in their hollows, and served with vanilla ice cream, is a more upscale dessert found in Virginia.\nSausage, both link and patties, and usually flavored with sage, constitutes an important aspect to a traditional Virginian breakfast.  Virginia is also well known for its peanuts which are prepared by either roasting or boiling them.

Winesap apples are commonly grown and used in Virginia, whereas in most other American locales they have fallen out of favor.  Seafood is important to the coastal areas, such as oysters, blue crabs, bay clams, blue fish, bay scallops, haddock, shad, and shad roe in the Spring.

Oyster and spinach soup is a traditional New Year's Eve dish in Virginia, although currently in decline.
