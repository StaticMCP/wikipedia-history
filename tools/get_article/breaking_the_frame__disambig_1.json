It was released in 2011 through Dynamic Tension Records.\nBackground\nBreaking the Frame is Surgeon's first studio album since Body Request (2000). In an interview, he explained that the album \"was very influenced by spiritually inspired music by people like Alice Coltrane, Eliane Radigue and Terry Riley, La Monte Young, that kind of thing.\"\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Pitchfork\n| rev2score = 7.2/10\n| rev3 = Resident Advisor\n| rev3score = 4.0/5\n}}\nMichaelangelo Matos of Resident Advisor commented that \"Each of these nine tracks is stark and enormous.\" He added, \"Straight off, they announce themselves, and while each has a good amount of detail that you don't even have to listen very closely to notice, what's striking about them all is that those strong first impressions remain true the entire time each track plays.\" Tim Finney of Pitchfork stated, \"It's typical on an album whose structures throw shadows of bleak, inhuman grandeur: Enormity, rather than velocity, defines the best work on Breaking the Frame, and there's a masochistic pleasure in being made to feel very small as you lose yourself on the dancefloor.\"}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | PopMatters\n| The 10 Best Electronic Albums of 2011\n|\n| }}\n|}\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from liner notes.\n* Anthony Child – production\n* Trudy Creen – artwork, typography\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
