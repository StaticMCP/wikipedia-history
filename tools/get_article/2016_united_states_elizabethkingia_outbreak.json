Signs and symptoms can include fever, shortness of breath, chills, and cellulitis. Confirmation requires a laboratory test.\nStatewide surveillance of the situation in Wisconsin was organized on January 5, 2016. Cases had been reported from Columbia, Dane, Dodge, Fond du Lac, Jefferson, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Racine, Sauk, Sheboygan, Washington, Waukesha, and Winnebago Counties); Illinois; and western Michigan as of April 13, 2016.\nBetween November 1, 2015 and March 30, 2016, 62 cases of E. anophelis infections were reported to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Division of Public Health.\nThe severity of the outbreak is reflected in a statement by the CDC that \"the agency sees a handful of Elizabethkingia infections around the country each year, but the outbreaks rarely involve more than a couple of cases at a time. To have dozens of cases at once — and more than a third of them possibly fatal — is startling\".\nIn 2017, genomics researchers determined that \"a disrupted DNA repair mutY gene [...] probably contributed to the high evolutionary rate of the outbreak strain and may have increased its adaptability,\" but the source was not identified.\nReferences"
