Towards the end of his tenure, Ward was the oldest member of the legislative body, and had earned the unofficial title \"Dean of the Council.\"\nThroughout his 25 years in office, Ward worked ardently for clean beaches and against airplane noise, issues at the heart of his constituency near the coast and around John F.

Ward also cast one of the deciding electoral votes for President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) after being named a Democratic elector for New York State in the 1960 presidential election. Ward continued to be involved in Democratic politics until his death, serving as Democratic District Leader in Queens after being defeated in the 1993 City Council election.\nIn addition to his political activities, Ward served on various community boards and organizations, such as the 101st Precinct Community and Youth Council, the Ozone Howard Little League, and the Wyckoff Heights Hospital Advisory Board. Ward died of cancer on November 8, 1994, at the age of 83.\nPS 232 in Lindenwood and the playground for PS 207 in Rockwood Park have been named in his honor.\nReferences"
