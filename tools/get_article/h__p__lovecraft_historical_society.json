Lovecraft Historical Society or HPLHS is the organization that hosts Cthulhu Lives!, a group of live-action roleplayers for the Cthulhu Live version of Call of Cthulhu. Founded in Colorado in 1984, it is now based in Glendale, California.  Their motto is Ludo Fore Putavimus (\"We thought it would be fun\").\nHPLHS produces a number of Cthulhu Mythos films, including the eponymous The Call of Cthulhu, as well as sound recordings, under its Mythoscope and Mythophone labels, respectively.  They also offer props, both for sale and for free download.\nOriginally a hobbyist group, HPLHS has become a for profit company dedicated to creating content faithful to the spirit of the Gothic 1920s source material but leavening it with some humour.\nThe HPLHS is the world's largest organization of Lovecraft enthusiasts, with members in more than fifty countries.\nProductions\nPrinted work\n*Strange Eons** (1986-1990)\n*''The Spirit of Revision - Lovecraft's Letters to Zealia Brown Reed Bishop (2015)\n*Miskatonic Missives\n*A Shoggoth on the Roof Libretto (2005)\n*Miskatonic University Monographs\n**Archeological Interpretations of Myth Patterns in the Iconography of the Codex Beltrán-Escavy\n**The Curious Sea Shanty Variants of Innsmouth, Mass.\n**The Discovery of Fragments of Kitab Al-Azif at Harran\nAudio\nThe H.P.
