It was composed of the eastern portion of Annapolis County, and all of Kings and Hants counties.\nIn 1978, it lost the eastern portion of Annapolis County to South West Nova.\nIn 1996, it was renamed \"Kings—Hants\". In 2003, it was given its current boundaries: the area encompassed by the provincial electoral district of Kings West was removed from Kings—Hants and added to West Nova. There was no territory changes as a result of the 2012 federal electoral redistribution.\nFollowing the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding gained some territory (Berwick area) in Kings County from West Nova.\nMembers of Parliament\nThis riding has elected the following members of Parliament:\nScott Brison resigned his seat effective 10 February 2019.
