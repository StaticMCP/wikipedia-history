There are numerous named peaks. The ridge of the Great Dividing Range passes through the west of the locality. This creates a watershed. Creeks which rise in the north-east of the locality flow north (Gunnawarra) and contribute eventually to the Herbert River which flows into the Hinchinbrook Channel at Macknade/Lucinda in the Shire of Hinchinbrook. Creeks which rise in the south-west are tributaries of the Burdekin which flows into the Coral Sea at Rita Island in the Shire of Burdekin. Meanwhile, the north-west of the locality contributes to the Mitchell River and the south-west to the Gilbert River, both of which flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria at Kowanyama (Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama) and Howitt/Yagoonga (Shire of Carpentaria) respectively.\nKirrama National Park is located in the south of the locality. Part of the Forty Mile Scrub National Park is located in the north-west of the locality.\nThe Kennedy Developmental Road passes through the locality from the north-west (Forty Mile) to south-west (Greenvale).\nMuch of the land is undeveloped with some grazing on native vegetation.\nDemographics\nIn the , Minnamoolka had a population of 38 people.\nIn the , Minnamoolka had a population of 27 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Minnamoolka.
