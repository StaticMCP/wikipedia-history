Kingston SE is the largest town of the district and also the seat of council.\nThe district is mostly reliant on agriculture, particularly cereal crops, sheep and cattle.\nCape Jaffa also hosts a lobster fishing fleet, with other commercial fishing also providing part of the area's economy.\nTourism also plays a minor role, with Kingston SE a minor tourist destination, noted for its 'Big Lobster', with Mount Scott Conservation Park  and Butchers Gap Conservation Park also located in the district.\nHistory\nThe area was originally settled by the Ngarrindjeri Aborigines, who lived along the Coorong and extended across the Murray River to the present day site of Goolwa.\nThe first European to make contact with this stretch of coastline was the French explorer Nicolas Baudin who discovered Lacepede Bay in 1802. In 1840, the Brigantine Maria was shipwrecked near Cape Jaffa after leaving Port Adelaide. All 25 people aboard were massacred by Aborigines along the Coorong.\nThe town of Kingston was established in 1856, the town being named after the government surveyor, George Strickland Kingston by Governor McDonnell, in 1858 and renamed as Kingston SE in July 1940.\nThe District Council of Lacepede was established on 4 July 1873 to serve the growing area. The name was changed to the present designation on 1 July 2000. Mayor Legoe justified the change at the ceremony, stating; \"The decision to change the name of the Council was not a decision to change for the sake of change. It is a decision to change the image and identity of the Council to propel itself into the 21st Century\".\nLocalities\nThe district council includes the following localities - Avenue Range (part), Blackford, Cape Jaffa, Coorong, Keilira, Kingston SE, Marcollat, Pinks Beach, Reedy Creek, Rosetown, Sandy Grove, Taratap, Tilley Swamp, Wangolina, West Range and Wyomi.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ward!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\"|Mayor\n| |&nbsp;|| Jeff Pope||\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\"|Unsubdivided\n| |&nbsp;|| Christopher England ||\n|-\n| |&nbsp;|| William Armfield ||\n|-\n| |&nbsp;|| Tim Harding ||\n|-\n| |&nbsp;|| James Starling ||\n|-\n| |&nbsp;|| Fiona Rasheed ||\n|-\n| |&nbsp;|| Jamie Parkins ||\n|-\n| |&nbsp;|| Carol Koch ||\n|-\n|}\nKingston District Council has a directly elected mayor.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingstondc.sa.gov.au Council page]\n*[http://www.lga.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=4182 LGA of South Australia - Kingston DC]"
