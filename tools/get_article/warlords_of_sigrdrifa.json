When even nuclear weapons fail to destroy them, the world's leaders are left wondering how to resist. Suddenly, a boy claiming to be Odin appears, promising to help humanity battle against Ragnarök by providing Valkyries who have the ability to destroy the Pillars. However, instead of modern jet fighters, Valkyries fly magically enhanced propeller driven fighters. In 2025, after a successful but costly attack on a Pillar in Europe, S-class Valkyrie Claudia is transferred to Japan. On the way there she is ambushed, but is assisted by a local, inexperienced Valkyrie squadron. Later, when she arrives at the Tateyama Base, Claudia meets the pilots she previously encountered, Miyako, Sonoka, and Azuzu, who are members of the 909th Valkyrie Wing. Claudia believes she was sent there due to her reputation as the \"Grim Reaper\". Suddenly, a Pillar is detected approaching Tateyama, but since it is underwater, it is almost impossible to attack. Azuzu comes up with a plan to force it to the surface with explosives. Working together, the 909th are able to destroy the Pillar.

The Pillar is also slowly draining the life force of the trapped civilians, putting a time limit on when they can be rescued.

Getting up close to the Pillar, Miyako is able to break its water barrier while Sonoka uses fire retardant to neutralize its heat barrier, allowing Claudia to destroy it.

Ronge, Kinpatsu, and Gurasan overhear the conversation and offer to help take them to the base, though everybody must wear swimsuits first. The trio then lead the Valkyries through a secret underground passage that takes them directly to the base. Once they finally reach the base, the Valkyries receive backup from another Valkyrie.
