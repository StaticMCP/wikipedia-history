It provides information to thousands of people each year through its Research Library and The Bronx County Archives, by mail, over the phone, and via digital communication.  The Society also works with the New York Public Library's Bronx Library Center and its branch libraries in sharing these resources.  The Bronx County Historical Society is digitizing select portions of its collections.\nThe Society honors Bronx High School valedictorians with an annual awards ceremony held at the Museum of Bronx History. The Society is also the largest publisher of books and articles about the Bronx and produces  The Bronx County Historical Society Journal, the oldest continuously published historical periodical in the New York metropolitan area.\nPartnerships and special projects\nThe Bronx County Historical Society is a joint sponsor with Fordham University's Department of African and African American Studies of the Bronx African American History Project. Over 230 oral histories have been gathered so far, fourteen associated archival collections accessioned, and many books, articles, lectures, musicals, commemorations, and exhibitions have been produced. The oral histories are being cataloged at The Bronx County Archives.\nIn 2010, the Society launched the Bronx Latino History Project, which highlights Latinos who lived or contributed to the Bronx throughout its history. Because the Latino population is the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the borough since the mid-20th century (constituting more than half of the county's population), the Society's education department is continuing the process of increasing its collections to reflect the Bronx's ethnic diversity.\n, Pelham Bay Park: ''\"Near this site on October 12, 1776 Col. John Glover and 600 patriots held off British and Hessian forces under Gen Howe long enough to save Washington's troops from destruction, enabling them to withdraw to Westchester and ultimate victory.'' Bronx County Historical Society 1960\"]]\nBCHS Research Library\nThe Bronx County Historical Society Research Library is the only facility in New York City solely dedicated to the collection, preservation, and dissemination of the history and heritage of the Bronx. The diverse materials in its collections document the growth and development of the Bronx from its early days as part of Westchester County, through its annexation to the City of Greater New York, and up to the present.\nThe Research Library houses over 7,000 books, pamphlets, and periodicals, a number of which also exist in digital formats, as well as more than 200 atlases and maps. Its Photograph Collection comprises 75,000 photographs and slides, including 3,000 nineteenth- and early twentieth-century glass negatives; and 1,600 postcards. The Research Library also has a sizable A/V Collection, which contains more than 200 audio cassettes, 300 reel-to-reel tapes, 150 phonograph records, and 200 video cassettes and DVDs. The Research Library's Vertical file collection includes more than 400,000 newspaper clippings and other ephemera on Bronx subjects.\nIn conjunction with Fordham University, the BCHS research library houses collections of the papers of Jamaal Bowman, Aurelia Greene, Jackie Robinson, and other notable figures associated with the Bronx.\nThe library received a grant from the  National Endowment for the Humanities in 1977 \"to research and publish the first comprehensive reference work on the history and heritage of Bronx County.\"\nThe Bronx County Archives\nThe Bronx County Historical Society founded The Bronx County Archives in 1974 to act as a repository for Bronx municipal records. Since that date, The Bronx County Archives have acquired a dedicated building, located next door to The Bronx County Historical Society Research Library, equipped with moisture- and temperature-controlled storage space. The Bronx County Archives currently house 114 individual collections, which comprise around 3205 cubic feet and uniquely document many aspects of Bronx history. These aspects include Bronx businesses and economic development; city planning and infrastructure; civic organizations and clubs; culture and cultural institutions; capital disinvestment and urban devastation; education; healthcare; housing and cooperatives; local history; municipal records; politicians and political parties; and radicalism and community activism. The Bronx County Archives also contain especially rich documentation of Black and Jewish life and culture in the borough. A growing number of archival collections document Latino life and culture in the Bronx as well. As of July 2020, finding aids have been created for the majority of collections and will be provided to researchers upon request.\nNational landmark historic houses\nIn addition to the Bronx County Historical Society Research Library and The Bronx County Archives, The Bronx County Historical Society administers two national landmark historic houses, the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, the home of poet Edgar Allan Poe, and the Valentine–Varian House, a colonial-era farmhouse that hosts the Museum of Bronx History.\nBCHS publications\nSince its founding in 1955, The Bronx County Historical Society has published, authored, commissioned, and produced popular books, monographs, pamphlets, periodicals, bibliographies, research aids, classroom guides, primary source collections, radio broadcasts, videos, musical performances, and other special interest items on many aspects of Bronx history. In addition, since 1964 the Society has published an annual journal on Bronx history that contains scholarly articles, reminiscences, oral histories, book reviews, and poetry.\nBelow is a partial list of books and pamphlets published or authored by The Bronx County Historical Society, 1955–2020:\nLocal and regional history\n# Beirne, Elizabeth, ed.
