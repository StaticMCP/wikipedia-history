Hong Kong–based New World Development (NWD) acquired Ramada in 1989 and re-launched Renaissance Hotels as a separate brand. The brand was acquired by Marriott International in 1997. As of January 31, 2023, it has over 170 hotels worldwide.\nHistory\n, opened in 1981 in Aurora, Colorado.]]\nRenaissance Hotels was founded in 1981 as Ramada Renaissance, an upscale division of Ramada Inns. The first property was located in Aurora, Colorado, outside Denver. Ramada's hotels and restaurants were sold to Hong Kong–based New World Development Ltd. in 1989 for $540 million. New World divided the Renaissance Hotels brand into a separate chain and developed Renaissance and Ramada as independent hotel brands. (the U.S. rights to the Ramada name were sold to Prime Hospitality), and the former Ramada Corp. was renamed Aztar Corp.\nIn 1993, New World Development acquired the Stouffer Hotels & Resorts (40 Hotels) chain from Nestle for an estimated $1.5 billion, New World Development licensed the Stouffer Hotels brand for three years and  28 U.S. Stouffer properties were reflagged as Stouffer Renaissance during a transitional period lasting until 1996. The Stouffer Presidente hotels in Mexico became Inter-Continental hotels.\nOn September 27, 1995, New World Development (NWD), took their management and franchising company public (listing on the New York Stock Exchange) and created a new company called Renaissance Hotel Group N.V.. which operated the New World, Renaissance & Ramada International hotel brands. New World Development retained ownership of many of the individual hotel structures through CTF Holdings, a private company owned by the Cheng family, the owner of NWD group.\nOn February 18, 1997, Marriott International bought the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. for US$1&nbsp;billion from NWD. The deal dramatically expanded Marriott's presence in fast-growing Asian markets. The Marriott announcement came only a few weeks after Renaissance Hotel Group N.V., tentatively agreed to be sold to rapidly expanding Doubletree Corp. However, Marriott surpassed '''Doubletree's $890-million offer. The Marriott acquisition did not include the Stouffer Hotels brand. The Ramada International brand was included in the acquisition.\nRenaissance Hotel Group N.V.''' operated and franchised 150 hotels with 35 based in the United States. Marriott had 1,035 hotels based in the U.S. and 75 additional hotels operating outside of the U.S. The acquisition of the Renaissance and Ramada portfolio by Marriott expanded its footprint globally. In September 2004, Marriott sold the Ramada International brand to Cendant Corp., today known as Wyndham.\nAccommodations\nHistorical\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"min-width:30em; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|  !!  !!
