It was built about 1730 and extensively remodeled in the 1840s in the Greek Revival style.  The original section is a -story, stone structure with a clapboard upper section, originally in the Dutch Colonial style.  The remodeling added a sweeping roof with an overhang supported by seven box columns.  At the rear are two interconnecting frame additions completed about 1900.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\nSee also\n*List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Staten Island\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Richmond County, New York\nReferences"
