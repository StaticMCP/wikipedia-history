Opened in 1991 on a  site, the center is part of the Riverwalk Arts and Entertainment District and has contributed to the redevelopment of the city's downtown area.\nDesigned by architect Benjamin C. Thompson, the complex includes multiple theaters that host a variety of performances, including opera, ballet, concerts, plays, lectures, and community events. The Broward Center partners with several organizations, such as the Symphony of the Americas, Florida Grand Opera, Miami City Ballet, the Concert Association of Florida, and Gold Coast Jazz. National touring Broadway productions are regularly presented in collaboration with Broadway Across America.\nLocated in the South Florida region, the Broward Center has been recognized as one of the most-visited theaters in the United States. In 2007, it was ranked fourth in the world by Venues Today and seventh worldwide by the concert industry publication Pollstar based on annual ticket sales.\nAs of 2011, the center reported attendance of over 700,000 patrons annually across more than 700 events. That same year, plans were announced for a major expansion project, scheduled to begin in spring 2012.\nArchitects and design team\n*Architect: Benjamin Thompson and Associates, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts\n*Acoustician: Kirkegaard Associates, Chicago, Illinois\n*Theater Consultant: Jules Fisher Associates, New York, New York\n*Consulting Engineer: Spillis Candela & Partners, Inc., Miami, Florida\nHistorical development\nThe Florida legislature in 1984 established the Performing Arts Center Authority (PACA) to oversee construction, then policy-making, at the Broward Center. The Downtown Development Authority, along with citizens, private sources, and the Broward Performing Arts Foundation worked together to raise the funding required to build the theater complex.\nBy the end of 1987, initial fundraising goals had been met and with supplementary grant monies from city, county, state, and national sources secured, the project went out to bid. The acclaimed Cambridge, Massachusetts architecture firm of Benjamin Thompson and Associates, Inc was selected to design the facility. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in May 1988 to initiate the building phase.\nBy early 1991 the  facility was completed at a cost of $54 million. The doors officially opened on February 26, 1991, with the first national tour of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. The tenth anniversary of the Broward Center was marked by retiring the entire building mortgage, 11 years ahead of schedule.\nIn 2007, from June 28-July 1, they premiered the Go, Diego, Go! live. The Live was based on the episode titled \"The Great Jaguar Rescue\". The Broward Center for the Performing Arts was the last stop for the Go, Diego, Go! live. It was one of the most popular art performances that ever happened.\nRiverwalk Arts & Entertainment District\nIn 1998, the Broward Center began a collaboration with neighboring merchants and cultural attractions along the New River that would evolve into the formation of the Riverwalk Arts and Entertainment District. This destination marketing organization features the Broward Center, The Museum of Art/Fort Lauderdale, Florida Grand Opera, Concert Association of Florida, Fort Lauderdale Historical Society, and Historic Stranahan House Museum. Formed to promote cultural tourism to Fort Lauderdale and to the Riverwalk District, in particular, more than 1 million ticketed visitors annually attend programming at the combined Arts & Entertainment District partner venues.\nExpansion and management\nIn 2004 Broward Center became a managing partner of the Rose and Alfred Miniaci Performing Arts Center, located on the campus of Nova Southeastern University. A year later, Broward Center assumed management of the historic 1100-seat Parker Playhouse in east Fort Lauderdale. In 2007, Broward Center was chosen as the creative consultants to help guide the emerging Miramar Cultural Center/Arts Park in western Broward County through its early development. It will now manage operations of this new 800-seat theater, scheduled to open in the fall of 2008.\nThe Broward Center is governed by the Performing Arts Center Authority (the \"Authority\"), a volunteer board of 13 members.    In October 2023, the Authority announced  its appointment of Ty Sutton as president and CEO of the Broward Center.  Sutton, who begins his new position on February 12, 2024, will succeed Kelley Shanley who has served as President & CEO since January 2009.\nVenues and facilities\nPerformance venues at BCPA, on the New River (Himmarshee):\nAu-Rene Theater, the main performance space for major international, national and regional productions, including Miami City Ballet, Concert Association of Florida, Florida Grand Opera and Broadway Across America touring companies.\n*Capacity: 2,658\n*Notable performances: The Phantom of the Opera (1991 and 2018), Tony Bennett (2007), Broadway's The Lion King (2002, 2007 and 2015), Whoopi Goldberg (2005), Renée Fleming (2006), Wicked (2008), k.d. lang (2008)\n*Seating structure: Orchestra, Mezzanine, and Balcony\nAmaturo Theater, for dramatic productions as well as children's theater, film, community theater, choirs, chamber, jazz, folk and symphonic orchestras, seminars, and emerging dance companies.\n*Capacity: 584\n*Notable performances: Gold Coast Jazz, Symphony of the Americas, Capitol Steps, Second City Revue, Paula Poundstone, Jane Monheit\nAbdo New River Room, a conference/banquet/performance facility available for various types of activities, such as cabaret, dinner theater, rehearsals, and speaker programs as well as for public and private receptions and events.\n*Capacity: 225 seated seminar/theater style; 200 banquet style:\n*Notable performances: Tony n’Tina's Wedding, Next Step Dance Theater, Laffing Matterz\n*Location: On the same Ft.
