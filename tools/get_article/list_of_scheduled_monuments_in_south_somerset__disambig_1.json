The South Somerset district covers an area of  ranging from the borders with Devon and Dorset to the edge of the Somerset Levels. It has a population of approximately 162,000. The administrative centre of the district is Yeovil.\nA scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; Historic England takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War.\nThere are 69 scheduled monuments in South Somerset. Some of the oldest are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hillforts, such as Kenwalch's Castle and Bowl barrows. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites including the Low Ham Roman Villa which included an extensive mosaic floor, now on display in the Museum of Somerset. Religious sites are represented by Muchelney Abbey, which was probably founded in the 8th century, and Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, from the 11th. Bruton Abbey was founded by the Benedictines before becoming a house of Augustinian canons. Stoke sub Hamdon Priory was formed in 1304 as a chantry college rather than a priory. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles such as Cary Castle, and church crosses which date from the Middle Ages. Several packhorse bridges, such as Bow Bridge, Plox also appear in the list. The most recent monuments include the Round House, a village lock-up in Castle Cary dating from 1779, and several duck decoys The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.\nMonuments\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = ST 64169 32192\n| lat = 51.0884\n| lon = -2.5132\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Cary Castle was built either by Walter of Douai or by his son Robert in the late 11th or early 12th century. In 1143, after the Battle of Wilton, Henry de Tracy gained control of Cary Castle and built another stronghold in front of the older castle; however this was demolished when William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester and his troops arrived to take the castle. By 1468 the castle had been abandoned. Around that time a manor house was built on or adjacent to the site of the castle, possibly by Baron Zouche. It later passed to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset but by the 1630s it was occupied by Edward Kirton. It was largely demolished at the end of the 18th century.\n| uid = 1019897\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Castle Cary castle remains from Lodge Hill.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Cary Castle\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =Q15207717\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 28 August 2001\n| grid_ref = ST 68464 34709\n| lat = 51.111\n| lon = -2.452\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Bruton Abbey was founded as a house of Augustinian canons in 1135, by William de Mohun, who later became the Earl of Somerset. It may have been a Benedictine priory before the Norman conquest of England. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey was granted to a John Drew of Bristol, but later transferred to Sir Maurice Berkeley. The latter built a house on the site incorporating some of the buildings, but this was demolished in 1786.\n| uid = 1020015\n| show_img = yes\n| image = BrutonAbbey.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Bruton Abbey\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =Q4979871\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 8 October 1954\n| grid_ref = ST 75360 31017\n| lat = 51.0782\n| lon = -2.3533\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Ballands Castle was a motte-and-bailey castle, probably built after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. The castle sits close to the contemporary Norman castles of Cockroad Wood and Castle Orchard, and may have been built as part of a system of fortifications to control the surrounding area.The motte of the castle is now around  high, and up to  wide.

Aerial photography has shown that there are a number of farm buildings around a large courtyard, although the excavations concentrated on the residential west wing and bath house. The large 14&nbsp;foot (4.3&nbsp;m) square mosaic depicts the story of Aeneas and Dido, as told in the 1st century BC by the Roman poet, Virgil. Like the villa, it dates to the mid-4th century. The Low Ham mosaic is unique in Roman Britain in providing a narrative story in five panels: Aeneas sailing to Carthage, Aeneas meeting Dido, the couple out hunting, the couple embrace and Dido left alone after Aeneas' departure. It is the earliest piece of narrative art in the country. It was lifted in 1953 and is now on display in the Museum of Somerset. The site has been placed on the Heritage at Risk Register due to the risks from extensive animal burrowing.\n| uid = 1006192\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Low ham mosaic.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat = Low Ham, Roman Villa\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata = Q2202563\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed = 22 December 1977\n| grid_ref = ST 65578 27411\n| lat = 51.0450\n| lon = -2.4924\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Earthworks show the site of houses and water management features.

The castle is close to the contemporary Norman castles of Ballands and Castle Orchard, and may have been built a system of fortifications to control the surrounding area. By 1086 the surrounding land was held by Walter of Douai, although no documentary evidence of the castle remains. The castle was built with a motte and two baileys, running along a north–south ridge, with a possible entrance to the east. The motte today is  wide, up to  high and is surrounded by a  deep ditch. The two baileys were probably linked to the motte by wooden bridges.\n| uid = 1008256\n| show_img = yes\n| image = Cockroad Wood Castle.jpg\n| upload_desc =\n| show_ref = yes\n| reference =\n| commonscat =\n| show_wikidata= no\n| wikidata =Q5139668\n}}\n| show_architect = no\n| architect =\n| show_listed = no\n| date_listed =\n| grid_ref = ST 42883 24732\n| lat = 51.0191\n| lon = -2.8157\n| show_notes = yes\n| notes = Muchelney Abbey is an English Heritage property.

The conversion to be a dovecote took place around 1780. The square tower was built of local stone with Doulting stone dressings.
