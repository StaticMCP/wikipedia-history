He was also instrumental in spearheading a newspaper recycling program, years before such recycling practices were commonplace. Newspaper from the local community was collected once a month by the Scouts and sold to an insulation company, with the proceeds to benefit the scout troop.  From September 16 through 29, 1978, funds from these efforts sent 12 Scouts and 3 leaders to Brownsea Island, England, the location of Lord Baden Powell's first Boy Scout camping trip in 1907.\nAfter military service\nLand retired from the Marine Corps as a major in 1977.\nLand was elected as Secretary of the National Rifle Association of America in 1994.
