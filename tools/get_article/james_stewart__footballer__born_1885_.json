Stewart played for Motherwell before he joined Liverpool in 1909. He made his English Football League debut at the start of the 1909–10 season and played every match bar one, as Liverpool finished as runners-up. He scored 18 goals during his debut season, but he was unable to replicate this form over the following seasons as he only made a further 25 appearances in the next four seasons. He left Liverpool in 1913 and returned to Scotland to play for Hamilton Academical. He later worked as a trainer (assisted in some cases by his son of the same name) at clubs including Hamilton, Blackpool, Dundee and Portsmouth.\nReferences"
