Bevan would also later co-found Electric Light Orchestra.\nThe Vikings started as a skiffle group in the Nechells district of Birmingham in the spring of 1957, formed by Terry Wallace and his friends George Jenkins, John \"Bango\" Badrick, Allan Compton, John Jolley, and Terry Smith, with their first gig being at the local Cromwell Street Working Men's Club. Barry Harber played bass from 1961 to 1964.\nThe band was signed to and released three singles on Pye Records in the mid-1960s, one of which – \"Your Loving Ways\" – was written by the group.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
