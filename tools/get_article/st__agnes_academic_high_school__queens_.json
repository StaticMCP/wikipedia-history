It was located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, and was established in 1908 by the Sisters of St. Dominic.\nSt. Agnes held its first graduation for 6 students in 1912. The school was originally co-educational, but shifted its focus to all-girls education in the aftermath of the Second World War. The current building was built in 1958.\nSt. Agnes had been affiliated with the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.\nThe school was closed in June 2021 due to financial hardships.\nCollege Partners\nMolloy College\nSt. Agnes Academic High School had partnered with Molloy College to match student interests with college resources with a program named D.R.E.A.M. BIG. Offering an up-close and personal look at college and careers, students gained insight from leaders in higher education through a series of experiences, seminars, and workshops at St. Agnes and at the Molloy College campus in Rockville Centre.\nThe D.R.E.A.M BIG Program offers:\n*Building Your Future in STEM: From High School to College\n*The Molloy College Center for Environmental Research and Coastal Oceans Monitoring Blue Point Oyster Hatchery\n*The Humanities and Technology\n*TV Studio Workshop\n*Law & Order Seminar\n*Dance/Theatre/Art Workshop\n*Choosing a Career Path\nSt. John's University\nThe St. John's College Advantage Program (CAP) provided qualified seniors the opportunity to enroll in college credit courses from the university while still enrolled in high school.  St. Agnes currently offers CAP courses in British Authors, College Writing, Advanced Algebra, Calculus, Human Biology, People and the Environment, Psychology, Psychology of Women, and Emergence of a Global Society.\nSUNY Albany\nThe SUNY at Albany Science Research Program was open to Grades 10, 11 and 12.
