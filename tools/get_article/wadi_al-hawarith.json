It was ethnically cleansed at the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War on March 15, 1948, following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. It was located 16.5&nbsp;km northwest of Tulkarm. Wadi al-Hawarith was mostly destroyed with the exception of four houses.\nIn 1945, Wadi al-Hawarith had a total population of 1,330.\nThe term also refers to the wider surrounding area, especially that which was subject to a controversial land sale in 1933. The sale included about 40,000 dunams of land (roughly 10,000 acres) within the Tulkarm subdistrict; the area sold is also considered to be \"Wadi al-Huwarith,\" not just the village.\nHistory\nThe area was originally called the River of Wadi Iskandaruna, but its name changed to Wadi al-Hawarith when the Haritha tribe settled there in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The Haritha tribe can be traced back to the Bani Sunbus tribe, who are believed to have descended from Tayyi, and ultimately from al-Qahtaniyya, a Yemeni tribe that split into smaller groups and migrated to the Hijaz, Iraq, Palestine, and Syria during the early Islamic conquests. The people of Wadi al-Hawarith were a branch of the Bani Sunbus.\nBritish Mandate era\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate  authorities, Wadi al-Hawarith had 812 inhabitants; 810 Muslims and 2 Christians,  where the Christians were one Roman Catholic and one Maronite.  The population had increased in the 1931 census to 1,112; 1,077 Muslims, 30 Jews and 5 Christians, in a total of 255 houses.\nUntil 1929, the people of Wadi al-Hawarith farmed the village land as tenants. That year, the Jewish National Fund acquired lands amounting to 30,800 dunams at auction from absentee landlords and initiated legal proceedings to evict the current tenants, who were Bedouin Palestinians that were resisting their removal. The British-appointed Shaw Commission notes that a \"state of extreme apprehension\" gripped the Palestinian public at large, whose members feared that they too would suffer the same fate of displacement at the hands of Jewish colonists. According to historian Weldon Matthews, the sale was \"the third largest area acquired by the JNF [Jewish National Fund] during the mandate, and it gave Jews contiguous ownership of land in the coastal plain....Despite much of the land being swampy, it was in the heart of the citrus belt and consequently was of great commercial value.\"\nPopulation estimates for the tribe in 1929 varied, with the Jewish Agency's Settlement Department reporting 850 people, the British high commissioner estimating between 1,000 and 1,200, and the tribal leader counting 1,500. The absentee owners of the land were the Tayans, a wealthy Christian family from Beirut, members of the urban Levantine merchant elite who \"had accumulated extensive landholdings by the end of the Ottoman era.\"\nThe inhabitants of the area under question refused to leave and resisted British government efforts to encourage them to do so. A long legal battle ensued, including with national leader Awni Abd al-Hadi representing the local residents. These court proceedings were highly publicized in Palestine—\"the lead story in the Arabic press\" during early summer 1933— and ultimately contributed to the increased militancy of nationalist organizations during the period. The final eviction order was issued by the court on June 15, 1933, prompting calls for strikes and declarations of protest by such groups as the Istiqlal Party, the Palestine Communist Party, and the Congress of Youth, among others.\nIn 1933, after successfully evicting the people of Wadi al-Hawarith from a section of their land, Zionist settlers established three settlements close to Wadi al-Hawarith: Kfar Vitkin  was south of village land, Mikhmoret to the west of  Wadi al-Hawarith, north, and Ma'abarot southwest of  Wadi al-Hawarith, south. Neither of these settlements were on village land. Furthermore, in 1934, Kfar Haroeh was settled on seized village land, and Geulei Teiman was settled on seized village land in 1947.\nVillage Statistics, compiled in 1938 by the Government Office of Statistics, recorded the population of Wadi al-Hawarith as 2974; out of them, 1716 Jews and 1258 Palestinians.\nIn the 1945 statistics,  Wadi al-Hawarith (North) had 850 inhabitants, while Wadi al-Hawarith (South) had 480; 1,330 in total, all Muslims, and the total land area was 9,812 dunams. Palestinians used 960 dunams for cereals,  while they owned 1,555 dunams of uncultivable land.\n1948 war\nThe Arab Liberation Army instructed in mid-February 1948 the inhabitants of Wadi al-Hawarith to evacuate their women and property to the Palestinian area, which it is unclear if they did. After an ambush by Haganah the month after, which killed three or four Palestinians, the inhabitants began to leave but stressing \"that the Jews all along had promised them that nothing bad would happen to them\" if they stayed. The British mandate authorities advised them to leave and helped with a military escort. The evacuation apparently took several weeks.\nIn early May, advisers of the Alexandroni Brigade recommended destroying the homes in Wadi al-Hawarith, except those of stone \"that may be made fit for human [i.e., Jewish] habitation\".\nThe Canadian Jewish Chronicle reported from Jerusalem on March 29, published on April 2, saying that the sudden mass exodus of Palestinian villagers \"heightened the belief here that Arab gangs are preparing for an all-out assault on Tel Aviv and Jewish coastal areas in the immediate future.\" According to this article, the evacuees had always had friendly relations with the settlers. The evacuation apparently was coordinated between the Jews and Sheik Abu Kishek, head of a prominent tribe in the Tel Aviv area, and states that Sheik Kishek had spent the previous month at Mufti headquarters, and \"reportedly got instructions to evacuate the area.\"\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* (p.
