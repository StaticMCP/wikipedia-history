These ads were signed by Ramsey Clark, Noam Chomsky, Philip Berrigan, and other activists. Some of the signatories (including Berrigan) told The Nation after the fact that they had not agreed to sign or had been misled as to the group behind the ads. After the ads were published, the Peru Peace Network (PPN), a group of American religious and human rights organizations working in Peru, launched a counter-campaign, approaching signers of the ad individually and giving them a flier.\nTerrorism\nThe support committees were also involved in the Shining Path's clandestine terrorism, such as the 1988 assassination of Peruvian captain Juan Vega Llona and the 1992 Peruvian embassy attack in Stockholm.\nIn 1988, Peruvian captain Juan Vega Llona was shot to death during a trip to La Paz, Bolivia by a hit squad of Shining Path assassins supported by CARP-Bolivia. The Central Committee had ordered for Llona's annihilation in retribution for his involvement in the 1986 Peruvian prison riots, in which 224 Shining Path prisoners were killed during an uprising.\nCARP's branches were also used to vandalize and threaten numerous Peruvian embassies, a tactic mainly inspired by the 1992 attempted assassination of Peruvian ambassador Gustavo Silva Aranda in Stockholm, Sweden.\nOpposition\nDue to the brutal nature of Shining Path, these Committees often faced opposition.\nWhen Alberto Fujimori visited San Francisco, Amnesty International picketed both the hotel where he spoke and a Berkeley bookstore selling Shining Path propaganda.\nThe Peruvian government published a booklet listing the atrocities of the groups and asked the European host countries to withdraw political asylum status from Peruvians who propagandize for the guerrillas.\nSee also\n* Peru–Sweden relations\n* List of ambassadors of Peru to Sweden\n* 1986 Soviet embassy attack in Lima\n* 1987 North Korean embassy attack in Lima\nReferences"
