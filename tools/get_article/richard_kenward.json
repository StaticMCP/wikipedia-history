His father was a farmer of over  living at The Manor House Icklesham.\nKenward made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1899 season in a match against Essex in June when he made 56 in his second innings to help Derbyshire to victory. Kenward generally made a reasonable score when he played more than one innings and his average for the team was 17.52. However he stopped playing for Derbyshire at the end of the season.\nIn 1902 Kenward played four games for Sussex but made little impression as 21 of his 23 runs came in one innings. He also played a match for a London County team captained by W. G. Grace against Derbyshire when Billy Bestwick took him for one. In 1905 he played for the Gentlemen of England  and for London County.\nKenward was a right-hand batsman and played 27 innings in 17 first-class matches with an average of 14.33 and a top score of 56.\nKenward died at Croydon, Surrey at the age of 82. His brother Charles Kenward  played cricket for Surrey second XI  and one first-class match for the Gentlemen of England.\nReferences"
