The club reached the playoffs after finishing first in the Eastern Conference (MLS). The club also reached the MLS Cup final, where they lost to the Houston Dynamo. Additionally, they club participated in the U.S. Open Cup, and the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. They were eliminated in both competitions in the quarterfinals.\nSeason overview\nThe Revolution made three selections in the 2006 MLS Superdraft. The team's preseason preparations, as well as their participation in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, saw them traveling to Bermuda and Costa Rica. As a result of this, the club announced \"TNT Vacations\" as its official vacation partner, and introduced a series of fan travel packages that allowed fans to take trips to see the team.\nIn the 2006 CONCACAF Champions' Cup the Revolution again faced  Liga Deportiva Alajuelense, who they'd played in 2003. The Revolution qualified for the tournament by winning the Eastern Conference in 2005. Alajuelense won the series 1–0 on aggregate with a 90th minute free kick from Carlos Hernandez.\nIn the 2006 Major League Soccer season Twellman would again lead the team in goals, with 11. Clint Dempsey added 8 goals, and Steve Ralston and Andy Dorman contributed 6 a piece. Dorman additionally led the team in assists, with 7. Clint Dempsey and Shalrie Joseph were named to the roster of the 2006 MLS All-Star Game.\nOn-field results were not as strong as 2005, and the team went on a 7 match winless run throughout the month of June, and a six match winless streak in July and August. The June winless run kicked off in a May 20 matchup away at FC Dallas, which saw the Revolution concede the fastest four goals in MLS history (19 minutes), a record which would stand until 2020 when it was broken by Los Angeles FC.\nStruggles were due in part to injury, but also to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Avery John and Clint Dempsey would both miss seven weeks of MLS action away with the U.S. and Trinidad & Tobago national teams. The Revolution's July 22 match against Houston Dynamo FC marked Joseph's 100th appearance for the club. Ralston would make his 300th MLS appearance on August 6 at Chivas USA, and on August 9th vs. Kansas City, both Jay Heaps and Joe Franchino made their 150th career appearances as members of the Revolution. Additionally in July, the Revolution played an international friendly match against Celtic F.C. as part of Celtic's pre-season U.S. mini tour. 16,312 turned out to watch the match, which the Revolution salvaged in the 90th minute on a strike from Ryan Latham nullifying Rocco Quinn's 80th minute effort.\nIn August, Celtic would make a $1m bid for Shalrie Joseph, but the  move would be blocked by MLS.\nWith Pat Noonan battling injuries for much of the season, the  Revolution signed Mexican international striker José Manuel Abundis late in the season after Abundis was unable to come to a contractual agreement with Deportivo Toluca F.C.. He would soon become upset with lack of playing time. The same day, the team announced they'd additionally signed Arsène Oka to their developmental roster.\nDespite the summer slump, the team's 12-12-8 record was good enough to see them to a second-place finish in the Eastern Conference, and a berth in the 2006 MLS Cup Playoffs.\nIn the Eastern Conference semifinals the Revolution once again squared off against rival Chicago Fire FC. Justin Mapp's 38th-minute goal was enough to give the Fire a 1–0 lead heading into the 2nd leg at Gillette Stadium.\nIn the return leg, Nate Jaqua gave Chicago an early lead, but goals from Twellman Noonan helped the Revolution complete a comeback and force penalties. In the shootout, Matt Reis not only converted a penalty, but saved shots by Thiago and Iván Guerrero to give the Revolution a 4–2 win and see them into the Eastern Conference Final for the fifth consecutive season.\nThe Eastern Conference Final was held at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in front of 19,552 fans on November 5. Twellman's 4th-minute goal was enough to see the Revolution lift the trophy for the 3rd time in its history, and the Revolution were for the second season in a row off to Pizza Hut Park for the MLS Cup Final.\nThe sold-out MLS Cup 2006 saw the Revolution square off against Houston Dynamo, a club that was concluding its first season in the league. The match was scoreless until the 113th minute, when Twellman guided a shot past Pat Onstad after being played in behind Houston's line by Khano Smith. Unfortunately Houston would immediately level the scoring; with Brian Ching heading past Reis from the ensuing kickoff.\nThe match went to penalties, and despite more heroics from Reis (saving a shot by Brad Davis and converting his own kick) Onstad would save shots by Noonan and Heaps, giving the Dynamo a 4–3 edge, and the title.\nIn the 2006 U.S. Open Cup, the Revolution would win their first Open Cup match since 2003 on August 2 against the Rochester Raging Rhinos in the fourth round, but would fall in the quarter finals to eventual-champion Chicago Fire.\nSquad\nFirst-team squad\nAs of
