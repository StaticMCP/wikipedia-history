It was the capital of the Heliopolite or 13th Nome (province or district) of Lower Egypt and a major religious centre. Its site is within the boundaries of Ain Shams and El Matareya, districts (kism) in northeastern Cairo.\nOne of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt, occupied since prehistoric Egypt, it greatly expanded under the Old and Middle Kingdoms. But today it's mostly destroyed, its temples and other buildings having been scavenged for the construction of medieval Cairo. Most information about the ancient city comes from surviving records.\nA major surviving remnant of Heliopolis is the obelisk of the Temple of Ra-Atum erected by Senusret I of the Twelfth Dynasty. It remains in its original position (now in el-Masalla, El Matareya, Cairo). The  high red granite obelisk weighs 120 tons (240,000&nbsp;lbs) and is believed to be the oldest surviving obelisk in the world.\nOther obelisks originating in Heliopolis were taken by the Romans after their conquest of Egypt. The taller  Vatican obelisk, was taken by Emperor Caligula, and now stands in St. Peter's Square, the only ancient obelisk in Rome never to have fallen. Emperor Augustus took the Obelisk of Montecitorio from Heliopolis to Rome, where it remains.\nTwo smaller obelisks called Cleopatra's Needles, now in London and New York, were also originally from Heliopolis.\nNames\n}}|iwn-nw:niwt|align=right|era=egypt}}\nHeliopolis is the Latinised form of the Greek name Hēlioúpolis (), meaning \"City of the Sun\". The Egyptian gods Ra and Atum, whose principal cult was located in the city, were interpreted by ancient Greeks as, and thus identified with, Helios, the personified and deified form of the sun.\nIts traditional Egyptological transcription is Iunu. Its native name was  \"The Pillars\". The exact pronunciation is uncertain because ancient Egyptian recorded only consonantal values.\nSome scholars reconstruct its pronunciation in earlier Egyptian as *ʔa:wnu, perhaps from older /ja:wunaw/. Variant transcriptions include Awnu and Annu. The name survived as Coptic  Ōn.\nThe city is called \"House of Ra\" in the Pyramid Texts, which date to the Old Kingdom of Egypt.\nIt appears as ʾOn () in Genesis 41:45 and 50 and ʾĀwen () in Ezekiel 30:17 and Amos 1:5 (apparently Baalbek). This later form would be the expected form in pausa, but perhaps is a play on awen \"idolatry.\"\nHistory\nAncient\n]]\nIt was the principal cult center of the solar deity Atum, who came to be identified with Ra and then with Horus as Ra-harakhty. The primary temple of the city was known as the \"Great House\" ( *Par ʻĀʾat) or \"House of Atum\" ( *Par-ʼAtāma'', ). Its priests maintained that Atum or Ra was the first being, rising self-created from the primeval waters. A decline in the importance of Ra's cult during the Fifth Dynasty led to the development of the Ennead, a grouping of nine major Egyptian deities that placed the others in subordinate status to Ra–Atum. The High Priests of Ra are not as well documented as those of other deities, although the high priests of Dynasty VI (BC) have been discovered and excavated.\nDuring the Amarna Period of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Pharaoh Akhenaten introduced a kind of henotheistic worship of Aten, the deified solar disc. He built a temple named \"Elevating Aten\" (), whose stones can still be seen in some of the gates of Cairo's medieval city wall. The cult of the Mnevis bull, another embodiment of the Sun, also had its altar here. The bulls' formal burial ground was situated north of the city.\nIn the Septuagint in Exodus 1:11, this city is mentioned as being one of the places that was rebuilt by enslaved Hebrews. The store-city Pithom in the same passage is, according to one theory, Heliopolis. Today, it is generally believed that Pithom is the archaeological site of either Tell el-Retabeh or Tell el-Maschuta.\nHellenistic\nAlexander the Great halted at this city on his march from Pelusium to Memphis.\nThe temple of Ra was said to have been, to a special degree, a depository for royal records, and Herodotus states that the priests of Heliopolis were the best informed in matters of history of all the Egyptians. Heliopolis flourished as a seat of learning during the Greek period; the schools of philosophy and astronomy are claimed to have been frequented by Orpheus, Homer,  Pythagoras, Plato, Solon, and other Greek philosophers. Ichonuphys was lecturing there in 308 BC, and the Greek mathematician Eudoxus, who was one of his pupils, learned from him the true length of the year and month, upon which he formed his octaeterid, or period of 8 years or 99 months.\nPtolemy II had Manetho, the chief priest of Heliopolis, collect his history of the ancient kings of Egypt from its archives.\nThe later Greek rulers, the Ptolemies, probably took little interest in their \"father\" Ra, as Greeks were never much of sun worshipers. The Ptolemies favored the cult of Serapis, and Alexandria had eclipsed the learning of Heliopolis. Thus, with the withdrawal of royal favour, Heliopolis quickly dwindled, and the students of native lore deserted it for other temples supported by a wealthy population of pious citizens. By the first century BC, Strabo found the temples deserted, and the town itself almost uninhabited, although priests were still present.\nHeliopolis was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, being noted by most major geographers of the period, including Ptolemy, Herodotus, and others, down to the Byzantine geographer Stephanus of Byzantium.\nRoman\nIn Roman Egypt, Heliopolis belonged to the province Augustamnica, causing it to appear as  when it needed to be distinguished from Roman Heliopolis. Its population probably contained a considerable Arabian element. Many of the city's obelisks were removed to adorn more northern cities of the Delta and Rome. Two of these eventually became London's Cleopatra's Needle and its twin in New York's Central Park.\n'' by Léon Cogniet. The Battle of Heliopolis took place during Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1800]]\nIslamic\nDuring the Middle Ages, the growth of Fustat and Cairo only a few kilometres away caused its ruins to be massively scavenged for building materials, including for their city walls. The site became known as the \"Eye of the Sun\" (Ayn Shams) and ʻArab al-Ḥiṣn.\nLegacy\nat Heliopolis, area of the temenos and surroundings, 1903-1906.]]\nThe importance of the solar cult at Heliopolis is reflected in both ancient pagan and current monotheistic beliefs. Classical mythology held that the Egyptian bennu, renamed phoenix, brought the remains of its predecessor to the altar of the sun god at Heliopolis each time it was reborn. In the Hebrew Bible, Heliopolis is referenced directly and obliquely, usually in reference to its prominent pagan cult. In his prophesies against Egypt, Isaiah claimed the \"City of the Sun\" () would be one of the five Egyptian cities to follow the Lord of Heaven's army and speak Hebrew.) instead.}} Jeremiah and Ezekiel mention the House or Temple of the Sun () and Ôn, claiming Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire would shatter its obelisks and burn its temple and that its \"young men of Folly\" (Aven) would \"fall by the sword\".\n(currently held in the Museo de Bellas Artes de Sevilla)]]\nThe \"Syrian Heliopolis\" Baalbek has been claimed to have gained its solar cult from a priest colony emigrating from Egypt.\nThe Titular Episcopal See of Heliopolis in Augustamnica remains a titular see of both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nPresent site\n'']]\nThe ancient city is currently located about  below the streets of the middle- and lower-class suburbs of Al-Matariyyah, Ain Shams, and Tel Al-Hisn in northern Cairo. The area is about  west of the modern suburb which bears its name.\nSome ancient city walls of crude brick can be seen in the fields, a few granite blocks bearing the name of Ramesses II remain, and the position of the great Temple of Ra-Atum is marked by the Al-Masalla obelisk. Archaeologists excavated some of its tombs in 2004. In 2017, parts of a colossal statue of Psamtik I were found and excavated. The site has been excavated a number of times over the years with some remaining unpublished.\nGallery\nA selection of old maps showing Heliopolis are below:\nFile:Tabulam Hanc Chorographicam agri Ditionis de Grand Cairo comprehenso situ urbis memphiticae praenobili viro DD Gulielmo - Pococke Richard - 1743.jpg|1743 map\nFile:MemphisJamesRennell01.jpg|1799 map\nFile:1882 Maclure and Macdonald Bird's-Eye View Map of Cairo.jpg|1882 map\nSee also\n*List of ancient Egyptian towns and cities\n*Other Heliopolises, particularly\n** Heliopolis, the 20th-century suburb of Cairo\n** Ilioupoli, the 20th-century suburb of Athens settled by Egyptian Greeks\n*Ancient Egyptian creation myths – in reference to the religious belief system of Iunu at Heliopolis\n*List of Egyptian dynasties – in reference to the reigns centered at Heliopolis\n*Benben\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* Allen, James P. 2001. \"Heliopolis\".
