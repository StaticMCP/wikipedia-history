M. G. Le Clézio first published in 1988. The subjects are Latin American history, Latin American studies, Romance languages, as well as comparative studies and history of religion\n11 editions were published between 1988 and 2004 in 5 languages and held by 835 libraries worldwide.\nContents\nLe Clézio conducts an inquiry into the disappearance of the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica in the 16th century, particularly the end of the Mexican civilization at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors. The author analyses the personalities of characters such as Hernán Cortés, La Malinche, Moctezuma II, Cuauhtémoc, and other key figures.\nHe refers extensively to the descriptions offered by Bernal Díaz del Castillo in his  Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España in analysing the events. He imagines what might have happened if the native populations had not been reduced, and what their impact on Western civilization might have been. Claiming that the West holds both economic and cultural sway over the contemporary world because of the colonization of America, he wonders how the cultural life of Mesoamerica – particularly that of the Aztecs – would have evolved had the arrival of the Europeans not decimated these societies.\nReviews\nLe Figaro and Kirkus Reviews reviewed the book.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
