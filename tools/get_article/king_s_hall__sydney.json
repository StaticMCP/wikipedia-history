Its foundation-stone was laid by the eminent Theosophist Charles \"Bishop\" Leadbeater, who opened the building on 4 June 1916. The hall was chiefly used for public lectures.\nThe Theosophical Society split into two factions in the 1920s, chiefly on account of Leadbeater: the Independent Theosophical Society took the Hunter Street property and Adyar House, at 19 Bligh Street, founded in 1925, by the others.\nAn earlier King's Hall\nThe Theosophical Society had an earlier building called \"King's Hall\" at 132 Phillip Street, Sydney, built in 1909.\nReferences"
