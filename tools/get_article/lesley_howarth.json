As a child, she attended the Bournemouth School for Girls, then, as an adult, received education from the Bournemouth College of Art and Croydon College of Art.\nAwards\nThe Pits (1996) is a Junior Library Guild book.\nIn January 2000, The Guardian named Mister Spaceman the children's book of the week.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Awards for Howarth's writing\n!Year\n!Title\n!Award\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|1993\n|\n|Whitbread Children's Book Award\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|MapHead\n|Carnegie Medal\n|Shortlist\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|MapHead\n|Guardian Children's Fiction Award\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Weather Eye\n|Nestlé Smarties Book Prize (ages 9–11)\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|MapHead\n|W.
