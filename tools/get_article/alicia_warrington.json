I even had all the action figures.\"\nWarrington was raised in a single-parent home and grew up listening to music from all different genres. \"I grew up with my grandparents playing Polka music in the house, my mom always had the R&B and classic rock (Anita Baker to The Beatles), my sister was getting Ozzy tapes banned from our house and my uncle was pushing Queensrÿche, Dokken and Quiet Riot at me. I love MUSIC. Period. If it's good, I'm going to listen to it, I'm going to play it and I'm going to be influenced by it—in one way or another. I grew up listening to absolutely everything and today, you will find [just that] in my collection. I like everything from En Vogue to Lamb of God.\"\nAround 11 years old, Warrington taught herself how to play drums on her uncle's drum set by watching and listening to other drummers. She learned songs by playing along to cassette tapes of her favorite bands. As a teen, Warrington performed in metal and punk bands in Michigan and began touring at the age of 15. After 2 years of college, Warrington packed up her car and moved by herself to Los Angeles.\nCareer\nWarrington got her big break in 2002, when she replaced Kelly Osbourne's drummer on MTV hit reality show, \"The Osbournes\". Warrington performed on numerous award shows and television programs with Osbourne, as well as toured in over 11 countries, with bandmates Devin Bronson, Josh Paul and Mat Dauzat. She also appeared on Kelly's 2003 album Changes as well as a DVD, Kelly Osbourne: Live at the Electric Ballroom.\nWarrington followed up that success drumming for Canadian pop artists Lillix, Disney's mega-hit series Hannah Montana, Selena Gomez, Dawn Robinson of 90's Funky Divas En Vogue, Uh Huh Her with Leisha Hailey, Gore Gore Girls, Colton Dixon from American Idol and as of March 2012, The X Factor's Chris Rene.\nIn 2015, she started her own solo Death metal band Dohrn, where she is also a bassist, guitarist, vocalist, keyboardist as well as drummer and vocalist.\nIn 2018, she was then invited as a guest in Survivor Series by Tom Phillips, while she didn't end up going, but later became a ring announcer. Within a year into her role, Triple H allowed her to reintroduce her Death metal tone into her announcement style.\nEndorsements/setup\nWarrington is endorsed by Ludwig Drums, Paiste Cymbals, Aquarian Drumheads, Vic Firth Sticks and daBeat.\nLudwig Maple\n12\" Rack Tom\n18\" Floor Tom\n22\" Kick Drum\n6x14\" Hammered Brass Snare\n6x10\" Epic Side Snare\nPaiste Cymbals\n14\" Twenty Custom Collection Full Hats\n18\" Alpha Thin Swiss Crash\n19\" Signature Full Crash\n20\" 2002 Crash\n22\" Twenty Custom Collection Ride or 22\" Signature Blue Bell Ride (Alternate)\nAquarian Drumheads\nCoated Hi-Velocity (main snare), Coated Studio-X (side snare), Coated Response 2 (toms), Impact 3 or Super Kick 2 (kick).\nVic Firth Sticks\nGavin Harrison Signature or American Classic Rock\nDiscography\nWarrington has largely featured on:\nDOHRN – Levels Of Hate (Single 2015)\nDOHRN – Becoming The Disease (Single 2015)\nLight FM – Voices in My Head (2013)The Dollyrots – One Big Happy (2012)The Dollyrots – Have A Crappy Summer (2012)The All-Girl Boys Choir – electric.
