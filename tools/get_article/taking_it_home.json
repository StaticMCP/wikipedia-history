The title was also used for a 1990 video release of a Buckwheat Zydeco show recorded in London.\nThe album peaked at No. 104 on the Billboard 200.\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Ted Fox. It was recorded with Buckwheat Zydeco's eight-member band, Ils Sont Partis. Eric Clapton contributed a guitar solo to the cover of \"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\".\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = Houston Chronicle\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = MusicHound Folk: The Essential Album Guide\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n|rev5score =\n}}\nThe St. Petersburg Times wrote that Buckwheat \"mixed vibrant, up-to-the-minute sound quality and full production with the kinetic rootsiness of straight-up zydeco.\" The San Francisco Chronicle found the album to be inferior to On a Night Like This, but praised Buckwheat's decision to give \"Clapton a chance to outdo his old solo on a romping, rollicking 'Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad'.\"\nThe Houston Chronicle stated: \"Feasting off the Creole culture's self-renaissance of the '70s and '80s, [Buckwheat]'s been able to move zydeco into the contemporary marketplace without sacrificing its roots. That is the major accomplishment here.\" The Chicago Tribune thought that Taking It Home \"finally crosses the line and becomes the nightmare purists always warned about... With few exceptions, the overblown, overly fast, repetitive pop tunes are mindless mainstream music with an accordion.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
