By discussing the various literary trends that were around in Russia between the revolutions of 1905 and 1917, Trotsky analyzed the concrete forces in society, both progressive as well as reactionary, that helped shape the consciousness of writers at the time.\nIn the book, Trotsky also argued that since the dawn of civilization, art had always borne the stamp of the ruling class and was primarily a vehicle that expressed its tastes and sensibilities. Nonetheless, he went on to argue against the seemingly obvious conclusion that after a proletarian revolution, the proletariat as a ruling class should, therefore, strive to create its own proletarian art.\nTo illustrate this, he points out that the bourgeoisie as a class had time and resources to form its culture long before the bourgeois revolutions in Europe in the 19th century, while the proletariat, by its position in society, is deprived not only of culture but primarily of the material means to attain it. Therefore, unlike previous revolutions in history, the proletariat takes power not to install itself as a ruling class forever and hence create its own distinct culture but to create a society in which the existence of classes is materially impossible. Therefore, the task of the proletariat in power with respect to art after seeing to the more pressing needs of daily life (one must not forget Russia was a war-torn country) is to assimilate all the cultural achievements of the past and lay the foundations for a truly classless and human culture and art in the future. Trotsky's conviction of the heights human beings can reach once the fetters of oppression are thrown asunder is illustrated by the following quote from the book:\n}}\nScholarly evaluation\nIn a comprehensive survey of Trotsky’s political thought, political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz argued that Trotsky’s writings on cultural matters as evident in Literature and Revolution \"were undoubtedly amongst the most informed and enlightened within the Bolshevik leadership\". Yet, Knei-Paz added that an underlying limitation of Trotsky’s analysis was that he premised the overall legitimacy of art on the basis of a political criteria.\nSee also\n* List of books by Leon Trotsky\n* Problems of Everyday Life - Trotsky's 1924-25 writings on culture, science and education.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* Borev, Yuri (1991). \"Ėstetika Trotskogo\" Эстетика Троцкого.
