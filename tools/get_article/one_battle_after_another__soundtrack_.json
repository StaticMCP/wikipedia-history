The film score was composed by Jonny Greenwood and released through Nonesuch Records on September 26, 2025.\nDevelopment\nJonny Greenwood composed the film score for One Battle After Another renewing his association with Anderson for the sixth time since There Will Be Blood (2007). Greenwood was involved with the film ever since its inception and had the script since late 2023. He wrote music based on the script, and played to the finished film during production so that the team could get a sense of understanding on the tone and go along with the script. Anderson and Greenwood watched the dailies of the film, to use the musical pieces throughout the film.\nSome of the pieces involved Steely Dan's 1972 song \"Dirty Work\" which served as the center of the theme song for the specific duration based on the rhythm and melody for that theme being particularly acute. Anderson noted \"Jonny's music is always unique and special. We got a sneak preview of where this was going, what the tension was going to be, and what we needed to sustain, so it's a tremendous luxury to work like that, and it's because Jonny is steps ahead of us.\"\nRelease\nThe film score was released through Nonesuch Records on September 26, 2025, the same day as the film's release in digital platforms. A physical edition of the album is scheduled to be released on November 14.\nReception\nPeter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \"a jolting, jangling, nerve-shredding score\". Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote \"More essential to the film's tone is a truly bonkers score by Jonny Greenwood, one that almost constructs themes for sections around sparsely played individual instruments. For a long stretch in the middle of the film, as Bob and Sergio evade Lockjaw\"s team, it sounds like a single piano key being struck, with the occasional flurry of what could be a cat running along the ivories. It\"s a remarkably effective choice, a score that almost sounds like an alarm going off somewhere.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote \"Jonny Greenwood\"s modernist musical score pacing the film like a metronome of suspense.\"\nJustin Chang of The New Yorker wrote that the score \"veers between manic percolation—imagine a xylophone humping a coffeepot—and grandly operatic surges of synth. The music sweeps us up in the queasy thrill of revolt, but also in the heat and momentum of an impetuous romance.\" David Jenkins of Little White Lies wrote \"Jonny Greenwood's score another blinder\". Amy Nicholson of Los Angeles Times commented that \"Jonny Greenwood's marvelously uneasy score of pounding piano, sounding at once improvised and insistent, hammers away as if trying to remember its own tune\".\nBarry Hertz of The Globe and Mail noted that the film is \"buoyed by a jittery, jangly score by Anderson's long-time collaborator Jonny Greenwood that is electric enough to power the grids of several municipalities\". Ross Bonalme of Collider wrote that \"Greenwood, as always, completely overwhelms with his score. The use of strings held over an extended period of time sounds as though they could split at any second as the tension rises, and heightens pretty much every moment in the film. Greenwood's score is nearly omnipresent throughout the almost three hours, but it's never oppressive and always necessary in setting the tone.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Jonny Greenwood, except \"Mean Alley\" written by Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke.\nAdditional music\nThe following songs were featured in the film, but not included in the soundtrack:\n* Jon Brion – \"Bunker Bumper\"\n* The Shirelles – \"Soldier Boy\"\n* Steely Dan – \"Dirty Work\"\n* The Ramsey Lewis Trio – \"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\"\n* Sheck Wes – \"Mo Bamba\"\n* Travis Scott ft.
