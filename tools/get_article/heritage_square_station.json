It was one of three stations to be renamed shortly before the line's opening. It was then renamed to Heritage Square/Arroyo (also signed as Heritage Square/The Arroyo) for the nearby Heritage Square Museum complex and the Arroyo Seco creek and canyon. Metro now refers to the station by the shorter Heritage Square.\nReferences\nExternal links"
