Examples include maize and tapioca.\nAgricultural classification\nThe following list contains plant products for human use.\n*Cereals\n*Legumes\n*Vegetables\n*Fruits\n*Nuts\n*Oilseeds\n*Sugars and starches\n*Fibres\n*Beverages\n*Narcotics\n*Spices\n*Condiments\n*Rubber\n*Forage\n*Green manure and green leaf manure\nCereals\nHistorically, wheat and barley were used as offerings, called Cerealia munera after Ceres, the Roman goddess of harvest. Subsequently, the grains used for food, and especially for making bread, were called Cerealia or cereals. The term is applicable to the grains obtained from the members of the family Poaceae, such as rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, barley, millet, rye, and oats.\nPseudocereals are plants such as buckwheat or amaranth, which are used similarly to cereals, but belong to families other than Poaceae.\nPulses\nThe term pulse is used for the seeds of plants from the Fabaceae family (legumes), such as beans, pea, lentil and chickpea. Pulses supply proteins and form chief source in vegetarian food. Leguminous plants fix nitrogen in root nodules, produced with the help of nitrogen fixing bacteria.\nOils and oilseeds\nPlants wits high fat percentage are used to produce vegetable oils. Examples include oil palm, olive, soybean, rapeseed and sunflower.\nPastures\nThe grasses and legumes which are grown in arable land and left for animals to graze. The straw of paddy and cholam and dry plants of pulse crops and groundnut form important forages. The foliage of a number of trees and shrubs which are edible to animals form another source of forage especially in dry areas and during periods of scarcity.\nSugars and starches\nSugar is extracted from sugarcane and sugar beet. Starch can be extracted from maize, cassava and potatoes.\nSpices and condiments\nFibers\nRubbers\nThere are trees found in most parts of the world (but mostly Africa) that make or provide rubber for human uses.\nGreen manures and green-leaf manures\nGrowing of special crops for adding organic matter and nitrogen to the soil and by ploughing them in situ is called green manuring.\n*Sunn hemp\n*Pillipesara\n*Kolingi\n*Indigo\n*Sesbania speciosa\nTaxonomical classification\nTaxonomical classification includes the taxonomical aspects of crops which is their morphology and economical parts and agrobotanical characters. This classification increases understanding of the morphological characters of any particular family.\nAs a disadvantage, this classification of crops with different economic uses and morphological and other agrobotanical peculiarities when brought under one family does not generally highlight the economic importance of the individual crops.\nReferences\n* Botany of Tropical Crops - Dr. V.
