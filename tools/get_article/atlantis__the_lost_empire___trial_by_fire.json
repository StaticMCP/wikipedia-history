It was released for free in children's magazines, DVDs, Kellogg's cereal boxes, and in pharmacies. The game was also offered as a free download through Disney Interactive's website in June 2001.\nGameplay\nThis game mainly follows the events in the movie. The player begins on the USS Ulysses as the Leviathan is attacking, and must escape through the underwater cave system on a subpod, evading Leviathan spawn. The player must navigate through the caverns to Atlantis, and solve puzzles to reach the crystal at the end of the game.\nReception\n| MC = 50/100\n| GameRev = D−\n| GSpot = 4.7/10\n| GSpy = 77%\n| GameZone = 6.2/10\n| IGN = 5/10\n| PCGUS = 50%\n| rev1 = The Cincinnati Enquirer\n| rev1Score =\n}}\nTrial by Fire was met with mixed reviews, as GameRankings gave it a score of 56.22%, while Metacritic gave it 50 out of 100.\nThe game was rated 5 out of 10 by IGN, which called the levels \"incredibly short, small, and fairly uninspired\" and recommended to avoid the game.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
