The monument was created within the boundaries of the Deschutes National Forest, which is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, and includes  of lakes, lava flows, and geologic features in central Oregon.\nFrom 1964 to 1966, the volcano was used for training Apollo astronauts.\nDescription\nNewberry National Volcanic Monument consists of four primary visitor destinations: Lava Butte, Lava River Cave, Lava Cast Forest, and Newberry Caldera.\nThe highest point within the monument is the summit of Paulina Peak at , with views of the Oregon Cascades and the high desert.  Paulina Peak may be accessed by road during the summer months, and as the road is both steep and rough, with hairpin turns towards the summit, trailers or long vehicles are discouraged. The summit area of Newberry Volcano holds two alpine lakes full of trout, East Lake and Paulina Lake.\nThe Big Obsidian Flow, created 1,300 years ago, covers . The black, shiny obsidian field is easily accessible from good roads within the caldera, or a trail that traverses the flow.\nLava Cast Forest is roughly  south of Bend, accessible via a  gravel road from U.S. Highway 97. Lava Cast Forest contains a 6,000-year-old lava flow that created molds of ancient trees.\nLava Butte is roughly  south of Bend, Oregon. Lava Butte is a cinder cone volcano that rises  above the Lava Lands Visitor Center. It can be accessed by either vehicle or hiking up a paved road. Interpretive signs, views of the surrounding lava flow and mountains, and an active fire lookout are found on top.\nLava River Cave is roughly  south of Bend. Lava River Cave is open to visitors from May through September. Lava River Cave is the largest uncollapsed lava tube in Oregon, and may be explored by lantern. Temperatures in the cave average . White-nose syndrome has not yet affected resident bats in the cave.\nNewberry Caldera\nNewberry Caldera is roughly  from Bend and  from La Pine. Newberry Caldera is the largest developed area within the national monument. The caldera was formed when a magma chamber collapsed. Over time the caldera filled up with water that created two lakes, Paulina Lake and East Lake. Newberry Caldera has many natural tourism opportunities. Visitors have access to campgrounds, trails, water recreation, lodging, viewpoints, and interpretive guides with Forest Service staff. Newberry Caldera has medium use most of the year with some high usage during peak times of the year.\nThere are twelve trails within Newberry Caldera ranging from 0.25 miles to 21 miles. These trails offer a variety of uses from hiking only to multiuse with hiking, biking, and horse allowed. Along the trails you can find access to fishing, viewpoints, interpretive signs, picnic areas, and even hot springs. There are seven boat launches for water recreationists, (the lakes do restrict boats to 10 miles per hour). The Caldera also offers nine campgrounds accommodating both tent and RV camper. Newberry Caldera also offers a variety of winter activates such as snowmobiling, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and rooms for rent at the resorts.'\nSee also\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.fs.usda.gov/r06/deschutes/recreation Official Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110902235514/http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5300659.pdf Volcanic Vistas: Guide to Newberry National Volcanic Monument]"
