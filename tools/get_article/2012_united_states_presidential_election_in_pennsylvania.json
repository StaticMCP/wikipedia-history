The primary election to select the Democratic and Republican candidates had been held on April 24, 2012. Pennsylvania voters chose 20 electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, against Republican challenger and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and his running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan. Pennsylvania's electoral vote number was a reduction from the 2008 delegation, which had 21 electors. This change was due to reapportionment following the 2010 United States census. Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes are allotted on a winner-take-all basis.\nObama received 51.97% of the vote, beating Romney's 46.59%. Also on the ballot were physician Jill Stein of the Green Party and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, who received 0.37% and 0.87%, respectively. Other candidates could run as write-in candidates, which received a total 0.2% of the vote. The state had been considered likely, but not certain, to go to Obama.Electoral-vote.com labeled Pennsylvania \"likely Democratic\". The Washington Post labeled Pennsylvania \"lean Democratic\". CNN labeled Pennsylvania \"leaning Obama\". The Cook Political Report labeled Pennsylvania \"lean Democratic\".  While the state had voted for a Democrat since 1992, it remained competitive, especially after Bush's loss of only 2.5% in 2004. Its competitiveness was attributable to the stark contrast between the state's diverse, urban voters in areas such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; and rural, blue-collar voters in the rest of the state. However, massive margins in the urban regions of the state and victories in the Philadelphia suburbs, Lehigh Valley, Scranton, and Erie delivered a considerable victory for the president. Obama received over 85% of the vote in Philadelphia County, the highest vote share in its history as of 2024.\nRegardless, Romney improved on John McCain's 10.32% loss in the state in 2008. Just like in 2008, Pennsylvania was the most Republican of the three Rust Belt swing states (including Wisconsin and Michigan) in 2012. Five counties that voted for Obama in 2008 voted for Romney in 2012: Berks, Cambria, Carbon, Chester, and Elk. This made Obama the first Democrat to win the presidency without carrying Cambria County since Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and made him the first Democrat to win the White House without carrying Elk County since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, and the first to do so without carrying Carbon County since John F. Kennedy in 1960.\nAs of the 2024 presidential election, this is the last time that Chester County voted for the Republican candidate, that Luzerne County voted for the Democratic candidate, and that Pennsylvania voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole.\nThis was also the last time Pennsylvania voted more Democratic than Virginia, as Pennsylvania has become a swing state while Virginia has become a blue state. Virginia never voted for Republican Donald Trump, unlike Pennsylvania which voted for Trump in 2016 and 2024.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nIncumbent Barack Obama ran unopposed on the Democratic primary ballot on April24. He received 616,102 votes. There were 19,082 write-in votes. In the floor vote taken at the Democratic National Convention, 242 Pennsylvania delegates voted for Obama, while the other 8 of the state's 250 allocated votes were not announced.\nRepublican primary\nFour candidates were on the Republican primary ballot: Mitt Romney, former Senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum, U.S. Representative from Texas Ron Paul, and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. His home state was set to be the make-or-break primary for Santorum. He had just lost 3 primaries to Romney, and Romney appeared poised to become the presumptive nominee by achieving a prohibitive lead.\nAs momentum in the Republican race built for Romney, Santorum suspended his campaign for four days to meet with 'movement conservatives' to strategize. Rather than returning to campaigning the next Monday, Rick and Karen Santorum canceled campaign events scheduled right after Easter weekend to be in the hospital with their youngest daughter.\nIn deference to the sick child, Romney ceased airing attack ads, replacing them with positive introductory ones.\nOn April 10, Santorum formally suspended his campaign. On May 7, he endorsed Romney. Santorum and Gingrich both released their delegates to Romney in August, shortly before the Republican National Convention.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:none; clear:none;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Candidate\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Percentage\n! | Projected delegates\n! | Actual delegate vote\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|Mitt Romney\n| 468,374\n| 57.8%\n| 31\n| 67\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Rick Santorum\n| 149,056\n| 18.4%\n| 4\n| 0\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Ron Paul\n| 106,148\n| 13.1%\n| 5\n| 5\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Newt Gingrich\n| 84,537\n| 10.4%\n| 3\n| 0\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Write-in votes\n| 2,819\n| 0.3%\n|\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| colspan=\"3\"| Unprojected delegates\n| 29\n|\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| Total:\n| 810,934\n| 100%\n| 72\n| 72\n|}\nGeneral election\nPolling\nIn statewide opinion polling, incumbent Barack Obama consistently led challenger Mitt Romney by a margin of between 2 and 12 percentage points. Analysts rated Pennsylvania as a \"likely Democratic\" or \"Democratic-leaning\" state in the presidential race. On the morning of the election, polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight estimated that there was a 99% likelihood that Obama would win Pennsylvania's electoral votes. At the time, Pennsylvania's electoral votes had gone to the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since Bill Clinton won it in 1992. The average of the last three polls had Obama leading Romney 51% to 46%, which was very close to the actual result.\nDuring the summer, there was significant spending on political advertisements in Pennsylvania, by both the Obama campaign and pro-Romney groups such as Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity. However, because Obama maintained a consistent lead in polling, Pennsylvania came to be considered a \"safe state\" for Obama, and campaign advertising subsided substantially in August. This changed in October, when pro-Romney groups Restore Our Future and Americans for Job Security spent $3 million on advertising in Pennsylvania. Later that month, the Obama campaign and the Romney campaign both launched their own advertising campaigns in Pennsylvania. On November 1, the Republican National Committee announced that it would spend $3 million on television ads in Pennsylvania in the final days of the campaign. In total, pro-Romney spending in Pennsylvania was estimated to amount to as much as $12 million, much more than Obama campaign spending. The Obama campaign characterized the pro-Romney spending surge as \"an act of sheer desperation\", while the Romney campaign argued that they had a realistic chance of winning the state. In the end, Obama carried the state by a modest margin, albeit narrower than his 2008 landslide over Senator John McCain.\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
