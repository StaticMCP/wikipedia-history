This effort was directed primarily at the Mekong Delta area. The Marine Police had responsibility for control and maintenance of security on navigable waterways and sea ports in the Republic of Vietnam, the support of resources control, the enforcement of civil and maritime law, and assistance in other police activities.\nStructure\nHeadquartered at Phú Xuân, near Huế in Thừa Thiên Province, the Marine Police had an initial strength of 350 men, who operated 100 river patrol boats from three bases in the Mekong delta and patrolled 40 miles of waterways by late 1966. The Marine Police was placed in 1969 under the control of the Field Police Command (Vietnamese: Cãnh Sát Dã Chiên – CSDC) co-located to the CSQG Headquarters at Saigon. By 1970–71, it had grown to a force of 2,404 men operating from 22 riverine and coastal bases located in all of the four Military Regions, patrolling 440 miles of waterways and the sea coast in 380 river and inshore patrol craft. Boat crews were trained at the Marine Police Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm huấn luyện cảnh sát biển) co-located at their Phú Xuân HQ, which also housed the Police repair yard.\nSee also\n* Brown Water Navy\n* First Indochina War\n* Junk Force\n* List of weapons of the Vietnam War\n* Republic of Vietnam\n* Republic of Vietnam Military Forces\n* Republic of Vietnam Navy\n* South Vietnamese Regional Forces\n* Vietnam War\nNotes\nReferences\n* H.V.
