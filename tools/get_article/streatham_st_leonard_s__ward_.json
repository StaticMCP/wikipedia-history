The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns three councillors to Lambeth London Borough Council.\nIt is located in the south west of the borough and shares a border with Wandsworth. The ward comprises the western part of the Streatham town centre and is mostly to the west of the A23 Streatham High Road, with the exception of the Stanthorpe Triangle area immediately east of St Leonard's church in the historic village centre. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 14,550.\nSt Leonard's ward is located in the Streatham Parliamentary constituency. The local Member of Parliament since 2019 is Bell Ribeiro-Addy of the Labour Party.\nFuture Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow served as a councillor here from 1986 to 1990.\nThe ward was renamed from '''St Leonard's''' to Streatham St Leonard's in 2022 with very minor boundary adjustment.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Term!!Councillor!!Party\n|-\n| style=\"background-color: \"| || 1964–1968 || L.
