The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 23, 1998, and is a contributing property to the Warehouses in Omaha Multiple Property Submission.\nHistory\nBuilt in 1913, the building is eight stories, and is made of brick and hollow tile. It was designed in the Renaissance Revival style for the Beebe and Runyan Furniture Company. The Leo A. Daly Sr. architecture firm designed a $10 million conversion of the Beebe and Runyan Furniture Showroom and Warehouse into a condominium, which was completed by the Boca Development Company in 2007. The building includes thermal insulated windows, reclaimed maple wood floor, exposed beamed ceilings and brick walls, and energy efficiency heat pumps backed by electric furnaces, along with other environmental and energy-efficient features.\nSee also\n* Transportation in Omaha\n* History of Omaha\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.historicomaha.com/nrbeebe.jpg Modern photo]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130624072743/http://beebe.jmwebtest.com/about/ Beebe + Runyan Luxury Lofts] website"
