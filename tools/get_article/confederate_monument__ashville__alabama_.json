It was funded by the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and was dedicated April 23, 1923, on the grounds of the St. Clair County courthouse in Ashville, Alabama.\nThe monument includes a larger than life-sized marble statue of a CSA soldier placed on top of a 10-foot-tall stone base.  The soldier is standing at rest, holding a rifle, the stock of which is placed on the base by the soldier's foot.  The rifle has been replaced at least once. The inscription on the base reads in part, \"TO THE HONOR OF ST. CLAIR CO. CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS ERECTED BY THEIR DESCENDANTS, THROUGH ASHVILLE CHAPTER U.D.C. 1923\".\nA version of the CSA battle flag is carved on the front.\nReferences"
