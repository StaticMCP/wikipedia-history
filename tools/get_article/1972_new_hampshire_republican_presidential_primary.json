Incumbent President Richard Nixon faced his first major test in New Hampshire against two minor challengers: liberal anti-Vietnam war candidate Pete McCloskey of California and conservative John Ashbrook of Ohio, who opposed Nixon's détente policies towards China and the Soviet Union. Nixon won the Granite State in a landslide, resulting in the withdrawal of McCloskey from the primaries (he promised to do so if he failed to reach >20% of the vote) and a clear path for the incumbent president to receive the Republican nomination.\nResults\n}}\nReferences"
