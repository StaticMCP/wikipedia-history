The awards ceremony was held at Earls Court in London for the last time. The ceremony was broadcast live on ITV on Tuesday 16 February 2010. It was hosted by Peter Kay with Fearne Cotton doing the side of stage coverage. ITV2 broadcast an after show highlights programme immediately after the main broadcast. BBC Radio 1 had official radio coverage throughout the day in the run up to the evening's show, with Scott Mills and Greg James on the Red Carpet.\nThe ceremony was broadcast live, but with a short delay to enable any offensive language to be cut. This occurred several times during the course of the evening, most notably when Liam Gallagher collected the Best Album of 30 Years award and also during Lily Allen's acceptance speech for Best British Female.\nThe ITV show drew 5.8 million viewers between 8pm and 10pm, which was a 21.9% share of the evening, topping the 5.18 million (21.7%) drawn in for the 2009 ceremony, but still down on the 6.07 million (24.4%) of 2008. The ITV2 Brits Encore show at 10pm drew 776,000 viewers, a 3.8% share.\nPerformances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n!UK Singles Chart Reaction After Performance\n!UK Albums Chart Reaction\n|-\n|Lily Allen\n|\"The Fear\"\n| 89 (re-entry)\n|''It's Not Me, It's You – 19 (+9)\n|-\n|JLS\n|\"Beat Again\"\n| 73 (+18)\n|JLS – 17 (+6)\n|-\n|Kasabian\n|\"Fire\"\n| 42 (re-entry)\n|West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum – 20 (+43)Empire – 98 (re-entry)\n|-\n|Lady Gaga\n|\"Telephone\" \"Dance in the Dark\"\n|34 (+5)did not chart\n|The Fame – 2 (+3)\n|-\n|Florence + the MachineDizzee Rascal\n|\"You Got the Dirtee Love\"\n|2 (debut)\n|Lungs – 3 (+6)  Tongue n' Cheek – 33 (+40)\n|-\n|Jay-Z Alicia Keys\n|\"Empire State of Mind\"\n|16 (+9)\n|The Blueprint 3 – 10 (+12)\n|-\n|Cheryl Cole\n|\"Fight for This Love\"\n| 36 (+7)\n|3 Words – 32 (+6)\n|-\n|Robbie Williams\n|\"Bodies\" \"Let Me Entertain You\" \"Feel\" \"Supreme\" \"Millennium\" \"Come Undone\" \"Morning Sun\" \"You Know Me\" \"No Regrets\" \"Angels\" \"Everything Changes\" \"Rock DJ\" \"Rudebox\"\n|did not chart\n|Reality Killed the Video Star – 8 (+13)Greatest Hits – 38 (re-entry)\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"50%\" | British Album of the Year(presented by Tom Ford)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Producer of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Florence and the Machine – Lungs'\n**Dizzee Rascal – Tongue n' Cheek\n**Kasabian – West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum\n**Lily Allen – It's Not Me, It's You\n**Paolo Nutini – Sunny Side Up''\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Paul Epworth\n**Ethan Johns\n**Jim Abbiss\n**Steve Lillywhite\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Single of the Year(presented by Alan Carr)\n! width=\"50%\" | Critics' Choice Award(presented by Courtney Love)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*JLS – \"Beat Again\"\n**Alesha Dixon – \"Breathe Slow\"\n**Alexandra Burke (featuring Flo Rida) – \"Bad Boys\"\n**Cheryl Cole – \"Fight for This Love\"\n**Joe McElderry – \"The Climb\"\n**La Roux – \"In for the Kill\"\n**Lily Allen – \"The Fear\"\n**Pixie Lott – \"Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)\"\n**Taio Cruz – \"Break Your Heart\"\n**Tinchy Stryder (featuring N-Dubz) – \"Number 1\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Ellie Goulding\n**Marina and the Diamonds\n**Delphic\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Male Solo Artist(presented by Andy Serkis)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Female Solo Artist(presented by Shirley Bassey)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Dizzee Rascal\n**Calvin Harris\n**Mika\n**Paolo Nutini\n**Robbie Williams\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Lily Allen\n**Bat for Lashes\n**Florence and the Machine\n**Leona Lewis\n**Pixie Lott\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Group(presented by Idris Elba)\n! width=\"50%\" | British Breakthrough Act(presented by Geri Halliwell)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Kasabian\n**Doves\n**Friendly Fires\n**JLS\n**Muse\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*JLS\n**Florence and the Machine\n**Friendly Fires\n**La Roux\n**Pixie Lott\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Male Solo Artist(presented by Mel B)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Female Solo Artist(presented by Jonathan Ross)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Jay-Z\n**Bruce Springsteen\n**Eminem\n**Michael Bublé\n**Seasick Steve\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Lady Gaga\n**Ladyhawke\n**Norah Jones\n**Rihanna\n**Shakira\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | International Album(presented by Mika)\n! width=\"50%\" | International Breakthrough Act(presented by Cat Deeley)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Lady Gaga – The Fame'\n**Animal Collective – Merriweather Post Pavilion\n**The Black Eyed Peas – The E.N.D.\n**Empire of the Sun – Walking on a Dream\n**Jay-Z – The Blueprint 3\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Lady Gaga\n**Animal Collective\n**Daniel Merriweather\n**Empire of the Sun\n**Taylor Swift\n|-\n! width=\"50%\" | British Album of 30 Years(presented by Noddy Holder)\n! width=\"50%\" | Live Performance of 30 Years(presented by Samantha Fox)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Oasis – (What's the Story) Morning Glory?

After thanking all of his former bandmates (apart from brother Noel) and declaring his fans \"the best fans in the fucking world\", he gave his award to a lucky fan and hurled his microphone into the audience; a search for the microphone caused a 10‑minute delay. After walking off stage, host Peter Kay reacted to Liam's actions by saying \"what a knobhead\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/2010 Brit Awards 2010 at Brits.co.uk]"
