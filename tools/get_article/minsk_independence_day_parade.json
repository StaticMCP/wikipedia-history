This parade is held annually in Minsk on 3 July. It is held every year except years that celebrate Victory Day (9 May), during which Victory Day Parades are held.\nSummary\nThe celebrations begin as the parade commander (usually the Deputy Defense Minister) arrives to take command of the parade formations from a commander of the first company participating in the parade. At 10am, the President of Belarus arrives on Victors Avenue and gets on the central grandstand to await the start of the parade. The parade commander gives the order to begin the review of the Minsk Garrison by the Defence Minister of Belarus, the parade presenting arms at this juncture. The Deputy Defense Minister of Belarus then reports to the Defense Minister on the status of the parade. Following the report, to the tune of the  Central Band of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus playing inspection tunes, both the parade commander and the Defense Minister then review the parade mounted in their vehicles and the Minister, once the vehicles stop upon each company of troops assembled, then congratulates them on the holiday. After this, the defense minister's car heads to the central tribune to the tune of Motherland My Dear (Радзіма мая дарагая) so that the minister can report to the president on the readiness of the parade once his limousine stops in front of the presidential grandstand, following which he disembarks and arrives there, following which the parade is ordered at ease. The president then delivers an address to the nation and congratulates the citizens on the holiday. At the end of the speech, My, belorusy is played by the Central Band of the Armed Forces, with a 21-gun salute being fired in the background. The commander of the parade then gives the order for the Minsk Garrison to commence the parade while at the same time the linemen take their places to mark the distance of the troops marching past.\nThe order now concluded, the parade then marches off in quick time with the drummers of the Corps of Drums of the Minsk Suvorov Military School setting the pace. As the Corps' bandmaster orders the halt, the massed bands start playing a military march (usually Letter from the 45th by Igor Luchenko as the first song) as he salutes while the drummers swing on the eyes right position. The drummers are just the first of the large ground column of an estimated 2,900 service personnel that marches past the presidential grandstand. There are generally 10 officers and around 140 conscripts in each formation. At the end of the ground columns, the massed bands play Den Pobedy by David Tukhmanov before sounding off to The Sacred War as the mobile column passes through. The exhibition drill at the end of the parade, performed by the Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus has been held annually since 2002 and shows off the military drill of the armed forces. Following the drill routine, the massed bands sing ''Our Fatherland's Flag'' (Айчыны нашай сцяг) before marching off the avenue, officially closing the parade.\nAnnual and guest participants in the Parade\nMassed Bands\n* Massed Bands of the Minsk Garrison\n** Fanfare Trumpeter Team from the Minsk Suvorov Military School\n** Exemplary Military Band\n** Band of the Military Academy of Belarus\n** Band of the Guard of Honor\n** Exemplary Band of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\n** Minsk GUVD Brass Band\nGround Column\n* Corps of Drums of the Minsk Suvorov Military School\n* Cadets from specialized military high schools (25 from the MES, 30 from the MVD and 50 from the army)\n* Color guard carrying the Flag of Belarus, the Flag of the USSR, the Victory Banner, and the banners of the 1st Belarusian Front, the 2nd Belarusian Front, the 3rd Belarusian Front and the 1st Baltic Front.\n* Historical Troops\n** Cadets from the Military Academy dressed in Red Army uniforms\n** Descendants of Belarusian Partisan Formations\n* Faculties of the Military Academy of Belarus\n* Cadets of the Military Faculty of the Belarusian National Technical University\n* Belarusian Ground Forces\n** 120th Guards Mechanised Brigade\n** 11th Guards Berlin-Carpathian Mechanized Brigade\n* Belarusian Air Force Servicemen and Cadets\n* Battalion of Female Servicemen of the Armed Forces\n* State Border Committee Training Institute\n* Personnel of the Ministry of Internal Affairs\n** Combined Police and OMON Unit\n** Battalion of Female Policewomen of the Police (recruited from police agencies such as the Minsk City Police Department)\n** Cadets of the Internal Troops College of the Military Academy of Belarus\n** 3rd Separate Special-Purpose Brigade\n* University of Civil Protection of the Ministry of Emergency Situations\n* Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces\n* 38th Guards Air Assault Brigade\n* 103rd Guards Airborne Division\n* 5th Spetsnaz Brigade\nThe Honor Guard of the Armed Forces of Belarus also participates in the parade and the end as part of a finale, instead of the ground column.\nMobile column\nThe T-34 tank generally leads the procession of military vehicles and technologies.

Belarusian tractors performed a ballet after the official parade. Breaking with a 5-year precedent, the military did not invite paratroopers from the Russian 76th Guards Air Assault Division to participate in the parade. Although no official reason was given, many have speculated that the division's involvement in the 2014 Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the ongoing involvement in the War in Donbas may have been a factor.

The parade was led by Major General Andrey Zhuk.\nParticularities\n* In the 1990s, the parade was held and conducted in the Belarusian language and was transmitted by means of one state television channel. This changed in the 2000s when the language that was used was Russian, and therefore could be expanded to all major channels. At the same time, it was also expanded to Russian language channels in the European Union.\n* Since the beginning, the parade has been followed by a Soviet-era traditional march of gymnasts, sportsmen and dancers.\n* The president has traditionally wears the commander in chief's uniform during the parade.\n* Every five years, reenactors dressed in the uniforms of Soviet partisans take part in the historical part of the parade. Both the uniforms and the weapons are provided by the Belarusfilm studio. This was done at the 2014 and 2019 jubilee parade editions was done for the first time in 2020 for the Victory Day Parade.\nGallery\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Белоруссии при участии авиации ЗВО (3).jpg|Defence Minister Ravkov being received by Deputy Defence Minister Sergei Potapenko.\nFile:2014 Minsk Independence Day Parade2.jpg|Major General Mikhail Puzikov during the 2014 jubilee parade.\nFile:Парад в Беларуси 2019 01.jpg|Members of the Belarusian military leadership led by Alexander Lukashenko saluting during the 2019 parade.\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Белоруссии при участии авиации ЗВО (5).jpg|Drummers from the Minsk Suvorov Military School.\nFile:Парад в Беларуси 2019 04.jpg|A massed color guard.\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Белоруссии при участии авиации ЗВО (7).jpg|A Belarusian Air Force contingent.\nFile:Парад в Минске 2019 06.jpg|A color guard from the Border Guard Service Institute in the 2019 parade.\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Белоруссии при участии авиации ЗВО (12).jpg|A Belarusian infantry fighting vehicle.\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Беларуси при участии авиации ЗВО (16).jpg|An armoured commander leading the contingent in an UAZ-469.\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Беларуси при участии авиации ЗВО (14).jpg|A military drone being carried by an offroad vehicle from MZKT.\nFile:Парад по случаю Дня независимости Беларуси при участии авиации ЗВО (23).jpg|A flypast by the Air Force.\nFile:Парад в Минске 2019 10.jpg|An exhibition drill routine.\nSee also\n* Partisans Parade\n* List of Victory Day Parades in Minsk\n* Kyiv Independence Day Parade\n* Moscow Victory Day Parade\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://news.tut.by/amp/society/642611.html «Это же музыканты, им нужно больше свободы».
