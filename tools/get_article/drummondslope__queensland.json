In the , Drummondslope had a population of 43 people.\nOn 22 November 2019, the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Drummondslope was incorporated into Alpha.\nGeography\nThe Capricorn Highway and, to its immediate north, the Central Western railway form the northern boundary of the locality. The western boundary roughly follows the Great Dividing Range while the southern boundary follows the southern tip of the Drummond Range (and may be the origin of the locality's name).\nThe Tambo Road traverses the locality from north-east (Alpha) to south-west (Blackall/Windeyer).\nAlpha Creek starts in the south of the locality and flows north through the locality exiting to the north-east (Alpha). Being east of the Great Dividing Range, all watercourses in the area are part of the North East Coast drainage basin. Alpha Creek is a tributary of the Native Companion Creek, then Belyando River, Suttor River and the Burdekin River, which flows into the Coral Sea at Rita Island in the Shire of Burdekin.\nThe principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nIn 1910, the pastoral run Drummondslope was offered for a 20-year lease; the property was . Edmund Jowett secured the lease with a bid of  per square mile. Jowett operated many pastoral runs in Australia. In 1930, the property was sold to George Oliver Carter. He sold the property in 1935 to B. Hooke & Co. As at 2019, the Drummondslope pastoral run still exists () but is considerably smaller at .\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Drummondslope. The nearest primary school is in Alpha. The nearest secondary school is in Alpha but only offers secondary schooling to Year 10. The nearest secondary schools to Year 12 is in Barcaldine.
