Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza had taken Mazandaran and Jurjan whereas Ala al-Dawla Mirza had taken Mashad thereby surrounding Abdal-Latif Mirza at Nishapur. On April 20, 1447, Ala al-Dawla Mirza's army surprised and attacked the city of Nishapur. Abdal-Latif Mirza was defeated and imprisoned whereas, Gawhar Shad and the Tarkhans were freed. They then marched towards Sadabad, Nishapur where Ala al-Dawla Mirza met Gawhar Shad and together they marched with the army towards Herat. At Herat, Abdal-Latif Mirza was kept in the fort of Iktiyar-al-Din. The army of Khurasan now marched against Ulugh Beg towards Samarkand.\nAftermath\nBut when Ala al-Dawla Mirza reached Murghab he received news of the betrayal of his brother Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza who was marching forward to take Herat. At that moment arrived Ulugh Beg's envoy Sadr Nizam-al-Din Mirak Mahmud who conveyed to Ala al-Dawla Mirza a message of peace and a treaty was concluded whereby Chechektu valley (east of Murghab River) was the limit of Ala al-Dawla Mirza's territory and of the Murghab basin his North-western limit. Abdal-Latif Mirza was released as a part of the treaty and was now appointed governor of Balkh by his father. Ala al-Dawla Mirza then turned his attention towards his renegade brother Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza whom he managed to stave off by making another territorial treaty with him settling Quchan as the border between them.\nReferences"
