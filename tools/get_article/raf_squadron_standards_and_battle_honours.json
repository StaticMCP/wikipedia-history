Squadron standards are ceremonial flags that are granted to squadrons on meeting certain criteria. Battle honours are awarded to commemorate notable battles, actions, or engagements in which squadron personnel have taken part.\nSquadron standards\nHistory\nof the Royal Air Force]]\nThroughout British history, military leaders have employed ceremonial flags for the purposes of identified rally points for troops during battle, these flags being known as 'standards'. The positions of the standards on a battlefield would provide an indication of how the battle was progressing.\nThe history of squadron standards in the Royal Air Force can be traced back to the Second World War, when on the 25th anniversary of the RAF in 1943, King George VI declared his plan to grant standards to operational squadrons. For a standard to be awarded, the squadron had to qualify by either completing 25 years of service in the RAF; Royal Auxiliary Air Force; Royal Naval Air Service; or Royal Flying Corps; or be recognised by the monarch for outstanding merit during operations. The requirements for the awarding of a squadron standard were laid down in Air Ministry Order 866, 1943 and initially thirty squadrons automatically qualified for the awarding of a standard.\nThe first standards were awarded in the 1950s, with thirty squadrons qualifying for their length of service, whereas No. 617 Squadron was awarded in recognition of its role in Operation Chastise in May 1943, otherwise known as the 'Dambuster Raid'.\nDesign\nSquadron standards measure  x . They hand-made in light-blue silk, with blue and gold fringes and tassels. Around the border are embroidered roses, thistles, shamrocks and leeks, national emblems of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Initially the design did not include the leek for Wales; this was highlighted in Parliament by a Welsh MP and subsequent standards were amended to include the leek. The centre of the standard features embroidery of the squadron's approved heraldic badge and scrolls identifying battle honours which the squadron has been awarded. Originally only eight battle honours could be emblazoned which was later raised to ten. In the 1980s this was amended to fifteen, but the number shown must be limited to eight pre-Operation Corporate (Falklands Campaign) honours.\nStandards are typically mounted on an  flagstaff featuring a gold eagle with elevated wings.\nBattle honours\nThe practice of awarding battle honours was inherited by the RAF from its Army and Navy predecessors upon its creation in 1918.  Several squadrons therefore carry honours awarded when they were a part of the Royal Flying Corps or Royal Naval Air Service.  Battle honours are not awarded for every operation conducted by British forces and not every squadron taking part in an operation is entitled to emblazon the honour on their standard, only those involved in contact with the enemy.\nIn 1943, King George VI approved the award of a Standard to RAF squadrons who have 25 years of service in either the RAF, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, Royal Naval Air Service or Royal Flying Corps.  Standards can also be awarded to units which have \"earned the King's appreciation for outstanding operations\".\nBelow is a list of battle honours separated by major campaigns which may be claimed by RAF squadrons.\nFirst World War battle honours\n* Aegean\n* Amiens\n* Arabia\n* Arras, 1917\n* Cambrai, 1917\n* East Africa, 1916–18\n* Egypt, 1914–17\n* Helles\n* Hindenburg Line\n* Home Defence, 1916–1918\n* Home Waters 1914–1918\n* Independent Force & Germany\n* Isonzo\n* Italian Front & Adriatic, 1917–18\n* Loos\n* Lys\n* Marne (1918)\n* Megiddo 1918\n* Mesopotamia, 1915–1918\n* Messines, 1917\n* Mons\n* Neuve Chappelle\n* North West Frontier, 1916–1918\n* Palestine (Gaza)\n* Piave\n* Somme, 1916\n* Somme, 1918\n* South-West Africa\n* Suvia\n* Vittorio Veneto\n* Western Front, 1914–18\n* Western Front, 1916–17\n* Western Front, 1917–18\n* Ypres, 1917\nInter-War battle bonours\n*Aden 1928\n*Aden 1929\n*Aden 1934\n*Afghanistan 1919–1920\n*Burma 1930–1932\n*Iraq 1919–1920\n*Iraq 1923–1925\n*Iraq 1928–1929\n*Kurdistan 1919\n*Kurdistan 1922–1924\n*Kurdistan 1930–1931\n*Mahsud 1919–1920\n*Mohmand 1927\n*Mohmand 1933\n*Northern Kurdistan 1932\n*Northern Russia 1918–1919\n*North West Frontier 1930–1931\n*North West Frontier 1935–1939\n*North West Persia 1920\n*Palestine 1936–1939\n*Somaliland 1920\n*South Persia 1918–1919\n*South Russia 1919–1920\n*Sudan 1920\n*Transjordan 1924\n*Waziristan 1919–1925\nSecond World War battle honours\n*Anzio and Nettuno.\n:For operations in support of the Allied landings in Italy 9–16 September 1943.\n*Arakan 1942–1944.\n:For operations by fighter, bomber and transport squadrons in support of the First and Second Arakan Offensives, November 1942 to February 1943 and November 1943 to March 1944.\n*Arctic 1940–1945.\n:For operations over the Arctic by squadrons of Coastal Command based in Iceland, Russia and Shetland.\n*Arnhem 1944.\n:For squadrons participating in the operations of the Allied Airborne Army, 17–26 September 1944.\n*Atlantic 1939–1945.\n:For operations by aircraft of Coastal Command and others employed in the coastal role over the Atlantic Ocean from the outbreak of war to VE Day.\n*Baltic 1939–1945.
