It is joined by six minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Wakool River and re-entering the Murray at Wakool Junction, near Kyalite. The river descends  over its  course.\nKolety was gazetted as a dual official name for the river in 2006.\nSee also\n*Rivers of New South Wales\n*List of rivers of Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
