In response to these attacks, the Dutch launched several expeditions aimed at putting an end to the attacks on Dutch vessels and safeguarding their ships. Ultimately, these efforts proved successful as both nations recognized the significance of peace in maintaining a prosperous economy.\nBackground\nBarbary pirates were pirates who began their operations in the early 17th century in the Mediterranean Sea. Subsequently, they experienced substantial growth in their activities, leading to an increase in their popularity.\nDuring the early 17th century, the Dutch Republic embarked on an extensive territorial expansion, solidifying its dominant position as a major maritime power. Concurrently, it established a vast presence in international trade, making significant inroads in global commerce. The Dutch strategically established colonies and trading posts across various continents, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas, facilitating the flourishing exchange of valuable commodities, ranging from spices and textiles to precious metals. As a result of these endeavors, the Dutch Republic emerged as one of the foremost trading nations of that era, commanding a pervasive influence across the seas.\n, 1667. Most likely Dutch ship to be harassed by barbary pirates.]]\nThe Dutch Republic displayed robust activity in the Mediterranean Sea engaging in frequent trade within the region. They established significant trade ties with countries situated along the Mediterranean coast, forging commercial relationships that were characterized by regular exchanges of goods and commodities. The Dutch's active presence in the Mediterranean facilitated the flow of various valuable products, further contributing to their status as a major trading nation during this period. The Dutch, who were known for their economic prosperity and active engagement in trade, found itself as a target of Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean Sea. These pirates, seeking to plunder the wealth carried by Dutch ships, engaged in acts of harassment and attacks. Consequently, in 1618, the Dutch authorities responded by declaring war on both Tunisia and Algiers.\nWar\n]]\nImmediately, Mooy Lambert and Hillebrand Quast were designated for action. Quast, in particular, proved successful in capturing a considerable number of North African ships. However, during his return journey, he once again confronted North African ships, disposing of each pirate mercilessly by throwing them overboard, and calling it footwashing. Meanwhile, Mooy Lambert was tasked with patrolling the Mediterranean and combating Algerian pirates, a mission that proved highly effective. While sailing through the Strait of Gibraltar, Lambert encountered a formidable Algerian fleet of 20–30 ships. A fierce battle ensued for two days, with Lambert emerging victorious and capturing 12–20 of the enemy's vessels. The remaining ships fled and, just like Captain Quast, Lambert disposed of their crew members by throwing them overboard.\nContinuing their efforts against Algiers, the Algerians responded by imprisoning the Dutch ambassador, further escalating tensions. The Dutch, incensed by this action, intensified their war against Algiers and reinforced Lambert's fleet to secure the ambassador's release. The Algerians complied with the Dutch demands and freed the Ambassador. However, reluctant to engage in an all-out war with the Dutch Republic, Algiers proposed peace to the Dutch Republic in 1619. Despite the Prince of Orange's desire to continue the war and dismantle Algiers, the States General believed it wiser to pursue peace and accepted the truce. The truce was short-lived, as Algiers became the first to break it by attacking another ship, leading to further hostilities. Between 1619 and 1620, the Dutch captured two Algerian ships, while the Algerians captured a total of 82 Dutch vessels. Around 300 Dutch were enslaved in Algiers.\nIn response, the Dutch dispatched another fleet under Willem de Zoete, and advised all traders to sail under the protection of the Dutch Navy. A period of relative quiet followed, as both the Dutch and North Africans sought peace.\nPeace\nDespite the Prince of Orange's inclination to prolong the war, the States General of the Dutch Republic took a different approach, deeming it more prudent to seek peace with Algiers. The reason behind this decision stemmed from the upcoming expiration of the Twelve Years' Truce with Spain, which necessitated preserving every available ship for potential conflicts. Moreover, England had recently initiated an expedition against Algiers, prompting Algiers to seek reconciliation with the Dutch as well. In pursuit of peaceful resolution, the Dutch Republic dispatched a representative to negotiate with Algiers, leading to the successful conclusion of a treaty that favored the Dutch interests. In the same year they also did it with Tunis.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
