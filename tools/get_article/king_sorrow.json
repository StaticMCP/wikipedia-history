In their pre-release starred review, Kirkus found the novel \"At turns spooky and funny, with bits of inside baseball and a swimming pool's worth of blood.\" Booklist called it a \"remarkably well-paced, character-centered epic [that pits] the computer age against folktales\", while James Gardner of Library Journal said, \"Though nearly 900 pages, the book never feels long or overstuffed, since Hill deftly moves between characters' viewpoints while rendering them vividly.\" The staff of Publishers Weekly wrote, \"Pitch-perfect characterizations and doses of black humor....[reinforce] Hill's reputation as a titan of the [horror] genre.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* at HarperCollins"
