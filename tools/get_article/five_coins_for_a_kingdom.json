Five coins fall from sky, each imbued with the spirit of a power wizard beseeching the party to free them and save their world from destruction.  Using the magic coins, the party travels to the outer plane of Eloysia, explore what is left of the city of Solius and free the wizards.  Before saving Solius, the party must defeat an invasive army led by mad Durhan.  Finally, the party journeys into their own sun to save their city.\nTable of contents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
