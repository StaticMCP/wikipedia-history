The monument is in the obelisk style. It is situated adjacent to the B815 road; in a field on the border  with Bishopton.\nHistory\nThe monument was built to commemorate the bravery of Robert Walter Stuart, the 11th Lord Blantyre, who lived at nearby Erskine House (now Mar Hall). He was a Major-General in the British Army and served in the Napoleonic Wars with the Duke of Wellington.  He was killed accidentally by a stray bullet in a street fight in Brussels in 1830.
