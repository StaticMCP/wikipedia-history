It is awarded by the Berggruen Institute to \"thinkers whose ideas have helped us find direction, wisdom, and improved self-understanding in a world being rapidly transformed by profound social, technological, political, cultural, and economic change.\"\nThe Berggruen Prize was first awarded in 2016 with the overt purpose of becoming a \"Nobel prize for philosophy\". The first recipient of the Berggruen Prize was the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, whose work \"urges us to see humans as constituted not only by their biology or their personal intentions, but also by their existence within language and webs of meaningful relationships.\"\nThe prize is awarded annually in October, with a ceremony at the New York Public Library. In 2016, ceremony speakers included University of Pennsylvania president Amy Gutmann and journalist Fareed Zakaria. The ceremony honoring Japanese philosopher Kojin Karatani was held in Tokyo, Japan. In 2024, the ceremony was held in Washington, D.C., at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, with journalist Michel Martin serving as a speaker.\nBerggruen Prize Laureates\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! | Year\n! | Image\n! | Laureate\n! | Country\n! | Citation\n! | Fields\n|-\n| 2016\n|\n| Charles Taylor(born 1931)\n|\n| \"whose work urges us to see humans as constituted not only by their biology or their personal intentions but also by their existence within language and webs of meaningful relationships.\"\n| Political philosophy, cosmopolitanism, hermeneutics, philosophy of religion, philosophical anthropology\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n| Onora O'Neill(born 1941)\n|\n| for \"her works have elevated the quality of public life and improved the very vocabulary of public discourse.\"\n| Political philosophy, ethics\n|-\n| 2018\n|\n| style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"|Martha Nussbaum(born 1947)\n|\n| for \"her transformative work as an academic philosopher into public debates about key questions of national and global political significance, making her one of the world's leading public philosophers.\"\n| Liberal theory, political philosophy, feminism, ethics, social liberalism\n|-\n| 2019\n|\n| style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"|Ruth Bader Ginsburg(1933–2020)\n|\n| for being \"a lifelong trailblazer for human rights and gender equality and a constant voice for justice, equal and accessible to all.\"\n| Law, political science, feminism, liberalism, social justice\n|-\n| 2020\n|\n| Paul Farmer(1959–2022)\n|\n| \"leader in the development of public anthropology, as well as in improving health care for the world's poorest people.\"\n| Internal medicine, infectious disease, medical anthropology\n|-\n| 2021\n|\n| Peter Singer(born 1946)\n|\n| \"for promoting the idea of 'effective altruism,' which encourages people to have reason, rather than empathy, guide their philanthropy.\"\n| Applied ethics, bioethics, utilitarianism, environmental ethics, philosophy of life\n|-\n| 2022\n|\n| Kojin Karatani(born 1941)\n|\n| for his \"radically original contributions to modern philosophy, the history of philosophy, and political thinking—making Karatani’s work particularly valuable in the current era of troubled global capitalism, crisis in democratic states, and resurgent but seldom self-critical nationalism.\"\n| Political philosophy, history of philosophy, deconstruction, comparative literature, literary criticism\n|-\n|2023\n|\n| Patricia Hill Collins(born 1948)\n|\n| for how her work “provides a powerful analytical lens through which we can envision the different and intersecting ways in which our material, social, and cultural worlds produce injustice,” and has given us “original vocabulary with which to think about social power and contestation.”\n| Social theory, Sociology of knowledge, Feminism, Feminist sociology, Gender studies, Black feminism\n|-\n|2025\n|\n| Michael Sandel(born 1953)\n|\n| for his \"use philosophy as an invitation to a more robust citizenship than we've become accustomed to, to prompt public deliberation about big questions that matter, such as what makes for a just society and how can we seek the common good. ”\n| Contemporary philosophy, Ethics, Jurisprudence, Political philosophy, Communitarianism\n|}\nBerggruen Prize Jury\nCurrent Prize Jury Members\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Image\n!Jury\n!Country\n!Details\n!Entered\n!Other Groups\n|-\n|\n|David Chalmers (b. 1966)\n|\n|Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science, New York University\n|2018\n|\n|-\n|\n|Antonio Damasio (b. 1944)\n|\n|Professor of Neuroscience, Psychology and Philosophy, University of Southern California\n|2016\n|Bio/Tech FuturesThe Berggruen NetworkTransformations of the Human Advisory Board\n|-\n|\n|Yuk Hui\n|\n|Professor of Philosophy, Erasmus University Rotterdam\n|2020\n|TofTH Senior Fellows\n|-\n|\n|Siri Hustvedt (b. 1955)\n|\n|Novelist, Poet, and Essayist; Recipient, 2019 Princess of Asturias Awards for Literature\n|2021\n|The Berggruen Network\n|-\n|\n|Pratap Bhanu Mehta (b. 1967)\n|\n|Laurance S.
