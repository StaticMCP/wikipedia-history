Sikandar Shah Suri was occupied with his struggle against Ibrahim Shah Suri when Humayun mobilized an army from Kabul.  He captured Rohtas Fort and Lahore in February 1555. Another detachment of his forces captured Dipalpur and Jalandhar.  Their advance division proceeded towards Sirhind.\nBattle\nSikandar sent a force of 30,000 under Naseeb Khan and Tartar Khan to intercept them but they were defeated by the Mughal Army at Machhiwara opening the way to Sirhind which was occupied by the Mughals.\nAftermath\nHumayun continued his campaign into Sur lands, and the subsequent victory at the  Battle of Sirhind allowed Humayun to reestablish the Mughal Empire.\nReferences"
