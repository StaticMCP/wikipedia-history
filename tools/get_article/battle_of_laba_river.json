Starting in August, Zass launched a series of expeditions against Circassians in an effort to push the Circassians as far as possible from the Kuban line. Zass systematically destroyed Circassian villages near the Kuban and Laba and cut clearings along the banks of the Laba and Khodz. Aytech Qanoqo, who had for a while fought on the side of the Russians, recently switched sides and joined the Circassians following a series of military setbacks by Russian forces in the late 1820s.\nBattle\nZass assembled a force of 800 infantry and 400 Cossacks with 6 light guns, and launched an attack on the Besleneys across the Laba river. He unexpectedly attacked the aul of Aytech Qanoqo and ravaged it. On the way back to the crossing over the Laba, the force was attacked by a detachment of 2,000 Besleney, Abzakhs and Kabardians led by Qanoqo. Qanoqo's forces set fire to dry grass and reeds along the path of the retreating Russians.  Zass ordered a site to be burned for his force and protected himself from fire. When the Circassians approached closer, they were met with grapeshot. The Circassians fled shortly after, Zass quickly reached the Laba and, without stopping for the night, began the crossing by the light of fires. In this campaign, Zass lost 1 soldier and 14 were wounded.\nAftermath\nAfter failing to defeat Zass's forces, Aytech Qanoqo lost hope in the Circassian cause, and switched back to the Russian side. Grigory Zass destroyed 2 more Circassian auls in December.\nReferences"
