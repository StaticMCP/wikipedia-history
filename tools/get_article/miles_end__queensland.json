Miles End is a \"mineside\" suburb.\nThe suburb is bounded to the east in parts by the Leichhardt River, to the south by Isa Street and Station Street, to the west by Hooper Road (and the mine itself), and to the north by Carbonate Street and  Alma Street. Despite the townside/mineside division of the suburbs, there is one exception. A small area along the riverside of West Street that contains the Mount Isa City Council's Civic Centre is not part of the townside suburb of Mount Isa City but part of the mineside suburb of Miles End that extends across the river.\nHistory\nMiles End was named on 1 September 1973 by the Queensland Place Names Board. 16 March 2001 its status was changed from a locality to a suburb.\nDemographics\nIn the , Miles End had a population of 265 people.\nIn the , Miles End had a population of 280 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Miles End.
