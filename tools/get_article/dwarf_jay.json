It is native to the sierra Madre de Oaxaca (Mexico). Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, specifically comprising an oak-pine mix. As its name would imply, this is the smallest member of the family Corvidae at 20–23&nbsp;cm long and weighing 41&nbsp;g. It is threatened by habitat loss.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Dwarf Jay\n\n#REDIRECT Dwarf jay\n}}"
