If the band continue to smartly and steadily branch out like they do on Orphan, they could soon be taking to the bigger stages and venues that the record’s songs so eagerly court.\"\nStereogum: \"Empires make timeless music – upbeat yet melancholy, pleasant but not saccharine, lyrics tangled up in the messy business of romance...These guys have their own thing going, and that thing is highly appropriate for the summer that is about to unfold before us.\"\nThe Huffington Post:  \"Empires have such a distinct sound I don't know whether to tell you they sound like The National meets [insert alt rock band here] or simply just say it's quality alt/indie-rock blended with subtle 1980s tones. Let's go with the latter.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nProduced & Mixed by: John Congleton\nRecorded at Elmwood Funeral Home, Dallas, TX\n\"How Good Does It Feel\" and \"Orphan\" mixed by Mark Needham\nMastered by Stephen Marcussen at Marcussen Mastering\nArtwork by Tom Conrad\nKeyboards, Mellotron, Moog Synthesizer by Bobby Sparks\nBass by Julio Tavarez\nReferences"
