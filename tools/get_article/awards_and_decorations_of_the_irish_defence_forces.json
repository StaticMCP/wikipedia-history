Among those systems is the system of awards and medals awarded to members of the Defence Forces.\nIn addition to the medals issued by the Irish government, members of the Defence Forces are also allowed to wear medals denoting overseas service.  These medals are issued by International organisations like the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union as well as medals from other countries for United Nations Mandated peacekeeping missions.\nDefence Forces medals\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width= \"60\"| Emblem\n! width= \"335\"| Description\n! width= \"75\"| Established\n! width= \"150\"| Eligibility Period\n!
