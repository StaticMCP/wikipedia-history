      "text": "# Michael Radcliffe Ward\n\nMichael Radcliffe Ward (c. 1859, Alderley - ) was an English electrical engineer and automotive pioneer. After making engineering innovation in electric lighting, he went on to develop electric buses.\nBy 1879, Radcliffe Ward was working for the British Electric Light Company. In 1881, he designed a Gramme machine which could power 4 to 6 arc lights of 4000 nominal candle power per light. In February of that year, he ran some experiments at George's Pier Head, Liverpool along with Alderman Joseph Hubback, chairman of the light company. They used one of the Gramme machines along with a multi-tubular boiler and vertical engine supplied by Cochrane and Co. The light produced was more effective in penetrating the fog than the pre-existing gas lights.\nIn 1882, Radcliffe Ward was named as the electrical engineer working for the Faure Electric Accumulator Company, working with consultants William Edward Ayrton and Camille Alphonse Faure.\nReferences"
