As a result, effective bankruptcy legislation was enacted and privately owned; well-managed banks emerged as market leaders. Today, near-ideal conditions for the banking sector exist. Foreigners are not restricted from buying bank shares or acquiring majority holdings.\nOn 20–22 June, the monetary reform of Estonia took place. During the reform, Soviet roubles were exchanged to Estonian krones.\nOn 23 June 1992, Estonia became a member of World Bank.\nIn 1992, 21 commercial banks established Estonian Banking Association ().\nIn 2004, Estonia became a member of European Union.
