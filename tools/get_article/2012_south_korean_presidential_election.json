They were the sixth presidential elections since democratization and the establishment of the Sixth Republic, and were held under a first-past-the-post system, in which there was a single round of voting and the candidate receiving the highest number of votes was elected.\nUnder the South Korean constitution, a president is restricted to a single five-year term in office. The term of the then incumbent president Lee Myung-bak ended on 24 February 2013. According to The Korea Times, 30.7 million people voted with turnout at 75.8%.\nPark Geun-hye of the Saenuri party was elected the first female South Korean president with 51.6% of the vote opposed to 48.0% for her opponent Moon Jae-in. Park's share of the vote was the highest won by any candidate since the beginning of free and fair direct elections in 1987 and the first such election in which any candidate won a majority. Moreover, as of the 2025 election, this is the latest South Korean presidential election in which the winning candidate won an absolute majority of the vote.\nIn 2017, following Park's impeachment and removal from office, Moon would go on to succeed her as president following a successful bid for the presidency in the 2017 presidential election.\nBackground\nin 2012, Lee Myung-bak. His term expired on 25 February 2013.]]\nLee Myung-bak was elected President of South Korea in 2007 as the nominee of the conservative Grand National Party after a closely contested primary in which he narrowly defeated Park Geun-hye, and assumed office in February 2008. His victory brought to a close ten years of liberal administration under Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun. The Lee Myung-bak government pursued the reduction of government bureaucracy and a laissez-faire economic policy, and came under criticism from the left for political scandals and controversial policies such as the Jeju-do Naval Base and its support of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement, although both were initiated under the previous administration. Despite the fact that he was elected in a landslide victory and received initial approval ratings of 70%, Lee's ratings had declined to below 30% by 2012.\nAt the end of 2011, Park Geun-hye assumed control of the Grand National Party, which was subsequently renamed the Saenuri or New Frontier Party in February 2012. She distanced herself from Lee and led the party towards the center. In legislative elections in April 2012, Park guided the party to an upset victory, returning its majority in the National Assembly. This contributed to an increase in her poll ratings and consolidated her position as frontrunner for the Saenuri nomination.\nOpposition to Saenuri was divided primarily between the Democratic United Party and independent supporters of Ahn Cheol-soo, who emerged as a leading potential candidate despite his ostensible silence on the race. In the DUP, focus initially lay on Sohn Hak-kyu as a potential nominee, but by late 2011 Moon Jae-in, a confidant of former president Roh, had overtaken Sohn in polls. Although the DUP invited Ahn to join the party, only 2.3% of respondents to a poll on 21 April thought that Ahn was best suited to be DUP nominee. The DUP itself has been troubled by the split between pro-Roh members such as Moon Jae-in and the \"Honam wing\" of former president Kim Dae-jung, represented by Chung Dong-young.\nRegistered candidates\nBallot numbers for party candidates were given according to the candidate's party seat distribution in the National Assembly. Ballot numbers for independent candidates were determined through a random lottery by the National Election Commission.\n{| class=wikitable  style=text-align:center\n|-  style=\"background:#eee; text-align:center;\"\n|width:125px|1\n|width:125px|2\n|width:125px|3 (Resigned)\n|width:125px|4\n|width:125px|5\n|width:125px|6\n|width:125px|7\n|-\n|Park Geun-hye\n|Moon Jae-in\n|Lee Jung-hee\n|Park Jong-sun\n|Kim So-yeon\n|Kang Ji-won\n|Kim Soon-ja\n|-\n||border=darkgray}} Saenuri\n||border=darkgray}} Democratic United\n||border=darkgray}} Unified Progressive\n| Independent\n| Independent\n| Independent\n| Independent\n|}\nNominations\nDemocratic United Party\nNominee\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"| Democratic Party candidate\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:; width:200px;\"|\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Member of the National Assembly\n|}\nCampaign\nThe 2012 Democratic United Party presidential primary saw an open primary system implemented for the first time. This new open primary introduced \"mobile voting\"; it was hailed as a \"revolution in voting\" because people could participate in voting more conveniently. However, controversies persisted during the primary elections, as questions of the legitimacy and trustworthiness of the voting results were raised.\nThe official result was announced on 16 September 2012, at 15:32 KST, naming Moon Jae-in the presidential candidate from the Democratic United Party. After winning the nomination, Moon stated that he would like to join forces with Ahn Cheol-soo.\nCandidates\n* Moon Jae-in, Member of National Assembly\n* Sohn Hak-kyu, former governor of Gyeonggi\n* Kim Doo-kwan, former governor of South Gyeongsang\n* Chung Sye-kyun, Member of National Assembly from Seoul\n* Park Joon-young, Governor of South Jeolla\n* Jo Gyeong-tae, Member of National Assembly from Busan\n* Kim Jung-kil, former Minister of the Interior\n* Kim Yong-hwan, former Member of National Assembly from Gyeonggi\nJo, Kim J and Kim Y were disqualified by the party through a cutoff poll, where only top five candidates were allowed to pass to primaries.

Kim, a former labor activist, stated in his announcement that he would focus on combating regional and socioeconomic divides, emphasized his commitment to a policy of multiculturalism, and argued for a revision in Saenuri's primary system. He stated further that Park Geun-hye's leadership of the party represented only an \"ambiguously prevailing trend\", and could not be relied upon to reach victory in the elections. Although Kim said that he was \"convinced\" he could \"attract more support than [Park]\", he was not widely expected to garner a high level of support. His early announcement was regarded as an attempt to preemptively form an anti-Park faction in the party.\nChung Mong-joon, a billionaire and longstanding member of the National Assembly, followed on 29 April. In his announcement, Chung emphasized the need to confront regionalism and factional politics, and stated that he would \"write a new history of the Republic of Korea by facilitating [his] experience of managing a business, engaging in diplomacy and creating unity in the nation\". He stressed that his task was to \"bring together the divided hearts of the people\" and that he was concerned that the \"country could collapse in its current situation\". Like Kim Moon-soo, Chung is expected to be at a disadvantage to Park. Chung previously declared his candidacy in the 2002 presidential elections but later dropped out to endorse Roh Moo-hyun.\nThe former mayor of Incheon, Ahn Sang-soo, declared his candidacy on 6 May, emphasizing his economic credentials and stating that he would relieve the burden of debt. Former presidential Chief of Staff Yim Tae-hee followed on 8 May, issuing a call for Park Geun-hye to act as a \"kingmaker\" that was interpreted as a request for her to step aside. Yim, a moderate, proposed to join hands with independent Ahn Cheol-soo and DUP frontrunner Moon Jae-in in a bid to \"demolish outdated politics\". On 10 May, five-term lawmaker and former Minister for Government Legislation and Special Affairs Lee Jae-oh announced his bid, promising to reform the constitution and cut his term as president to three years.\nThe campaign for the Saenuri primaries has been characterized by a dispute between Park Geun-hye, as frontrunner and party leader, and her opponents in the party. She was cited in 2009 as the most influential politician in South Korea, and has outranked other candidates in many polls throughout 2012, though as of early May 2012 she is yet to officially declare her candidacy. Park's opponents have called for Saenuri to adopt an open primary system rather than the present system based on an electoral college and opinion poll results. At the end of April the Democratic United Party suggested a joint discussion on the issue of fully open primaries. Park has been criticized for her taciturn and authoritarian style in leading the party, and Kim Moon-soo described her as overly \"secretive\". Chung Mong-joon stated that under Park's leadership, \"democracy in the party [had] gone missing\". Park strengthened her position when her ally Lee Hahn-koo was elected Saenuri's floor leader on 9 May.\nDuring a primary debate on 7 August 2012, primary candidate Kim Tae-ho asked if Park Geun-hye would agree that the May 16 coup by her father (Park Chung Hee) was both a coup and a \"necessary decision\", regarding Park's previous stance that the overthrow was a \"revolution to save the country\". Park confirmed her stance by answering, \"I don't think it's the place of politicians to be fighting over whether [the 16 May incident] were a 'coup d'etat' or a 'revolution'\". She furthermore commented that \"no one can refute that the events themselves did happen, whether you call them a 'coup' or a 'revolution.'\" and that \"we need to leave that issue\" for history to decide. In addition, during another debate on 8 August 2012, the moderator asked Park the minimum hourly rate for a part-time worker as of 2012. Park replied \"I think it's over 5,000 won, isn't it?,\" when the legal minimum wage was 4,580 won.

They followed these claims by identifying one such agent. In a police raid, that agent did not emerge from the rented office and claimed that she was not involved in such actions. Right after the last TV debate between candidates Park Geun-Hye and Moon Jae-in, police announced that no evidence was found. After Park Geun-Hye was sworn into office, evidence emerged that the agent in question and many others were involved in activities manipulating public opinion in the presidential election. On 27 May 2013 the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and Seoul Suseo Police Station was found to have delayed delivering evidence, and turned in fabricated laptop hard drive analysis reports. The police already had evidence that the agent in question posted political comments, the analysis report was not submitted to the Suseo Police Station and was destroyed.\nIn 2013, prosecutor Yoon Seok-youl led a special investigation team that looked into the National Intelligence Service (NIS)'s involvement in the scandal. Yoon sought the prosecution of the former head of the NIS, Won Sei-hoon for violating the Public Official Election Act for his role in the case. Yoon accused Park Geun-hye's Justice Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn of influencing his investigation. In February 2015, Won was convicted on charges of instructing NIS officials to manipulate internet comments and sentenced to three years in prison. However the conviction was overturned on appeal, leading to a retrial. In a second trial, Won was sentenced to four years in prison in 2017. The Supreme Court upheld the sentence in April 2018. When Moon Jae-in won the 2017 election, his administration pursued nine additional charges of political interference against Won, resulting in a subsequent 7 year jail sentence in 2020.\nIn August 2017, the NIS formally acknowledged that it was involved in the election manipulation after an internal inquiry. In December 2020, the National Assembly passed reforms curbing powers of the NIS, explicitly banning the agency and its employees from interfering in domestic politics.\nInterference with overseas voters\nIn June 2021, according to a MBC News report, Won Sei-hoon pushed South Korean embassies abroad to delay issuing new passports to Korean nationals, who tend to lean liberal in order to limit their ability to vote for Moon Jae-in. A NIS whistleblower also claimed that he was tortured after objecting to the operation by being placed for several days in a small white room intended to cause sensory disorientation.\nReferences"
