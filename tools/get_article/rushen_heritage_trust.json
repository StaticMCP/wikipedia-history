Following a public consultation, an initial public meeting about the potential formation of the Trust was held in Port St Mary Town Hall on 3 April 2014, where 120 attended and 60 people volunteered to be a part of the Trust. The Trust then appointed Graham Hall as its first Heritage Manager in June 2014, and then officially launched on 25 July 2014, the day it was incorporated and registered as a Charity (939).\nOrganisation\nThe Trust is led by volunteers organised into Heritage Actions Teams (HATs) focussing on five key areas of Rushen heritage:\n* Tourism\n* WWII Internment\n* Manx Language, Culture & Art\n* Story of the Sea\n* Story of the Land\nThe seven board members of the Trust consist of: Juan Watterson (Chairman), Sandra Davidson (Secretary), Ali Graham (Treasurer), Staffan Overgaard, Kathy Potter, Robert Graham, Connie Herdman.\nWork\nThe stated purpose of the Trust is \"To preserve, enhance, and celebrate the rich heritage of Rushen; and thereby to build wide community involvement.\"\nSince 2021, Rushen Heritage has had its own Heritage Centre, the former bus shelter in Bridson Street, Port Erin.
