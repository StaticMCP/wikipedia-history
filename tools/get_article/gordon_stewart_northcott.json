He was executed on October 2, 1930.\nBiography\nGordon Stewart Northcott was born in Bladworth, Saskatchewan and raised in British Columbia. He had an early fondness for animals, particularly ducks and rabbits. His father later described Northcott as \"an abnormal boy, both physically and mentally\". Northcott's mother insisted that her son wear dresses and play with dolls until his mid-teens. He moved to Los Angeles with his parents in 1924.\nNorthcott asked his father to purchase a plot of land in Wineville, California. On this land, he built a chicken ranch and a house with the help of his father—who was in the construction business—and his nephew, Sanford Clark. It was under this pretext that Northcott brought Sanford from Canada to the United States.\nWineville Chicken Coop murders\nWhile residing at his chicken ranch, Northcott abducted an undetermined number of boys and sexually abused them. Typically, after abusing a victim, he would drive the boy home and let him go. However, he murdered some of them at the ranch.\nThe police in Canada arrested Northcott and his mother on September&nbsp;19, 1928. Due to errors in the extradition paperwork, they were not returned to Los Angeles until November&nbsp;30. Northcott was implicated in the murder of Walter Collins, but because Northcott's mother had confessed to murdering Collins and had been sentenced for it, the state chose not to prosecute Northcott in that murder.\nPolice and press commonly referred to Northcott as \"Ape Man\" in reports, due to both his father and nephew taking note of his excessive body hair.\nIt was speculated that Northcott may have killed as many as 20 boys, but the state of California could not produce evidence to support that allegation. Ultimately, the state only brought an indictment against Northcott for the murders of an unidentified underage Mexican national, later to be identified as Alvin Gothea—known as the \"Headless Mexican\"—and the brothers Lewis and Nelson Winslow (aged 12 and 10, respectively). The brothers had been reported missing from Pomona on May&nbsp;16, 1928.\nIn early 1929, Northcott's trial was held before Judge George R. Freeman in Riverside County, California. The jury heard that he kidnapped, molested, tortured, and murdered the Winslow brothers and the \"Headless Mexican\" in 1928. On February 8, Northcott was convicted of those murders. On February 13, Freeman sentenced him to death. He was hanged on October&nbsp;2, 1930, at San Quentin State Prison. The rope failed to break Northcott's neck, resulting in it taking 13 minutes for him to die from strangulation.\nPopular culture\nIn 2008, Clint Eastwood directed Changeling, in which Northcott was portrayed by Jason Butler Harner.\nSee also\n* List of serial killers in the United States\n* List of botched executions\nReferences"
