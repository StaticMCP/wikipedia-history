      "text": "# Johnny Warren Medal\n\nThe Johnny Warren Medal is awarded to the best player of the Australian national soccer club competition. It was first awarded in the National Soccer League in 1990, and upon the NSL's demise in November 2004, was carried forward into the new national club competition, the A-League. It is named after former Australia national soccer team captain and tireless promoter of soccer in Australia, Johnny Warren.\nThe medal was previously determined by the votes of current players after rounds 9, 18 and 27. The format was changed for the 2015-16 A-League season following consultation with all A-League clubs, the PFA and the Warren family.\nFor the 2015–16 A-League season to determine the medal a new four body panel was introduced that independently vote on a 3–2–1 basis after each regular season match, which is consolidated into a single 3–2–1 vote. The four body panel consists of:\n# A technical football expert;\n# A football media representative;\n# A former professional player representative; and\n# A combined vote from the match officials.\nThe eligible player(s) who receive the most votes for the regular season will determine the winner of the medal.\nSince 2016 the award has been presented jointly with the Julie Dolan Medal at an event known as the Warren – Dolan Awards, where both A-League and W-League awards are presented.\nEligibility\nA player is ineligible to win the medal if they are:\n* suspended as a result of receiving a direct red card in a match;\n* suspended as a result of a determination of a body under the Hyundai A-League Disciplinary Regulations;\n* convicted of an anti-doping offence;\n* found guilty of serious misconduct;\n* a Guest Player; and/or\n* found guilty of breaching an FFA Statute.\nList of winners\nNSL\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!Year\n!Player\n!Club\n!Ref.\n|-\n| 1989–90\n|  Željko Adžić\n| Melbourne Croatia\n|\n|-\n| 1990–91\n|  Milan Ivanovic\n| Adelaide City\n|\n|-\n| 1991–92\n|  Josip Biskic\n| Melbourne CSC\n|\n|-\n| 1992–93\n|  Paul Trimboli\n| South Melbourne\n|\n|-\n| 1993–94\n|  Mark Viduka\n| Melbourne Knights\n|\n|-\n| 1994–95\n|  Mark Viduka\n| Melbourne Knights\n|\n|-\n| 1995–96\n|  Damian Mori\n| Adelaide City\n|\n|-\n| 1996–97\n|  Kresimir Marusic\n| Sydney United\n|\n|-\n| 1997–98\n|  Paul Trimboli\n| South Melbourne\n|\n|-\n| 1998–99\n|  Brad Maloney\n| Marconi-Fairfield\n|\n|-\n| 1999–2000\n|  Scott Chipperfield\n| Wollongong Wolves\n|\n|-\n| 2000–01\n|  Scott Chipperfield\n| Wollongong Wolves\n|\n|-\n| 2001–02\n|  Fernando Rech\n| Brisbane Strikers\n|\n|-\n| 2002–03\n|  Damian Mori\n| Perth Glory\n|\n|-\n| 2003–04\n|  Ante Milicic\n| Parramatta Power\n|\n|}\nA-League\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!Year\n!Player\n!Club\n!Ref.\n|-\n| 2005–06\n|  Bobby Despotovski\n| Perth Glory\n|\n|-\n| 2006–07\n|  Nick Carle\n| Newcastle Jets\n|\n|-\n| 2007–08\n|  Joel Griffiths\n| Newcastle Jets\n|\n|-\n| 2008–09\n|  Shane Smeltz\n| Wellington Phoenix\n|\n|-\n| 2009–10\n|  Carlos Hernández\n| Melbourne Victory\n|\n|-\n| 2010–11\n|  Marcos Flores\n| Adelaide United\n|\n|-\n| 2011–12\n|  Thomas Broich\n| Brisbane Roar\n|\n|-\n| 2012–13\n|  Marco Rojas\n| Melbourne Victory\n|\n|-\n| 2013–14\n|  Thomas Broich\n| Brisbane Roar\n|\n|-\n| 2014–15\n|  Nathan Burns\n| Wellington Phoenix\n|\n|-\n| 2015–16\n|  Diego Castro\n| Perth Glory\n|\n|-\n| 2016–17\n|  Miloš Ninković\n| Sydney FC\n|\n|-\n| 2017–18\n|  Adrian Mierzejewski\n| Sydney FC\n|\n|-\n| 2018–19\n|  Roy Krishna\n| Wellington Phoenix\n|\n|-\n|2019–20\n| Alessandro Diamanti\n|Western United\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2020–21\n| Ulises Dávila\n|Wellington Phoenix\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| Miloš Ninković\n|Sydney FC\n|-\n|2021–22\n| Jake Brimmer\n|Melbourne Victory\n|\n|-\n|2022–23\n| Craig Goodwin\n|Adelaide United\n|\n|-\n|2023–24\n| Josh Nisbet\n|Central Coast Mariners\n|\n|-\n|2024–25\n| Nicolas Milanovic\n|Western Sydney Wanderers\n|\n|}\nMultiple winners\nThe following players have won the Johnny Warren Medal multiple times.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
