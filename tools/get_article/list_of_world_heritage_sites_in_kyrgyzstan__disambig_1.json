Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Kyrgyzstan ratified the convention on 3 July 1995.\nKyrgyzstan has three sites on the list. The first site, the Sulayman Mountain, was listed in 2009. The Silk Road corridors were listed in 2014 and the most recent site, the Western Tien-Shan, was listed in 2016. The Sulayman Mountain and the Silk Roads are cultural sites, while the Western Tien-Shan is a natural site. The Silk Roads site is shared with China and Kazakhstan while the Western Tien-Shan is shared with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In addition, Kyrgyzstan has three sites on the tentative list.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
