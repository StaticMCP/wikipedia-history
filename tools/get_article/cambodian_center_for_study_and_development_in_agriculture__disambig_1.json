Initial support came from the French non-governmental organization (NGO), GRET (Groupe de Recherches et d'Echanges Technologiques).\nThe Cambodian Centre for study and development Agriculture also known as the CEDAC has a really big role when it comes to strengthening the agricultural sector. It does this by allowing smaller farmers to improve their economic knowledge. Farmers Help Group is one of the other organizations that help farmers advocate for their farmers rights, making sure their voices are heard in policy discussions. As of this it helps farmers have a sense of unity that reduces exploitation by unnecessary people and it creates a more equal opportunity. Additionally, they also  provide extensive training on how to have more sustainable farming techniques, for farmers to increase their knowledge by also keeping their natural way of doing it. This collective approach not only boosts incomes in the long run but also encourages long-term agricultural sustainability.\nOne important benefit of the cooperatives is their ability to improve profits through the shared resources and bulk marketing. In Cambodia, there is a cooperative organization that, as reported by Open Health News, helps farmers increase their earnings by reducing production costs and improving market linkages. By merging resources such as, smallholder farmers access better seeds, fertilizers, and equipment at lower prices. These cooperatives also negotiate directly with specific buyers, ensuring that the farmer receives fair prices for produce Open Health News. This model is particularly effective in rural areas, where individual farmers often lack bargaining power, thereby contributing to poverty reduction and rural economic growth.\nResearch from the Cambodia Development Resource Institute CDRI emphasizes cooperatives' role in promoting climate-resilient agriculture. In Cambodia climate change has caused several problems/ challenges in regarding unpredictable rainfall and soil degradation. Many Cooperatives have been providing training on climate-smart practices, such as crop diversification and water-efficient irrigation. Initiatives like those are documented by Cambodia's National Council for Sustainable Development also known as the NCSD. They further show how cooperatives facilitate the access to the government and NGO support for sustainable farming projects NCSD 2. This is resulting in farmers gaining more knowledge and resources about  cooperatives helping them build resilience against environmental shocks, ensuring food security.\nFarmer cooperatives are being made essential to advance Cambodia’s agricultural sector by improving quality of life, increasing farmers market access, and promoting sustainability. These cooperatives have the power of enabling small-scale farmers to overcome economic and environmental challenges. Even Though, greater investment and policy support are crucial to be able to expand all of these initiatives. Strengthening all these cooperatives will benefit farmers and support Cambodia’s broader economic development, making agriculture more viable and sustainable.\nSee also\n* Agriculture in Cambodia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cedac.org.kh Official website of CEDAC]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726181717/http://www.interdev-net.org/uk/reseau/result_paysdetail.asp?ID=Cedac CEDAC]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081007184829/http://www.globalinstitutefortomorrow.org/files/file/YLP_Cambodia_CEDAC_Prospectus_29Nov07.pdf  Global Institute for Tomorrow]"
