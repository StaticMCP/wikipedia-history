      "text": "# Ubaldo Fillol Award\n\nThe Ubaldo Fillol Award (from the Spanish: Premio Ubaldo Fillol), was a football award that went to the goalkeeper with the lowest goals-to-games ratio of each tournament of the Argentine Primera División. The award was created by Argentine World Cup winning goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol (considered by some journalists as the best Argentine goalkeeper ever) in 2008, and was named after him. Since the 2009 Clausura tournament, the Argentine Football Association recognized the award as official.\nRules\nTo win the award, a goalkeeper had to play at least 14 games in the tournament (over the 19 possible). Only matches in which the goalkeeper played at least 60 minutes were accounted. The result obtained from dividing the total goals conceded by the total games played by the keeper determined the standings, with the lowest average winning the award. In case more than one goalkeeper shared the lowest average, the winner was the one who had played more games. If that did not break the tie, it would be defined via an online opinion poll in Ubaldo Fillol's official website.\nWinners\n;Keys:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width= px\n|-\n!width= px|\n!width= px|Tournament\n!width= px|Player\n!width= px|Nation.\n!width= px|Club\n!width= px|\n!width= px|\n!width= px|\n!width= px|\n|-\n|  || 2008 Apertura || Gastón Sessa ||  || Gimnasia y Esgrima LP || 17 || 14 || 0.82 ||\n|-\n|  || 2009 Clausura || Germán Montoya ||  || Vélez Sársfield  || 19 || 13 || 0.68 ||\n|-\n|  || 2009 Apertura || Cristian Lucchetti   ||  || Banfield  || 17 || 9 || 0.53 ||\n|-\n|  || 2010 Clausura || Nelson Ibáñez  ||  || Godoy Cruz || 19 || 14 || 0.74 ||\n|-\n|  || 2010 Apertura || Marcelo Barovero   || || Vélez Sársfield || 16 || 6 || 0.38 ||\n|-\n|  || 2011 Clausura || Marcelo Barovero   |||| Vélez Sársfield  || 19 || 17 || 0.89 ||\n|-\n|  || 2011 Apertura || Agustín Orión  ||  || Boca Juniors  || 19 || 6 || 0.31 ||\n|-\n|  || 2012 Clausura || Nicolás Cambiasso  || || All Boys || 18 || 11 || 0.61 ||\n|-\n|  || 2012 Inicial || Agustín Marchesín |||| Lanús || 19 || 10 || 0.49 ||\n|-\n|  || 2013 Final || Juan Carlos Olave  |||| Belgrano (C)  || 18 || 13 || 0.72 ||\n|-\n|  || 2013 Inicial || Marcelo Barovero  |||| River Plate || 17 || 11 || 0.65 ||\n|-\n|  || 2014 Final || Gerónimo Rulli  |||| Estudiantes LP   || 19 || 11 || 0.57 ||\n|-\n|  || 2014 || Marcelo Barovero  |||| River Plate  || 18 || 12 || 0.67 ||\n|}\nReferences"
