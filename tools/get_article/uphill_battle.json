      "text": "# Uphill Battle\n\n}}\nUphill Battle was an American metalcore band with elements of grindcore, based out of Santa Barbara, California, United States.\nHistory\nUphill Battle got some recognition releasing their self-titled record on Relapse Records. Combining grindcores speed with a hardcore sense of tension, Uphill Battle's hectic riffing, strafing percussive assault and tortured vocals bled conviction and proved the band to be one of the scene's brightest hopefuls. A tour slot as part of the 2003 Relapse Records Contamination Tour alongside label-mates Mastodon, Cephalic Carnage and Dysrhythmia immediately followed, exposing the band to entirely new audiences.\nUphill Battle released their second full-length, Wreck of Nerves in 2004. In 2005, Uphill Battle disbanded, leaving behind Blurred, a collection of their pre-Relapse rarities including demo and compilation tracks.\nMembers\n*Adi Tejada - Guitars, lead vocals\n*Danny Walker - Drums\n*Jeff Capra - Guitars\n*Casey Shropshire - Bass and vocals\nDiscography\nAlbums\n*Uphill Battle - (2002)\n*Wreck of Nerves - (2004)\nCompilation albums\n*Blurred - (2006)\nRelated bands\n*Intronaut - Drummer Danny Walker's band\n*Sutratma - Singer/Guitarist Adi Tejada's band\n*Rival Cults - Guitar/Lead Vocals Adi Tejada's and Bass/Vocals Casey Shropshire's band\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.uphillbattle.org Official Uphill Battle Web site]\n* [http://relapserecords.com Relapse Records]"
