She was a fast ocean-going torpedo gunboat and was one of the most important precursors of the destroyer type of naval vessels. Destructor was the first warship formally classified as a \"destroyer\" at the time of her commissioning. Her designer was a Spanish Navy officer, Fernando Villaamil, commissioned by the Minister of the Navy, Vice-Admiral Manuel Pezuela.\nGenesis\nDuring the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s the rapidly improving, fast and cheap torpedo boats were presenting an escalating threat to major warships. Escort vessels were already in use to provide protection for battleships but it was decided that what was needed was a new type of enlarged and fast torpedo boat, capable of escorting larger ships on long voyages and also able to attack enemy battleships with torpedoes as part of a fleet action.\nThe Spanish Navy asked several British shipyards to submit proposals capable of fulfilling these specifications. In 1885 it chose the design submitted by the shipyard of James and George Thomson of Clydebank, near the Yarrow shipyards. The vessel was laid down at the end of the year, launched in 1886, and commissioned in early 1887.\nCharacteristics\nDestructor displaced , and was equipped with triple-expansion engines generating , for a maximum speed of , which made her one of the faster ships in the world by 1888. She was armed with one 90mm (3.5&nbsp;in) Spanish-designed Hontoria breech-loading gun, four  (6 pdr) Nordenfeldt guns, two  Hotchkiss revolving cannons and two  torpedo tubes. The ship carried three Schwartzkopff torpedoes per tube. She was manned by a crew of 60. On her maiden voyage, Destructor established a record after steaming from Falmouth to Ferrol in 24 hours.\nIn terms of gunnery, speed and dimensions, the specialised design to chase torpedo boats and her high seas capabilities, Destructor is widely considered the first torpedo-boat destroyer ever built, and was described as such by British naval engineer Sir William Henry White. Destructor'' is thought to have influenced the design and concept of later destroyers developed by the British Royal Navy. Further developments followed the pattern of the , built in 1893. The aim of the new destroyer design was not only to neutralize the torpedo boat as an effective weapon, but also to replace it as a faster and more reliable torpedo-carrying warship.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Chesneau, R & Kolesnik, E (Eds).
