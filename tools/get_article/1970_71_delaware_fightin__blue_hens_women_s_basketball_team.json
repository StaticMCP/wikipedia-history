This marked the second year of the program as a sanctioned sport by the university. Women's basketball, field hockey, and swimming had been approved on an experimental two-year basis in early 1969. This was also the first year of varsity coaching for head coach Mary Ann Hitchens, who had led the 1969–70 freshman women's team to an undefeated 5–0 record the prior season.\nRoster\nSchedule\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 0–1\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 0–2\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–2\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–3\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 1–4\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 2–4\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 3–4\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Mid Atlantic Regional Women's Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 4–4\n}}\n| overtime     =\n| record       = 4–5\n}}\nReferences"
