      "text": "# List of armed groups in the Algerian Civil War\n\nThis article is a list of armed groups involved in the Algerian Civil War  (1992 - 2002). The civil war between the Algerian government and various Islamist rebel groups took place from 11 January 1992 - after a coup overturned an assumed Islamist electoral victory - until 8 February 2002. Initially, the government assumed to have suppressed the Islamist movement, but armed groups soon emerged, declaring jihad. By 1994, the violence had escalated to a point where the government's ability to maintain control appeared uncertain. By 1996–97, the Islamist resistance had visibly lost popular support, though clashes continued for several more years.\nAlgerian Civil War\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and allies\n!
