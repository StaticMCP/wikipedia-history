Office 365, on the other hand, is an example of SaaS, where a monthly subscription is required.\nDevelopment effort estimation\nIn the book The Mythical Man-Month Fred Brooks tells that when estimating project times, it should be remembered that programming products (which can be sold to paying customers) are three times as hard to write as simple independent in-house programs, because requirement to work on different situations, which increases testing efforts and as a documentation.\nSee also\n* The Mythical Man-Month\n* Minimum viable product\n* Product manager\n* Software as a service\nLiterature\n*\nReferences"
