It was formed following the 2017 legislative election.\nIn the 2022 legislative election, which resulted in a hung parliament, the group lost 141 seats from its original 313 seats. It remains the largest group in the National Assembly under the 16th legislature of the Fifth Republic.\nHistory\nOn 24 June 2017, Richard Ferrand was elected La République En Marche group president with 306 votes and two abstentions. On 27 June, the group voted to designate François de Rugy its candidate for the office of President of the National Assembly, to be elected later that day; with a total of 301 votes cast, he collected 153 against 59 for Sophie Errante, 54 for Brigitte Bourguignon, 32 for Philippe Folliot, 2 blank votes and 1 null vote. Pacôme Rupin, Coralie Dubost, Danièle Hérin and Gilles Le Gendre were selected as the group's initial vice presidents; Aurore Bergé, Stanislas Guerini, Olivia Grégoire and Hervé Berville as spokespersons; and Guillaume Gouffier-Cha and Stéphanie Do as treasurers. De Rugy was elected President of the National Assembly the same day; former Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced his intention to leave the Socialist Party and seek to affiliate with the LREM parliamentary group.\nImage:Logotype du groupe La République en marche à l’Assemblée nationale.png|Previous logo of the group from 2017 to 2022, when it was named Groupe La République En Marche\nImage:Renaissance_NA.png|Alternate logo of the group since 2022\nImage:Renaissance Group.png|Logo of the group from 2022 to 2024\nImage:RE24 logo bleu.png|Logo of the group in 2024, prior to its renaming\nAt the time of its formation on 27 June, the LREM parliamentary group included 313 deputies, including 4 associated members. Manuel Valls later joined the group as an associated member. On 5 September, M'jid El Guerrab left the group and party after his physical assault of Socialist Boris Faure.\nOn 16 November, the Constitutional Council nullified the election of deputy Isabelle Muller-Quoy on 16 November 2017 under article L.O. 132 of the electoral code; a by-election was subsequently held in her constituency in 2018 to fill the vacant seat. After his exclusion from The Republicans and subsequent adhesion to La République En Marche!, Thierry Solère left the Constructives group for the La République En Marche group. On 8 December, the Constitutional Council nullified the election of Lénaïck Adam in French Guiana's 2nd constituency under article R42 of the electoral code; a by-election was held in his constituency as a result. The nullification of the election of Ramlati Ali in Mayotte's 1st constituency on 19 January 2018 triggered another by-election, as was the case in the 5th constituency for French residents overseas, where the nullification of the election of Samantha Cazebonne triggered another by-election.\nList of presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!
