      "text": "# Genroku culture\n\nby Ogata Kōrin]]\nis the term used to describe the culture of the early Edo period (1603–1867), in particular the Genroku era of 1688–1704. Genroku culture is known as a period of luxurious display when the arts were increasingly patronized by a growing and powerful merchant class.  The Genroku period is associated with two pleasure zones: the brothel district and the theaters. These two areas were often located near each other on the margins of respectable society. These constituted the  celebrated in woodblock prints of prostitutes, actors, and pornography.\nOverview\n]]\nGenroku culture was mainly centered in the Kamigata area, containing both Osaka and Kyoto. Genroku culture was defined by the fashions and lives of everyday townspeople, particularly those of the merchant classes, whose rising monetary wealth led developments in decorative art, theatre and clothing; however, the samurai classes were also involved in the development of Genroku culture. Genroku culture would contribute to the development of Neo-Confucian thought, natural science, and classical study. In fine art, the Rinpa school, founded by Korin Ogata and others, and the Tosa school both played active roles; in ceramic art, Ninsei Nonomura, Hon'ami Kōetsu and others were key players. In music, a number of key instruments and musical styles were developed during the Genroku period, including the  (a thirteen-stringed Japanese zither) music of the Ikuta-ryu school,  (a genre of traditional songs with  accompaniment) music of the Nogawa School,  (new ballad drama) such as  (musical narrative of the puppet theatre) and  melodies, and  (, ballads with  accompaniment).\nArts\n'' by Ogata Kōrin]]\nIt is generally felt that the Genroku period marks the highest point of Edo period culture. Two representative artists of Genroku culture are Rimpa school artists Ogata Kōrin and Hishikawa Moronobu, who is regarded as the founder of ukiyo-e. The term  is an amalgamation of the last syllable of \"Kōrin\". Torii Kiyonobu I was another influential ukiyo-e artist active within the Genroku period.\nEarly manga\nThe printmaking of the Genroku period would later serve as the inspiration for manga. During this period, literacy in the pleasure quarters was truly significant for the geisha and  to entertain their patrons. Literary wit and knowledge was highly valued, not only in the upper echelons of society but throughout multiple castes.\nThe accessibility to literary arts came through a plethora of mediums. One integral form of literature, often considered the parent of manga, was , a form of woodblock printed adult comicbook typically spanning no more than 30 pages. Although this genre in its initial stages focused on the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters, later it was used as a tool to represent iconographic figures and satirize various classics and issues of the time. Due to the use of illustrations, this form of art appealed to the humble-ranked samurai and the common people. One notable  author was , who generated sales of over ten thousand copies, with his compositions considered the most read literature during the Genroku era.\nNovels and poetry\nThe main elements of the emerging bourgeois culture were developed during the Genroku period within the Kamigata region. Examples are the  and kabuki plays of Chikamatsu Monzaemon, the  of Ihara Saikaku, and the poetic essays and haiku of Matsuo Bashō.\nTheater\nKabuki and  (puppet theater) emerged at the heart of urban cultural life during the Genroku period.\nKabuki\nIt is widely believed that kabuki was founded by female dancer Izumo no Okuni. Kabuki originated as a means for prostitutes, majority female, to draw crowds and entice them to purchase sexual services. Performances were often held in outdoor theaters in dry riverbeds and alongside carnival entertainments such as bear and tiger acts or sumo wrestling.\nIn 1629, the Tokugawa shogunate banned female actors from kabuki in an effort to suppress prostitution, leaving to the development of  (female roles) entirely played by men, a defining aspect of kabuki that has lasted to the modern day.\n-style actor Ichikawa Danjūrō I, -style actor Sakata Tōjūrō I, and  actor Yoshizawa Ayame I are famous kabuki actors of the Genroku era.\n(puppet theater) is a form of theater that emerged in the Genroku period. Featuring puppets of roughly two-thirds human size, each puppet was controlled by a maximum of three men. A highly skilled singer-actor chanted the several parts and the narration alongside musical accompanists. Puppet theater was attractive to writers, and many famous  plays, such as , would later be adapted for kabuki.  also provided a development of beautiful literary qualities within the theater genre.\nThe greatest  playwright was Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1725). His works offered a source of escapism for the common people, including scandalous contemporary events such as domestic murders.\nNoh\nNoh emerged from a host of ancient folk and popular performing arts, both indigenous and imported. During the early Edo period, Noh was frequently performed by women of the Kyoto pleasure quarters.\nUnlike kabuki or , the development of Noh drama is usually portrayed as one of steady ascent, and was typically seen as an upper-class style of theater, frequently drawing from Shinto legend. Noh was refined and supported by both the shogunate and imperial courts. By the height of the Edo period, Noh had climbed beyond the reaches of the Japanese masses, preserving its exalted position until the Meiji period.\nSee also\n* Kasei culture\nReferences\nExternal links ==\n*\n* [https://www.britannica.com/event/Genroku-period Genroku-period] - britanica\n* [https://kotobank.jp/word/元禄文化-61192 元禄文化] - Kotobank"
