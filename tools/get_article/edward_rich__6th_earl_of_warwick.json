In 1699, together with his friend Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun, Warwick was tried for the murder of Richard Coote and was found guilty of manslaughter. He escaped punishment by pleading the privilege of peerage. He and Mohun had killed Coote in a duel and it was common for a seventeenth-century jury in such cases to take a lenient view of such matters.\nHe died in 1701 and was succeeded by his son Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick (1698–1721).\nMarriage and children\nIn early 1697 he married Charlotte Myddelton, a daughter of Sir Thomas Myddelton, 2nd Baronet, by whom he had one son:\n*Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick (1698–1721)\nCharlotte, who survived her husband, was later married to the celebrated writer Joseph Addison.\nAncestry\nReferences"
