The first was as an unbilled player in a Harold Lloyd short.\nIn the early 1920s Edwards and his vaudeville partner Edward Flanagan appeared as the \"Hall Room Boys\" in some of the earliest short films produced by Cohn-Brandt-Cohn Film Sales, which would develop into Columbia Pictures.  Of his  credited film appearances, about 140 are comedy short subjects, notably the \"Nervy Ned\" one-reelers made for Universal Pictures from 1922 to 1924, in which he and Bert Roach played a couple of hoboes who typically get into slapstick trouble.\nHis later career is marked by bit parts and character work.  Edwards was married to actress Marguerite Snow.  He was born in Delphos, Ohio, and died in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.\nVaudeville farces and skits\n*\"Off and On\" - skit of stage life 1917\nPartial filmography\n* The Hungry Actors (1915)\n* You Never Can Tell (1920)\n* The Little Clown (1920)\n* ''Brewster's Millions (1921)\n* The Green Temptation (1922)\n* Made for Love (1926)\n* Footloose Widows (1926)\n* The Princess on Broadway (1927)\n* Show Boat (1929)\n* Gold Diggers of Broadway (1929)\n* Dynamite (1929)\n* Scarlet Pages (1930)\n* Love, Honor, and Oh Baby!
