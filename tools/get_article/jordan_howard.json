He played college football for the UAB Blazers and Indiana Hoosiers.\nEarly life\nHoward played high school football at Gardendale High School in Gardendale, Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham. He was a two-year starter for the Rockets, gaining 2,876 yards in his junior and senior seasons. While he excelled for the Rockets, he was generally regarded as a just two-star prospect and was not a highly sought-after recruit by major college programs. He ended up going to play college football just a few miles away from his home at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in Birmingham, Alabama.\nCollege career\nUAB\nHoward began his college football career at UAB in 2013. He made his collegiate debut against LSU. He rushed for a season-high 159 yards against FIU. He finished the 2013 season with 881 rushing yards. His longest rushing play of the season was 52 yards against Vanderbilt. Howard finished second in yards per carry (6.1) in Conference USA.\nAs a sophomore in 2014, he set a school single-season record with 1,587 rushing yards and ranked seventh among Division I FBS players with an average of 132.3 rushing yards per game. Howard was second in rushing yards in Conference USA for the 2014 season.\nIndiana\nFollowing the shutdown of UAB's football team, Howard transferred to Indiana University Bloomington prior to the 2015 season. He rushed for a season-high 238 yards and two touchdowns against Michigan on November 14, 2015. In only nine games in his junior season, Howard rushed for 1,213 yards and nine touchdowns on 196 attempts and had 11 receptions for 106 yards and one touchdown.\nHoward received his Bachelor of Science degree from Indiana University Bloomington on May 4, 2019.\nCollege statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Season\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"| GP\n! colspan=\"5\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"4\"| Receiving\n|-\n!

Howard was graded a 6.1 on NFL.com and had the third-highest running back rating with only Derrick Henry at 6.15, and Ezekiel Elliott at 7.09 having higher ratings than him. He was one of 24 running backs invited to the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Howard attended the combine, but opted to only perform the bench press, vertical jump, and broad jump. On May 1, 2016, he participated at Indiana's pro day, along with Nate Sudfeld, Jason Spriggs, Darius Latham, and seven other then prospects. Howard performed all of the running drills that he opted out of at the combine and also performed positional drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Howard was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. Howard was ranked as the third best running back in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com, the fourth best running back by Sports Illustrated,\nand was ranked the sixth best running back in the draft by NFL analyst Mike Mayock.\n}}\nChicago Bears\n2016 season\nThe Chicago Bears selected Howard in the fifth round (150th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the tenth running back taken in the draft. On May 9, 2016, the Bears signed him to a four-year, $2.58 million contract with a signing bonus of $248,022.\nFollowing the departure of veteran running back, Matt Forte, Howard competed with Jeremy Langford, Jacquizz Rodgers, and Ka'Deem Carey for the Bears' starting running back position. Howard had a strong performance in the Bears' preseason finale against the Cleveland Browns, where he rushed for 107 yards with one touchdown. The Bears named Howard as their third running back on their depth chart behind veterans Langford and Carey prior to the start of the regular season.\nHoward made his professional regular season debut in the Bears' second game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles after Carey suffered a hamstring injury. He finished the game with three carries for 22 rushing yards and two receptions for nine yards. Howard was named the Bears' starting running back after Langford suffered an ankle injury. On October 2, 2016, Howard earned his first career start against the Detroit Lions and finished the game with 23 carries for 111 rushing yards and three catches for 29 yards as the Bears won 17–14.

Howard joined Gale Sayers as the only Bears rookie running backs to make the Pro Bowl. He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.\n2017 season\nHoward shared the Bears' backfield with Tarik Cohen in the 2017 season.
