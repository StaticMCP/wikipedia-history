Created in 2017, the ward elects three councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 7,751 people.\nThe area has produced strong results for the Conservatives who have taken one seat and at least 35 per cent of the vote at each election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections. Five of the 13 multi-member wards in Dumfries and Galloway were abolished as a result of the review and replaced by four new ones. Castle Douglas and Crocketford encompasses an area represented by the former Castle Douglas and Glenkens ward and an area that was previously part of the Abbey ward on the Solway Firth coast in the Irish Sea at the mouth of the Urr Water. The ward takes in a central southern area of Dumfries and Galloway. It is situated within Galloway and takes in part of the historic county of Kirkcudbrightshire between the Dee and Glenkens, Mid and Upper Nithsdale, Lochar, North West Dumfries and Abbey wards. The ward takes its name from the two principal settlements within it – Castle Douglas and Crocketford. It includes the villages of Terregles, Crossmichael, Corsock, Kirkpatrick Durham, Springholm, Haugh of Urr, Beeswing, Kirkgunzeon and Palnackie.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|David James(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=2|Ian Howie(Ind.)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=2|John Young(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|Pauline Drysdale(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 Dumfries and Galloway Council election\nReferences"
