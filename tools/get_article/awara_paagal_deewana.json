Anu Malik composed the film's score with lyrics by Sameer. The plot is loosely based on the 2000 American film The Whole Nine Yards.  Dion Lam, who worked on The Matrix and Hong Kong action films was the stunt director. The film's cast includes Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Aftab Shivdasani, Paresh Rawal, Johnny Lever, Preeti Jhangiani, Aarti Chhabria, Amrita Arora and Rahul Dev.\nAwara Paagal Deewana was released on 20 June 2002 to a global audience. It received mixed reviews from critics. The film was notable for lavish and exotic song sequences, action scenes involving Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty, and the performances of Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever.\nPlot\nThe MacGuffin is $200 million worth of diamonds held in a New York bank, left in the will of Indian underworld don, Baba Baldev Prasad.  His bequest is to be distributed equally between his son, Vikrant, his daughter, Preeti, and Preeti's husband, Guru Gulab Khatri. To claim the diamonds, all three beneficiaries must present themselves to the bank.\nShortly after the don's death, Vikrant plots to disguise himself as Guru and assassinate the Indian home minister while he is live on television. Guru is falsely accused and evades prosecution by fleeing to the United States under an assumed identity.\nIn the United States, Guru is identified by Anmol, a dentist. Anmol's mother-in-law sends Anmol and her husband, Manilal to India to collect a reward for finding Guru.  However, Vikrant reneges and sends Anmol and Manilal back to the United States, accompanied by Vikrant's henchmen, Yeda Anna  and Chota Chathri, who are tasked with killing Guru. It is later revealed that Yeda Anna is a double agent working for Guru.\nVikrant and Preeti arrive in the United States to receive their inheritance of diamonds. At their hotel, Vikrant is kidnapped and killed by a mysterious group of Chinese thugs. However, Yeda Anna discovers that the kidnapped Vikrant is an imposter.\nWith Vikrant seemingly dead, Preeti and Guru claim one half of the diamonds each. As they leave the bank, a group of policemen apprehend them and take them to a remote location. Then, the real Vikrant appears. In a confrontation with Guru, Vikrant is killed by Guru.\nIn the aftermath, Anmol, who wishes to marry Preeti, asks Guru to divorce Preeti in exchange for her portion of the diamonds. Yeda Anna double-crosses Guru, and tries, in vain, to steal the diamonds from him.\nIn the end, Anmol and Preeti return to India together. Guru gives them some of his diamonds and Preeti is grateful.\nProduction\nThis film was shot principally in New York, Oman, and some scenes in Mumbai.

From the box-office point of view, the fabulous stunts, excellent music, and an aggressive promotion will help the film reach the safety mark. Business in metros should prove to be the best. Well worth a watch!\"  Anjum N of Rediff.com wrote, ″Director Bhatt should concentrate on what he does best - making small budget, non-star cast films (Ghulam being an exception). Here, he shows his capability in handling the comic scenes well - there weren't many light scenes in his earlier films. But overall, he fails to hold the audience's attention. See the film only if you are a diehard fan of Rawal's comic talent or Akshay's action scenes.\"\nAwards\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2003\n| rowspan=\"3\"|Paresh Rawal\n| Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role\n|\n|-\n| Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Comic Role\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2004\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Screen Award for Best Comedian\n|\n|-\n| Johnny Lever\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
