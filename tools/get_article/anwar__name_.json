      "text": "# Anwar (name)\n\nAnwar (or Anwer, Anwaar, Anouar, Anvar, Enver, Enwer) is the English transliteration of two Arabic names commonly used in the Arab world by both Arab Christians and Muslims: the male given name  (), meaning \"luminous\" or the female given name  (), meaning \"a collection of lights\". In Arabic, Anwar is also a comparative adjective with the meaning of \"more enlightened\".\nBoth variations may also be encountered as surnames, sometimes also with the accompanying \"al\" (the definite article \"the\") as in Al Anwar.\nIn Francophone countries, both names are usually transliterated as Anoir, Anouar and Al Anouar with the definite article \"al\".
