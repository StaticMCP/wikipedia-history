The game was released in Europe and Australasia on February 13, 2015 and in North America on February 26, 2015. It was primarily developed in assembly language. The game was VD-dev's first original work, having primarily worked on licensed titles as well as games for Ubisoft and Atari in the past. A Nintendo Switch version was released on November 28th, 2024.\nDevelopment\nDetails on IRONFALL Invasion were first shared on October 17, 2013 by Nintendo Everything. The game was shown as a tech demo on November 4, 2013.\nOn January 14, 2015, the game was revealed during a Nintendo Direct presentation and was confirmed to be out February 2015 as a free-to-start title for all Nintendo 3DS users, with enhanced support for the New Nintendo 3DS console. The free-to-start version allows players limited access to the multiplayer campaign, whilst only making the first map in the single-player campaign playable until a certain point.

On July 31, Rabet confirmed that the game the exploit was found in was IronFall: Invasion. On August 11, Nintendo temporarily delisted the game off the Nintendo eShop, as to prevent the exploit from spreading further. Six days later, Rabet released his exploit. On October 13, IRONFALL Invasion returned to the eShop with \"Update Data\", which prevents the exploit from being used. As of January 15, 2016, the exploit has been patched on system menu 10.4.0-29 which released the same day. When trying to load the game, the system does not allow users to launch the title until the software is updated, forcing users to download the patch, rendering the exploit unusable even if the older version of the game is available.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
