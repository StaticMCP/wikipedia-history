It was caused by the slaughtering of a camel that was owned by a neighboring tribe, and the subsequent killing of the Taghlibi chief that came after it.\nThis war is also remembered as a famous aphorism warning against familial discord and other family-related issues including grudges between relatives.\nBackground\nAn influential tribal chief and leader of the Banu Taghlib, Kulaib ibn Rabiah, had shot a prized she-camel with his arrow. This camel belonged to a woman named Basus, who was related to the chief of the Banu Shayban, a subdivision of Banu Bakr. Basus wrote and recited a poem which incited the chief of Banu Shayban, Jassas ibn Murrah, against Kulayb ibn Rabi'ah; this resulted in the former stabbing the latter to death. Kulayb's murder angered the Banu Taghlib, and they attacked and provoked Banu Shayban hence bringing all the subdivisions of Banu Bakr against themselves.\nCourse of conflict\nOn a day known as Yawm al-Hazr, the Banu Taghlib carried out an assault against the Banu Shayban. They were victorious, and majority of the casualties were from the Banu Shayban. Then a few days later, the Banu Taghlib confronted the Arab tribe of Zubaid. No casualties were reported, and later on the Banu Taghlib continued their attacks on Banu Shayban, killing one of the important Banu Shayban members. Gradually, the whole group of Banu Bakr (including all subdivisions) participated in the war against Banu Taghlib. One of the first victories against Banu Taghlib was on a day known as ''Yawm 'ala Istirad'', where a criminal from that tribe was killed.\nUltimatum\nSome years later, some of the subdivisions of Banu Bakr pulled out from fighting. This angered the Bakry chief Uday ibn Murrah, who called out all those Bakrys who backed off. Internal dissent occurred amongst the Banu Bakr, but it was eventually resolved. The decision was to retreat and hold a session. Due to the high number of losses, the decision was made for them to retreat, reproduce and then go back to war. So they did, they attacked some forty years later by their fresh younger generations and that's why its referred to as the 40-year-war. It took them forty years to breed a new army and go back and finish off the battle with a final victory.\nHimyarite involvement\nThe Himyarite ruler Marthad'ilan Yu'nim dispatched at least five hundred soldiers to assist Imru' al-Qays in his mission to reunite the tribes of Taghlib and Banu Bakr, with the goal of fighting against the Banu Asad.\nAftermath and end of conflict\nAfter the Banu Taghlib had suffered several defeats, their leading commander, Abu Layla al-Muhalhel fled but was captured by a Madh'hiji tribe in South of Arabia and forced to marry a woman from that tribe. The Banu Taghlib tribe eventually dispersed into the lands of Iraq, where they stayed for the rest of their lives. The fighting soon died down, and by the 530s, the war had already ended.\nBanu Taghlib were the victors of the war at first since they killed most of the Banu Bakr forces. But they eventually capitulated after forty years as Banu Bakr came for retaliation and started the killing again. The poetry that came along the war is documented specifically until our time.\nIn popular culture\nThe Basus War is referenced as an aphorism against having grudges, family feud, vendettas and violent rivalries.\nSee also\n*Battle of Dhat Irq\n*Yawm al-Nakhla\n*Dahis and al-Ghubra\nReferences"
