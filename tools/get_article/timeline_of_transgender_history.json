However, the word transgenderism did not exist until 1965 when coined by psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and Pathology; the timeline includes events and personalities that may be viewed as transgender in the broadest sense, including third gender and other gender-variant behavior, including ancient or modern precursors from the historical record.\nBefore the Common Era\n*  7,000 BCE 1700 BCEAmong the sexual depictions in Neolithic and Bronze Age drawings and figurines from the Mediterranean are, as one author describes it, a \"third sex\" human figure having female breasts and male genitals or without distinguishing sex characteristics. In Neolithic Italy, female images are found in a domestic context, while images that combine sexual characteristics appear in burials or religious settings. In Neolithic Greece and Cyprus, figures are often dual-sexed or without identifying sexual characteristics.\n*  2900 BCE 2500 BCEA burial of a suburb of Prague, Czech Republic, a male is buried in the outfit usually reserved for women. Archaeologists speculate that the burial corresponds to a transgender person or someone of the third sex.\n*  400 BCEAncient Greek physician Hippocrates writes of the enarei, a class of androgynous Scythian priests and healers; \"there are many eunuchs among the Scythians, who perform female work, and speak like women\". The enarei are also mentioned around the same time in Herodotus' work Histories; \"the Scythians who plundered the temple were punished by the goddess with the female sickness, which still attaches to their posterity. They themselves confess that they are afflicted with the disease for this reason, and travellers who visit Scythia can see what sort of a disease it is. Those who suffer from it are called Enarees\".\nFirst millennium (1–1000)\n*  1 100Philo of Alexandria and Marcus Manilius provided descriptions of transgender people during the early Roman Empire. Philo stated: \"Expending every possible care on their outward adornment, they are not ashamed even to employ every device to change artificially their nature as men into women\". He also attested that some members of this group, to that end, had their penises removed.\n* Nero becomes Emperor of Rome. Nero married two men, Pythagoras and Sporus, in legal ceremonies, with Sporus accorded the regalia worn by the wives of the Caesars.\n*  Tacitus wrote in Germania that priests of the Swabian sub-tribe, the NaharvaliFor the spelling, see Hans-Werner Goetz, Jörg Jarnut, Walter Pohl (eds.), Regna and Gentes: The Relationship Between Late Antique and Early ...

According to Cassius Dio, Elagabalus delighted in being called the mistress, wife, and queen of Hierocles, one of Elagabalus's lovers. The emperor wore makeup and wigs, preferred to be called a lady and not a lord, and offered vast sums to any physician who could provide the emperor with a vagina; for this reason, the emperor is seen by some writers as an early transgender figure and one of the first on record as seeking sex reassignment surgery.\n* Death of Anastasia the Patrician who left life as a lady-in-waiting in the court of Justinian I in Constantinople to spend twenty-eight years (until death) dressed as a male monk in seclusion in Egypt, and has been adopted by today's LGBTQ community as an example of a \"transgender\" saint.\n1001–1900\n*  Kalonymus ben Kalonymus composes a poem for Even Boḥan, a Jewish ethical treatise. The poem expresses discontent with having been born male instead of female. The poem, which was traditionally interpreted as a piece of satire, has sometimes been reinterpreted as a genuine expression of gender dysphoria.\n* Rolandino Roncaglia is tried for sodomy, an event that caused a sensation in Italy. He confessed he \"had never had sexual intercourse, neither with his wife nor with any other woman, because he had never felt any carnal appetite, nor could he ever have an erection of his virile member\". After his wife died of plague, Rolandino started to prostitute himself, wearing female dresses because \"since he has female look, voice and movementsalthough he does not have a female orifice, but has a male member and testiclesmany persons considered him to be a woman because of his appearance\".\n* John Rykener, known also as Johannes Richer and Eleanor, was a transvestite prostitute working mainly in London (near Cheapside), but also active in Oxford. He was arrested in 1395 for cross-dressing and interrogated.\n* 1498 A Moor in Rome, who was likely a trans woman, was executed for transvestism on April 7 this year, wearing \"(her) usual women's clothes … (she) was placed on a bundle of wood and strangled at the column of the gallows\" and subsequently burned.\n* 1537An unnamed woman was executed for wearing male clothing near Basel.\n* Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca documents same sex marriages and men \"who dress like women and perform the office of women, but use the bow and carry big loads\" among a Native American tribe in his publication, The Journey of Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and His Companions from Florida to the Pacific 1528–1536.\n* Process of Wojciech z Poznania, who married Sebastian Słodownik, and lived with him for two years in Poznań.

He would later use the term \"eonism\", named for the aforementioned Chevalier d'Éon, to refer to this phenomenon.\n*  In Berlin, Germany, Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld co-founds the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sex Research), a pioneering private research institute and counseling office. Its library of thousands of books was destroyed by Nazis in May 1933.\n*  Lili Elbe had received emasculation and ovary transplant in June 1930.

It is viewed by some historians as the first modern LGBT uprising in the United States.\n1960s\n* The term transgenderism is coined by psychiatrist John F. Oliven of Columbia University in his 1965 reference work Sexual Hygiene and Pathology. \"According to scholars, the word first appeared in print in John F. Oliven's 1965 book, \"Sexual Hygiene and Pathology.\" Oliven writes:Where the compulsive urge reaches beyond female vestments, and becomes an urge for gender ('sex') change, transvestism becomes 'transsexualism.' The term is misleading; actually, 'transgenderism' is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism.Although Oliven's understanding of \"transgender\"is not the same as our understanding of it today, his use of it is still significant. As K.J. Rawson and Cristan Williams note in their book, \"Transgender*: The Rhetorical Landscape of a Term,\" Oliven didn't use the word in the book's 1955 edition; it was added later, when the second edition was revised and published.Gradually, some members of this marginalized community began to apply the word \"transgender\"to themselves. For example, Virginia Charles Prince, publisher of the long-running periodical \"Transvestia,\" occasionally used a variation of the word, \"transgenderal.\"\": \"Transexualism. Where the compulsive urge reaches beyond female vestments, and becomes an urge for gender (\"sex\") change, transvestism becomes \"transexualism.\" The term is misleading; actually, \"transgenderism\" is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism.\"\n* The Compton's Cafeteria Riot occurred in August 1966 by transgender women and Vanguard members in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco.
