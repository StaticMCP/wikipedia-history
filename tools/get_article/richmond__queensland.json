It is the administrative centre of the Shire of Richmond. In the , the locality of Richmond had a population of 578 people.\nToponymy\nThe origin of the name Richmond comes from when Arthur Bundock and Walter Hayes took up land in the district which they named the Richmond Downs Pastoral Run. It was named after the Richmond River in northern New South Wales which was where Bundock had been born.\nGeography\nThe town is  west of Townsville and  east of Mount Isa. The Flinders Highway traverses the locality from east to west passing through the town which is located in about the centre of the locality. The Great Northern railway runs immediately south and parallel to the highway through the east of the locality, crossing over in the town which is served by the Richmond railway station, and then the railway runs immediately north and parallel to the highway through the west of the locality. There is a second railway station, the Moselle railway on the far eastern edge of the locality, named after the pastoral run, which in turn was named in about the 1870s by pastoralist J.B. Brodie after the Moselle River in eastern France.\nThe Flinders River flows through the locality from east to west, passing to the west of the town, where the river has its confluence with its tributary Dutton River.\nThe Richmond–Croydon Road exits to the north-west, and the Richmond–Winton Road to the south-west.\nClimate\nRichmond has a hot semi-arid climate bordering on a tropical temperature regime.\n}}\nHistory\nJirandali (also known as Yirandali, Warungu, and Yirandhali) is an Australian Aboriginal language of North-West Queensland, particularly the Hughenden area. The language region includes the local government area of the Shire of Flinders, including Dutton River, Flinders River, Mount Sturgeon, Caledonia, Richmond, Corfield, Winton, Torrens, Tower Hill, Landsborough Creek, Lammermoor Station, Hughenden, and Tangorin.\nWanamarra (also known as Maykulan and Wunumura is an Australian Aboriginal language in North West Queensland. The language region includes areas within the Shire of McKinlay, Shire of Cloncurry and Shire of Richmond, including the Flinders River area, and the towns of Kynuna and Richmond.\nThe explorer William Landsborough camped on 13 March 1862 at the site that would become the town of Richmond. Explorer and former Commandant of the Native Police, Frederick Walker, had previously passed through the area in October 1861, naming and camping on the Dutton River. Both the Landsborough and Walker parties were attempting to locate the Burke and Wills expedition.\nThe leasehold of the Richmond Downs Pastoral Run was granted in 1863 to Wellington Cochrane Bundock and Enoch Price Walter Hays who came from the Richmond River in New South Wales. In 1866 the Crown Lands Office transferred the leasehold on the Pastoral Runs of Wyanganie, Landsborough Downs and Richmond Downs in the Burke district from W C Bundock and F S Hays to Robert Napier, manager of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. Then in 1867 the interest of the bank in these three properties was transferred back to W C Bundock and Francis S Hays.\nBy 1867, Richmond Downs had a postal service. However at some stage the service drew the attention of the Postmaster General for inefficiency.  In the 1870s services became intermittent. In May 1899, the post office name was changed from Richmond Downs to Richmond, and a new post office built.\nIn 1880, gold was found at Woolgar to the north and Richmond became an important stagecoach stop en route to Woolgar.\nThe town was surveyed on 9 December 1882 by surveyor Joseph Hargreaves with town lots sold from April 1883.\nRichmond Provisional School opened on 22 May 1889 with 23 pupils, becoming Richmond State School on 27 February 1902 when it had 113 pupils.\nThe Great Northern railway reached the town in June 1904. At the official celebration on 2 June 1904, it was explained that the line was the first to be built by cheaper methods by replacing the track ballast with packed earth, but the cost saving was at the expense of train speed, which was expected to be 15 miles per hour. It was hoped that cheaper methods would allow more pastoral areas to be serviced by rail with an immediate desire to connect through to Cloncurry.\nOn Sunday 24 July 1904, St Brigid's Catholic Church was blessed and opened by Bishop Joseph Higgins.\nIn July 1909, St John the Baptist Anglican Church was officially opened and dedicated by Bishop George Frodsham.\nThe Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart opened a Catholic primary school in 1915.\nThe Richmond Public Library was opened in 1996.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Richmond had a population of 554 people.\nIn the , the locality of Richmond had a population of 522 people.\nIn the , the locality of Richmond had a population of 648 people.\nIn the , the locality of Richmond had a population of 578 people.\nHeritage listings\nRichmond has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* St John the Baptist Anglican Church, 55 Crawford Street ()\nEconomy\nTraditionally, the two biggest industries in Richmond are sheep- and cattle-farming, however tourism is an increasingly important aspect of the local economy.
