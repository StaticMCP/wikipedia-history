He first performed in public at age 9, when, as a reward for having sold the most tickets to a high school operetta, he was tasked not merely with formally presenting the frieze purchased by proceeds from the production, but also asked to sing at the ceremony. After attending the University of California, San Diego, Wright joined the US Army, serving in 1st Cavalry Regiment, with whom he took part in the unsuccessful Pancho Villa Expedition. Eventually rising to the rank of Second Lieutenant, Wright received his discharge in 1920.\nOver the next decade, Wright—as Fred Howard—established himself as a successful stage performer, writer, producer, and director, specializing in musical comedy. His singing was showcased in the trio, Harmony Three.\nBy February 1929, Wright—who, as a solo act, had previously appeared in at least one revue also featuring his soon-to-be partner's recently formed duo—had officially become one half of the Happy Chappies, replacing pianist Nat Vincent's previous partner, tenor Harry Morton, while also facilitating Wright's radio debut on San Francisco's KFRC. They continued together—having reportedly co-authored \"486 popular songs\" as of December 1935—at least as late as the summer of 1937.\nIn April 1938, Wright appeared at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, in the Lambs Club's annual Spring Gambol, co-starring with Walter Woolf King and Gene Wolf in the brief operetta, Tempest in a Teapot, with words and music by Wright.\nAs a radio actor, some of Wright's more notable roles were C. Pemberton Tooley in Ma Perkins, Mr. Pringle—father of Oogie—in A Date with Judy, and Pa Buskirk on The Opie Cates Show\nFrom 1949 through 1952, Wright was the principal writer on The Ruggles, the Charlie Ruggles sitcom created by Irving Phillips.\nFrom Fred Howard to Howard Wright\nIn March 1949, Wright—still billed as \"Fred Howard\"—made his TV debut, starring alongside K. T. Stevens, Marc Lawrence, in the Don Lee Television Workshop episode, \"Shoes and Souls\". One additional \"Fred Howard\" credit, for a 1951 appearance on Racket Squad'', preceded the actor's unnoticed—and, accordingly, never explained—1953 professional transition to \"Howard Wright\" on The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok.\nAmong Wright's more notable television credits are two The Twilight Zone episodes, as \"Judge Hardy\" in the Season Three episode, \"The Jungle (The Twilight Zone)\" and an unnamed judge in the previous season's ''What's in the Box. He also appeared on numerous episodes of the westerns, Bonanza and Death Valley Days.\nIn his rave review of the 1956 Barry Shipman/William Witney western drama, Stranger at My Door, ''Variety's'' William Brogdon—as \"Brog\"—made a point of assigning every bit as much credit to the film's principal supporting players as to the stars.\nThe above mentioned players earn plaudits for characters compellingly performed and right along with them are Louis Jean Heydt, as the sheriff, Howard Wright, a doctor, Slim Pickens, horse trader and millwright, and Malcolm Atterbury, a circuit rider.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1919 or 1920, Wright became the husband of Jean—elsewhere identified as Laura—Henley, with whom he had one child, a daughter, Jo Ann. Wright was married to actress Sylvia Jane Worley from January 1925 until at least March 1927—when they sailed together from San Francisco to Honolulu—and no later than October 1930, when Greek-born Theofani Arminda Pappadakis became the next Mrs. Wright, as she would remain until her death on March 4, 1963. Their union produced one child, a daughter, Patsy Zo. In 1969, Wright once again was wed, this time to Helen Louise Daves (née Young); she died in 1985.\nWright died on July 2, 1990, at age 93. His remains are interred at the Los Angeles National Cemetery.\nSelected filmography\nFilms\nSoundtrack\n*''The Fiddlin' Buckaroo (1933) – writer: \"My Pretty Quadroon\"\n*Round-Up Time in Texas (1937) – writer: \"When the Bloom Is on the Sage\"\n*Jezebel (1938) – writer: \"My Pretty Quadroon\"\n*Western Jamboree (1938) – writer: \"When the Bloom Is on the Sage\"\n*Loaded Pistols (1948) – writer: \"When the Bloom Is on the Sage\"\n*Under Mexicali Stars (1950) – writer: \"Old Black Mountain Trail\"\n*Rodeo King and the Senorita (1951) – writer: \"The Strawberry Roan\"\n*A Prairie Home Companion (2006) – writer: \"When the Bloom Is on the Sage\"\nActing\nAll performances credited as \"Howard Wright\" unless otherwise indicated.\n*Six Bridges to Cross (1955) – Judge\n*Cell 2455, Death Row (1955) – Judge\n*One Desire (1955) – Judge Congin\n*Headline Hunters (1955) – Harry Bradley\n*Seminole Uprising (1955) – Col.
