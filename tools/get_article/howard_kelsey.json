He is one of only four athletes to be named to the Canada men's national basketball team immediately out of high school.  Over the course of 11 years (1977–88), Kelsey represented Canada in many tournaments in over 400 total games, including two Olympics (1980, 1984); three FIBA World Championships; and two FISU World University Games, where Canada won gold in 1983.\nHigh School\nKelsey played for Point Grey High School in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Kelsey still holds the all-time career scoring record in B.C. high school basketball history with a 37.5 ppg average.\nWhile in high school, he led his team to a city championship and a fifth-place finish in the provincial tournament, where he was named tournament MVP.\nAfter high school, Kelsey was selected to the Canadian national men's basketball team, one of only four players in history to be selected immediately after high school.\nInternational career\nKelsey represented Canada in over 400 games over the course of 11 years (1977–88).\nOlympics\nKelsey is a two-time Olympian, being on Canada's Olympic teams in 1980 and 1984.  Kelsey is one of two native BC players to represent Canada in two Olympics.\nCanada qualified for the 1980 Moscow Olympics; however, Kelsey and his teammates did not compete in these games given Canada's boycott of these Olympics as a result of the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.  This 1980 Canadian Olympic team was positioned to be a medal-contender given that Canada competed for the bronze medal in the Olympic games preceding and following these 1980 Olympics (1976, 1984), with this time of Canadian basketball being described as \"arguably the Canadian national team's greatest era\" and \"Canada's golden age of basketball\".\nCanada finished 4th overall in the 1984 Olympics, narrowly missing a medal.  This 1984 bronze-medal game constituted the only time in the past 80+ years where Canada has had a legitimate chance of winning an Olympic medal in basketball.  This bronze medal game was highly competitive, being tied 18 times with 12 lead changes, with Canada being within one point with less than a minute of play remaining.\nOther National Team Tournaments\nKelsey represented Canada in the 1981 and 1983 FISU World University Games, where in 1983, Canada won the gold medal.  In the semifinal match of this tournament, Canada defeated a talented US team led by future NBA hall of famers Charles Barkley and Karl Malone.  This 1983 gold medal win constituted one of the finest moments in Canadian basketball history, being the only time in which Canada has won the gold medal in an international basketball tournament.  Additionally, in the 1981 World Student Games, Kelsey started for the Canadian team that achieved its first-ever victory over the United States in an international men's basketball tournament.\nKelsey also represented Canada in three FIBA World Championships; and in the 1978 Commonwealth Basketball Championships, where Canada won gold.\nKelsey won many awards while representing Canada, including the BC Male Basketball Player of the Year, being named three times as a First Team All-Star at the Canadian Senior Men's Basketball Championships and being a two-time recipient of BC's Premier Award for Excellence in International Competition.\nCollege\nKelsey lettered twice and started at Oklahoma State University.
