He is often called the \"father of expert systems\".\nEducation and early life\nFeigenbaum was born in Weehawken, New Jersey in 1936 to a culturally Jewish family, and moved to nearby North Bergen, where he lived until the age of 16, when he left to start college. His hometown did not have a secondary school of its own, and so he chose Weehawken High School for its college preparatory program. He was inducted into his high school's hall of fame in 1996.\nFeigenbaum completed his undergraduate degree (1956), and a Ph.D. (1960), at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). In his PhD thesis, carried out under the supervision of Herbert A. Simon, he developed EPAM, one of the first computer models of how people learn.\nDuring undergrad years, he took a graduate-level course called \"Ideas and Social Change\" taught by James March. March introduced him to Herbert Simon. Feigenbaum took a course \"Mathematical Models in the Social Sciences\" taught by Simon, where Simon announced the Logic Theorist with \"Over the Christmas holidays, Al Newell and I invented a thinking machine.\" Simon gave Feigenbaum a manual of IBM 701, which he read in one night. Feigenbaum later called it a \"born-again experience\".\nCareer and research\nFeigenbaum completed a Fulbright fellowship at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) and in 1960 went to the University of California, Berkeley, to teach in the School of Business Administration. He joined the Stanford University faculty in 1965 as one of the founders of its computer science department. He was the director of the Stanford Computation Center from 1965 to 1968.  He established the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at Stanford University. Important projects that Feigenbaum was involved in include systems in medicine, as ACME, MYCIN, SUMEX, and Dendral. He also co-founded companies IntelliCorp and Teknowledge.\nTeknowledge was founded in July 1981 by 20 computer scientists from Stanford University, MIT, and the Rand Corporation. The company's staff \"represent about 1/3 of the world's high-level expertise in the design and development of knowledge systems\". Its aim was to allow people without training in knowledge-engineering technology to use it for commercial and industrial applications.\nIn 2000, Feigenbaum became a Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at Stanford University. His former doctoral students include Peter Karp, Niklaus Wirth, and Alon Halevy.\nHonors and awards\n* 1984: Selected as one of the initial fellows of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI)\n* 1986: Elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to knowledge engineering and expert systems technology, and for leadership in education and technology of applied artificial intelligence.\n* 1994: Turing Award jointly with Raj Reddy for \"pioneering the design and construction of large scale artificial intelligence systems, demonstrating the practical importance and potential commercial impact of artificial intelligence technology\".\n* 1997: U.S. Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Award\n* 2007: Inducted as fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)\n* 2011: IEEE Intelligent Systems [http://www.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2011/0811/rW_IS_AIsHallofFame.pdf AI's Hall of Fame]  for \"significant contributions to the field of AI and intelligent systems\".\n* 2012. Made fellow of the Computer History Museum \"for his pioneering work in artificial intelligence and expert systems.\"\n* 2013. IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award for \"pioneering work in Artificial Intelligence, including development of the basic principles and methods of knowledge-based systems and their practical applications\".\nWorks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
