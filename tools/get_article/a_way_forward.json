The album was released on November 5, 2021 and was their last to feature original bassist Michael Sue-Poi before his departure in 2022.\nBackground\nThe album was announced on June 3, 2021, with the release of the first single \"Across That Fine Line\". Three variations of the vinyl record were made available: a standard black color, a red and blue blend sold from Rough Trade Records, and a coke-bottle-clear color sold through the band's webstore. Rough Trade also offered a bonus CD which features alternate versions of the tracks \"A Word & A Wave\", \"In Manhattan\" and \"Miranda\", plus a remix of the band's 2020 single \"A Different Kind of Life\" by producer Nick Millhiser.\nReception\n| rev2      = God Is in the TV\n| rev2score = 8/10\n| rev3      = Mojo\n| rev3score =\n| rev4      = NME\n| rev4score =\n| rev5      = Paste\n| rev5score = 8.2/10\n| rev6      = Pitchfork\n| rev6score = 7.0/10\n}}\nThe album received a Metacritic score of 76 out of 100, which indicates generally favorable reviews.\nAustin Brown of Pitchfork said, \"The band’s decision to expand their swagger and invest in more complex synth work pushes them to new territory, and the most remarkable digressions from their comfort zone point towards a future beyond pastiche.\" Similarly, Allmusic's Marcy Donelson writes how, \"the detailing and variable arrangements here, combined with engaging songs, lift A Way Forward above the level of genre exercise, occasionally into something more compositional\".\nTrack listing\n*Tracks 1, 4, 7, 9 and 10 were produced and mixed by Nick Millhiser.\n*Tracks 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 were produced and mixed by Abe Seiferth.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for A Way Forward\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
