Brown, published by Oxford University Press on November 14, 1985, in hardback and on December 11, 1986, in paperback.\nThe book was adapted into the 2021 film Benedetta, starring Virginie Efira as Benedetta Carlini.\nSynopsis\nThe book is a study of the life of Sister Benedetta Carlini, a 17th-century Italian nun who was accused of lesbianism and other \"immodest acts\". The book explores the cultural, social, and religious context of the time and the consequences faced by Sister Benedetta as a result of her alleged actions. It is considered a notable work in the field of lesbian history and gender studies, and provides insights into the experiences of women and sexual minorities in early modern Europe.\nLiving in Tuscany, Benedetta was elected as the abbess due to the notoriety she gained from visions of Jesus. At first, church authorities were skeptical of her visions but eventually embraced them for the prestige it would bring the convent. In 1619, Benedetta had a vision where Jesus commanded her to conduct a \"grand wedding ceremony\" during which she was to be his bride. This caused unease with church authorities; this resulted in two investigations to determine if her visions were divine or demonic. The author explores the suspicions of the authorities that she was involved in sexual acts with another nun.\nStructure\nThe book is divided into chapters that cover different aspects of Sister Benedetta Carlini's life and the major events of her life.\nThe opening provides an overview of the cultural, social, and religious context of Renaissance Italy and sets the stage for the story of Sister Benedetta. The subsequent chapters examine the events leading up to Sister Benedetta's accusation of lesbianism, her trial, and the subsequent events in her life. The book also includes a detailed analysis of the written records of the case, including depositions, letters, and court documents.\nThroughout the book, the author interweaves historical and cultural analysis with her interpretation of the events. The book concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of the case and its significance for the history of sexuality and gender.\nReviews\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/immodest-acts-9780195042252?cc=us&lang=en& Official page], Oxford University\n*"
