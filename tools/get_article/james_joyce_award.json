Past recipients include academics, political figures, actors and writers. It is the highest award that an Irish University society can give. It is named after one of the society's most best-known alumni, James Joyce, the author of Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake.\nJoyce was a student at University College, the predecessor of UCD, from 1898 to 1903, where he studied modern languages.
