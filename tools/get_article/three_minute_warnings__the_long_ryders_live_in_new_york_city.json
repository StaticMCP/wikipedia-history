AllMusic rated the album four stars out of five, calling it \"a jewel of a concert album\", and commented: \"The fact is that they're so \"on\" for this show ... that it almost wouldn't have mattered what they played, as long as they played this way\". AllMusic wrote that the guitars \"crunch and cut away at folk-ish and country-like melodies, sounding a lot like a garage punk version of the Eagles\". Uncut and Mojo both gave it three stars out of five, writing that the live performance displayed \"verve and commitment\" and \"highlights why the Long Ryders mattered\". The Edmonton Journal described the album as \"punk band energy, fused with clever pop craftmanship\", and embellished with \"countrified solos\". Exclaim! magazine felt that the album contains \"stellar versions of their most well-known songs\", adding that \"it serves as a reminder that without them, Jason & the Scorchers, Rank & File, and others, alt-country wouldn't exist.\" The Sunday Times described the performance as \"loud, fast and impossibly tight ... fusing fragments of mythic Americana with a driving punk aesthetic, prophets without honour, playing for their lives.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;The Long Ryders\n*Sid Griffin – guitar, harmonica, vocals\n*Steve McCarthy – guitar, mandolin, lap steel, vocals\n*Tom Stevens – bass, vocals\n*Greg Sowders – drums\n;Technical\n*David Van Der Heyden – producer, engineer\n*Bob Kranes – broadcast coordination\n*Tommy Sjostrom – photography\n*Phil Smee – design\nReferences"
