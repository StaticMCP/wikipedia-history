The offensives began as a result of newly elected Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's crackdown on the group, and increasingly deadly attacks on civilian and military centers. The main area of operations for these offensives was Hirshabelle and Middle Shabelle states, north of the capital Mogadishu. Runirgod, also called Ruunnirgood, was a major al-Shabaab hub in Middle Shabelle state, having been controlled by the group since 2016.\nBattle\nThe battle for Runirgod, and its surrounding district, began on December 12, when Somali troops liberated the village of al-Kowthar, just north of Runirgod district. From there, Somali forces and an allied militia, the Macawisley, penetrated southwards into Runirgod district, capturing the town of Daarunimoo. By the morning of December 18, Somali forces had captured the hamlets of Harerigi Ali Ahmed, Lebi Ad, and El-Bad. The following morning, clashes broke out again in Daarunimoo, as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to recapture the town. al-Shabaab also captured el-Bad later on December 18. On December 19, al-Shabaab forces retreated to rural areas of Galgaduud region and the eastern parts of Runirgod district.\nSomali forces claimed on December 22 that they captured the town of Runirgod, the capital of Runirgod district, around 6am. Army spokesman claimed they killed 150 al-Shabaab fighters in the operation, five of whom were foreign. While al-Shabaab did not claim to have retreated, they did claim the deaths of four Somali soldiers in a bomb attack in the district. Following the liberation of Runirgod, all major towns in Middle Shabelle state were under the control of the Somali Army.\nAftermath\nOn December 24, Somali troops attacked El-Bad again, which was still under the control of al-Shabaab. An unnamed Somali military official claimed Somali forces took casualties, although captured the town.\nReferences"
