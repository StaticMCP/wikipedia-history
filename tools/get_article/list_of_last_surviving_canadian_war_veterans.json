The last surviving veteran of any particular war, upon his death, marks the end of a historic era. Exactly who is the last surviving veteran is often an issue of contention, especially with records from long-ago wars. The \"last man standing\" was often very young at the time of enlistment and in many cases had lied about his age to get entry into the service, which confuses matters further. There were also sometimes incentives for men to lie about their ages after their military service ended.\n19th century\nWar of 1812 (1812–1815)\n* Sir Provo Wallis (1791–1892)&nbsp;— Royal Navy.
