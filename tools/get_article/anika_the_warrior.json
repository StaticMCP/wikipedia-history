Anika challenges Wonder to a duel, but is immediately overcome because Wonder is Death in disguise. Though he begs for more time and attempts to bribe Death, no mercy is given. Proverbially, an \"Anika the Warrior\" is one engaged in something as hopeless as a fight against death. He appears in the folk plays Tsar Maximilian and King Herod, and is mentioned in Maxim Gorky's Childhood. Its plot is loosely based on the Byzantine epic about Digenes Akritas.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* Богатыри и витязи Русской земли: По былинам, сказаниям и песням.
