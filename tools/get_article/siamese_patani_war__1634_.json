King Prasat Thong came to power in Ayutthaya through a coup d'état which Raja Ungu of Patani refused to accept and cut off relations with Ayutthaya and stopped sending bunga mas. This caused Prasat Thong to gather an army of 30,000 men and more than 60,000 from various cities on 11 May 1634, with the Dutch promising to send warships to support him. The war lasted seven days. Ayutthaya was unable to attack Pattani as it received assistance from Johor and Pahang, totalling 50 ships, along with four Portuguese warships that came to support. When supplies ran low, the Ayutthaya forces retreated to Songkhla to wait for support from the Dutch, but there was no sign of it and the army eventually retreated.\nReferences"
