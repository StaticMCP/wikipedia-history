Choi addressed SMCU as the \"core value and vision of future entertainment\" presented by SM. He presented that SMCU is \"not just a worldview\" that is interpreted as a symbol or a metaphor, but a \"new vision and project\" to express artists and music through storytelling content that contains \"attractive\" characters and stories. Choi talked about Aespa as the \"beginning\" of the SMCU project, and added that the worldview and stories of various groups such as Exo, Red Velvet, and NCT will unfold independently and sometimes connect to new stories. Additionally, he added that Super Junior is also part of SMCU and hopes that people will see what different stories the group will unfold in the future.\nOn June 23, 2021, SM Entertainment and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a joint metaverse study.

He explained that the metaverse era will be recognized for its \"originality and will become more valuable\" in the future.

Lee told Aespa that they are \"stepping out in earnest to a world\" where they expand their worldview under the name of SM Culture Universe and create their own universe. Moreover, SM announced further details regarding SMCU such as potential plans for films, applications, and games that would allow for fan interaction.\nOn July 1, 2021, the Second WCIF was held in the form of an international seminar involving key figures from five countries including South Korea, the United States, China, Japan, and India.
