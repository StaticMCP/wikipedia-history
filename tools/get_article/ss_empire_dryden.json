The United Kingdom Official Number 169010 and Code Letters BCTN were allocated. Her port of registry was Sunderland and she was placed under the management of Sir R Ropner & Co Ltd. She was armed with a four-inch gun, a 20&nbsp;mm gun and four machine guns. Her crew totalled 51 officers and men, including six DEMS gunners.\nEmpire Dryden made her maiden voyage on 27 February 1942, departing from Sunderland to join Convoy FN 642, which had departed from Southend, Essex the previous day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 28 February. She then joined Convoy EN 53, which departed on 1 March and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 4 March. Empire Dryden was in ballast. She left the convoy at Loch Ewe on 3 March. She then joined Convoy ON 74, which departed from Liverpool, Lancashire on 9 March and arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada on 25 March. She then joined Convoy XB 5, which departed on 27 March and arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, United States on 29 March. She left the convoy at the Cape Cod Canal that day and sailed to New York, arriving on 1 April.\nEmpire Dryden departed from New York on 17 April, laden with  of general cargo and military stores. She was bound for Alexandria, Egypt via Table Bay, South Africa. On 19 April, she reported the position of some from the survivors of the Argentine tanker  to , which was nearby. At 03:06 (German time) on 20 April, Empire Dryden was hit by one of the three torpedoes which had been fired by . She was  north west of Bermuda (). The torpedo hit the starboard side of the No. 2 hold, blowing off the bow and causing the ship to start sinking.\nAll on board took to the lifeboats, with some difficulty as the engine was still running. The next day, the smallest of the three lifeboats had to be abandoned as it was taking on water. The survivors in that lifeboat were divided between the other two lifeboats. One lifeboat with 25 of the crew and the three DEMS gunners on board was last seen on 22 April, and is presumed to have foundered in a gale sometime during the next two days. The other lifeboat, with 22 crew and three DEMS gunners on board, sailed for  until the survivors were spotted by the American passenger ship  at  and rescued. They were landed in Bermuda on 8 May. Those lost from Empire Dryden are commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial, London.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.yourottawaregion.com/yourottawaregion/article/222121 Survivors' account of the sinking and time on board the lifeboat]"
