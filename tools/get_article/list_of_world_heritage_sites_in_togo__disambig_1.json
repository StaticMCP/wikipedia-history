Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Togo accepted the convention on April 15, 1998, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2023, Togo has only one World Heritage Site, Koutammakou, the Land of the Batammariba, which it's shared with Benin.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF|Koutammakou, the Land of the Batammariba\n|\n| Kara Region\n| 2004\n| 1140bis; v, vi (cultural)\n|The Koutammakou landscape in north-eastern Togo and neighbouring Benin is home to the Batammariba, whose remarkable mud tower-houses are known as takienta (sikien in the plural). Nature is strongly associated with the rituals and beliefs of society here. The landscape is exceptional due to the architecture of the tower-houses which reflect the social structure; its farmland and forest; and the associations between people and landscape. The buildings are grouped in villages, which also include ceremonial spaces, springs, sacred rocks and sites reserved for initiation ceremonies.\n|}\nTentative List\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Togo maintains 4 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Aného-Glidji Aglomeration\n|\n|Maritime Region\n| align=\"center\" |2021\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Serial Granaries of the caves of Nok, Mamproug, Kouba and Bagou\n|\n|Savanes Region\n| align=\"center\" |2021\n|iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bassar Ancient Iron Metallurgy Sites\n|\n|Kara Region\n| align=\"center\" |2021\n|iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Fazao Malfakassa National Park\n|\n|Centrale Region, Kara Region\n| align=\"center\" |2021\n|x (natural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
