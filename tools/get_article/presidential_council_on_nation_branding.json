The council was abolished on March 23, 2013.\nSouth Korea achieved a nation brand above the OECD average. South Korea's nation brand ranked 17th in 2012, on track to achieving the council's goal of 15th place by 2013.\nBackground and objective\nAccording to the Simon Anholt Report, nation branding refers to \"how a country is seen by others\".  Other conceptualizations define nation branding as \"strategic self-presentation of a country with the aim of creating reputational capital through economic, political, and social interest promotion at home and abroad.\" National brand today reflects the image of a country (soft power) more than its military or economic influence (hard power) in the international world. Strong national brand translates into high respect and acceptance of that country by the international community. To assess Korea’s current positioning and seek ways to improve and strengthen national brand in and out of Korea, governmental efforts continue.\nThe goal of the Presidential Council on Nation Branding was to raise Korea's brand from near the bottom of the member states of the OECD to the middle of the bloc (13 out of 31 countries) by 2013.\nStatus of Korean national brand\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:1px black; float:right; margin-left:1em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#82CAFA;\" colspan=\"3\"|Mainly positive view of South Korea (2013 BBC Poll); % change 2010\n|-\n|  || 58% || 15%\n|-\n|  || 55% || 14%\n|-\n|  || 48% || 17%\n|-\n| || 47% || 1%\n|-\n|  || 45% || 10%\n|-\n|  || 44% || 14%\n|-\n|  || 43% || 21%\n|-\n|  || 41% || 12%\n|-\n| || 40% || 5%\n|-\n|  Central America (2010)|| 39% ||NR\n|-\n| || 38% || 1%\n|-\n| || 37% || 7%\n|-\n| || 34% || 3%\n|-\n| || 34%|| 6%\n|-\n| || 31%|| NA\n|-\n| || 31%||NA\n|-\n| || 30%|| 8%\n|-\n| || 30%|| 13%\n|-\n| || 29%|| 16%\n|-\n| || 24%|| 16%\n|-\n|  (2010)|| 23% ||NR\n|-\n|  (2010)|| 20%||NR\n|-\n| || 20%||  7%\n|-\n| || 18% ||NA\n|-\n| || 17% || 11%\n|-\n| || 19% ||\n|-\n| || 19%|| 17%\n|-\n| NA = Data not available in 2010NR = Country not ranked in 2013 || ||\n|}\nSouth Korea made substantial gains since the launch of the council, moving up to 26th in 2011 in the Anholt-GfK Roper Nation Brands Index from a rank of 29th in 2010 and 32nd in 2008. The index has not published results for South Korea since 2012.\nIn a similar nation brand index that the Presidential Council on Nation Branding developed with Samsung Economic Research Institute, South Korea moved up to 17th in 2012 from 19th in 2010 and 20th in 2009. Backed by the world's most watched YouTube video in history, Gangnam Style and hit products from Samsung, the world's largest information technology company, for the first time, the country surpassed the average of the OECD in 2012, overtaking countries like Spain, Finland and Ireland, while trending toward surpassing New Zealand, Norway, and Italy within a decade.\nVision and strategy\nThe general motto employed by the South Korean government was, \"Korea, A Loving Embrace\"\nVision\nAs its main goal, the Presidential Council on Nation Branding aimed to (1) achieve a national brand at the OECD average level and (2) achieve the entry of the Korean national brand as world top 15 by 2013.\nStrategy\nStrategies to implement the aforementioned goals included, (1) accumulating national capacity through cooperation amongst the people, corporations, and government, (2) managing national brand by establishing a master plan and developing brand index, (3) pursuing customized policies in accordance to the needs of different sectors, and (4) creating a national brand motivating force through the expansion of a common national response.\nThe Presidential Council on Nation Branding emphasized on the following five strategic areas to increase national brand value: (1) Contribution to the international community, (2) embrace of multiculturalism and consideration for foreigners, (3) cultivation of global citizenship, (4) advertisement of modern technology and products, and (5) promotion of an attractive culture and tourism.\nFunctions\nThe three main functions of the Presidential Council on Nation Branding were: (1) General control tower on nation branding related issues of the South Korean government, (2) Effective execution of nation branding policies and related projects, and (3) Strengthening and expanding public-private partnerships as well as encouraging the participation of Korean nationals in nation branding activities.\nStructure\nThe council was led by its second chairperson, Lee Bae-yong from September 28, 2010.
