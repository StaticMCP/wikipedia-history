At the age of 16, she joined the National Youth Theatre of Wales and went on to study at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. Before graduating, Stewart had already appeared in the  BBC One medical drama Casualty (2007), as well as the films Hearts of Gold (2003) and Crusade in Jeans (2006).\nCareer\nIn 2011, she joined the main cast of the Sky One comedy series Stella (2012–2017), portraying Emma Morris, the \"sweet, loving and funny\" daughter of Ruth Jones' titular character.\nIn 2012, Stewart took on the leading role of Juliet in Headlong's production of Romeo and Juliet. Kate Kellaway of The Observer called her performance \"one of the most captivating and touching [she has] seen.\" The following year, she made her London theatre debut in Longing at the Hampstead Theatre, playing opposite Tamsin Greig and Iain Glen.\nIn 2015, she starred in , a twisty thriller from director Euros Lyn. The film won the Best Performance in a British Feature Film award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, becoming the first Welsh-language film to do so.
