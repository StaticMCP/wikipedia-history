Historically, it was allocated to Spain during a colonial exchange with Portugal in November 26, 1778, in the Treaty of El Pardo, and later became part of Equatorial Guinea following its independence in 1968.\nFrom about 1700 to at least 1885, the inhabitants of Annobón were completely autonomous in political terms. There was virtually no European presence\non the island for more than a century and Europeans had no significant impact on their lives.\nDespite its location, Annobón is one of the country's smallest and most remote provinces, with limited access to electricity and water. The island is also home to a population of about 5,000 people, many of whom speak ''Fa d'Ambô'', a Portuguese creole, though Spanish is the official language.\nA cholera epidemic in the 1970s killed a third of the population, and in the 1980s, President Teodoro Obiang's regime permitted a British firm to dump toxic waste on the island, which led discontent over the years.\nIndependence Movement\n1993 Uprising\nIn August 1993, an uprising on Annobón sought to challenge president Teodoro Obiang's regime. The protests were suppressed, as the government viewed them as a direct affront to Obiang, and the authorities took down any disagreement with force.\nDeclaration of Independence, 2022\nIn July 8, 2022, two of the youths involved in the 1993 protests, Orlando Cartagena Lagar and others, declared Annobón's independence under the banner of Ambô Legadu, a separatist group they had founded in Spain. Lagar assumed the role of prime minister of the self-declared republic. This declaration was faced with many arrests on the island.\n2024 Annobón raids\nIn July 2024, the government launched a series of raids on Annobón. 16 activists sent a letter to the government demanding an end to harmful mining practices on the island. In retaliation, soldiers arrested the signatories and dozens of other activists, shutting down internet services in an attempt to suppress their communication and protest. Many of those detained were sent to mainland prisons under harsh conditions.\n}}\n2025 March Protests\nIn February 2025, a ship from Equatorial Guinea arrived at Annobón, carrying soldiers, civilians, and families.\nAs of March 2025, the people of Annobón are planning a peaceful rally in Madrid to deliver the \"Manifesto for the Self-Determination and Emancipation of Annobón\" to Spanish authorities.\nInternational Recognition\nIn May 11, 2024, the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) announced the official acceptance of the Republic of Annobón as its newest member.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
