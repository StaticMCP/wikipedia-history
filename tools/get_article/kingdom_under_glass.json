It was published by Henry Holt in 2010.\nKingdom Under Glass is the biography of Carl Akeley, the American taxidermist, explorer, and creator of the African Hall in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.\nKirk first came up with the idea of writing Akeley’s biography when researching a piece he wrote about panthers for Harper’s Magazine, saying in an interview that the paradoxical nature of Akeley’s character and job (“he killed animals in order to save them”) was what most appealed to him in writing the biography.\nThe Washington Post reviewed Kingdom Under Glass, praising Kirk’s talent and the book’s “daring” narrative. Kirk was featured talking about Kingdom Under Glass on NPR’s All Things Considered podcast. SFGate calls Kingdom Under Glass “an epic display of one man’s life”, while Kirkus says the book narrates the “feral escapades of a creative wunderkind stitched together with novelistic zeal\".\nThe documentary [http://www.stuffedfilm.com/ Stuffed], featured at 2019’s SXSW conference, features Kirk talking about Akeley and Kingdom Under Glass.\nReferences"
