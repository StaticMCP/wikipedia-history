Together with the ships' crews the expedition consisted of 445 men, of whom 183 were scheduled for wintering.\nThe tasks of the expedition were:\n# Relief of the 1956–1958 continental expedition and continuation of the IGY programme\n# Organisation of the Sovetskaya station at the pole of relative inaccessibility\n# Continuation of tractor-sledge traverses in central Antarctica\n# Oceanographic work on the Ob in the southern oceans, and cartography of the coast from Mirny to the Bellingshausen sea\nThe programme included 6 stations: (Mirny; Vostok; Sovetskaya; Oasis; Pionerskaya and Komsomol'skaya).\nThe first tractor-train to the interior left on 26 December, with 32 men. On 2 January 1958 the train arrived at Pionerskaya, and left again on the 8th. On the 17th they reached Komsomol'skaya; conditions of travel were difficult. A portion of the train (7 tractors and sledges) left on the 20th to relieve Vostok, arriving on the 27th, and delivering over 100 tons of cargo.
