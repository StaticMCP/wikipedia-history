The Warriors entered the season as the two-time defending NBA champions, having won back-to-back NBA championships. The Warriors attempted their first \"three-peat\" in franchise history, but were defeated by the Toronto Raptors in the 2019 NBA Finals.  This was the Warriors' final season at Oracle Arena in Oakland, before moving to the new Chase Center in San Francisco, beginning with the 2019–20 NBA season. The Warriors won the Pacific Division title and Western Conference Championship for the fifth consecutive season. They finished with the best record in the Western Conference, with a record of . Golden State made the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season, a new franchise record. The previous record was six, in the team's first six years of existence between 1947 and 1952. Golden State recorded 50 wins for the sixth consecutive season, a franchise record.}} The Warriors playoff run was riddled with injuries, with DeMarcus Cousins (quadricep tear in the first round), Stephen Curry (dislocated finger in the semi-finals), Kevin Durant (calf strain in the semi-finals, ruptured achilles in the finals), Andre Iguodala (calf strain in the Western Conference finals), Klay Thompson (hamstring strain and a torn ACL in the finals), and Kevon Looney (fractured collar bone in the finals) all missing a combined total of 26 games.\nThompson broke the NBA record for three-pointers made in a game with 14, surpassing the 13 made by teammate Curry in the 2016–17 season. Curry broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in the playoffs with 470. The record was held by Ray Allen, who had 385. This season Curry also moved into third on the all-time career three-point scoring list with 2,483; only Allen and Reggie Miller having made more three-pointers during the regular season in NBA history. Curry, Durant, and Thompson were all named to the All-Star Game. Durant was named MVP of the game, the fourth time a Warrior player has won the award and first since 1967. Curry and Durant were named to the All-NBA Team. Green and Thompson were named to All-Defensive Team, it was Green's fifth consecutive selection which tied Nate Thurmond for the most selections in franchise history. With the addition of free agent DeMarcus Cousins in the off-season, the Warriors had five All-Stars on their roster that were named to the 2018 All-Star Game. This is the sixth time in NBA history a team has had five All-Stars from the previous season, and the first since the Boston Celtics in 1976. From November 15 to 21, the Warriors lost four games in a row for the first time since the 2012–13 season, and for the first time under the tenure of Steve Kerr.\nFollowing the season, Durant signed with the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent, Iguodala was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, Cousins signed with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent, and Shaun Livingston retired.\nDraft\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\";\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\";\" width=\"10%\"| Pick\n! style=\";\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\";\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\";\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\";\" width=\"20%\"| School / club team\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 28\n| Jacob Evans\n| SG\n|\n| Cincinnati\n|}\nRoster\nRecords\nset an NBA record for most three-pointers made in a game with fourteen.]]  set the all-time NBA record for most three-pointers made in the playoffs with 470.]]\nNBA records\nIndividual\nRegular season\n* Most three-pointers made in game: 14 (Klay Thompson, vs Chicago Bulls on October 29, 2018\n* Most games with 10+ three-pointers in a season: 6, (Stephen Curry, up to and including game against Minnesota Timberwolves on March 29, 2019.
