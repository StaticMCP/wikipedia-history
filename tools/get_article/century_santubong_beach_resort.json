The property was founded by Santubong (Kuching) Resort Sdn. Bhd. and began operations in 31 August 1993, several years after the completion of the Santubong Bridge in 1987, which contributed to the growth of tourism in the area alongside Damai Beach Resort.\nOne Hotel Santubong Kuching Resort was officiated by Malaysia’s forth and seventh former prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad. It was established as a three-star hotel offering five-star service standards, with the aim of encouraging domestic tourism and attracting international visitors.\nBefore 2016, the resort’s architecture incorporated traditional Borneo-inspired design elements. Following its acquisition by Century Four Points Sdn. Bhd., the property was rebranded as Century Santubong Beach Resort and underwent renovations that introduced a more modern appearance.\nIn the late 2010s, the resort ceased operations, reportedly due to management issues, leading to its quiet closure.\nReferences"
