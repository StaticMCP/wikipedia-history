It flourished as an industry from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century until the use of concrete block supplanted it as a building material, after it was introduced in 1915.\nStonehooking was unique to the north shores of Lake Ontario, from Coburg to Burlington.  Stonehooking fleets were found at ports in Frenchman's Bay, Port Credit, Oakville, and Bronte.  During the heyday of the stonehooking industry, in the late 1800's, as many as thirty schooners operated out of Port Credit.  In Toronto Harbour, an estimated  was removed by the industry.\nSpecialized schooners known as stonehookers would anchor close to shore.  A small skiff, yawl boat or scow would be sent out to gather the stone.  This was accomplished using long rakes with hooks at the end to pry up slabs of stone which would be piled on the smaller vessel.  The stone would then be loaded on the schooner's deck until full, before crews set sail for a market destination to unload. Toronto was the largest market for stonehookers, with most stone loads destined for Toronto Harbour and the Queen's City Wharf.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://corporate.pickering.ca/PLHCWebLink/ElectronicFile.aspx?docid=166903&dbid=0 Image of stonehooking off Bronte]"
