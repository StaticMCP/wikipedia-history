The battle ended in a decisive Kalhora victory and the devastation of much of Kutch.\nBattle\nMian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro of Sindh led a large-scale campaign into Kutch, commanding around 80,000 soldiers. Following a brief yet fierce battle near Jara, his forces overcame the Cutch defenders the  Maratha-aligned tributaries. The Sindhi army swept through the region, causing extensive destruction and seizing a considerable portion of its territory.After the defeat near Jara, Ghulam Shah Kalhoro advanced toward Tera, imposing heavy fines and ravaging the region. Alarmed, the Rao sought reconciliation through Punja, admitting past misjudgments and offering to appoint him as minister if he could negotiate the Sindhi army’s withdrawal. Punja, regaining influence at Bhuj, convinced Ghulam Shah to retreat by warning of strong fortifications ahead and promising to finalize a marriage alliance. Ghulam Shah agreed, departing with Punja’s son as a hostage. Punja returned to Bhuj, assumed office, and stabilized control by dismissing external forces and conducting campaigns in Vagad. However, the promised marriage was never fulfilled, straining relations between Punja and the Rao. Eventually, the Rao had Punja imprisoned, held in irons, and forced to drink poison, ending his service.\nAftermath\nThe victory greatly increased Kalhora influence over western India. Much of Kutch was laid waste, and a political marriage was arranged — the cousin of Godji II was given in marriage to Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro.\nSindhi forces also carried out two more raids into Kutch in the years following the battle.\nSee also\n* Kalhora dynasty\n* History of Sindh\n* History of Kutch\nReferences"
