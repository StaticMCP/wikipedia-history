During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 22 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Howard W. Koch and directed by Marty Pasetta. Comedian and talk show host Johnny Carson hosted the show for the fourth consecutive time.\nChariots of Fire won four awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Raiders of the Lost Ark with five awards, On Golden Pond and Reds with three, Arthur with two; and An American Werewolf in London, Close Harmony, Crac, Genocide, Mephisto, and Violet with one. The telecast garnered 46.2 million viewers in the United States.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 54th Academy Awards were announced on February 11, 1982, by Academy president Fay Kanin and actor Lloyd Bridges. Reds earned the most nominations with twelve; On Golden Pond came in second with ten.  The winners were announced at the awards ceremony on March 29.\nBest Director winner Warren Beatty became the first person to earn acting, directing, producing, and screenwriting nominations for the same film for the second time. He previously earned nominations in the same categories for 1978's Heaven Can Wait. On Golden Pond was the fifth film to win both lead acting awards. Best Actress winner Katharine Hepburn became the first and only performer to win four competitive acting Oscars. Furthermore, the 48-year span between her first win for 1933's Morning Glory and her last win for On Golden Pond set the record for the longest span between first and last career Oscar wins.\nAwards\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| role=\"presentation\" class=wikitable\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n|Best Picture}}\n*'Chariots of Fire – David Puttnam, producer'\n**Atlantic City – Denis Héroux and John Kemeny, producers\n**On Golden Pond – Bruce Gilbert, producer\n**Raiders of the Lost Ark – Frank Marshall, producer\n**Reds – Warren Beatty, producer\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n|Best Directing}}\n*'Warren Beatty – Reds'\n**Louis Malle – Atlantic City\n**Hugh Hudson – Chariots of Fire\n**Mark Rydell – On Golden Pond\n**Steven Spielberg – Raiders of the Lost Ark\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n|Best Actor in a Leading Role}}\n*'Henry Fonda – On Golden Pond as Norman Thayer Jr.'\n**Warren Beatty – Reds as John Silas \"Jack\" Reed\n**Burt Lancaster – Atlantic City as Lou Pascal\n**Dudley Moore – Arthur as Arthur Bach\n**Paul Newman – Absence of Malice as Michael Gallagher\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n|Best Actress in a Leading Role}}\n*'Katharine Hepburn – On Golden Pond as Ethel Thayer'\n**Diane Keaton – Reds as Louise Bryant\n**Marsha Mason – Only When I Laugh as Georgia Hines\n**Susan Sarandon – Atlantic City as Sally Matthews\n**Meryl Streep – ''The French Lieutenant's Woman as Sarah Woodruff/Anna\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n|Best Actor in a Supporting Role}}\n*'John Gielgud – Arthur as Hobson'\n**James Coco – Only When I Laugh as Jimmy Perrino\n**Ian Holm – Chariots of Fire as Sam Mussabini\n**Jack Nicholson – Reds'' as Eugene O'Neill\n**Howard E.

In February 1982, Howard W. Koch took over producing duties after Frank had been hospitalized for complications stemming from a virus. Koch stated that all artistic contributions made by Frank would remain during the production of the festivities.\nIntroduction of Best Makeup award\nBeginning with this ceremony, AMPAS introduced a new competitive award that would honor achievement in makeup. According to Academy executive administrator John Pavlik, the category would be presented if a special committee composed of makeup artists, hairstylists, cinematographers, and other related craftspeople determined that at least one film was deemed worthy of such awards. Members would be able to nominate up to five films, and the committee would review the seven films receiving the most votes to select up to three nominees. Prior to the introduction of this category, 1964's 7 Faces of Dr. Lao and 1968's Planet of the Apes were given special honorary awards.\nCritical reviews\nSt. Petersburg Times film critic Thomas Sabulis wrote, \"The Academy Awards show was a reasonably good television product. The acceptance speeches were thankfully brief and concise.\" Columnist Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked, \"Thanks largely to the fancifulness of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' voters, Monday night's Oscar presentation was the most exciting in recent years. When the awards show itself is something less than swift or glamorous, which was certainly the case this year, it can still come to life if the voting takes a sufficiently strange turn.\" The Atlanta Constitution critic Scott Cain commented, \"The academy has steadily increased the amount of showpieces. These musical numbers worked splendidly this year and the program was relatively painless at 3.5 hours in length.\"\nHarold Schindler of The Salt Lake Tribune called the ceremony \"a three-and-a-half-hour marathon which sparkled in spots, sputtered in others, and featured some of the most uneven casting in the program's history.\" Austin American-Statesman film critic Patrick Taggart quipped, \"Whether or not the awards will be taken more seriously in the future, the ceremony last Monday night certainly had the dreariness one associates with serious events.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Desmond Ryan commented that due to many winners being absent from the festivities, \"An already dull evening lapsed into long stretches of tedium.\"\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 46.2 million people over the length of the entire ceremony. Moreover, the show drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony, with 33.6% of households watching with a 53% share.\nIn August 1982, the ceremony presentation received three nominations at the 34th Primetime Emmys. The following month, it won an award for Ray Klausen's art direction of the program.\nSee also\n* List of submissions to the 54th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.oscar.com/ Academy Awards official website]\n* [http://www.oscars.org/ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/oscars Oscars' channel]  on YouTube run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n;Analysis\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/aa81.html 1981 Academy Awards Winners and History]  Filmsite\n;Other resources\n*"
