It is applicable to fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\nThe legislation is named in reference to the World War II era Lend-Lease program that supplied US allies in the fight against the Axis powers and is credited with being a deciding factor in the war.\nPassage of legislation\nThe bill was passed unanimously in the US Senate on April 6, 2022, and passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 417–10 on April 28, 2022.\nThe ten representatives, all from the Republican Party, who voted against the bill were: Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Warren Davidson of Ohio, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin.\nPresident Joe Biden signed the bill into law on May 9, 2022, Soviet Victory Day, a date which was seen as a \"rejoinder to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has seized on Victory in Europe Day – the anniversary of Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945 and Russia's biggest patriotic holiday – to rally his people behind the invasion.\"\nText\nLack of use and 2023 expiry\nUkrainian diplomats lobbied for extension of the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act beyond 2023, but it expired on September 30, 2023. No weapons were ever delivered to Ukraine under the terms of the act. Instead, three other American budget programs were used to supply materiel to Ukraine: the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, Foreign Military Financing, and Presidential Drawdown Authority.\nSenator John Cornyn, who introduced the initial bill, attempted to reauthorize the act in April 2024 with cosponsorships from fellow Republican Tim Scott and Democrats Chris Coons and Jeanne Shaheen. Their proposal would have extended the act's power through 2026, waived a five-year cap on defense lending to allies, and removed the need of a presidential declaration of emergency to give military aid to \"countries impacted by Russian agression\". However, the bill was not passed and the 2025 defense budget did not include mention of the Lend-Lease Act.\nSee also\n*\n* List of foreign aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/118?link-type=uslm Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022] ([https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/117/public/118?link-type=pdf PDF]) as enacted in the US Statutes at Large\n*[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3522 S.3522 Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022] on Congress.gov"
