      "text": "# Battle Riot IV\n\nBattle Riot IV was a professional wrestling supercard event produced by Major League Wrestling (MLW) that took place on June 23, 2022 at the Melrose Ballroom in New York City. It was the fourth event under the Battle Riot chronology.\nMatches from the event were taped for future MLW programming; the main card aired as a television special on November 3, 2022 on Pro Wrestling TV (PWTV), while the undercard would air as part of the new season of MLW Fusion that premiered on November 10.\nProduction\nBackground\nBattle Riot is a recurring event that was established by MLW in 2018. The event is named after the Battle Riot match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner. The match begins with a number of participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by either pin, submission, or going over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor. The declared winner of the Battle Riot match receives a future title shot for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship. On March 19, 2022, it was announced that Battle Riot IV would take place on June 23, 2022 at the Melrose Ballroom in New York City.\nStorylines\nThe show feature several professional wrestling matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main feature of the event is the titular Battle Riot match, a 40-man rumble rules-based match where the winner will receive a \"golden ticket\", which they can redeem for an MLW World Heavyweight Championship match anytime and anywhere. On the May 19 episode of Fusion, MLW announced the first five participants in the Battle Riot: Lince Dorado, Marshall Von Erich, Alex Kane, Calvin Tankman, and Killer Kross. The week after that, the field included EJ Nduka, Jacob Fatu, Mini Abismo Negro Budd Heavy, Matt Cross, and Ross Von Erich. Bandido, KC Navarro, Lance Anoa'i, Juicy Finau, and Richard Holliday were announced on June 2. On June 9, names announced included Real1, Davey Richards, Little Guido, Ace Romero, Savio Vega, and Los Maximos (Joel and Jose). O the June 16 Fusion, Mads Krügger, Myron Reed, Ken Broadway, Warhorse, and Microman entered the match. On June 23, Gangrel, Arez, Mr. Thomas, and Dr. Dax were added to the match.\nThrough MLW's \"Open Door Policy\", several free agents will be announced for the event. Scarlett Bordeaux was announced on June 2. On June 13, Dragon Gate's La Estrella was announced as a participant in the Battle Riot.\nEvent\nCesar Duran opened the show by calling out MLW World Heavyweight Championship Alexander Hammerstone. After Hammerstone beat Duran's security, Richard Holliday appeared to laid him out with a chair. Duran then made a rematch between the two for later that night, but under falls count anywhere rules.\nBoth Bandido, Hammerstone's originally intended challenger, and Marshall and Ross Von Erich did not appear due to injuries.\nThe main event, the titular \"Battle Riot\", saw the returns of Mance Warner, after previous contractual issues that included him asking for his release in December 2020, among others. Former NXT superstar Parker Boudreaux also made his debut in the promotion during the match.\nResults\n|times=\n|match1 = Alexander Hammerstone defeated Los Aztecas (Uno and Cinco) (with Cesar Duran) by pinfall\n|stip1 = 2-on-1 Handicap match\n|time1 = 0:38\n|match2= KC Navarro defeated Mini Abismo Negro by pinfall\n|stip2= Singles match\n|time2= 4:04\n|match3 = Jacob Fatu defeated Real1 by disqualification\n|stip3 = Singles match\n|time3 = 2:01\n|match4 = Davey Richards defeated Alex Kane (c) (with Mr. Thomas) by pinfall\n|stip4 = Singles match for the MLW National Openweight Championship\n|time4 = 12:52\n|match5= Scarlett Bordeaux defeated Clara Carreras by pinfall\n|stip5= Singles match\n|time5= 1:47\n|match6 = Alexander Hammerstone (c) defeated Richard Holliday (with Cesar Duran) via submission\n|stip6 = Falls Count Anywhere match for the MLW World Heavyweight Championship\n|time6 = 21:55\n|match7 = Myron Reed (c) (with  Mr. Thomas) defeated Arez, Lince Dorado and La Estrella by pinfall\n|stip7 = Four-way match for the MLW World Middleweight Championship\n|time7 = 6:54\n|match8 =The Samoan SWAT Team (Juicy Finau and Lance Anoa'i) (with Jacob Fatu) defeated Los Maximos (Joel and Jose) by pinfall\n|stip8 = Tag team match\n|time8 = 3:14\n|match9 = Killer Kross (with Scarlett Bordeaux) defeated Matt Cross by pinfall\n|stip9 = Singles match\n|time9 = 4:38\n|match10 = Taya Valkyrie (c) defeated Brittany Blake via submission\n|stip10 = Singles match for the MLW Women's Featherweight Championship\n|time10 = 6:50\n|match11= Jacob Fatu won by last eliminating Real1\n|stip11= 40-man Battle Riot match for a future MLW World Heavyweight Championship match\n|time11= 48:52\n}}\nBattle Riot match entrances and eliminations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Draw\n!Entrant\n!Order\n!Eliminated by\n!Method of elimination\n!Elimination(s)\n|-\n|1||EJ Nduka||3||Arez and Lince Dorado||Over the top rope||2\n|-\n|2||Calvin Tankman||2||EJ Nduka||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|3||Mr. Thomas||1||EJ Nduka||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|4||Lince Dorado||12||Killer Kross||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|5||Arez||6||Killer Kross||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|6||Micro Man||8||Real1||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|7||Mini Abismo Negro||7||Sami Callihan||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|8||La Estrella||9||Sami Callihan||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|9||KC Navarro||20||Rickey Shane Page||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|10||Kim Chee||4||Joel Maximo||Submission||0\n|-\n|11||Joel Maximo||5||Killer Kross||Pinfall||1\n|-\n|12||Killer Kross||38||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||5\n|-\n|13||Sami Callihan||37||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||5\n|-\n|14||Real1||39||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||6\n|-\n|15||Gangrel||15||Killer Kross||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|16||Kwang The Ninja||11||Killer Kross||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|17||Budd Heavy||10||Real1||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|18||Little Guido||14||Davey Richards||Submission||0\n|-\n|19||Jose Maximo||13||Homicide||Pinfall||0\n|-\n|20||Davey Richards||33||Real1 and Sami Callihan||Over the top rope||3\n|-\n|21||Lance Anoa'i||19||Real1||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|22||Ken Broadway||16||Sami Callihan||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|23||Homicide||17||Lance Anoa'i||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|24||Rickey Shane Page||28||Mads Krügger||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|25||Juicy Finau||24||Real1||Over the top rope||1\n|-\n|26||Los Azteca 80||18||Juicy Finau||Pinfall||0\n|-\n|27||Dr. Dax||21||Jacob Fatu||Pinfall||0\n|-\n|-style=\"background: gold\"\n|28||Jacob Fatu||&ndash;||Winner||&ndash;||8\n|-\n|29||Mads Krügger||35\n||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||4\n|-\n|30||Wil Maximo||22||Mads Krügger||Pinfall||0\n|-\n|31||Warhorse||27||Mads Krügger||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|32||Myron Reed||29||Davey Richards||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|33||Los Azteca 33||23||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|34||Los Azteca 22||25||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|35||Matt Cross||26||Jacob Fatu||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|36||Mance Warner||34||Mads Krügger||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|37||Alex Kane||30||Davey Richards||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|38||Savio Vega||31||Real1||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|39||Taya Valkyrie||32||Parker Boudreaux||Over the top rope||0\n|-\n|40||Parker Boudreaux||36||Killer Kross and Sami Callihan||Over the top rope||1\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
