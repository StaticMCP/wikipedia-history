The Webby Awards have been dubbed the \"internet's highest honor\".\n1996\nIn 1996 the Association for Computing Machinery awarded an \"ACM Student Webbie Prize\"; this was expected to be repeated in subsequent years but was not.  This ACM Webbie Prize is not related to the Webby Awards which began the following year but may be easily confused with them.  The 1996 prize was awarded for the concept of a \"web mediator\".\n1997\n1997 was the first year of the annual Webby Award event, which was the first-ever nationally televised awards ceremony devoted to the Internet. 700 people attended the event on March 6, 1997 at Bimbo's Night Club in San Francisco, California  Whereas in later years the panelists were official members of International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, in 1997 the awards were chosen and given by IDG's The Web Magazine, which appointed a panel to judge the competition.\n1998\nThe 1998 Webby Awards were held on March 6, 1998 at the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts, and were the first event ever to be broadcast live via the Web in 3D.  The \"People's Voice\" awards, chosen by online poll, received 100,000 cumulative votes that year. The 1998 awards were sponsored by PC World Communications, the San Francisco Chronicle and other organizations. ABC News was the official website to \"cybercast\" the awards.\nThe Web magazine, which was hosting the awards, was closed down by its parent company IDG shortly before the awards, and the ceremony continued thereafter under the management of Tiffany Shlain, who IDG had hired in 1996 to coordinate the awards.  The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences was constituted that year as the judging panel for the awards, continues to do so as of the 2007 awards.\n1999\nThe 1999 Webby Awards were held on March 18, 1999 at the Herbst Theater (War memorial Opera House) in San Francisco, with a post-award party at City Hall.\nThat year, Mayor Rudy Giuliani lobbied to move the ceremony to New York City, but San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown convinced the organization to remain in San Francisco by promising city support. Brown gave a speech at the ceremony and Marc Maron was the master of ceremonies.  The event was noted for the famous incident in which a representative of Jodi.org, which had won in the arts category, called the event participants \"Ugly corporate sons-of-bitches\" in his acceptance speech and tossed his trophy to the audience.  In 1999 the Webby Awards asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to help it tabulate and ensure security for the \"People's Voice\" winners, chosen by online voting.\n2000\n}}\nThe 2000 awards were the first time that organization requested submissions. Previously, nominees had been selected by an internal committee. The organization gave out awards in 27 categories voted on by a 350 member judges.\n2001\n2002\n2003\nThis year marked the first year the awards show was broadcast online, and it lasted 20 minutes. The organization provided 30 awards. NASA and eBay won the most honors.\n2004\n2005\nHonorees at 9th Annual Webby Awards included:\n*Webby Lifetime Achievement Award: Former Vice President Al Gore in recognition of the role he played in
