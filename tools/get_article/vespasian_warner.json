He returned to Illinois the same year to practice law in his hometown of Clinton, Illinois. His law partner was his father-in-law, Clifton H. Moore.\nWarner was elected as a Republican to the Fifty-fourth and to the four succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1895 – March 3, 1905).\nHe served as chairman of the Committee on Revision of the Laws (Fifty-fifth through Fifty-eighth Congresses).\nIn 1904, Warner ran for Governor of Illinois as a Republican, but he failed to win his party's nomination. The Republican nominee Charles S. Deneen won the general election.  After the election, President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Warner for the job of United States Commissioner of Pensions, heading an agency within the Department of the Interior which was roughly equivalent to today's Department of Veterans Affairs. Warner served from March 4, 1905, until November 25, 1909.\nHe engaged in business in Clinton, Illinois, as a banker and realty owner and agent. He died in Clinton on March 31, 1925. He was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery.\nVespasian Warner Public Library District\nWarner's father-in-law, Clifton H. Moore, was an avid book collector. When Moore died in 1901, he left his collection of books to the city of Clinton, provided a proper library could be constructed to house it. In 1906, Warner donated $25,000 and a plot of land to the city for a public library. The Vespasian Warner Public Library opened to the public in 1908 and continues operation to this day.\nReferences\n[1] Vespasian Warner Public Library District Our History http://www.vwarner.org/about-us\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.vwarner.org/ Vespasian Warner Public Library]"
