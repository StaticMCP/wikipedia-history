It was amalgamated into the locality of Longreach.\nHistory\nIn the , Tocal had a population of 14 people.\nIn January 2019, it was decided to reduce the number of localities within Longreach Region by amalgamating the localities to the north and west of the town of Longreach into the locality of Longreach. The localities amalgamated were: Camoola, Chorregon, Ernestina, Maneroo, Morella, Tocal, and Vergemont. As a consequence of this amalgamation, the Longreach Region has only three localities: Longreach, Ilframcombe and Isisford.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.dnrme.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/1278201/17050-qpn1380-proposal.pdf Map of Tocal prior to the 2019 amalgamation] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20190728202640/https://www.dnrme.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/1278201/17050-qpn1380-proposal.pdf archived] on 28 July 2019)"
