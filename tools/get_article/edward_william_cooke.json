He was a precocious draughtsman and a skilled engraver from an early age, displayed an equal preference for marine subjects (in special in sailing ships) and published his \"Shipping and Craft\" – a series of accomplished engravings – when he was 18, in 1829. He benefited from the advice of many of his father's associates, notably Clarkson Stanfield (whose principal marine follower he became) and David Roberts. Cooke began painting in oils in 1833, took formal lessons from James Stark in 1834 and first exhibited at the Royal Academy and British Institution in 1835, by which time his style was essentially formed.\n, Edward William Cooke]]\nRemarkably of his few drawings of ships, boats, and coastal views appear in the childhood albums of Edward William Cooke since age of four. Many of his earlier drawings are seemed to favor Dutch pastoral landscapes and animal subjects. Numerous of his drawings are influenced by Nicolaes Berghem [Berchem], Paulus Potter, or Karel Dujardin.\nHe went on to travel and paint with great industry at home and abroad, indulging his love of the 17th-century Dutch marine artists with a visit to the Netherlands in 1837. He returned regularly over the next 23 years, studying the effects of the coastal landscape and light, as well as the works of the country's Old Masters, resulting in highly successful paintings. These included 'Beaching a Pink at Scheveningen' (National Maritime Museum, London), which he exhibited in 1855 at the Royal Academy, of which he was an Associate from 1851. He went on to travel in Scandinavia, Spain, North Africa and, above all, to Venice. In 1858, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.\nCooke was \"particularly attracted by the Isle of Wight, and on his formative visit of 1835 he made a thorough study of its fishing boats and lobster pots; above all he delighted in the beaches strewn with rocks of various kinds, fishing tackle, breakwaters and small timber-propped jetties.\"\nHe also had serious natural history and geological interests, being a Fellow of the Linnean Society, Fellow of the Geological Society and Fellow of the Zoological Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries. In the 1840s he helped his friend, the horticulturist, James Bateman fit out and design the gardens at Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire, in particular the orchids and rhododendrons. His geological interests in particular led to his election as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1863 and he became a Royal Academician the following year.\nIn 1842 John Edward Gray named a species of boa, Corallus cookii, in Cooke's honor.\nIn January 1864, Cooke donated £200 to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) towards the provision of a lifeboat at  in Kent. The first boat to be stationed there, in service from 1865 to 1887, was named Van Kook at his request.\nGallery\nFile:Hay Barge off Greenwich RMG BHC4165.tiff|Hay Barge off Greenwich, 1835\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Lobster Pots, Ventnor - FA.39(O) - Victoria and Albert Museum.jpg|Lobster Pots, Ventnor, 1835\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - The Antiquary's Cell - FA.42(O) - Victoria and Albert Museum.jpg|''The Antiquary's Cell, 1835\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Old Hastings - FA.46(O) - Victoria and Albert Museum.jpg|Old Hastings, 1835\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Portsmouth Harbour, The Hulks - FA.45(O) - Victoria and Albert Museum.jpg|Portsmouth Harbour, The Hulks, 1836\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Mending the Bait-Nets, Shanklin - FA.40(O) - Victoria and Albert Museum.jpg|Mending the Bait-Nets, Shanklin, 1836\nFile:Semaphore at Portsmouth RMG BHC1919.tiff|Semaphore at Portsmouth, 1836\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Brighton Sands - FA.41(O) - Victoria and Albert Museum.jpg|Brighton Sands, 1837\nFile:Vessels on the Sands at Hastings.jpeg|Vessels on the Sands at Hastings, 1837\nFile:Cooke, Edward William - Mont Saint-Michel, Normandie.jpg|Mont Saint Michel, Normandy, 1838\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Off the Port of Havre - 0223-1901 - Bury Art Museum.jpg|Off the Port of Havre, 1840\nFile:Mont St Michel-Shrimpers.png|Mont St Michel Shrimpers, 1842\nFile:Dutch Yachting on the Zuider Zee RMG BHC1249.tiff|Dutch Yachting on the Zuider Zee, 1848\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Off the Coast of Leghorn - 1931-019 - Cartwright Hall Art Gallery.jpg|Off the Coast of Leghorn, 1848\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Salerno, Italy - 653 - Guildhall Art Gallery.jpg|Salerno, Italy, 1849\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - San Giorgio Maggiore and the Salute, Venice, with Fishing Craft of Chioggia and the Lagoon - 1230225 - National Trust.jpg|San Giorgio Maggiore and the Salute, Venice, 1852\nFile:Morning After a Heavy Gale.png|Morning After a Heavy Gale, 1857\nFile:Bridge of Sighs (Cooke).jpg|Bridge of Sighs, Venice, 1858\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Scheveningen Pincks off the Coast of Yarmouth - 03-1329 - Royal Academy of Arts.jpg|Scheveningen Pincks off the Coast of Yarmouth, 1864\nFile:Edward William Cooke (1811-1880) - Canal of the Giudecca, Venice - N01780 - National Gallery.jpg|Canal of the Giudecca, Venice, 1867\nFile:French Sloop Entering the Harbour of Tréport.png|French Sloop Entering the Harbour of Tréport, 1869\nPublications\n* Cooke, E.W.
