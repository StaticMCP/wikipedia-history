It is found only in the Philippines in the Cordillera Mountain Range of northern Luzon. It is found in tropical montane forest.\nDescription and taxonomy\nEBird describes the bird as \"A small drab bird of dense undergrowth within open montane forest in northern Luzon. Warm brown on the upper parts and crown with a dark eye-stripe and pale brown underparts blending to a pale gray chest and whitish throat. Similar to Long-tailed bush warbler, but tail shorter and underparts grayish rather than deep brown. Also similar to Benguet bush warbler, but has a more distinct pale eyebrow. Song consists of a drawn-out low whistle followed by an explosive whistled phrase. Call is a sharp 'tsik!\nThis species was once conspecific with the Japanese bush warbler and differs vocally, through its smaller size, deeper rufous upper back, darker lores and grayer\nEcology and behavior\nPresumed to feed on small invertebrates. Typically seen alone foraging in low dense vegetation. This species is very vocal while remaining hidden in the thickets.\nBirds in breeding condition with enlarged gonads collected in April. Juveniles have been seen from May to July but otherwise no other information on this species breeding habits.\nHabitat and conservation status\nIt is found in tropical montane pine forests above 800 meters in elevation. It is typically found in the understory and low thickets in the forest strata. Little else is known about this bird.\nIUCN has assessed this bird as least-concern with the population believed to be stable but more surveys are needed to determine the actual population health and distribution of the species.\nReferences"
