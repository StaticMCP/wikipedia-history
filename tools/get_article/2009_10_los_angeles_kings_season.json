For the first time since the 2001–02 NHL season, the Kings qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs.\nPreseason\nThe Kings were busy at the 2009 NHL entry draft, making five trades. The Kings chose Brayden Schenn as their first-round pick, fifth overall. The Kings finished the pre-season with a record of 4–3–1.  Defenseman Sean O'Donnell received a five-game suspension during the preseason after an incident involving New York Islanders forward Matt Martin. O'Donnell missed the final three pre-season games, and will miss the first two games of the regular season.\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#393997; color:#FFFFFF;\" | 2009 Pre-season game log: 4–3–1 (Home: 2–0–0; Road: 0–3–0; Neutral: 2–0–1)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n| # || Date || Visitor || Score || Home || OT || Decision || Attendance || Record || Recap\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ccffcc\n| 1 || September 15 || Phoenix Coyotes || Won 4–3 || Los Angeles Kings || || Jonathan Bernier (1–0–0) || 8,432 || 1–0–0 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/boxscore.htm?id=2009010005]\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ffcccc\n| 2 || September 15 || Los Angeles Kings || Lost 4–2 || Phoenix Coyotes || || Erik Ersberg (0–1–0) || 4,643 || 1–1–0 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009010004]\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3 || September 17 (in Ontario, CA) || San Jose Sharks || Lost 2–1 || Los Angeles Kings || SO || Jonathan Quick (0–0–1) || 6,245 || 1–1–1 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009010023]\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ccffcc\n| 4 || September 19 || Anaheim Ducks || Won 4–1 || Los Angeles Kings || || Jonathan Bernier (2–0–0) || 11,995 || 2–1–1 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009010037]\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ccffcc\n| 5 || September 22 (in Kansas City, MO) || Los Angeles Kings || Won 4–2 || New York Islanders || || Jonathan Quick (1–0–1) || 9,792 || 3–1–1 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009010060]\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ffcccc\n| 6 || September 23 || Los Angeles Kings || Lost 3–2 || Colorado Avalanche || || Erik Ersberg (0–2–0) || || 3–2–1 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009010065]\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ccffcc\n| 7 || September 26 (in Las Vegas, NV) || Colorado Avalanche || Won 5–3 || Los Angeles Kings || || Jonathan Quick (2–0–1) || 11,263 || 4–2–1 || [http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009010091]\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=#ffcccc\n| 8 || September 27 || Los Angeles Kings || Lost 5–4 || Anaheim Ducks || || Jonathan Bernier (2–1–0) || 15,677 || 4–3–1 || [https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175124/http://kings.nhl.com/club/recap.htm?id=2009010095]\n|}\nLuc Robitaille was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 9, 2009.  Robitaille, who currently serves as the President of Business Operations for the Kings, was joined by Brian Leetch, Steve Yzerman, Brett Hull and Lou Lamoriello in this year's class of inductees.\nRegular season\nThe Kings observed a 17-day break in the schedule in February due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.  Five players currently under contract for Los Angeles were selected to represent their countries during the tournament.  Drew Doughty played for Canada, Michal Handzus played for Slovakia, while Dustin Brown, Jack Johnson and Jonathan Quick all represented the United States.\nThe main highlights for the club included them breaking an eight-year playoff absence by qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western Conference.  They finished the season with 101 points, the third highest point total in franchise history.  They also set a franchise record with a nine-game winning streak from January 21 through February 6. They registered two other eight game stretches without a loss.  On the road, they established franchise records for road wins in a season (24), road points (51) and the first ever 5–0–0 record on a five-game trip in franchise history.\nIndividually, goaltender Jonathan Quick established single-season records for victories with 39 and games played with 72.\nDivisional standings\nConference standings\nSchedule and results\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
