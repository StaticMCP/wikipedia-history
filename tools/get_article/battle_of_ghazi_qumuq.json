It marked the final major engagement of Nader's arduous Caucasian campaign, bringing about the submission of most Lezgi chiefs and securing Persian control of the eastern Caucasus before the convocation of the Mughan assembly later that year.\nBackground\nFollowing his victories over the Ottoman Empire in the caucasus, Nader Qoli Beg turned his attention north to Daghestan, whose Lezgin and Avar tribes continued to resist Persian authority. In 1735–1736, he launched a difficult winter campaign through the mountains, determined to crush Sorkhai of Avaria and the other insurgent chieftains. During this campaign, Nader fell ill, probably due to a malarial mosquito bite, yet continued operations in harsh winter conditions. When one particularly strong mountain fortress resisted assault, Nader threatened the Afghan commander Nur Muhammad Khan Alizai and his Abdali lashkars with death if they failed to take it. The Afghans charged the defences, suffering severe losses but eventually stormed and captured the stronghold.\nBattle\nDespite heavy snow and treacherous mountain terrain, Nader pressed forward against the Lazgi positions in the Ghazi Qumuq Valley but was unable to take the Stronghold. Sorkhai had assembled his forces and fortified the surrounding mountaintops, blocking the route of the Persian army. Nader ordered his musketeers to attack the main Lazgi front, while the Afghan contingents were sent to storm the high ground. After intense fighting, the Lazgis were driven from their positions, and Sorkhai was forced to retreat once more into Avaria. Eldar, another Lezgin chief attempting to join him, was defeated en route.\nNader then entered Qumuq, where most of the local chiefs submitted, with the notable exception of Sorkhai, who again fled north. The Usmi Ahmad Khan of Qumuq sent his daughters and son to Nader as hostages in token of submission, while other Lezgi leaders followed suit.\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Ghazi Qumuq broke organized resistance in eastern Daghestan. Although Sorkhai remained at large in Avaria, the region's principal chieftains surrendered. Nader imposed terms requiring the Lazgis of Doquz-Para to provide a thousand horses and send their noble families as hostages. He rewarded loyal allies such as Khass Fulad, allowed compliant chiefs to return home, and dispatched the hostages to Derbent.\nHaving subdued Daghestan, Nader marched south toward the Mughan Plain, where, in the spring of 1736, he was proclaimed Shah of Persia. When the battle ended, Nader asked how they wished to be rewarded. Nur Muhammad Khan requested that, should Nader capture Kandahar, he permit the Abdalis to return from exile and restore the city to the Sadozais. Nader assented to this request.\nReferences"
