He was the father of actor and filmmaker Ron Howard and actor Clint Howard, and grandfather of actresses Bryce Dallas Howard and Paige Howard.\nHoward appeared in films such as Cool Hand Luke (1967), Chinatown (1974), Splash (1984), Ed Wood (1994), Apollo 13 (1995), Independence Day (1996), A Beautiful Mind (2001), Cinderella Man (2005), Frost/Nixon (2008), Nebraska, and Max Rose (both 2013). He received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program for co-producing the television film The Time Crystal (1981).\nEarly life\nHoward was born Harold Engle Beckenholdt in Newkirk, Kay County, Oklahoma, the son of Ethel Cleo (née Tomlin) and Engel Beckenholdt, a farmer. He legally changed his name to \"Rance Howard\" when he became an actor. Howard graduated from Shidler High School in 1946 and studied at the University of Oklahoma.\nWhile in the Air Force, Howard directed plays in Special Services, a unit that provided entertainment for service members.\nCareer\nHis professional acting career began in 1948 when he went to New York City, auditioned, and landed a job in a children's touring company. The role that got him noticed nationally for television and film was playing the part of Lindstrom in the touring company of the play Mister Roberts with Henry Fonda in 1950, portraying the character for about a year-and-a-half in major cities across the U.S.\nBoth Rance and elder son Ron, who was two at the time, made their feature-film debuts together in the 1956 Western Frontier Woman. Later in the 1950s, Rance's roles included his TV debut in the series Kraft Theatre, on which he appeared three times in 1956–57.\nAfter son Ron went on to play Opie in The Andy Griffith Show in the early 1960s, Rance had guest parts in five episodes of the show. Howard was known best for his role on television in 25 episodes of the 1960s TV series Gentle Ben starring his younger son, Clint. Howard played Henry Boomhauer, a backwoodsman who befriended the family. Another well-known TV role was on Babylon 5, in which he had a recurring role as David Sheridan, the father of Babylon 5 captain John Sheridan. He also starred in the short-lived 2000 TV series Driving Me Crazy. His television guest appearances include Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Kung Fu, The Waltons, CBS Schoolbreak Special 1986 episode \"The Drug Knot\", Angel, Married... with Children, 7th Heaven, Cold Case, ''That's So Raven, and two appearances on Seinfeld (as different characters). On The Waltons, Howard portrayed Dr. McIver in five different episodes, one of which included Ron.\nHoward appeared in over 100 films, including the movies The Music Man (1962) (in an uncredited bit part playing \"Oscar Jackson\"), Cool Hand Luke (1967), Chinatown'' (1974), and many other films. Howard acted in many of his son Ron's films including Splash (1984), Cocoon (1985), Apollo 13 (1995), A Beautiful Mind (2001), Cinderella Man (2005) and Frost/Nixon (2008). He also appeared as Dottie and Kit's father in A League of Their Own (1992), as well as in the films Ed Wood (1994), Independence Day (1996) and Max Rose (2013). In 2013, he played Woody Grant's brother in Nebraska. He often took parts as a priest or minister, county sheriff, or western marshal, and made numerous appearances in films by Joe Dante.\nHis final film role, completed in September 2017, is also the largest in his career. He plays the role of Carl Robbins in the Michael Worth road-trip drama, Apple Seed, playing on film for the first time the father of his real-life son Clint.\nPersonal life and death\nHoward married actress Jean Speegle Howard in Winchester, Kentucky, in 1949. They remained married until her death in September 2000. Their sons are actor and filmmaker Ron Howard and actor Clint Howard, their granddaughters are actresses Bryce Dallas Howard and Paige Howard. Ron was born while his father served three years in the United States Air Force.\nIn 2001, Howard married Judy O’Sullivan. Judy Howard died in January 2017 in Burbank, 10 months before Howard's death.\nHoward died on the morning of November 25, 2017, in Los Angeles, California from heart failure spurred on by a West Nile virus infection.\nFilmography\n* Sources:\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1956\n! scope=\"row\" | Frontier Woman\n| Prewitt\n|\n|-\n| 1962\n! scope=\"row\" | The Music Man\n| Oscar Jackson\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Uncredited\n|-\n| 1963\n! scope=\"row\" | ''The Courtship of Eddie's Father\n| Camp Counselor\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1965\n! scope=\"row\" | Village of the Giants\n| Deputy\n| Son Ron also starred\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Desert Raven\n| Reggie\n|\n|-\n| 1966\n! scope=\"row\" | An Eye for an Eye\n| Harry\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1967\n! scope=\"row\" | Gentle Giant\n| Tater Coughlin\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Cool Hand Luke\n| Sheriff\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1969\n! scope=\"row\" | Old Paint\n| Cowboy\n| Short film\n|-\n| 1970\n! scope=\"row\" | The Wild Country\n| Cleve\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1972\n! scope=\"row\" | Bloody Trail\n| Jake\n|\n|-\n| 1973\n! scope=\"row\" | Salty\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1974\n! scope=\"row\" | Where the Lilies Bloom\n| Roy Luther\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Chinatown\n| Irate Farmer\n|\n|-\n| 1976\n! scope=\"row\" | Eat My Dust!\n| Clark\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 1977\n! scope=\"row\" | The Legend of Frank Woods\n| Howard Blacker\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Heroes''\n| Veteran's Hospital Orderly\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Grand Theft Auto\n| Ned Slinker\n| Directed by Ron Howard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Another Man, Another Chance\n| Wagonmaster\n|\n|-\n| 1978\n! scope=\"row\" | The Amazing Mr. No Legs\n| Lou's Sidekick\n|\n|-\n| 1979\n! scope=\"row\" | Mr. No Legs\n| Mr. No Legs' sidekick\n|\n|-\n| 1981\n! scope=\"row\" | Smokey Bites the Dust\n| Coach\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1983\n! scope=\"row\" | Love Letters\n| Joseph Chesley\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Forever and Beyond\n| Technician\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1984\n! scope=\"row\" | The Lonely Guy\n| Minister\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Splash\n| McCollough\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Directed by Ron Howard\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1985\n! scope=\"row\" | Cocoon\n| St. Petersburg Detective\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Creator\n| Mr. Spencer\n|\n|-\n| 1986\n! scope=\"row\" | Gung Ho\n| Mayor Conrad Zwart\n| Directed by Ron Howard\n|-\n| 1987\n! scope=\"row\" | Innerspace\n| Supermarket Customer #1\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1988\n! scope=\"row\" | Dark Before Dawn\n| Logan\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Merchants of Death\n| Robert Morrison\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1989\n! scope=\"row\" | Trust Me\n| Vern\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''The 'Burbs\n| Detective #2\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Listen to Me''\n| Tucker's Father\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Parenthood\n| Dean at College\n| Directed by Ron Howard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Limit Up\n| Chuck Feeney\n|\n|-\n| 1991\n! scope=\"row\" | 9 1/2 Ninjas!\n| Ninja Negotiator\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 1992\n! scope=\"row\" | ''I Don't Buy Kisses Anymore\n| Elderly Man\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Far and Away\n| Tomlin\n| Directed by Ron Howard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Universal Soldier\n| John Devreux\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Wishman\n| Det.
