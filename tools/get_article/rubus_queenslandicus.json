Prior to 1997, collections of this plant were identified as either R. rosifolius, R. fraxinifolius or R. muelleri/R. probus.\nDescription\nThis species is an erect shrub growing up to about  tall. The stems, petioles and rachises are glabrous, i.e. without hairs, but have small stout thorns about  long. The compound leaves are glabrous and usually have five or seven leaflets, although those close to inflorescences may have three or one. The leaflet blades are narrowly ovate, the base obtuse and the tip acute or acuminate. The leaflet margins are bi- or triserrate, the teeth up to  long, and each of the eight or nine lateral veins terminates at a major tooth.\nThe inflorescences are terminal or borne in the leaf axils, flowers carried on pedicels up to  long. There are five pale sepals measuring up to  by  with a long acumen, narrowly triangular, persistent. The five petals are white, measure about  long by  wide, and are deciduous. The flowers have between 100 and 200 stamens measuring about  long, and between 400 and 600 carpels.\nThe fruit is an ovoid or somewhat cylindrical aggregate fruit measuring about  diameter and up to  long, and is bright red at maturity.\nPhenology\nFlowering has been observed from May to November, and fruit between June and February.\nTaxonomy\nThis species was first formally described by the Queensland botanist Anthony Bean based on a specimen collected by another Queensland botanist, Paul Irwin Forster, in the Mount Lewis National Park. Bean's paper, titled \"A revision of Rubus subg. Idaeobatus (Focke) Focke (Rosaceae) in Australia\", was published in 1997 in the journal Austrobaileya.\nEtymology\nThe genus name Rubus is from the Latin word rubus meaning \"blackberry\" or \"bramble\". The species epithet queenslandicus refers to the Australian state to which this species is endemic.\nDistribution and habitat\nThis species is restricted to highland areas of northeastern Queensland, from the Windsor Tablelands (adjacent to the Daintree National Park), south to Mount Fox (a little north of Townsville). However, most collections of the plant have been on the Atherton Tableland. It usually grows in disturbed areas of rainforest or on the forest's margins, at altitudes from about  up to .\nEcology\nThe fruit is eaten by numerous species of birds.\nConservation\nThis species is listed by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science as least concern. , it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nGallery\nFile:Rubus queenslandicus 224172697.jpg|Habit\nFile:Rubus-queenslandicus-SF23237-01.jpg|Compound leaves\nFile:Rubus queenslandicus 224172649.jpg|Flower close-up\nFile:Rubus-queenslandicus-ALA-2.jpg|Flowers and fruit\nFile:Rubus-queenslandicus-SF23237-03.jpg|New fruit with persistent calyx\nFile:Rubus-queenslandicus-ALA-1.jpg|Ripe fruit\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* [https://avh.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?taxa=Rubus+queenslandicus#tab_mapView View a map] of herbarium collections of this species at the Australasian Virtual Herbarium\n* [https://inaturalist.ala.org.au/observations?taxon_id=925386 View observations] of this species on iNaturalist\n* [https://flickriver.com/search/Rubus+queenslandicus View images] of this species on Flickriver"
