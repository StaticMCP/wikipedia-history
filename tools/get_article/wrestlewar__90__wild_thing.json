It took place on February 25, 1990, from the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina. This would be the second year in a row WCW promoted a PPV under the name \"WrestleWar\", a series that would include four shows in total. When the WWE Network launched in 2014 this show became available \"on demand\" to network subscribers.\nSeven matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Ric Flair defeated Lex Luger by countout to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.\nStorylines\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentators\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Terry Funk\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Gary Michael Cappetta\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Gordon Solie\n|-\n|Missy Hyatt\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Referees\n|Mike Atkins\n|-\n|Nick Patrick\n|}\nThe WrestleWar show featured a number of professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe main event of the show was originally supposed to see Ric Flair defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Sting but Sting was injured a few weeks prior during the main event of Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout. Sting was replaced by his longtime friend Lex Luger in the match. Luger was originally slated to defend the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship against Dr. Death Steve Williams, a match that was dropped. The opening match loss by the Dynamic Dudes (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace) to Kevin Sullivan and Buzz Sawyer was the last time the team worked together ever again. The Chicago Street Fight between The Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal) and  The Skyscrapers saw \"The Masked Skyscraper\" replace Dan Spivey as Mark Callous' partner, citing an injury to Dan Spivey. The Masked Skyscraper was Mike Enos under a mask, at the time of the show Enos held the AWA World Tag Team Championship in the rival American Wrestling Association (AWA) with Wayne Bloom.\nResults\n|match1 = Kevin Sullivan and Buzz Sawyer defeated The Dynamic Dudes (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace)\n|stip1  = Tag team match\n|time1  = 10:15\n|match2 = Norman the Lunatic defeated Cactus Jack Manson (with Kevin Sullivan)\n|stip2  = Singles match\n|time2  = 09:33\n|match3 = The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) defeated The Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) (with Jim Cornette)\n|stip3  = Tag team match\n|time3  = 19:31\n|match4 = The Road Warriors (Hawk and Animal) (with Paul Ellering) defeated The Skyscrapers (Mark Callous and The Masked Skyscraper) (with Teddy Long)\n|stip4  = Chicago Street Fight\n|time4  = 04:59\n|match5 = Brian Pillman and Tom Zenk (c) defeated The Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin)\n|stip5  = Tag team match for the NWA United States Tag Team Championship\n|time5  = 24:32\n|match6 = The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) (c) defeated Ole Anderson and Arn Anderson\n|stip6  = Tag team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship\n|time6  = 16:05\n|match7 = Ric Flair (c) (with Woman) defeated Lex Luger (with Sting) by countout\n|stip7  = Singles match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship\n|time7  = 38:08\n}}\nSee also\n*1990 in professional wrestling\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
