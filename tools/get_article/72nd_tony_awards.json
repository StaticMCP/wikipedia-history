On Metacritic, the ceremony has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based 5 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The Hollywood Reporter columnist David Rooney remarked, \"Bareilles and Groban aced their duties on their own terms, displaying terrific chemistry and making it less about themselves than their infectious enthusiasm as out-and-proud theater geeks.\" The New York Times'' theatre critic Mike Hale commented, \"The just-happy-to-be-here, can't-we-all-get-along vibe was set by the opening song, a celebration of the ceremony's also-rans — 'This one's for the loser inside of you' — sung by the hosts, Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban, and a chorus made up of ensemble members from every Broadway musical. It was a charming, if not particularly memorable, number. That could also describe the performances of Ms. Bareilles and Mr. Groban, who were a likable and entertaining pair. The show as a whole ran like clockwork, without any significant gaffes but also no particularly memorable outbreaks of emotion or eccentricity.\" Daniel D'Addario from Variety wrote, \"Throughout, Groban and Bareilles kept up this happily effervescent, optimistic but never cloying energy — up until the show's end, when they reprised their opening number as a call to arms for all who work in the theater, or hope to. It was a sweet debut performance by hosts who may well be back at Radio City next June, should the Tonys be so lucky.\"\nIn addition, Kristen Baldwin from Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B+, expanding in her review, \"Hosts Josh Groban and Sara Bareilles kicked off the 72nd annual Tony Awards with the mix of showmanship, self-deprecating humor, and good-natured egalitarianism that would continue throughout the night.\" Deadline Hollywood critic Dino-Ray Ramos commented, \"Bareilles and Groban live on the border of radio-friendly music and the Broadway stage, and they served as delightful cruise directors, devoid of forced jokes and corny antics. Instead, they leaned into their musical theater geekiness, which was infectious. As a hosting duo, they did their job effortlessly and well, staying in their lane by not doing too much or too little. They were pitch perfect — pun intended.\" Television critic Jessica Gelt of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \"hosts Josh Groban and Sara Bareilles leavened the evening with well-measured comedy.\"\nRatings\nThe ceremony averaged a Nielsen 4.8 ratings/11 share, and was watched by 6.3 million viewers. The ratings was a 5 percent increase from previous ceremony's viewership of 6 million, becoming the highest since 2016.\nIn Memoriam\nThe cast of Dear Evan Hansen sang \"For Forever\" as images of theatre personalities who had died in the past year were shown.\n*Barbara Cook\n*Thomas Meehan\n*John \"Corky\" Boyd\n*Nanette Fabray\n*Patricia Morison\n*Frank Corsaro\n*Danny Daniels\n*Gemze de Lappe\n*Roy Dotrice\n*Michael Friedman\n*Peter Hall\n*A.
