      "text": "# Revolution DNA\n\n}}\nRevolution DNA is the fifth studio album by the Greek death metal band Septic Flesh. This album shows the band continuing their mixture of death metal with even stronger gothic rock elements than before, while also introducing elements of industrial. The album also puts a much larger emphasis on clean vocals than any other Septic Flesh album, along with death growls being largely replaced by a less intense, spoken-rasped style.\nAlso, this is the first Septicflesh release since 1991's \"Temple of the Lost Race\" to feature a human drummer.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Spiros A. – bass, vocals, artwork & layout\n* Sotiris V. – guitar, vocals\n* Christos A. – guitar, samplers\n* Akis K. – drums\n* Fredrik Nordström – sound engineering, production\n* The Mastering Room – mastering\n* Chris Kissadjekian - photos\n* Vangelis Rassias (Studio Rassias) - band photos\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.myspace.com/septicfleshband Official Myspace]\n*[http://www.metal-archives.com/release.php?id=10114 Revolution DNA at Metal Archives]\n*[http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=1968&band_id=282&bandname=Septicflesh Revolution DNA at Metal Storm]"
