He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1841.\nIn 1847, Bunbury was elected to the House of Commons for Bury St Edmunds, a seat he held until 1852. In 1886, he succeeded his elder brother in the baronetcy.\nBunbury died of pneumonia in March 1895, aged 83. He never married and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his nephew, Charles.\nWork\nBunbury's two-volume history of ancient geography published in 1879 is the first modern work in English which treats the textual sources with any sophistication.\nHe was also a contributing author to the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854–57), and to a number of other reference works. Samuel Sharpe thought Bunbury had plagiarised his work on the Ptolemies.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). ''Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage'' (1990 edition).
