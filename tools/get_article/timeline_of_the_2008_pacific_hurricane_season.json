      "text": "# Timeline of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2008 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15 in the East Pacific Ocean, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. The first storm of the year, Tropical Storm Alma, developed on May&nbsp;29, and the last, Tropical Storm Polo dissipated on November 5.\nThis timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. For convenience and clarity, in the timeline below, all landfalls are bolded. The timeline will also include information, when it becomes available, which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included.\nThe graphical bar below gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and for convenience, the storm's maximum intensity is included as a color bar.\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:770 height:215\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/05/2008 till:30/11/2008\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2008\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:gray(0.88)\nid:GP     value:red\nid:TD     value:rgb(0.43,0.76,0.92)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_≤38_mph_(≤62_km/h)\nid:TS     value:rgb(0.3,1,1)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117_km/h)\nid:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.85)     legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h)\nid:C2     value:rgb(1,0.85,0.55)  legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h)\nid:C3     value:rgb(1,0.62,0.35)  legend:Category_3_=_111–129_mph_(178–208_km/h)\nid:C4     value:rgb(1,0.45,0.54)  legend:Category_4_=_130–156_mph_(209–251_km/h)\nid:C5     value:rgb(0.55,0.46,0.90)  legend:Category_5_=_≥157_mph_(≥252_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Hurricane\nbar:Month\nPlotData=\nbarset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\nfrom:29/05/2008 till:30/05/2008 color:TS text:\"Alma (TS)\"\nfrom:27/06/2008 till:04/07/2008 color:C1 text:\"Boris (C1)\"\nfrom:27/06/2008 till:30/06/2008 color:TS text:\"Cristina (TS)\"\nfrom:01/07/2008 till:04/07/2008 color:TS text:\"Douglas (TS)\"\nfrom:05/07/2008 till:07/07/2008 color:TD text:\"Five-E (TD)\"\nfrom:11/07/2008 till:19/07/2008 color:C2 text:\"Elida (C2)\"\nfrom:16/07/2008 till:22/07/2008 color:C1 text:\"Fausto (C1)\"\nfrom:21/07/2008 till:27/07/2008 color:C1 text:\"Genevieve (C1)\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:06/08/2008 till:12/08/2008 color:C3 text:\"Hernan (C3)\"\nfrom:07/08/2008 till:12/08/2008 color:TS text:\"Kika (TS)\"\nfrom:13/08/2008 till:16/08/2008 color:TS text:\"Iselle (TS)\"\nfrom:23/08/2008 till:26/08/2008 color:TS text:\"Julio (TS)\"\nfrom:02/09/2008 till:03/09/2008 color:TS text:\"Karina (TS)\"\nfrom:06/09/2008 till:11/09/2008 color:TS text:\"Lowell (TS)\"\nfrom:01/10/2008 till:06/10/2008 color:C1 text:\"Marie (C1)\"\nfrom:04/10/2008 till:12/10/2008 color:C4 text:\"Norbert (C4)\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:08/10/2008 till:12/10/2008 color:TS text:\"Odile (TS)\"\nfrom:23/10/2008 till:24/10/2008 color:TD text:\"Seventeen-E (TD)\"\nfrom:02/11/2008 till:05/11/2008 color:TS text:\"Polo (TS)\"\nbar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\nfrom:01/05/2008 till:31/05/2008 text:May\nfrom:01/06/2008 till:30/06/2008 text:June\nfrom:01/07/2008 till:31/07/2008 text:July\nfrom:01/08/2008 till:31/08/2008 text:August\nfrom:01/09/2008 till:30/09/2008 text:September\nfrom:01/10/2008 till:31/10/2008 text:October\nfrom:01/11/2008 till:30/11/2008 text:November\nTextData =\npos:(570,30)\ntext:\"(From the\"\npos:(618,30)\ntext:\"Saffir–Simpson scale)\"\nMay\n;May 15\n* The 2008 Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n;May 29\n* 0000 UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT May 28) &ndash;
