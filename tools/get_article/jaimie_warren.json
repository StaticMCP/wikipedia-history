The Huffington Post commented on her exhibition “The WOAHS of Female Tragedy II”: “We don't know what we love most about Jaimie Warren: her knack for puns, her obsession with \"Toddlers & Tiaras\" or her endless devotion to Roseanne Barr...Warren, like a Reddit-crazed Cindy Sherman, inserts her self-portraits into the best and most bizarre memes, channeling everything from Picasso's \"Demoiselles\" to the celebrity spoof, \"Lasagna Del Rey.\" For her second solo exhibition at the Hole in 2014,  Roberta Smith writes in the New York Times: “In her latest New York exhibition, Jaimie Warren comes across as a force of nature, or at least pop culture, whose work brims with messy promise. [Her photographs] indicate a talent for color and tactility (to say the least) as well as for rough-edged transformation that combines aspects of the work of Cindy Sherman, Sandy Skoglund and Alex Bag while channeling the spirits of Leigh Bowery, Divine and George Grosz.”\nPublications\nWarren's photography and art has been published and reviewed in a variety of publications, including The New York Times (New York). ARTnews (New York), Artforum (New York),  i-D (London), Vice Magazine (New York),  Complex (New York),  Nylon (New York),  Missbehave (New York),  The Fader (New York), SPIN (New York), XLR8R (New York), URB (New York), Village Voice (New York), Foam Magazine (The Netherlands), Dossier Journal (New York), NY Arts Magazine (New York), artnet (New York and Berlin), Paper (New York), Dazed & Confused (London), Interview (New York), and Oyster (Sydney).\nWarren’s first monograph ''Don't You Feel Better'' was published by Aperture in New York in 2008.\nVideo and Performance Work\nIn more recent years, Jaimie's work has transitioned from low-fi photography based self-portraits to more elaborate and referential performance and video workWarren has performed at venues including the Warhol Museum (Pittsburgh), The Jewish Museum (NYC), Vox Populi (Philadelphia), Showroom Mama (Rotterdam), Getsumin (Osaka), Material (Mexico City), California Institute of the Arts (Valencia, CA), The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) Education Department (New York, NY), and Extrapool (Nijmegen), among others..\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dontyoufeelbetter.com/ Jaimie Warren – Don’t You Feel Better]\n*[https://www.whoopdeedoo.org Whoop Dee Doo]"
