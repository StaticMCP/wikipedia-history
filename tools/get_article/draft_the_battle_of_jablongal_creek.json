      "text": "# Draft:The Battle of Jablongal Creek\n\n----\nThe Battle of Jablongal Creek  was a turning point for the Austro-Hungarian counteroffensive into Romania in late August 1916 during World War I. Though the battle was small compared to the rest of the offensive, it in turn opened a small gap which the Romanian army couldn't successfully hold. This small battle that many are unaware of ended up opening a major breakthrough towards the Romanian capital of Bucharest, which fell a few days later on December 6.\nSome sources claim that the 1st Romanian army partook in the defense of Jablongal Creek but it's widely agreed upon that the answer is lost to time. As for the Austro-Hungarian army it's even less clear; many speculate that the army might have been a branch of the Imperial-Royal Landwehr or the Common Army of Hungary.\nThe Battle of Jablongal Creek remains relatively unknown mainly due to it being part of the many battles during the Battle of Brassó. Although the distinction between the Battle of Brassó and Jablongal Creek could be summed up to date so to speak. The Battle of Jablongal Creek was the last skirmish during the Battle of Brassó which led to the fleeing of the Romanian army as a breakthrough ensued."
