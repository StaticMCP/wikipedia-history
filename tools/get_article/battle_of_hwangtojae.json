The Donghak Peasant Army achieved a significant victory in the battle against the Jeolla Gamyeong Army.\nBackground\nOn March 20, 1894, Jeon Bong-jun and Kim Gae-nam went south to Mujang, where they met Son Hwa-jung. Jeon announced a proclamation in Mujang, Jeolla Province, marking the start of a full-scale peasant uprising. The rebels properly organized in Mujang, and on 20 March the 4,000 rebels of Mujang, Jeolla Province, turned towards Mount Baek, Gobu. While camped in Mount Baek, the army grew to tens of thousands. Choe Deokyeong and Choi Gyeong-seon's 300 peasants who were stationed in Jae-san Village, and several hundred peasant soldiers gathered at the horse market, and together they occupied Gobu Gwan-a, a government office and Gobu Pass and gradually strengthened their forces. Here, the aphorism came: \"When sitting, a white mountain; when standing, a bamboo mountain\". (rebels mostly wore white, and used bamboo spears. The term may have appeared earlier, however, as Mount Juk, meaning 'bamboo mountain', could only be seen when standing, as it was covered by smaller Mount Baek, 'white mountain'.) On 22 March the rebels destroyed the reservoir and burned down governmental offices and storages.\nAfter occupying Gobu Gwan-a, the peasant soldiers stayed there for four days. They demolished the government's arsenals and carried out reforms, and on March 25, they advanced to Baeksan. Baeksan was a small hill less than 50 meters high located north of Gobu Gwan-a, but it was a fortress that provided a clear view of the surrounding grain-producing areas.\nWhile the peasant soldiers were encamped at Baeksan, peasant soldiers from neighboring towns such as Geumju, Buan, and Gochang gathered one after another. As a result, the peasant army expanded and reorganized its camp, appointing Jeon Bong-jun as the commander-in-chief, Son Hwa-jung and Kim Gae-nam as generals, and Choi Gyeong-seon as an administrative officer.\nFrom March 26 to 29, they declared the \"Honam Changyi Headquarters\" and established Jeon Bong-jun as the overall commander and Son Hwa-jung (1861-1895) and Kim Gae-nam (1853-1895) as deputy commanders.\nThe rebels camped for four days in Gobu, and new rebels joined them every day. After making Jeon Bong-jun as the leader and Kim Gae-nam and Son Hwa-jung as generals, the rebels occupied Taein (1 April) and Buan (4 April). They also announced the \"Four Great Principles\" (Sadaemyeongui) to clarify their intentions and posted proclamations (gikmun) throughout the country to actively seek the support of the people.\n# Do not kill the innocent and refrain from eating farm animals.\n# Open the Hucheon through loyalty and piety and appease the people.\n# Defeat every single barbarians of Japan and purify the holy land.\n# Drive the army into Seoul and kill every member of the Min family.\nThe rebels also \"did not seek alcohol and women and did not smoke tobacco\". They did not forcefully take food, but paid for them in money.\nPursuing the rebels\nMeanwhile, when the Jeolla Gamsa (local magistrate) Kim Mun-hyun heard the news that the Donghak peasant soldiers had occupied Gobu and gathered at Baeksan, he immediately reported it to the central government and ordered the military and civil officials in Jeonju to guard the west and south gates of Jeonju Castle. Meanwhile, preparations were made to strengthen the defense of Jeonju Castle, and the Jeolla Provincial Army (Kamyeonggun (감영군 (監營軍)) was mobilized.\nThey had a total of around 2,000 soldiers, including 300 elite troops from Munamyeong. They consist of 700 soldiers from the Munam Camp and about 600 conscripts led by Bo Bu-sang and Yi Gyeonghyo advanced through Wonpyeong and Taein and reached the vicinity of Baeksan. Furthermore, he mobilized the troops of the Munam Camp (a military camp established in 1893) under the command of Yi Gyeong-ho and led a mixed force of artillery units that had come from various towns to block the advance of the Donghak peasant soldiers along the Geumgu Road.\nOn April 3, the Jeolla Gamyeong Army moved towards Gumgu direction to intercept the peasant army. Upon hearing this news, the peasant army of 4,000 led by Jeon Bong-jun changed direction again, heading towards Taein. The main force of the peasant army spent the night of April 3 in Taein, leaving only a small force as a deterrent, and then moved to Buan. On April 4, they captured Buan Pass and opened the arsenal to strengthen their weaponry, they changed their route towards Jeonju and encamped at Seonghwangsan, which was close to the border area between Buan and Gobu.\nBattle\nOn a cloudy April 6, the main force of the peasant army left Buan and headed towards Gobu, while the remaining peasant army in Taein also moved towards Gobu. They had agreed to meet at Hwangtohyeon, a strategic location connecting Taein and Gobu, located west of Dokyosan.\nThe first engagement took place around 4 p.m. When the peasant army encountered the Jeolla Provincial Army, they pretended to be defeated and retreated from Hwangtohyeon, turning their formation towards the southern foothills of Shirubong. As Yi's forces pursued them and reached Hwangtohyeon, night fell and further advancement became impossible. They decided to camp there. Gam Yeong was unfamiliar with the geography of the area, and coincidentally, the rain had just stopped, shrouding the area in dense fog. Underestimating the strength of the peasant army, Yi and his troops leisurely enjoyed the evening, even slaughtering cattle and drinking alcohol.\nInitially, the peasant army pretended to retreat as if they were defeated. When the peasant army retreated to the Maegyo Bridge in Gobu, the Jeolla Provincial Army pursued them. In response, the peasant army pretended to be defeated again and climbed up the mountains called the yellow earth embankment. The Jeolla Provincial Army continued to pursue and encamped near the yellow earth embankment. While the two forces were facing each other, it became dark, and April 6 came to an end. In this tense standoff, the peasant army, waited for the right moment. The governmental soldiers charged into the rebel camp, but found it empty. At around 4 a.m. on April 7, the peasant army, hiding on the yellow earth embankment under the cover of fog, launched a surprise attack by firing cannons on the defenseless Jeolla Provincial Army camped under the hill at around 4 a.m. on April 7th. The Jeolla Supervisory Division was caught off guard, causing confusion and chaos. The peasant army chased the disoriented Jeolla Provincial Army and achieved victory in the first encounter with the government forces by killing military officer Yi Gyeong-ho and many other commanding officers while some fled. The peasant army chased the disoriented Jeolla Provincial Army and achieved victory in the first encounter with the government forces by killing military officer Yi Gyeong-ho and many other commanding officers while some fled.\nThe \"Ogahimun\" records the battle situation at that time as follows:\nAftermath\nIn this battle, the government army suffered more than 1,000 casualties. Prominent officials such as Yeonggwan Lee Gun-yang, Taeeun Bobusang Liu Byeong-jik, and Secretary Lee Dun-seong were all killed, while officials like Lee Jae-seop, Yu Su-geun, Jung Chang-kwon, and Baek Nak-yu all fled. However, it seems exaggerated, and the actual number is estimated to be around 200. The Hwangtohyeon Battle boosted the morale of the Donghak peasant soldiers and significantly diminished the morale of the government forces, thus influencing the course of the Donghak Peasant Uprising. It was a major defeat for the government army and the first victory for the peasant army.\nLegacy\nThe victory at Hwangtohyeon Battle became a significant turning point in the First Donghak Peasant War. Not only did the peasant army's morale soar after defeating the government army in the first battle, but it also served as a catalyst for ordinary peasants who had been observing the uprising to join the ranks of the rebellion. In fact, after the battle, the peasant army's strength grew quantitatively and qualitatively until they eventually captured Jeonju Castle.\nSee also\n* Donghak Peasant Revolution\n* Jeon Bong-jun\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*"
