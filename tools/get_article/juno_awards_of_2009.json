These ceremonies were held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada during the weekend ending 29 March 2009.\nLoverboy was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and Sarah McLachlan received the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award. Long-time broadcast executive Fred Sherratt, a former CHUM Limited executive, received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award.\nEvents\nPreliminary award-related events began on 26 March 2009. The following day featured a Welcome Reception at the Commodore Ballroom and a Juno Cup ice hockey game at the UBC Thunderbird Arena.\nMost awards were announced at a Gala Dinner and Awards which was a restricted-access, non-televised event at Vancouver's Westin Bayshore Hotel on 28 March 2009. The only multiple-category winner at that event was The Stills who won New Group of the Year and Alternative Album of the Year (Oceans Will Rise). Kardinal Offishall's single \"Dangerous\" was awarded Single of the Year, over competition from songs by established major artists such as Michael Bublé, Céline Dion and Nickelback.\nPrimary ceremonies\nThe primary awards ceremony on 29 March 2009 was telecast by CTV from General Motors Place and hosted for the second consecutive year by Russell Peters.\nArtists performing at the ceremonies broadcast included City and Colour, Nickelback, Sarah McLachlan and Simple Plan. The complete list of performing artists was:\n* Nickelback - \"Something in Your Mouth\"\n* Sam Roberts - \"Them Kids\"\n* Sarah McLachlan - \"U Want Me 2\"\n* The Stills - \"Being Here\"\n* City and Colour with Gord Downie - \"Sleeping Sickness\"\n* Crystal Shawanda - \"You Can Let Go\"\n* Divine Brown - \"One More Chance\"\n* Serena Ryder - \"Little Bit Of Red\"\n* Simple Plan - \"Your Love Is a Lie\"\n* Bryan Adams with Kathleen Edwards - \"Walk On By\"\n* Great Big Sea with Eccodek and Hawksley Workman - \"Gallows Pole\"\nNominees and winners\nThe band Nickelback received five Juno Award nominations, the most of any band or individual artist. Celine Dion and Hedley earned nominations in three categories apiece. Performances have also been scheduled from Simple Plan and Alexisonfire vocalist Dallas Green (performing as City and Colour).\nNominees were announced at a press conference on 5 February 2009.
