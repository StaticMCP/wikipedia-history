His family had been magnates for nearly a century, at least since 1205 when his grandfather Fulk III FitzWarin obtained Whittington Castle near Oswestry, which was their main residence and the seat of a marcher lordship.\nAll the male heirs were given the first name Fulk, and the barony with the castle and lordship of Whittington descended from father to son until 1420.  It then passed to an heiress, Elizabeth FitzWarin, and from her to the Bourchier family, with John Bourchier being created Earl of Bath in 1536. The line ended with the death of Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath in 1636. In 1913 the title was unsuccessfully claimed by Sir Robert Wrey, a distant relative who had acquired parts of what had been the FitzWarin estate.\nPredecessors of barons\n*Fulk I FitzWarin (died before 1172), a supporter of King Henry II, of Whittington in Shropshire and Alveston in Gloucestershire, son of the \"shadowy or mythical\" Warin of Metz.\n*Fulk II FitzWarin (died after 1194), married Hawise, daughter and co-heiress of Joceas de Dinan.
