The engagement is interrupted by a surprise attack from the Predacons. Optimus saves Dinobot's life during the attack, prompting the two to come to terms and ally.\nFrom then on, Dinobot serves alongside the Maximals during the Beast Wars, and proves to be a valuable ally in both strength and cunning, as well as in his knowledge of his former Predacon comrades. However, Dinobot frequently clashes with the Maximals' morals, but grows to respect the Maximals, and forges strong friendships with them. Later on he realizes Megatron did in fact arrive on Earth, and was all along planning to alter history in order to ensure himself power. So to derail Megatron's tyrannical ambitions he sabotages the Predacons in their onslaught against a group of proto-humans that would lead to the human race.
