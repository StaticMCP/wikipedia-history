Raised in 1943, the division fought in the Normandy landings (Capture of the Caen canal and Orne river bridges, Operation Tonga, Operation Mallard, Battle of Breville), the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945. The division then participated in Operation Varsity, the second airborne assault over the River Rhine during the war. Afterwards the division advanced north to the Baltic Sea, reaching Wismar by the end of the war.\nIn the immediate post war period the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded leaving the 6th as the only airborne division in the British Army. Near the end of 1945, the division was named the Imperial Strategic Reserve and posted to the Middle East and deployed in an internal security role, during unrest in the British mandate of Palestine. By 1948, the British Army numbers had returned to peace time levels and the division was disbanded leaving the independent 2nd Parachute Brigade as the only regular army airborne formation.\nOrder of battle\nSecond World War\nThe Second World War formation, that participated in the Normandy landings, and Rhine Crossing.\n* 3rd Parachute Brigade\n** 8th (Midlands) Parachute Battalion\n** 9th (Eastern and Home Counties) Parachute Battalion\n** 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion\n* 5th Parachute Brigade\n** 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion\n** 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion\n** 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion\n* 6th Airlanding Brigade\n** 12th Devonshire Regiment\n** 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry\n** 1st Royal Ulster Rifles\n* Divisional troops\n** 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment\n** 53rd (Worcester Yeomanry) Airlanding Light Regiment, Royal Artillery\n** 2nd Forward Observer Unit, Royal Artillery\n** 3rd Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery\n** 4th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery\n** 2nd Airlanding Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, Royal Artillery\n** 3rd Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers\n** 591st Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers\n** 249th Field Company.
