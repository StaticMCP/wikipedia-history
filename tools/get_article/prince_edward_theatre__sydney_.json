      "text": "# Prince Edward Theatre (Sydney)\n\nPrince Edward Theatre was a picture theatre on Elizabeth and Castlereagh streets, Sydney, erected for the Carroll-Musgrove partnership of Harry G. Musgrove (died 27 April 1951) and brothers Edward and Dan Carroll)  with financial backing from George Marlow in 1923. Architects were Robertson & Marks, with technical assistance from Thomas W. Lamb, the American picture theatre designer.\nDescribed as Australia's \"first cathedral of motion pictures\", it opened on 22 November 1924.\nThe first film shown was The Ten Commandments\nIn the era of silent film, the live sound accompanying a film was important to its success. The Prince Edward Concert Orchestra, of up to 21 players, was initially conducted by Will Prior (–1948), and followed 1927–1936 by Albert Cazabon, father of actor John Cazabon. The orchestra pit was raised or lowered by hydraulic lifts according to requirements.\nA Wurlitzer theatre organ, which could be used to either augment or replace the orchestra, was opened in February 1925 with Eddie Horton (born 1893) at the console.\nThe Prince Edward was regarded as unique in its elaborate sophistication until 1928, when the Regent, Capitol and State theatres opened or were refurbished in competition.\nThe theatre closed on 4 December 1965 and was subsequently demolished. The final film shown was a re-run of the 1956 classic, War and Peace.\nReferences"
