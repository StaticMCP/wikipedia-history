      "text": "# Delaware Bay (New Zealand)\n\nDelaware Bay is an indentation in the New Zealand South Island coast east of Pepin Island, to the north of Nelson. It is part of the larger Tasman Bay / Te Tai-o-Aorere. The bay is named after the Delaware, a newly built brig which sank here on its maiden voyage from Nelson to Napier in 1863, an incident best remembered for the dramatic rescue attempts by a group of local Māori.\nReferences"
