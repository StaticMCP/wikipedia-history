Described by Vaughan Williams as a \"Song for chorus and orchestra\", it was premiered at the Leeds Festival in October 1907.\nBackground\nVaughan Williams loved the poetry of Walt Whitman throughout his adult life. He had been introduced to Whitman's work by Bertrand Russell while they were undergraduates at Cambridge. The musicologist Elliott Schwartz has commented that Vaughan Williams was particularly attracted to Whitman by traits that are paralleled in his music: \"the concern for the development of a national art independent of foreign influences and the recurring theme of mysticism and exploration\". The composer's first settings of words by Whitman were two vocal duets with violin obbligato: \"The Last Invocation\" and \"The Birds’ Love-Song\". He later rejected these songs, calling one \"perfectly awful\" and the other \"an unconscious crib\". His first canonical setting of Whitman was composed in late 1904 or early 1905, using the words of \"Darest thou now, O soul\" from the \"Whispers of Heavenly Death\" section of Leaves of Grass:\nDarest thou now O soul,\nWalk out with me toward the unknown region,\nWhere neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow?\nNo map there, nor guide,\nNor voice sounding, nor touch of human hand,\nNor face with blooming flesh, nor lips, nor eyes, are in that land.\nI know it not O soul,\nNor dost thou, all is a blank before us,\nAll waits undream'd of in that region, that inaccessible land.\nTill when the ties loosen,\nAll but the ties eternal, Time and Space,\nNor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any bounds bounding us.\nThen we burst forth, we float,\nIn Time and Space O soul, prepared for them,\nEqual, equipt at last, (O joyl O fruit of all!) them to fulfil O soul.\nThe piece is dedicated to the composer's sister-in-law Florence Maitland in memory of her husband, F. W. Maitland, Downing Professor of the Laws of England at Cambridge, whose recent death had grieved Vaughan Williams.\nPremiere and reception\nThe composer conducted the first performance, which was given at the Leeds Festival on 10 October 1907, in a concert otherwise conducted by his former professor at the Royal College of Music, Sir Charles Stanford. The London premiere of the piece was conducted by Stanford two months later.\nThe music critic of The Times, J. A. Fuller Maitland, wrote:\nLater analysts note the influence of older composers: Stanford, Elgar and particularly Hubert Parry, another of Vaughan Williams's former professors, whose Blest Pair of Sirens (1887) is, according to both Michael Kennedy (1980) and Christopher Palmer (1993),  a model in form and general outline for Toward the Unknown Region.\nStructure\nThe work is scored for 3 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets in B, bass clarinet in B, 2 bassoons, 4 horns in F, 3 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, 2 harps, organ and strings. The chorus is in the traditional four vocal parts.\nThe duration is typically between 11 and  13 minutes.\nRecordings\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: left; margin-right: 0;\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Conductor\n! scope=\"col\" |Orchestra\n! scope=\"col\" |Chorus\n! scope=\"col\" |Date\n|-\n|Sir Malcolm Sargent\n| London Symphony Orchestra\n| BBC Chorus\n| 1957\n|-\n| Sir Adrian Boult\n| London Philharmonic Orchestra\n| London Philharmonic Choir\n| 1973\n|-\n| Norman Del Mar\n| City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra\n| City of Birmingham Symphony Chorus\n| 1980\n|-\n| Bryden Thomson\n| London Symphony Orchestra\n| London Symphony Chorus\n| 1989\n|-\n| David Hill\n| Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra\n| Waynflete Singers; Winchester Cathedral Choir\n| 1991\n|-\n| Matthew Best\n| Corydon Orchestra\n| Corydon Singers\n| 1993\n|-\n| David Lloyd-Jones\n| Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra\n| Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir\n| 2005\n|-\n| Graham Taylor\n| Scottish Opera Orchestra,\n| City of Glasgow Chorus\n| 2005\n|}\n:Source: WorldCat and Naxos Music Library\nNotes, references and sources\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
