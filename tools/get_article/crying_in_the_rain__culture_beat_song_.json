It was co-written by band members Tania Evans and Jay Supreme with Doug Laurent and Robert Gerding, and produced by Laurent. The single charted in many countries, reaching its best chart positions in Hungary, Germany and Denmark, where it was a top-10 hit. \"Crying in the Rain\" also reached number-one on the Canadian RPM Dance/Urban chart. The music video for the song was directed by Oliver Sommer and filmed in Hong Kong, China. A CD maxi-single containing remixes was also released under the name \"Crying in the Rain Remixes\".\nCritical reception\nLarry Flick from Billboard noted that \"Tania Evans smolders on the Culture Beat kicker 'Crying in the Rain'—which is by far the act's most viable bid for pop radio success since 1994's 'Mr. Vain'.\" Taylor Parkes from Melody Maker was less enthustiastic, saying, \"Belgium being probably the only country still interested in Culture Beat.\" Damien Mendis from Music Week's RM Dance Update gave the song four out of five, remarking its \"traditional speedy Euro style with galloping bass, sweeping synths and obligatory energetic rap capturing its catchiness.\" He concluded, \"You'll either love it or hate it.\" Another RM editor, James Hamilton, described it as \"Tania Evans wailed and gruff J. Supreme muttered Eurodisco\".\nChart performance\n\"Crying in the Rain\" was quite successful on the charts in both Canada and Europe, peaking at number-one on the Canadian RPM Dance/Urban chart. In Europe, it made the top 10 in Denmark, Germany and Hungary, where it peaked at number ten, eight and three. The single was also a top-20 hit in Austria, Belgium, Finland and Switzerland, and a top-30 hit in Scotland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as on the Music & Media Eurochart Hot 100, where it hit number 28. In the UK, \"Crying in the Rain\" peaked at number 29 in its first week at the UK Singles Chart, on June 9, 1996.\nTrack listings\n* CD single (Germany, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Radio Edit) - 3:54\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Not Normal Mix - Special Acoustic Version) - 3:30\n* CD maxi-single (Europe, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Radio Edit) - 3:54\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Extended Mix) - 5:38\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Doug Laurent Mix) - 6:09\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Brainformed Mix) - 6:54\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Let The Love House 7\" Mix) - 3:52\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Sweetbox Funky 7\" Mix) - 3:22\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Not Normal Mix) - 3:30\n# \"Out of Touch\" - 4:08\n* CD maxi-single - Remix (Germany, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Aboria Euro Radio Mix) - 3:49\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Temple Of Light Mix) - 6:31\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Celvin Rotane Mix) - 6:58\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Stonebridge & Nick Nice Club Mix) - 8:10\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Großer Club Mix) - 7:58\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Jim Clarke Mix) - 5:36\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Aboria Euro 12\" Mix) - 6:43\n* CD single (France, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Aboria Euro Radio) - 3:49\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Aboria Euro Mix) - 6:43\n* CD maxi-single 1 (UK, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Radio Edit) - 3:54\n# \"Mr. Vain\" (Mr House) - 6:18\n# \"Got to Get It\" (Hypnotic Mix) - 7:17\n# \"Anything\" (Trancemix) - 6:30\n* CD maxi-single 2 (UK, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Radio Edit) - 3:54\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Extended Mix) - 5:38\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Sweetbox Funky 12\" Mix) - 7:13\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Brainformed Mix) - 6:54\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Let The Love House 12\" Mix) - 7:01\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Not Normal Mix) - 3:30\n* 12\" maxi vinyl single (France, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Aboria Euro Mix) - 6:43\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Extended Mix) - 5:38\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Radio Edit) - 3:54\n* 12\" maxi vinyl single - Remix (France, 1996)\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Brainformed Mix) - 6:54\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Sweetbox Funky 7\" Mix) - 3:22\n# \"Crying in the Rain\" (Let The Love House 7\" Mix) - 3:52\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1996)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 181\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Dance/Urban (RPM)\n| 1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (IFPI)\n| 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 28\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Dutch Top 40 Tipparade)\n| 2\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1996)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n| 66\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia)\n| 83\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Germany (Media Control)\n| 61\n|}\nReferences"
