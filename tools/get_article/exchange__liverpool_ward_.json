The Liverpool Exchange building itself was central to the economic development of the city during the 18th and 19th centuries, serving as a focal point for trade and business, especially given Liverpool's prominence as a major port during the British Empire.\nOverview\nHistorically, wards in Liverpool were used as administrative districts for electing members to the City Council and for organizing various city services.\nThe Exchange ward was located in the heart of the city center, encompassing some of the most important civic and commercial buildings, including the Town Hall and the financial district around Castle Street, Water Street, and Old Hall Street. The ward was home to merchants, bankers, and other prominent business figures of the time.\nThe boundaries of Liverpool’s electoral wards have been redrawn multiple times over the years, reflecting changes in population and administrative needs. By the latter part of the 20th century, the Exchange ward was abolished or merged with surrounding areas as part of broader changes to Liverpool's ward structure. While the Exchange ward itself no longer exists in the modern electoral system, its legacy remains tied to Liverpool's economic history and its development as a major international trading city.\nElections\n1835\nPolling places : Surnames A to K : at the south end of the Sessions'-house in South Chapel-street.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurnames L to Z : at the north end of the Sessions'-house in Chapel-street.\n1836\n1837\n1838\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Time\n! colspan=\"2\" | Henry Holmes\n! colspan=\"2\" | George Gurden\n|-\n!
