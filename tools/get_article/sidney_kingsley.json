He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for his play Men in White in 1934.\nLife and career\nKingsley was born Sidney Kirschner in New York. He studied at Cornell University, where he began his career writing plays for the college dramatic club. He joined the Group Theater for the production of his first major work. In 1933 the company performed his play Men in White. Set in a hospital, the play dealt with the issue of illegal abortion, 1930s medical and surgical practices, and the struggle of a promising physician who must choose to dedicate his life to medicine or devote himself to his fiancée. The play was a box-office smash.\nKingsley followed this success with the play Dead End in 1935, a story about slum housing and its connection to crime. The play was fairly successful, being filmed and eventually spawning the film troupe The Dead End Kids. Kingsley's two successes were followed by his 1936 anti-war play Ten Million Ghosts and his 1939 work The World We Make, which were both flops and had short runs.\nIn 1943, Kingsley had success with the historical drama The Patriots, which told the story of Thomas Jefferson and his activities in the young American republic and won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play. Kingsley continued writing for the theater late into his career, adapting Arthur Koestler's novel Darkness at Noon for the stage in 1951, and writing Lunatics and Lovers in 1954 and Night Life in 1962.\nIn addition to his work for the stage, Kingsley wrote a number of scripts for Hollywood productions, mostly based on his own work. He later also wrote the scripts and templates for numerous television series and television films.\nDespite reaching the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army during World War II, soon after, in 1951, Kingsley's name was placed on the Hollywood Blacklist by HUAC, which ended his film career.\nHis marriage to actress Madge Evans in 1939 lasted until her death in 1981. The couple lived together in their 18th century Oakland, New Jersey, home for 42 years.\nMeeting him in 1957, Michael Korda described Kingsley as \"a short, powerfully built man with broad shoulders, a big head, and rough-hewn features that made him look like a bust by Sir Jacob Epstein\". Kingsley hired Korda as an assistant to do research for a screenplay he was writing for CBS on the Hungarian Revolution which was never produced.\nIn 1964, Kingsley was elected president of the Dramatists Guild of America and in 1983, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\nKingsley died of a stroke on March 20, 1995, aged 88, in his home in Oakland, New Jersey.\nWorks\n* 1933: Men in White\n* 1935: Dead End\n* 1936: Ten Million Ghosts\n* 1939: The World We Make\n* 1943: The Patriots\n* 1949: Detective Story\n* 1951: Darkness at Noon (stage & TV adaptation)\n* 1954: Lunatics and Lovers\n* 1962: Night Life\nEditions of Works\n* Sidney Kingsley: Five Prizewinning Plays.
