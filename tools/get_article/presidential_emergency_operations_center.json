It serves as a secure shelter and communications center for the president of the United States and others in case of an emergency.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nThe first White House bunker was built during World War II to protect President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the event of an aerial attack on Washington, D.C.\nThe present-day PEOC space has modern communications equipment, including televisions and phones to coordinate with outside government entities. During a breach of White House security, including violations of the Washington, D.C., Air Defense Identification Zone (P-56 airspace), the president and other protectees are relocated to the executive briefing room, next to the PEOC. Day to day, the PEOC is staffed around the clock by joint-service military officers and non-commissioned officers.\nSeptember 11 attacks\n, First Lady Laura Bush, and Second Lady Lynne Cheney in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center following the September 11 attacks]]\nDuring the September 11 attacks, a number of key personnel were evacuated from their offices in the White House to the PEOC. These included Vice President Dick Cheney, First Lady Laura Bush, Lynne Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Mary Matalin, \"Scooter\" Libby, Joshua Bolten, Karen Hughes, Stephen Hadley, David Addington, Secret Service agents, U.S. Army major and White House Fellow Mike Fenzel, and other staff including Norman Mineta. President George W. Bush was visiting a school in Florida at the time of the attacks.\nMay 29, 2020\nPresident Donald Trump retreated to the PEOC during the night of May 29, 2020, at the beginning of the George Floyd protests.\nAfter his time in the bunker was reported in the news, Trump demanded that officials find and prosecute those responsible for the information getting to the press. Trump's secretary of defense, Mark Esper, described in his 2022 book that Trump stated the person who leaked his whereabouts \"should be tried for treason and should be executed\".\nReferences\nExternal links\nsv:Vita huset#Östra flygeln"
