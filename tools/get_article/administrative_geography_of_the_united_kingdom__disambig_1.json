As a sovereign state located northwest of continental Europe, the United Kingdom comprises England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Each of these nations operates its own distinct system of local government and territorial divisions. As a result, there is no single, unified layer of administrative units that spans the entire United Kingdom.\nAs there is no written document that comprehensively encompasses the British constitution, and owing to a convoluted history of the formation of the United Kingdom, a variety of terms are used to refer to its constituent parts, which are sometimes called the four countries of the United Kingdom. The four are sometimes collectively referred to as the Home Nations, particularly in sporting contexts. Although the four countries are important for legal and governmental purposes, they are not comparable to administrative subdivisions of most other countries.\nThe United Kingdom also contains 17 dependent territories which are not officially a part of the UK but are represented by it in places like the UN.\nHistorically, the subnational divisions of the UK have been the county and the ecclesiastical parish, while following the emergence of a unified parliament of the United Kingdom, the ward and constituency have been pan-UK political subdivisions. More contemporary divisions include Lieutenancy areas and the statistical territories defined with the modern International Territorial Level (formerly NUTS) and ISO 3166-2:GB systems.\nHistory\nEuler diagram of the [[British Isles]]\nThis structure was formed by the union agreed between the former sovereign states, the Kingdom of England (including the Principality of Wales) and the Kingdom of Scotland in the Treaty of Union and enacted by the Acts of Union 1707 to form the single Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800); followed by the Act of Union 1800, which combined Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, following the partition of Ireland, resulted in the present-day United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nWales was incorporated into the English legal system through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542, the earlier Statute of Rhuddlan having restricted but not abolished Welsh Law following the Edwardian conquest in 1282.  As a result, England and Wales are treated as a single entity for some purposes, principally that they share a legal system (see English law), while Scotland and Northern Ireland each have a separate legal system (see Scots Law and Northern Ireland law).\nNorthern Ireland was the first part of the British Isles to have a devolved government, under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and that continued until the Parliament of Northern Ireland was suspended in 1972. After a period of direct rule by the Westminster government and some abortive attempts at reinstating devolved government during the Troubles, the present-day Northern Ireland Assembly was established in 1998, and is currently in operation following a number of periods of suspension. The complex history of Northern Ireland has led to differing views as to its status. The term \"Province\" is often used by unionist and British commentators to refer to Northern Ireland, but not by nationalists.\nOverview of administration\nFollowing Brexit the UK ONS replaced the EU NUTS1 regional model with its own International Territorial Level model, continuing the treatment of the 3 Home Nations alongside the 9 Regions of England.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Overview of administrative divisions of the UK\n!Sovereign State\n| colspan=\"9\" |United Kingdom\n|-\n!Constituent country\n| colspan=\"6\" |England\n(without devolution)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Wales\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Scotland\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Northern Ireland\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Authority area\n| colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"2\" |Greater London Authority and combined authority areas, other areas\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |(with devolution)\n|-\n!Lieutenancy area\n| colspan=\"6\" |Ceremonial counties\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Preserved counties\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Lieutenancy areas\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Lieutenancy areas\n|-\n!County type\n| colspan=\"2\" |Non-metropolitan\n|Metropolitan\n| colspan=\"3\" |Unique\n|-\n!County council area\n|Two-tier council area\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Unitary authority areas\n|None\n|None\n| rowspan=\"2\" |City of London\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Isles of Scilly\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Principal areas\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Council areas\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Districts\n|-\n!District\n|Non-metropolitan districts\n|Metropolitan boroughs\n|London boroughs\n|-\n!Parish\n| colspan=\"4\" |Civil parishes\n|None\n|Civil parishes\n|Communities\n|Communities\n|(Civil parishes)\n|}\n;Notes\nThe markers above link to relevant articles where available.\n: Can have city, borough or royal borough status\n: Has a council\n: Has a legislature\n: May have a council\n: Sui generis unitary authority.

Separate legislation exists for:\n##unitary authorities\n##non-metropolitan districts\n##metropolitan boroughs\n##London boroughs\n##sui generis status (the City of London and Isle of Scilly).\n#civil parishes with parish or town councils, most of England but not as common in larger urban areas.\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland has the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive established under the Good Friday Agreement. During periods where the devolved institutions were suspended, executive government in Northern Ireland was administered directly by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and laws made in the United Kingdom Parliament – known as \"direct rule\" in contrast to devolution.\nFor local government, Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts, which are unitary authorities.\nNorthern Ireland is divided into six traditional counties.  Though widely used, these no longer serve any administrative purpose.\nScotland\nScotland has a devolved legislature, the Scottish Parliament, with a government, the Scottish Government, since 1999. The Scottish Government is headed by the First Minister of Scotland who is responsible for all areas of decision making, government policy as well as the international engagement of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament is made up of 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), with the population of Scotland being represented by a number of 8 MSPs. The Scottish Parliament consists of two types of MSPs – a constituency MSP who represents the local area, and seven regional list MSPs who collectively represent the larger area that includes any given constituency.\nThe Scottish Parliament meets at Holyrood, located in the capital city of Edinburgh. Edinburgh is also the seat of Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister, as well as the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official residence of the monarch in Scotland. The highest courts in Scotland operating under the countries legal system – the High Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session (known collectively as the Supreme Courts of Scotland) – are based at Parliament House, Edinburgh.\nFor local government, Scotland has 32 council areas (unitary authorities). Below this uniform level of subdivision, there are varying levels of area committees in the larger rural council areas, and many small community councils throughout the country, although these are not universal. Scottish community councils have few if any powers beyond being a forum for raising issues of concern.\nWales\nWales has an elected, devolved legislature, the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ), from which the Welsh Government is drawn.\nFor local government, Wales consists of 22 unitary authorities: 10 county boroughs, 9 Counties, and 3 Cities.  Below these are community councils, which have powers similar to those of English parish councils.\nThe 22 unitary authorities are grouped into preserved counties, which are used for ceremonial purposes.  Although based on the counties used for local government between 1974 and 1996, they no longer have an administrative function.\nDemocratic representation\nParliaments\nEach of the 650 electoral areas or divisions called constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom has, since 1950, elected one Member of Parliament (MP) to represent it at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.  Before 1950, some constituencies elected two or more MPs using the plurality bloc vote system, and before the Reform Act 1832 nearly all constituencies in England returned two MPs.\nThe devolved Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd both use an additional member system of elections, which combines single-member constituencies with multi-member electoral regions.\nElections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are held under the single transferable vote (STV) system, in 18 multi-member constituencies.\nLocal government\nThe wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom are electoral districts at subnational level represented by one or more councillors at local authority level, or else used to divide the electorate into electoral districts for voting. It is the primary unit of British electoral geography.\nInformal divisions\nThere are also many informal, historical and special purpose regional designations. Some such as the Highlands of Scotland have or have had, to some extent, formal boundaries. Others such as the London commuter belt are more diffuse. Some such as Snowdonia () have a formal boundary in some contexts; in this case as a National Park. Others such as The Fens of eastern England are quite distinctly defined by geography but do not form any official entity.\nInternational subdivisions\nThe UK's Office for National Statistics, the International Organization for Standardization and before 2021 Eurostat, have developed subdivision codes for the UK. See ITL (UK) and ISO 3166-2:GB.\nDependent territories\nAdministrative units of the United Kingdom and its dependent territories\nThe United Kingdom has 17 dependent territories in total: three \"Crown Dependencies\" in the British Isles and in the English Channel and fourteen \"overseas territories\" scattered around the world.\nUnlike other former colonial powers, the British Government does not classify its overseas possessions (or the crown dependencies, which share historical ties with the British Crown) as subdivisions of the United Kingdom itself; rather, each is treated in law as a separate jurisdiction. Most have their own legislatures and a degree of autonomy usually exceeding that of the devolved UK nations, including fiscal independence.\nOut of the 14 overseas territories, 10 are autonomous, two used primarily as military bases, one uninhabited, and one an Antarctic claim.\nHowever, the UK retains varying degrees of responsibility in all of the territories, currently ranging from full political control to a largely ceremonial presence. The main reserved matters are the areas of diplomacy, international treaties, defence and security. The UK also retains in all territories a residual responsibility for 'good governance', a loosely defined constitutional concept recently exemplified by its imposition of direct rule following alleged serious corruption in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The UK parliament at Westminster, and the British Government through the Privy Council, both retain the power to legislate for the overseas territories – though by convention will usually only do so with each local government's consent.\nThe three Crown Dependencies within the British Isles are self-governing possessions of the British Crown. They are distinct from the British overseas territories of the United Kingdom.\nSee also\n*Countries of the United Kingdom\n*Types of subdivision of the United Kingdom\n*Devolution in the United Kingdom\n*European Parliament constituencies in the United Kingdom\n*British Isles (terminology)\n*British Overseas Territories\n*Crown Dependencies\n*List of subnational entities\n*Office for National Statistics coding system for counties, districts, wards and census areas\n*List of regions of the United Kingdom by Human Development Index\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071028044626/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/findcontactbrowse?r.l1=1073909872&topicId=1074537118 Browsable list of all UK local authorities' contact details and websites on the Business Link website]\n*[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/index.html Beginners' guide to UK geography – administrative geography]"
