In the 1980s it was converted into a public house and restaurant under the direction of the local architect James Brotherhood.  It was badly damaged by a fire in 2000, and has since been restored.  It has sincs been converted into a public house and music venue.\nArchitecture\nIt is built in brown brick with grey slate roofs.  It is in two blocks, that facing Raymond Street having two storeys, and the block facing Tower Wharf with three storeys.  In the smaller block the face overlooking the canal has two arches to allow for the entrance of boats for unloading.  On the corresponding face of the larger block are loading bays in each floor, now converted into windows.  The windows elsewhere are sashes.\nSee also\n*Grade II listed buildings in Chester (north and west)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.telfordswarehousechester.com/ Website of public house]"
