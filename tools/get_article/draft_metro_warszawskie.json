It was established in 1995 by transforming the General Directorate for Metro Construction into a budgetary unit, and in 2003, it became a private limited company owned by the city. It is the capital's operator of the underground railway, operating as part of public transportation commissioned by the Public Transport Authority in Warsaw under the Warsaw Public Transport brand.\nHistory\nOrigins (before 1983)\nThe history of the company dates back to 1971, when the construction of the Łazienki Route began, and the Directorate for the Construction of the Bridge Route – Łazienki was established to carry out this project. After the completion of the construction, organizational changes took place, and in connection with further planned investments in Warsaw, the Directorate for the Construction of Transport Routes was created on 1 September 1974 based on the company's assets.\nIn the autumn of 1974, the Directorate for Metro Construction was also established, with its headquarters at 27/31 . It served as an investment unit responsible for preparing the future operation of the metro and developed the technical and economic assumptions for the M1 metro line. On 1 July 1980, the body was taken over by the Directorate for the Construction of Transport Routes as a separate organizational unit.\nGeneral Directorate for Metro Construction (1983–1995)\nAfter the construction of the Toruń Route, most of the Directorate for the Construction of Transport Routes employees joined the General Directorate for Metro Construction. It was established on 10 February 1983 by ordinance no. 7 of the Mayor of Warsaw and began its activities as the investor and general contractor for the construction of the M1 line of the Warsaw Metro, which started on 15 April. Its headquarters were located at 77/79 Marszałkowska Street.\nIn 1989, the President of Warsaw entrusted General Directorate for Metro Construction with the role of operator during the initial period after the metro's launch. Due to the political and economic changes in the country, the scope of Directorate for the Construction of Transport Routes' activities and its organizational and legal form also changed. On 25 February 1992, the Board of the Association of Warsaw Districts and Municipalities adopted resolution no. 157/92, under which the company became an organizational unit of this association without legal personality.\nOn 7 April 1995, the first section of the Warsaw Metro was opened.\nMetro Warszawskie (after 1995)\nOn 1 August 1995, a budgetary unit of the City of Warsaw named Metro Warszawskie was established as the successor of Directorate for the Construction of Transport Routes. On 30 December 2002, Sławomir Skrzypek, the Deputy Mayor of Warsaw, issued an ordinance on behalf of the mayor, transforming the company into a private limited company on 1 January 2003. In 2003, the operator also moved its headquarters to 5 Wilczy Dół Street.\nActivity\nThe company's mission is to operate the Warsaw Metro. It utilizes and is responsible for maintaining the metro infrastructure provided by the city, which includes stations and tunnels. The company is bound by a commercial agreement with Warsaw Public Transport Authority, from which it receives compensation for operational activities, calculated based on an agreed rate per vehicle-kilometer.\nAn additional source of income for the company comes from its commercial and investment activities. The company receives remuneration for investment substitution and supervision of construction works related to the expansion of the metro network, which is an established part of the contracts signed.\nRolling stock\nPassenger trains\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Vehicle\n!Manufacturer\n!Production years\n!Number of cars\n!Number of trains\n!Source\n|-\n|81-717.3/714.3, 81-572/573, 81-572.1/573.1\n|Metrowagonmash, Mytishchi\nWagonmash, St. Petersburg\n|1989, 1994, 1997, 2007\n|90\n|15\n|\n|-\n|81-572.2/573.2\n|Wagonmash, St. Petersburg\n|2008–2009\n|42\n|7\n|\n|-\n|Metropolis 98B\n|Alstom, Barcelona\nKonstal, Chorzów\n|2000–2002, 2004–2005\n|108\n|18\n|\n|-\n|Inspiro\n|Siemens Mobility, Vienna\nAssembly: Newag, Nowy Sącz\n|2013–2014\n|210\n|35\n|\n|-\n|Škoda Varsovia\n|Škoda Transportation, Plzeň\n|from 2021\n|222\n|37\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Total\n|672\n|112\n|\n|}\nFile:81-717.3, Politechnika, 2013-10-30.jpg|81-717.3/714.3\nFile:81-572-573, Warsaw metro, Kabaty STP.jpg|81-572/573\nFile:81-572.2, Plac Wilsona, 2013-10-25.jpg|81-572.2/573.2\nFile:Alstom Metropolis 98B, Centrum, 2013-10-25.jpg|Metropolis 98B\nFile:Siemens Inspiro, A11 Politechnika, 2015-08-01.jpg|Inspiro\nFile:Skoda Varsovia 59WE, Warszawa, Stacja metra Bródno.jpg|Varsovia\nAuxiliary vehicles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Vehicle\n!Type\n!Production years\n!Number\n!Source\n|-\n|418D\n|switcher locomotive\n|1991\n|1\n| rowspan=\"10\" |\n|-\n|418Da\n|switcher locomotive\n|1999\n|1\n|-\n|797.8\n|switcher locomotive\n|2007\n|1\n|-\n|LM-400.00\n|switcher locomotive\n|2012\n|1\n|-\n|DS-10-03\n|draisine\n|1989, 1994\n|2\n|-\n|DS-Ż-03\n|draisine\n|1991, 1994\n|2\n|-\n|PWM-10\n|draisine\n|1990–1991, 1993, 2000\n|13\n|-\n|PWM-10W\n|draisine\n|1994\n|5\n|-\n|ZPA-10/M\n|low floor platform\n|2006, 2008\n|2\n|-\n|208Kg/M\n|railroad car\n|1987\n|2\n|}\nFile:418D-001, STP Kabaty, 2007-09-22.JPG|418D\nFile:LM-400.00.jpg|LM-400.00\nFinance and transport performance\nThe initial authorised capital of the company on 1 January 2003 was 210 million PLN, while since 22 August 2012, its value has been 328,917,500.00 PLN.
