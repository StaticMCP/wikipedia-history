Brander's batting style is unknown. He was born at Dartford, Kent.\nEducated at Cheltenham College, where he played for the college cricket team, Brander made a single first-class appearance for the Orleans Club against the touring Australians in 1878 at the Orleans Club Ground. Batting once in the match, Brander was dismissed for 2 runs by Frank Allan in a match which ended in a draw.\nOutside of cricket, Brander served in the East Surrey Regiment as a captain, serving from 1864 until his death at Southbourne, Hampshire on 2 May 1883.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/9951.html Edward Brander] at ESPNcricinfo\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/28/28095/28095.html Edward Brander] at CricketArchive"
