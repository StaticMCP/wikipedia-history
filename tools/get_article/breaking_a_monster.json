The film follows the teen heavy metal band Unlocking the Truth through a monumental year in which they take on a manager (Alan Sacks, known for creating Welcome Back Kotter, producing Thrashin’ and for his work with The Jonas Brothers), sign a $1.8 million record deal with Sony Music, tour across North America, and record their first album. The film is made in an observational style, following the teen musicians, Alec Atkins, Malcom Brickhouse and Jarad Dawkins, through a series of life-changing events, touching on themes of child-stardom, racial representation and the stark realities of the music industry.\nThe feature documentary followed a short from two years earlier that Luke Meyer had made about the band when they were 11 year-olds. The feature documentary was produced by Black Label Media with SeeThink Films.\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the South By SouthWest Film Festival on  March 14, 2015. It played at film festivals in many different counties, including the HotDocs Film Festival, Sheffield DocFest, BAM CinemaFest, Zurich Film Festival, Indie Memphis, Camden International Film Festival, RIDM, Wind-Up Fest, CPH:DOX and others.

It won the Jury Prize at Sound Unseen, and Best Music Documentary at the UK Music Video Awards. The film was released theatrically by Abramorama, premiering on June 24, 2016 at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens where Unlocking the Truth also played a live concert.\nCritical Response\nThe film has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a “generally favorable” 72/100 rating on Metacritic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://unlockingthetruthband.com/index.html  Unlocking the Truth band website]"
