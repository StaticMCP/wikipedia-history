It was released in 2004 as the lead single from their second album, We Are Not Alone. Despite never having reached the number one spot on the Mainstream Rock chart, \"So Cold\" holds the record for the most weeks spent in the chart with 62 weeks. The single was certified Platinum by the RIAA on September 15, 2015, just before the band's debut album Saturate was certified Gold. A reimagined version was released on October 31, 2019 in anticipation for their 2020 album, Aurora.\nBackground and writing\nThe movie 28 Days Later was an inspiration while Benjamin Burnley was writing the song.\nIn 2020, Burnley told Apple Music,\n}}\nMusic video\nThe music video of \"So Cold\" was directed by Frank Borin. The story is set in early US history, and it is interpolated with the band playing the song.\nThe video opens by showing a preacher standing at the edge of a swamp. The scene then shifts to a group of people walking in a forest. One man can be seen carrying a large stone with the Breaking Benjamin Celtic knot on it. The man, who is being punished for infidelity, is shackled to the stone throughout the video and struggles to free himself from it. Towards the end, the group of people arrive at the swamp where the preacher stands. The man carrying the stone walks into the swamp and drowns.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Chart (2004)\n!
