It was opened in 1987 by the Mesa Historical Society to preserve the history of Mesa, Arizona.\nThe museum's exhibits include a comprehensive history of Mesa, a replica of an early adobe one-room schoolhouse, as well as additional galleries of changing exhibits. The museum also maintains a large collection of historic agricultural equipment.\nThe museum buildings are in fact the museum's largest artifacts.  The main museum building was built in 1913-1914 for use as the Lehi School in what was then Lehi, Arizona.  The auditorium was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project.  The two-building complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 as the \"Lehi School\".\nIn 2008, the museum began developing a popular exhibit about Spring Training (baseball) in Arizona, called \"Play Ball: The Cactus League Experience.\" The exhibition has since expanded to locations throughout Maricopa County.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mesahistoricalmuseum.com/ Mesa Historical Museum] – official site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110402005850/http://www.playballexperience.com/about/cactus-league/ Play Ball: The Cactus League Experience]"
