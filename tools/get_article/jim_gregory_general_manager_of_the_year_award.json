The current title holder is Jim Nill, of the Dallas Stars.\nHistory\nIn 1993, Brian Burke, who was at the time working for the league, suggested the General Manager of the Year Award. However, it was not created until the 2009–10 season. It was presented during the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals at the annual GM meeting, rather than during the Awards ceremony with the majority of the other NHL Awards. The next season, it was announced that the award would be included in the full ceremony.\nOn November 19, 2019, the NHL announced it would rename the award in honour of Jim Gregory, the recently deceased former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and former NHL executive. The official name is changed to the \"Jim Gregory General Manager of the Year Award.\"\nOn June 22, 2021, New York Islanders General Manager Lou Lamoriello became the first general manager to win the award twice.\nOn June 27, 2025, Dallas Stars General Manager Jim Nill became the first general manager to win the award three times.\nWinners\n, first executive with multiple wins, which were won consecutively in 2019–20 and 2020–21.]]\n;Key\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: af9f9f9; border: 1px aaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\n|-\n!style=\"background: ae3e3e3;\" |Season\n!style=\"background: ae3e3e3;\" |Winner\n!style=\"background: ae3e3e3;\" |Team\n!style=\"background: ae3e3e3;\" |Win #\n|-\n|\n| Don Maloney\n| Phoenix Coyotes\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| Mike Gillis\n| Vancouver Canucks\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Doug Armstrong\n| St. Louis Blues\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| Ray Shero\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| Bob Murray\n| Anaheim Ducks\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Steve Yzerman\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| Jim Rutherford\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| David Poile\n| Nashville Predators\n| 1\n|-\n|\n| George McPhee\n| Vegas Golden Knights\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Don Sweeney\n| Boston Bruins\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Lou Lamoriello\n| New York Islanders\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n|Lou Lamoriello\n|New York Islanders\n|2\n|-\n|\n| Joe Sakic\n| Colorado Avalanche\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Jim Nill\n| Dallas Stars\n| 1\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Jim Nill\n| Dallas Stars\n| 2\n|-bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n|\n| Jim Nill\n| Dallas Stars\n| 3\n|}\nSee also\n*List of National Hockey League awards\n*List of NHL General Managers\nReferences\n;General\n*[http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=80942 NHL General Manager of the Year Award] at NHL.com\n;Specific"
