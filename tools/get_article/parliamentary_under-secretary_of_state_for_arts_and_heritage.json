From 1992 to 1997, the post was combined with the office of Secretary of State for National Heritage. The title of the post was changed to Minister for Culture in 2005, and to Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism in 2007. Under that last title, the office was held by Barbara Follett MP, who was appointed on 5 October 2008, until 22 September 2009.\nEd Vaizey was appointed by then Prime Minister David Cameron to the position as Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries at Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State level, a post Vaizey initially split between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), but is now entirely placed in the DCMS.\nCurrent portfolio\n*Arts and museums\n*Ceremonials\n*DCMS business in the Lords\nMinisters for the Arts\nThe individuals who have held the office of Minister for the Arts or equivalent existing positions, their terms and under which Prime Minister.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Term start\n!Term end\n!Title\n!Prime Minister\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Jennie Lee\n|1964\n|1967\n|Minister of State for the Arts\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Harold Wilson\n|-\n|1967\n|1970\n|Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Arts\n|-\n|The Viscount Eccles\n|20 June 1970\n|5 June 1973\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Minister of State for the Arts\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Edward Heath\n|-\n|Norman St John-Stevas\n|2 December 1973\n|4 March 1974\n|-\n|Hugh Jenkins\n|4 March 1974\n|5 April 1976\n|Harold Wilson\n|-\n|The Lord Donaldson of Kingsbridge\n|5 April 1976\n|4 May 1979\n|James Callaghan\n|-\n|Norman St John-Stevas\n|5 May 1979\n|5 January 1981\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Margaret Thatcher\n|-\n|Paul Channon\n|5 January 1981\n|11 June 1983\n|-\n|The Earl of Gowrie\n|11 June 1983\n|2 September 1985\n|-\n|Richard Luce\n|3 September 1985\n|25 July 1990\n|-\n|David Mellor\n|26 July 1990\n|28 November 1990\n|-\n|Tim Renton\n|28 November 1990\n|11 April 1992\n| rowspan=\"5\" |John Major\n|-\n|David Mellor\n|11 April 1992\n|22 September 1992\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Secretary of State for National Heritage\n|-\n|Peter Brooke CH\n|22 September 1992\n|20 July 1994\n|-\n|Stephen Dorrell\n|20 July 1994\n|5 July 1995\n|-\n|Virginia Bottomley\n|5 July 1995\n|2 May 1997\n|-\n|Mark Fisher\n|2 May 1997\n|14 June 1998\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Arts\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Tony Blair\n|-\n|Alan Howarth\n|28 July 1998\n|7 June 2001\n|-\n|The Baroness Blackstone\n|8 June 2001\n|13 June 2003\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Minister of State for the Arts\n|-\n|Estelle Morris\n|13 June 2003\n|5 May 2005\n|-\n|David Lammy\n|5 May 2005\n|28 June 2007\n|Minister of State for Culture\n|-\n|Margaret Hodge\n|28 June 2007\n|3 October 2008\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Minister of State for Culture and Tourism\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Gordon Brown\n|-\n|Barbara Follett\n|4 October 2008\n|22 September 2009\n|-\n|Margaret Hodge\n|22 September 2009\n|11 May 2010\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ed Vaizey\n|14 May 2010\n|15 July 2014\n|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries\n| rowspan=\"2\" |David Cameron\n|-\n|15 July 2014\n|15 July 2016\n|Minister of State for Culture and the Digital Economy\n|-\n|Matt Hancock\n|15 July 2016\n|8 January 2018\n|Minister of State for Digital and Culture\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Theresa May\n|-\n|Margot James\n|9 January 2018\n|18 July 2019\n|Minister of State for Digital and Creative Industries\n|-\n|Nigel Adams\n|24 July 2019\n|13 February 2020\n|Minister of State for Sport, Media and Creative Industries\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Boris Johnson\n|-\n|Caroline Dinenage\n|13 February 2020\n|15 September 2021\n|Minister of State for Digital and Culture\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |The Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay\n|30 September 2021\n|20 September 2022\n|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Arts\n|-\n|27 October 2022\n|March 2024\n|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Arts and Heritage\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Rishi Sunak\n|-\n|27 March 2024\n|5 July 2024\n|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Arts, Heritage and Libraries\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060213234922/http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AF79456A-D133-4963-BF68-8030D4B2E3F3/0/PastMinistersArts12052005.pdf UK Government document listing past Ministers for the Arts], DCMS (PDF)."
