It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its historical significance in architectural, military and social history.\nHistory\nThe United States Army built the hospital in the 1830s for Fort Howard. After the fort's decommissioning, the building was moved to the corner of Kellogg Street and Chestnut Street and was used as a private residence. In 1975, it was moved to its current location. Currently, it serves as a museum.\nSee also\n*List of the oldest buildings in Wisconsin\nReferences"
