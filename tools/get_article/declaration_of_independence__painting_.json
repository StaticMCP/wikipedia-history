      "text": "# Declaration of Independence (painting)\n\nDeclaration of Independence is a  oil-on-canvas painting by the American artist John Trumbull depicting the presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence to Congress. It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the Yale University Art Gallery. Trumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life, and visited Independence Hall to depict the chamber where the Second Continental Congress met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the United States Capitol rotunda in 1826.\nThe painting is sometimes incorrectly described as depicting the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The painting shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the famous copy, which took place mainly on August 2.\nThe painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also depicted several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including John Dickinson, who declined to sign. Trumbull had no portrait of Benjamin Harrison V to work with, but his son Benjamin Harrison VI was said to resemble his father, so Trumbull painted him instead. Similarly, Trumbull painted Rufus Hopkins, who resembled his father Stephen Hopkins, for whom no portrait was available. As the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men featured in the painting never were in the same room at the same time.\nKey to historical figures depicted in the painting\nFile:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|Trumbull's Declaration of Independence\ndesc bottom-right\nrect 4 1044 38 1130 George Wythe\nrect 38 1026 86 1119 William Whipple\nrect 93 1046 139 1133 Josiah Bartlett\nrect 147 1055 197 1133 Thomas Lynch Jr.\nrect 215 1037 293 1138 Benjamin Harrison\nrect 424 1049 491 1140 Richard Henry Lee\nrect 492 1051 533 1139 Samuel Adams\nrect 537 1055 582 1140 George Clinton\nrect 287 856 356 940 William Paca\nrect 366 855 417 948 Samuel Chase\nrect 456 886 503 960 Lewis Morris\nrect 506 913 549 987 William Floyd\nrect 575 958 619 1015 Arthur Middleton\nrect 601 1053 638 1108 Thomas Heyward Jr.\nrect 640 1069 689 1125 Charles Carroll\nrect 700 1076 734 1126 George Walton\nrect 741 1086 787 1144 Robert Morris\nrect 794 1071 824 1125 Thomas Willing\nrect 838 1086 881 1147 Benjamin Rush\nrect 902 1092 942 1153 Elbridge Gerry\nrect 946 1087 981 1149 Robert Treat Paine\nrect 987 1095 1019 1151 Abraham Clark\nrect 816 962 850 1010 Stephen Hopkins\nrect 855 966 889 1019 William Ellery\nrect 894 965 928 1015 George Clymer\nrect 1064 1099 1106 1155 William Hooper\nrect 1114 1098 1153 1150 Joseph Hewes\nrect 1203 1093 1247 1148 James Wilson\nrect 1256 1104 1293 1153 Francis Hopkinson\nrect 1427 858 1510 955 John Adams\nrect 1519 806 1590 911 Roger Sherman\nrect 1592 833 1652 928 Robert R.

Although Charles Thomson was one of two members listed by name in the earlier Dunlap Broadside as having attested to the Declaration, and many historians believe he had signed the original document that was lost. Clinton was not present at the signing of the Declaration.)\nUnpainted signers\nThere were 14 signers of the Declaration who did not appear in the painting:\n*Matthew Thornton (New Hampshire)\n*John Hart (New Jersey)\n*John Morton (Pennsylvania)\n*James Smith (Pennsylvania)\n*George Taylor (Pennsylvania)\n*George Ross (Pennsylvania)\n*Caesar Rodney (Delaware)\n*Thomas Stone (Maryland)\n*Thomas Nelson, Jr. (Virginia)\n*Francis Lightfoot Lee (Virginia)\n*Carter Braxton (Virginia)\n*John Penn (North Carolina)\n*Button Gwinnett (Georgia)\n*Lyman Hall (Georgia)\nOn U.S. currency and postage stamps\npostage stamp]]\nTrumbull's Declaration of Independence signing scene painting has been depicted several times on United States currency and postage stamps. It was first used on the reverse side of the $100 National Bank Note that was issued in 1863. The depiction was engraved by Frederick Girsch of the American Bank Note Company. The same steel engraving was used on the 24¢ stamp issued six years later as part of the 1869 pictorial series of definitive U.S. postage stamps.\nTrumbull's painting is presently depicted on the reverse of the two-dollar bill. Featured in it are 40 of the 47 figures from Trumbull's painting.  Cut out from the scene are: the farthest four figures on the left—George Wythe, William Whipple, Josiah Bartlett, and Thomas Lynch, Jr.; the farthest two figures on the right—Thomas McKean and Philip Livingston; and one of three figures seated in the left rear—George Walton. Additionally, two unrecognized figures were added: one in between Samuel Chase and Lewis Morris and another between James Wilson and Francis Hopkinson, bringing the total number of figures shown in this presentation scene to 42.\nOther versions\nTrumbull painted a smaller version (only ) entitled The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 (1786–1820) that is now on view at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.\nLegacy and interpretations\nIn 2017, the company Ancestry.com restaged the painting with the 29 living descendants of the men depicted in Trumbull's painting as part of an advertising campaign called “Declaration Descendants\". The campaign included two short films and ran on digital and social media platforms.  Shannon Lanier, a descendant of Thomas Jefferson, said: “When you see the new picture, the new image, it’s a picture of diverse people. Black, white, Hispanic, Native American—a little bit of everything—Asian, and that’s more of a representation of this country.”\nIn the 2008 HBO miniseries John Adams, in one of the final scenes of the series, the painter John Trumbull is showing his massive mural to an elderly John Adams for his approval. While staring at the painting Adams mentions, \"They're all dead ... except me and Jefferson.\" He then expresses to Trumbull his disapproval of the work. This leads to a brief argument between the men about the difference between artistic license and historical accuracy. The scene itself is entirely fictional, but serves as a warning towards the fictionalization of the past itself with Adams stating \"It is very bad history\".\nAlthough Thomas Jefferson appears to be stepping on John Adams' shoe in the painting, which many thought symbolized their relationship as friendly rivals, upon closer examination it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the two-dollar bill version.\nOn the farthest wall hangs a display of trumpets, drum, and regimental colours captured from British regiments. This is not depicted in all versions, most notably the one seen on the two-dollar bill.\nSee also\n*Congress Voting Independence, a similar painting by Robert Edge Pine, 1784-1788\n*Declaration of Independence Tablet, Boston Common\n*Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States &ndash; a 1940 painting depicting members of the 1787 Constitutional Convention by Howard Chandler Christy.\n* Founding Fathers of the United States\n* Syng inkstand, pictured in the painting\nReferences\nExternal links\n;Keys to the figures\n*[http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html Another key to the figures]\n*[http://www.quiz-tree.com/Declaration-of-Independence-Trumbull.html Declaration of Independence Flash - based key]\n;Other\n*[http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/trumbull.htm A web page with some information on the painting]\n*[http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/rotunda/declaration_independence.cfm Architect of the Capitol] Web page on the painting"
