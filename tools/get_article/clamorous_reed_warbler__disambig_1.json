It breeds from Egypt eastwards through Pakistan, Afghanistan and northernmost India to south China and southeast Asia. A. s. meridionalis is an endemic race in Sri Lanka.\nSubspecies\nNine subspecies are recognised:\n* A. s. stentoreus (Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833) – Egypt\n* A. s. levantinus Roselaar, 1994 – Israel, Jordan, Syria and northwest Arabia\n* A. s. brunnescens (Jerdon, 1839) – Red Sea region to Kazakhstan and north India\n* A. s. amyae Baker, ECS, 1922 – northeast India, Myanmar, Thailand and south China\n* A. s. meridionalis (Legge, 1875) – south India and Sri Lanka\n* A. s. harterti Salomonsen, 1928 – Philippines (except Palawan group and Sulu Archipelago)\n* A. s. siebersi Salomonsen, 1928 – west Java\n* A. s. celebensis Heinroth, 1903 – Sulawesi\n* A. s. lentecaptus Hartert, EJO, 1924 – Borneo and central, east Java to Sumbawa (west Lesser Sunda Islands)\nDescription\nClamorous reed warbler is a large song thrush-sized warbler at 18–20&nbsp;cm. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and whitish underparts. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers. It is very like the great reed warbler, but that species has richer coloured underparts.\nThere are a number of races differing in plumage shades. The migratory northern race has the richest brown upperparts, and the endemic Sri Lanka subspecies is the darkest form.\nLike most warblers, the clamorous reed warbler is insectivorous, but will take other small prey items.\nThe song is loud and far-carrying, but less raucous than that of the great reed warbler. It is a slow, chattering  with typically acrocephaline whistles and mimicry added.\nHabitat\nMost populations are sedentary, but the breeding birds in Pakistan, Afghanistan and north India are migratory, wintering in peninsular India and Sri Lanka.\nThis passerine bird is a species found in large reed beds, often with some bushes. 3-6 eggs are laid in a basket nest in reeds.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) in Kolkata W IMG 3245.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) at Kolkata W2.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) at Kolkata W.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) at Kolkata W IMG 3366.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) at Kolkata W IMG 3265.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) at Kolkata W IMG 3222.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) in Kolkata I IMG 2728.jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler I32.jpg| At Nalban in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nImage:Clamorous reed warbler1.jpg\nImage:Clamorous Reed Warbler I .jpg| In  Kolkata, West Bengal, India.\nFile:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) in AP W IMG 4054.jpg|in Kolleru Lake, Andhra Pradesh, India.\nFile:Clamorous Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus stentoreus) in AP W IMG 4053.jpg|in Kolleru Lake, Andhra Pradesh, India.\n-->\nReferences\n* Warblers of Europe, Asia and North Africa by Baker, ISBN\n* Birds of India by Grimmett, Inskipp and Inskipp, ISBN"
