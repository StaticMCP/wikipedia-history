It was released on August 22, 2025, via DeadAir Records. It was preceded by the singles \"Wrenches\", \"Observer\", and \"Aviator\". Writing and production on the album was handled entirely by Quannnic.\nLyrically, Warbrained is a concept album about a military veteran struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and spiraling mentally.\nBackground\nQuannnic released the album's first single, \"Wrenches\", on January 24, 2025. A shoegaze song, it was described by BrooklynVegan as \"hazy\" and \"hooky\". The title, cover art, and release date for Warbrained were officially announced on June 20, alongside the release of its second single, \"Observer\". The song's music video, directed by BlindLight and Midvessel, was described by Neville Hardman of Alternative Press as feeling like a \"dark hallucination\", with a \"trio of ghoulish surgeons [performing] an operation in the background\". The album's tracklist was also revealed by Alternative Press on June 23. On June 24, Quannnic announced their first-ever headlining tour in support of the album, which is set to begin in September and conclude in October, and will include DeadAir labelmate Kmoe as the opening act. The album's third single, \"Aviator\", was released on August 1, alongside a music video directed by BlindLight.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
