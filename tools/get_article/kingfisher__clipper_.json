It eventually sailed out of Uruguay. She was one of the longest lived clipper ships, with a sailing life of 36 years and 5 months.}}\nVoyages\nKingfisher arrived in Honolulu:\nOn 20 June 1871, en route from San Francisco to New York, she sprang a leak and put into Montevideo, Uruguay, in distress. Was surveyed, condemned, and, in November 1871, was sold to the Ciblis family of that city. She was repaired, renamed Jaime Ciblis and sailed under the Uruguayan flag until 1890.}}\nFate\nIn 1890 she was \"sold at auction and broken up in Montevideo Bay\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://capecodhistory.us/19th/Brewster_Ship_Masters.htm Tully Crosby], commander of brig Old Colony, barque Arab, and ships Kingfisher, Monterey, Antelope of Boston and Charlotte.\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=LAoCAAAAQAAJ&dq=kingfisher+clipper&pg=PA121 Heave Ahoy!], chantey about the Kingfisher\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=4NkbAAAAIAAJ&dq=kingfisher+clipper&pg=RA1-PA385 Zera L.
