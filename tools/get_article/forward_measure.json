The use of forward measure was pioneered by Farshid Jamshidian (1987), and later used as a means of calculating the price of options on bonds.\nMathematical definition\nLet\n: B(T) = \\exp\\left(\\int_0^T r(u)\\, du\\right)\nbe the bank account or money market account numeraire and\n: D(T) = 1/B(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^T r(u)\\, du\\right)\nbe the discount factor in the market at time 0 for maturity T.  If Q_* is the risk neutral measure, then the forward measure Q_T is defined via the Radon–Nikodym derivative given by\n:\\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} = \\frac{1}{B(T) E_{Q_*}[1/B(T)]} = \\frac{D(T)}{E_{Q_*}[D(T)]}.\nNote that this implies that the forward measure and the risk neutral measure coincide when interest rates are deterministic.  Also, this is a particular form of the change of numeraire formula by changing the numeraire from the money market or bank account B(t) to a T-maturity bond P(t,T). Indeed, if in general\n:P(t,T) = E_{Q_*}\\left[\\frac{B(t)}{B(T)}|\\mathcal{F}(t)\\right] = E_{Q_*}\\left[\\frac{D(T)}{D(t)}|\\mathcal{F}(t)\\right]\nis the price of a zero coupon bond at time t for maturity T, where \\mathcal{F}(t) is the filtration denoting market information at time t, then we can write\n:\\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} = \\frac{B(0) P(T,T)}{B(T) P(0,T)}\nfrom which it is indeed clear that the forward T measure is associated to the T-maturity zero coupon bond as numeraire. For a more detailed discussion see Brigo and Mercurio (2001).\nConsequences\nThe name \"forward measure\" comes from the fact that under the forward measure, forward prices are martingales, a fact first observed by Geman (1989) (who is responsible for formally defining the measure).  Compare with futures prices, which are martingales under the risk neutral measure.  Note that when interest rates are deterministic, this implies that forward prices and futures prices are the same.\nFor example, the discounted stock price is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure:\n:S(t) D(t) = E_{Q_*}[D(T)S(T) | \\mathcal{F}(t)].\\,\nThe forward price is given by F_S(t,T) = \\frac{S(t)}{P(t,T)}.  Thus, we have F_S(T,T)=S(T)\n:F_S(t,T) = \\frac{E_{Q_*}[D(T)S(T) | \\mathcal{F}(t)]}{D(t) P(t,T)}= E_{Q_T}[F_S(T,T) | \\mathcal{F}(t)]\\frac{E_{Q_*}[D(T)|\\mathcal{F}(t)]}{D(t) P(t,T)}\nby using the Radon-Nikodym derivative \\frac{dQ_T}{dQ_*} and the equality F_S(T,T)=S(T).  The last term is equal to unity by definition of the bond price so that we get\n:F_S(t,T) = E_{Q_T}[F_S(T,T)|\\mathcal{F}(t)].\\,\nReferences\n*\nSee also\n*Risk-neutral measure\n*Forward price"
