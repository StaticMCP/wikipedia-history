He made a living by compilation and editorial work for booksellers.\nKimber spent the years 1742 to 1744 in British North America, and drew on his travels in subsequent writing. In 1745–6 he published a series of Itinerant Observations in America in The London Magazine, at that point edited by his father.\nWorks\nKimber wrote:\n*A Relation, or Journal, of a Late Expedition to the Gates of St. Augustine, on Florida (1744). Kimber had served in the militia of James Oglethorpe, and participated in a raid in 1743 that was a sequel to the 1740 siege of St. Augustine, Florida.\n* The Life and Adventures of Joe Thompson, a Narrative founded on fact, written by himself [anon.], 2 vols., London, 1750; other editions, 1751, 1775, 1783. A French translation appeared in 1762. A \"ramble novel\", it sold well at the time, and was then condemned to neglect.\n* The History of the Life and Adventures of Mr. Anderson (1754). A sentimental novel, it was based on a real-life narrative Kimber had heard in Georgia. Kimber denounced slavery, but is now found to be equivocal on the related issue, in the American context, of white supremacy.\n* The Life and Adventures of James Ramble (1754)\n* The Juvenile Adventures of David Ranger (1756)\n* The Life,  Extraordinary Adventures, Voyages, and Surprizing Escapes of Capt. Neville Frowde, of Cork (1758)\n* The Happy Orphans (1759), translation from the French. The French original of 1754 was itself imitated from the Fortunate Foundlings of Eliza Haywood.\n* Maria: The Genuine Memoirs of an Admired Lady of Rank and Fortune (1764)\n* The Generous Briton: or, the Authentic Memoirs of William Goldsmith (1765)\n* The Peerage of England, London, 1766; 2nd edit. 1769.\n* The Peerage of Scotland, London, 1767.\n* The Peerage of Ireland, London, 1768.\n* The Extinct Peerage of England, London, 1769.\nHe also wrote memoirs of his father, together with a poem to his memory, prefixed to Isaac Kimber's Sermons, 1756. With Richard Johnson he edited and continued Thomas Wooton's Baronetage of England, 3 vols., London, 1771.\nNotes\n;Attribution"
