An official commercial version was released on July 19, 2019.\n''King's Mouth'' is a concept album that was conceived as the soundtrack to an art exhibit of the same name by frontman Wayne Coyne, which opened in 2017. The album features Mick Jones of The Clash providing narration on several tracks.\nThe concept of the album follows the storyline of a royal baby who is born to a mother that perishes during labor due to the baby's brain being too big. His brain is used to save a city from an avalanche, devouring the whole universe with his teeth. He dies in the process, and his followers chop off his head to live inside it for eternity.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Consequence of Sound\n| rev2score = B−\n| rev3 = NME\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Pitchfork\n| rev4score = 7.0/10\n| rev5 = PopMatters\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = Slant Magazine\n| rev6score =\n}}\nOn Metacritic, ''King's Mouth received a score of 74 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reception.
