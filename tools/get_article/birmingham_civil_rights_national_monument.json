Civil rights protesters took to the streets of Birmingham, Alabama to fight in favor of Project C, a campaign against laws limiting African Americans freedoms. They were met with violent resistance from the police. The monument spans an approximately five-block area of  in the Birmingham Civil Rights District near Downtown Birmingham. It is administered by the National Park Service.\nHistory\nBirmingham was the site of the 1963 Birmingham campaign; Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail; the Children's Crusade, with its images of students being attacked by water hoses and dogs; the bombing of the A.G. Gaston Motel – the movement's headquarters motel – and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.\nPresident Barack Obama signed a proclamation on January 12, 2017, which designated half of the  Birmingham Civil Rights District as a U.S. National Monument. The purpose of this proclamation was to protect the history that came from the Reconstruction, tell stories, and illustrate how the Era redefined freedom. Other proclamations signed the same day established the Freedom Riders National Monument in Anniston and the Reconstruction Era National Monument in Beaufort County, South Carolina.\nScope\nThe national monument is within the larger Birmingham Civil Rights District, which was designated in 1992 by the City of Birmingham. The National Park Service only has ownership in the A.G. Gaston Motel (), which now hosts the visitor center. Additional historic sites within the monument boundaries that partner with the NPS include the 16th Street Baptist Church, Kelly Ingram Park, St. Paul United Methodist Church, the Masonic Temple Building, and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The historic Bethel Baptist Church in Birmingham's Collegeville neighborhood also partners with the monument but it outside the boundary.\nSee also\n* Fourth Avenue Historic District\n* Freedom Riders National Monument\n* Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home National Monument\n* Civil rights movement in popular culture\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Birmingham, Alabama\n* List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/bicr/index.htm Official National Park Service site]\n*"
