The awards were not televised and were only awarded for Melbourne television, as all major cities had different stations. American actor Hugh O'Brian was the guest host and presented some awards on Graham Kennedy's light entertainment variety show In Melbourne Tonight.\nFollowing the awards in this year, Kennedy who won the \"Star of the Year\" award coined the ceremony the \"Logie Awards\" as a tribute to honour Scottish engineer and innovator John Logie Baird who contributed to the development of television as a practical medium.
