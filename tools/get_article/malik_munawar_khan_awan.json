He received a gallantry award for his work during Operation Gibraltar in 1965.\nEarly life\nMunawar was born to a Muslim family of the Awan tribe in Chakwal, Punjab, British India. As a young boy, he was spotted winning an athletics race that he had entered on the spur of the moment and was nurtured by the British for a role in the army.\nCareer\nAwan was among those captured and made prisoner of war by Japanese forces while trying to defend Singapore in World War II. He learned the Japanese language while incarcerated and his fluency brought him to the attention of his captors. They moved him out of the prison camp and enlisted him in the Imperial Japanese Army, where he received special training.\nWhen the Indian National Army, led by Subhas Chandra Bose, was formed in 1942, Awan joined its fight for Indian independence from British rule. He was captured by the Allied forces and returned to India to stand trial for treason at the end of World War II.\nAwan was freed, along with other INA prisoners, when the Partition of India occurred. He moved to Pakistan and was invited to join the Pakistan Army by prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan. He then joined the Azad Kashmir Regular Forces (AKRF), which later became the Azad Kashmir Regiment.\nOperation Gibraltar was launched in July 1965 with the aim of Pakistani infiltration of Jammu & Kashmir. Awan, who now held the rank of major, was involved in this, leading troops in heavy fighting at a pass near to Rajouri. He controlled an area of around 500 square miles for a period of three months and, according to Lt General Mahmud Ahmed in his book War 1965, Munawar enjoyed full support from the local population of the valley. By the time the Second Kashmir War ended, Munawar was in effective control of Rajouri valley and welcomed UN military observers who landed in Rajouri valley to monitor the ceasefire. However, after the Tashkent Agreement between India and Pakistan, he was ordered to withdraw his forces and return to Rawalpindi.\nAwan was awarded the Sitara-i-Jurat for his actions in the Rajouri valley, and was also referred to as the \"King of Rajouri\" by Field Marshal Ayub Khan. He died a few years later.\nMemorials\nMunawar Pass, a pass in Pir Panjal mountain range north of Pir ki Gali overlooking the town of Rajouri in the union territory of Kashmir was named after Major Munawar by the locals.\nReferences"
