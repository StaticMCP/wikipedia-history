The rebellion, led by Mihran Baloch, took place in the dense forests surrounding Bakhar and posed a challenge to the authority of the Samma ruler, Jam Taghlak.\nBackground\nDuring the early 15th century, the Samma dynasty controlled much of Sindh, including the strategic town of Bakhar. The Baloch tribes of the region, who often lived on the peripheries of settled areas, maintained a degree of independence but occasionally clashed with the central authority. In circa 1429, under the leadership of Mihran Baloch, the tribes in Bakhar rose in defiance against Jam Taghlak's rule.\nThe Rebellion\nThe uprising began in the forested lands around Bakhar, where the Baloch tribes gathered in significant numbers. Jam Taghlak, upon learning of the revolt, mobilised around 6,000 troops from the Samma forces and marched into the area. After a series of confrontations, the Samma army decisively defeated the rebels. Mihran Baloch was captured and executed along with several other prominent tribal chiefs.\nAftermath\nFollowing the suppression of the rebellion, the Samma authorities stationed soldiers and policemen in the Bakhar forests to secure the area and prevent further unrest. This measure effectively curtailed Baloch activity in the region for a period of time.\nReferences"
