The emblem features a sunrise accented by sunbeams, the hammer and sickle for the victory of communism and the \"world-wide socialist community of states\", and the red star to represent the affiliation to communism. The emblem consists mainly of the colors red, yellow and green.\nIn the lower part the interlaced text reads in , an abbreviation for  ('Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic'). To the right, rye stalks encircle the center of the coat of arms, and to the left arcs a branch of a coniferous tree.\nThe banner bears the Soviet Union state motto, \"Workers of the world, unite!\", in both Estonian and Russian.\nThe official usage of the Soviet emblem was discontinued in Estonia in 1990, as the country switched back to the original coat of arms of independent Estonia along with other national symbols, display of which had been banned under the Soviet rule.\nSee also\n* Coat of arms of Estonia\nReferences"
