They were first held in 1989, and recognise excellence in all areas of Australian radio broadcasting including news, talk, sport, music and entertainment. They are run annually by Commercial Radio Australia and hosted in either Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or the Gold Coast.\nThere are typically 33 award categories that are peer judged across three divisions: metropolitan, provincial and country commercial radio stations.  All judging panels are composed of industry members.\nIn September 2025, Commercial Radio Australia announced the permanent cancellation of the Commercial Australian Radio Awards (ACRAs), citing high operational costs and a strategic shift toward funding alternative initiatives.\nAwards Format\nThe awards are organised into various categories, with nominees being announced a few weeks before the main awards ceremony.  Usually four (on rare occasions five) entries are shortlisted in each of the three divisions and an overall division winner is selected from these finalists, meaning three separate awards are given out per category (one each for metropolitan, provincial and country). A hall of fame member is also generally inducted each year.\nThe night is hosted by an industry member (or members), who is (are) generally employed in an on-air capacity, with revolving hosts throughout the night presenting specific awards.\nPrevious Winners\nA full list of winners can be found on the Australian Commercial Radio Awards website. All winners listed below are in the Metropolitan division.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Year\n| colspan=\"2\" |Best On-Air Team\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Networked Program\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Music Presenter\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Best Talk Presenter\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hall of Fame Inductee\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Host\n| rowspan=\"2\" |City\n|-\n|FM\n|AM\n|-\n|2024\n|Jonesy & Amanda;
