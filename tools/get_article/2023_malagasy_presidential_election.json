On 12 October 2023, it was announced that the election would be postponed by one week to 16 November because of pre-election unrest.\nAndry Rajoelina was re-elected to another term with 58.95% of the vote in the first round. Turnout was 46.36%, the lowest in a presidential election in the country's history.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Madagascar is elected using the two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of the votes in the first round, a run-off will be held.\nCandidates\nA total of 28 candidates applied to run for the presidency. In the High Constitutional Court decision published on 9 September 2023, only 13 candidates out of 28 were accepted:\nThey are, by their order on the ballot, decided by sortition:\n#Tahina Razafinjoelina\n#\n#Andry Rajoelina\n#Roland Ratsiraka\n#Marc Ravalomanana\n#Auguste Richard Paraina\n#Andry Tsiverizo Raobelina Andriamalala\n#Jean Brunelle Razafintsiandraofa\n#Lalaina Harilanto Ratsirahonanana\n#Hery Rajaonarimampianina\n#Sendrison Daniela Raderanirina\n#Jean-Jacques Jedidia Ratsietison\n#Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko\nAndry Rajoelina in December 2022 (cropped).jpg|\nMarc Ravalomanana.jpg|\nHery Rajaonarimampianina 2014.jpg|\nSiteny Randrianasoloniaiko (10-11-2025).jpg|\nHajo Andrianainarivelo.jpg|\nDeclared but not registered\n*Noël Abel Jean\n*Heritiana Guy LaChapelle\n* James Rasoamaka\n* Julia Mickaelle Rasolofonoroniaina\n* Marie Josiane Vololonirina\n* Monja Roindefo\n* Claude Raharivoatra\n* Elias Ralaiarimanana\n* James Francklin Rakotomahanina\n* Eufraime Randrianambinina\n* Jean Bruno Betsy Andriamanolo\n* Miarintoa Rasolofotinana\n* Désiré Nivo Raharovoatra\nWithdrew\n*Masy Goulamaly\n* Annick Ratsiraka\nCampaign\nDuring an opposition campaign rally held on 2 October 2023, Marc Ravalomanana, himself a former President and  candidate in the election, suffered a leg injury following the use of teargas by the police.\nOn the same day, candidate Andry Raobelina suffered an injury to the face from a part of an exploded tear gas canister, which prompted him to call for a report of the election to the Haute cour constitutionnelle. The latter decided on 12 October to move the first round from 9 November to 16 November..\nConduct\nProhibition of political rallies in the open\nIn April 2023, incumbent Rajoelina prohibited all political rallies in the open. This was condemned by representatives of the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, Norway and Japan.\nLack of funding\nIn a letter to the European Union from May 2023 Rajoelina asked for 30 million euros for assisting in organizing the elections.\nDual nationality of Rajoelina\nIn June 2023 it was discovered that Rajoelina had acquired French nationality for himself, his wife and their three children in 2014. Under Malagasy law, this may have disqualified him from the presidency, as only citizens of Madagascar are eligible to hold the position, and the country imposes a loss of citizenship if voluntarily acquiring another nationality. Rajoelina argued that he automatically obtained the French nationality through his father and only formalized it, meaning he had not voluntarily switched. The Constitutional Court eventually sided with him, pointing out the lack of a decree officially removing his Malagasy nationality.\nCase of Romy Voos Andrianarisoa\nOn 14 August 2023 the Director of Cabinet of President Andry Rajoelina, Romy Voos Andrianarisoa, was arrested in London under accusations of corruption in a London-based mining company. She was then dismissed by Rajoelina on 16 August. On a rally of the opposition in Antananarivo on November 13, Paraina August, one of the ten protester candidates and former speaker of the lower house of the Malagasy parliament, claimed that London would have emitted a summons letter to one of the running candidates without specifically mentioning a name. This claim was interpreted by the police as a public defamation, spread of fake news, and incitement to hatred. A few hours later, Paraina August was arrested at the international airport of Ivato and detained by the Police for a couple of hours before finally being released.\nProhibition of an opposition meeting\nOn 5 September 2023 a meeting of the candidates of the opposition was prevented by the police.\nOpposition boycott\nThe political opposition largely boycotted the elections.\nResults\n|cand3=Marc Ravalomanana|party3=Tiako i Madagasikara|votes3=586282\n|cand4=Hery Rajaonarimampianina|party4=|votes4=251144|color4=#23426B\n|cand5=Hajo Andrianainarivelo|party5=Malagasy Miara-Miainga|votes5=91832|color5=#1160a2\n|cand6=Roland Ratsiraka|party6=Malagasy Tonga Saina|votes6=76858|color6=red\n|cand7=Tahina Razafinjoelina|party7=Firaisankinan'ny Tia Tanindrazana|votes7=76553|color7=#025685\n|cand8=Jean Brunelle Razafintsiandraofa|party8=Antoko Politika Madio|votes8=63474|color8=#ff0066\n|cand9=Sendrison Daniela Raderanirina|party9=Fandrosoa Faritsy iaby ho an'i Madagasikara|votes9=38966|color9=#f8ccd9\n|cand10=Lalaina Harilanto Ratsirahonanana|party10=Antoko Fihavanantsika|votes10=32608|color10=#282d67\n|cand11=Andry Tsiverizo Raobelina Andriamalala|party11=Anjomara sy Rivo-baovao|votes11=30198|color11=#479db4\n|cand12=Auguste Richard Paraina|party12=Tsara Tahafina|votes12=29874|color12=#FF5733\n|cand13=Jean-Jacques Jedidia Ratsietison|party13=Fahefa mividy no ilain'ny Malagasy|votes13=14468|color13=green\n|invalid=270123|electorate=11043836\n|source=[http://www.hcc.gov.mg/?p=8619 HCC]\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.africaintelligence.com/southern-africa-and-islands/2023/02/23/un-reluctant-to-fund-presidential-election,109916616-gra UN reluctant to fund presidential election], Africa Intelligence, February 23, 2023 (requires free registration)"
