A special unit was organized under the command of Colonel Nagel. This unit was composed of two regiments from Moscow, a rifle battalion, two squadrons from Kabardia and Selenga, and 300 Don and Greben Cossacks. On 21 November 1785, Colonel Nagel invaded Small Kabardia.\nHaving heard of the approach of the Russian army, Sheikh Mansur organized a small unit of Chechens, Kabardians, Kumyks and Dagestanis. The two sides met at the Tatartup fortress near the Malka River. During the fierce fighting that ensued, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and both Mansur and Nagel planned to withdraw their troops from the battle. Mansur first gave the order of retreat, and his troops returned home, while he took refuge in Anapa.\nThe result of this defeat was heavy for Mansur, because many of his supporters, amongst Kabardins, Kumyks and Daghestanis, lost their confidence in him, left Mansur and asked for forgiveness from the Tsarina of Russia. At the beginning of 1786, Dol Mudarov, Psheh of Small Kabardia and faithful supporter of Mansur was captured by the Russian army.\nAlthough most of his men left him, Sheikh Mansur continued waging Guerrilla warfare against Russian soldiers, numbering an army of 600.\nSee also\n*Sheikh Mansur\n*Battle of the Malka\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
