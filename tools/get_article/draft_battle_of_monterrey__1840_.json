This engagement permanently ended the southern expansion of the upstart Republic, something which would cripple the state for the rest of its existence.\nPrelude\nAfter their defeat at the Battle of Mier, the Riograndese forces withdrew to Monterrey in an attempt to replenish their forces, gaining around 150 men.\nThe Siege\nCarvajal’s men had fortified parts of the city, setting up makeshift barricades and using the stone buildings for defense, however,  they lacked sufficient munitions, making a long defense impossible.Morning — Mejía’s army reached the outskirts of Monterrey at dawn. The Mexican artillery began bombarding rebel positions near the city entrances — likely the southern and western approaches, where the main roads led in. Rebel forces fired back from behind hastily built barricades, but the Centralists had the advantage of range and coordination. Within hours, Mejía ordered two columns to enter the city: One moved through the southern gate, driving the rebels from their forward barricades. The other pushed in from the west, forcing Carvajal’s men to fall back toward the city center.Midday — Once inside the city, the battle turned chaotic. Rebels shot from windows, rooftops, and alleys, attempting the hold back the Mexican army. Mejía’s troops moved block by block, using their artillery to clear buildings that offered resistance. Civilians were caught in the crossfire, and parts of the city suffered damage from cannon fire and fires started during the fighting. Carvajal’s men fought stubbornly, but they couldn’t stop the artillery-supported infantry. By early afternoon, they were being squeezed into the central plaza.Afternoon — By late afternoon, Mejía’s troops surrounded the city center, trapping Carvajal’s main force. Rebel casualties mounted; they had no reinforcements and dwindling ammunition. Several rebel officers reportedly urged Carvajal to retreat before total annihilation. As dusk approached, Carvajal decided to withdraw. Some of his men slipped out of the city under the cover of darkness, while others were chose to stay behind to cover the flanks of the retreating forces.Next Morning —\nBy the following morning, Mejía’s army effectively controlled Monterrey. The remaining rebel defenders surrendered. Carvajal himself was captured soon after the battle. The victory effectively ended the Republic of the Rio Grande’s campaign in Nuevo León.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, the Republic of the Rio Grande effectively lost control of its southern territories, with Mexican forces occupying the land. However, the battle became a symbol of resistance to Mexican expansion and occupation, galvanizing remaining resistance.\nReferences"
