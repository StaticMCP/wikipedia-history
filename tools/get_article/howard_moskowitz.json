He is known for the detailed study he made of the types of spaghetti sauce and horizontal segmentation. By providing a large number of options for consumers, Moskowitz pioneered the idea of intermarket variability as applied to the food industry.\nEarly life and education\nMoskowitz earned undergraduate degrees in mathematics and psychology from Queens College, City University of New York, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\nHe went on to complete a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology at Harvard University in 1969, where he studied under S. S. Stevens, the influential psychologist known for developing modern psychophysics and the theory of measurement scales. His doctoral research focused on psychophysics and sensory perception.\nProducts\nAfter graduating from Harvard, Moskowitz was hired by the United States Army to improve their Meals, Ready-to-Eat, where he applied the concept of sensory-specific satiety, the tendency for consumers to tire of strongly flavored foods, to ensure that the meals were formulated in a way that encouraged soldiers to eat sufficient calories.\nSince at least the 1980s, Moskowitz has been consulted by Campbell Soup, General Foods, Kraft and PepsiCo for his expertise in food optimization. According to Moskowitz he has optimized soups, pizzas, salad dressings, and pickles in his work for various firms. His research on Prego spaghetti sauce, which revealed a significant customer preference for an \"extra-chunky\" formulation, is notable as was his optimization of the amount of salt, sugar, and fat in spaghetti sauce at the \"bliss point\" which maximized consumer satisfaction.\nMoskowitz developed Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper when he was hired in 2004 by Cadbury Schweppes, which was hoping to expand the market for Dr Pepper by developing a product line extension using an alternative formulation with vanilla or cherry flavors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_choice_happiness_and_spaghetti_sauce TED Talk: Malcolm Gladwell – \"Choice, Happiness and Spaghetti Sauce\"] (February 2004) – discusses Moskowitz’s work on horizontal segmentation.\n* [https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/09/06/the-ketchup-conundrum Malcolm Gladwell, \"The Ketchup Conundrum\"] (The New Yorker, September 2004).\n* [https://www.unifiedhuman.org/board/dr-howard-moskowitz/ Unified Human Foundation – Board Profile].\n* [https://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/prizes-awards/william-procter/award-winner/howard-r.-moskowitz Sigma Xi – William Procter Prize Recipient].\n* [https://www.oecd-events.org/summit-gpaiserbia2024/en/speaker/c565ab0e-b49b-ef11-88cf-6045bd903ca2/howard-moskowitz OECD Global Science Summit Speaker Biography].\nSee also\n* Psychophysics\n* S.
