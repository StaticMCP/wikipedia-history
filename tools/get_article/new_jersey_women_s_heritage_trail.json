Held in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1994, that conference was presented collaboratively by the state's Historic Preservation Office, the Alice Paul Centennial Foundation, and Preservation New Jersey. It helped pave the way for New Jersey's passage of legislation in 1999 which authorized funding \"to begin research to identify historic sites associated with New Jersey women.\"\nSites\nAs of 2018, more than 90 sites are included related to:\n*Acorn Hall, Women of the Crane–Hone Family\n*Alice Stokes Paul's childhood home\n*Annis Boudinot Stockton, a Colonial era poet\n*Atlantic City Convention Hall where Miss America Pageants have taken place\n*Clara Barton, a Civil War era nurse and the founder of the first public school in New Jersey\n*Alice Paul, suffragist\n*Anne Morrow Lindbergh\n*Millicent Fenwick, political leader\n*Home of abolitionist Quaker Abigail Goodwin and her sister Elizabeth who helped and housed runaway slaves along on the Underground Railroad and organized with other leading abolitionists.\n*Rebecca Estell Bourgeois Winston\n*Women's Federation Memorial at Palisades Interstate Park\n*The Victor building of the Victor Talking Machine Company where women worked at 1 Market Street, between Delaware and Front Streets\n* Bridget Smith House at 124 Randolph Avenue in Morris County, Mine Hill Township where Irish immigrant wives and families lived after their husbands were killed in mines\n*Brookdale Farm in Thompson Park, 805 Newman Springs Road, Lincroft, where social welfare reformer Geraldine Morgan Thompson (1872–1967) lived\n*Martha Brookes Hutcheson's gardens at what is now Bamboo Brook Outdoor Education Center\n*Sara Spencer Washington's Hotel Brigantine\n*Roosevelt Common designed by Marjorie Sewell Cautley\n*Esther Saunders burial site at Salem Friends Burial Ground\n*Smithville Park in Easthampton, New Jersey where Agnes Gilkerson (1838–1881) was involved in the development of worker's village Smithville and edited a newspaper\n*Jarena Lee's gravesite at Mt.
