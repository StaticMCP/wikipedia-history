It is located at 22 Itaewon-ro, Yongsan District, Seoul.\nBackground\nThe building was opened in November 2003 and previously housed the Ministry of National Defense, its area totalling 276,000 square meters. Following the inauguration of President Yoon Suk Yeol in May 2022, Cheong Wa Dae or the Blue House, the previous presidential residence, was relieved of its duties and replaced by the current building. The facility was vacated by Yoon on 11 April 2025, a week following his impeachment and dismissal from the presidency. Its latest presidential occupant is Lee Jae-myung, who is staying there following his inauguration on 4 June 2025 pending a complete relocation back to the Blue House.\nIn 2024, balloons from North Korea containing rubbish landed on the compound in July and October.\nLogo history\nEmblem of the Office of the President of the Republic of Korea.svg|Presidential emblem used from 23 October 2022 to 12 June 2025.\nProvisional emblem of the Office of the President of South Korea.svg|Presidential emblem used since 12 June 2025, pending the relocation to Blue House.\nFlag\nFlag of the Office of the President of the Republic of Korea.svg|Presidential flag used from 23 October 2022 to 12 June 2025.\nProvisional flag of the Office of the President of South Korea.svg|Presidential flag used since 12 June 2025, pending the relocation to Blue House.\nSee also\n* Blue House\n* Korean architecture\n* Politics of South Korea\n* National Assembly Proceeding Hall\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://eng.president.go.kr/ Official website]"
