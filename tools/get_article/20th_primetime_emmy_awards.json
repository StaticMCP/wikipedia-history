The ceremony was hosted by Frank Sinatra and Dick Van Dyke.  Winners are listed in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe top shows of the night were Get Smart and Mission: Impossible. Get Smart won three major awards, while the most nominated show was the anthology drama CBS Playhouse with ten. It also won three major awards.\nThe first posthumous Acting Emmy went to Marion Lorne for her performance in Bewitched, while The Avengers was the first non American produced nomination, having been syndicated from ABC Weekend TV, which was a part of the United Kingdom Independent Television Network, by ABC. However, other than sharing the same initials, the two companies were independent of each other.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Get Smart (NBC)'\n** Bewitched (ABC)\n** Family Affair (CBS)\n** ''Hogan's Heroes (CBS)\n** The Lucy Show (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Mission: Impossible (CBS)'\n** The Avengers (ABC)\n** I Spy (NBC)\n** NET Playhouse (NET)\n** Run for Your Life (NBC)\n** Star Trek (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'''Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (NBC)'\n** The Bell Telephone Hour (NBC)\n** The Carol Burnett Show (CBS)\n** The Dean Martin Comedy Hour (NBC)\n** The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (NBC): \"Pilot\"'\n** Chrysler Presents The Bob Hope Show (NBC)\n** The Fred Astaire Show (NBC)\n** Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass (CBS)\n** Lincoln Center/Stage 5 (Syndicated)\n** A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Today (NBC)'\n** Camera Three (CBS)\n** The Mike Douglas Show (Syndicated)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'ABC's Wide World of Sports (ABC) – Roone Arledge\n*ABC's Wide World of Sports (ABC) – Jim McKay'\n** 10th Winter Olympic Games (ABC) – Roone Arledge\n** 10th Winter Olympic Games (ABC) – Dick Button\n** The American Sportsman (ABC)\n** The Flying Fisherman (Syndicated)\n** NCAA Football (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n*'Hallmark Hall of Fame (NBC): \"Elizabeth the Queen\"'\n** CBS Playhouse (CBS): \"Dear Friends\"\n** CBS Playhouse (CBS): \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\"\n** NET Playhouse (NET): \"Uncle Vanya\"\n** The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (ABC)\n** Xerox Special (ABC): \"Luther\"\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Don Adams as Maxwell Smart in Get Smart (NBC)'\n** Richard Benjamin as Dick Hollister in He & She (CBS)\n** Sebastian Cabot as Mr. Giles French in Family Affair (CBS)\n** Brian Keith as Uncle Bill Davis in Family Affair (CBS)\n** Dick York as Darrin Stephens in Bewitched (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Lucille Ball as Lucy Carmichael in The Lucy Show (CBS)'\n** Barbara Feldon as Agent 99 in Get Smart (NBC)\n** Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens in Bewitched (ABC)\n** Paula Prentiss as Paula Hollister in He & She (CBS)\n** Marlo Thomas as Ann Marie in That Girl (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Bill Cosby as Alexander Scott in I Spy (NBC)'\n** Raymond Burr as Robert T.
