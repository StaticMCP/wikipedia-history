At the beginning of the series, Parn is a brave but unskilled fighter. He chafes at his life in a small farming community and feels ostracized by the townsfolk for his father's legacy. He later leaves the village after a goblin attack, eventually meeting with King Fahn of Valis and King Kashue of Flaim. His skills eventually improve to the point where he can put up a decent fight against his nemesis, the Dark Knight of Marmo, Ashram. He meets Deedlit the high elf during his adventures, and the two of them become romantically involved over the course of the series.\nParn is voiced by Takeshi Kusao in the OVA and cameo appearances, by Nobutoshi Canna in Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, and by Bill Timoney in English.\nDeedlit\nA female high elf skilled in both swordplay and elemental sorcery, Deedlit grew up in the Forest of No Return, her people's isolated abode. From a very early age on, however, she became interested in the outside world and - despite the disapproval of her family and peers - set out to learn more about it. After meeting Parn, she develops a romantic interest in his rash, impulsive nature, his sense of honor, and his dedication, and faithfully stayed by his side in the war against Marmo.\nDeedlit is voiced by Yumi Touma in the OVA and cameo appearances, by Shiho Niiyama (eps. 1-21) and Junko Noda (eps. 22-27) in Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, and by Lisa Ortiz in English.\nEtoh\nParn's best friend and a priest of Falis, the Supreme God. Upon King Fahn's death, he later becomes the king of Valis and the husband of Princess Fianna.\nEtoh is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi in the OVA, Shinichiro Ohta in Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, and Ted Lewis in English.\nSlayn\nAn old friend of Ghim's, Slayn is a wise and powerful magician. He marries the priestess Leylia after she is freed from Karla's possession and becomes the father of Little Neese.\nSlayn is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka in the OVA, by Mitsuru Miyamoto in Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, and by Al Muscari in English.\nGhim\nGhim is an elderly but very skilled dwarven warrior. Prior to the start of the series, Ghim was wounded in a mining accident, and was healed at the Temple of Marfa by Neese and her daughter Leylia. When Leylia was kidnapped and possessed by Karla, the Grey Witch, Ghim left to search for her. He has some past connection with Slayn, and comes to seek the wizard's aid in locating Leylia. Coincidentally, Ghim arrives shortly before the goblin attack in Parn's village, prompting he and Slayn to join with Parn and Etoh on their quest. Later in the OVA, Ghim challenges Karla to free Leylia's body from possession. Though successful, Ghim is killed by Karla's magic. Ghim's axe marks his gravesite in the closing scenes of the OVA. Ghim does not appear in the TV series, though his name is mentioned.\nGhim is voiced by Yoshisada Sakaguchi in Japanese and Greg Wolfe in English.\nWoodchuck\nA thief and the last member of the party to join them, Woodchuck encounters the group when they are briefly thrown into prison. After Leylia is rescued from Karla's possession, Karla takes over Woodchuck. His whereabouts after his possession by Karla is unknown. In the novels, rather than being captured, he takes Karla's circlet of his own will to attempt to make up for over twenty years of his life that he spent in prison.\nWoodchuck is voiced by Norio Wakamoto in Japanese and Jacques LeCann in English.\nChronicles of the Heroic Knight\nSpark\nA young aspiring warrior from Flaim who dreams of becoming a knight. What he initially does not know is that King Kashue considers him to be his possible successor in ruling Flaim, and is therefore loath to send him into danger; an intention which is foiled by Spark's impulsiveness and hot-headedness. In the course of his trials, however, Spark becomes more mature and responsible from his experiences, and also enters a romantic relationship with Little Neese. He worships Parn as his idol, who in turn becomes fond of Spark himself, as the latter reminds him of his own impetuous youth.\nSpark is voiced by Kenji Nojima in Japanese and Crispin Freeman in English.\nLittle Neese\nThe 13-year-old daughter of Leylia and Slayn, possessed by the soul of Naneel. Like her grandmother (after whom she is named) and her mother, she is a priestess of Marfa. Aware of the malevolent entity's presence inside her, she has detached herself emotionally from the rest of the world, although her mental barriers begin to come down when she meets Spark and gradually falls in love with him. She is later freed from Naneel's presence when Wagnard attempts to resurrect Kardis by drawing Naneel's essence from her.\nLittle Neese is voiced by Chie Sawaguchi in Japanese and Roxanne Beck in English.\nLeaf\nA young half-elf born to a male elf and a female human warrior in the realm of Alania. She first met Deedlit during the first war against Marmo, when her home village was evacuated, and has idolized the high elf ever since. She later becomes a mercenary and Garrack's partner. She is a skilled fighter with her spear and, like a full-blooded elf, capable of using spirit magic.\nLeaf is voiced by Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese and Debora Rabbai in English.\nGarrack\nAn overconfident axe-wielding mercenary who joins Spark's company under Kashue's orders. Secretly a Noble of Flaim ordered by Kashue to protect Spark. Despite his boisterous attitude, he is brave and loyal to a fault. He eventually enters a relationship with the thief Ryna.\nGarrack is voiced by Masaya Takatsuta in Japanese and by Michael Gerard and Crispin Freeman in English.\nRyna\nA human thief who joins Spark and his companions after encountering a group of dark elves, who had just stolen a holy artefact from the vault of Valis. Her fellow thief and friend Randy was cursed by the dark elves, which eventually led to his death, and she joins the company primarily to gain revenge on them. Although she initially keeps her true profession a secret, the others - especially Garrack - gradually work out her identity as a thief. But after repeatedly using her skills to aid them, she becomes a trusted and valued member of the team and eventually becomes romantically attracted to Garrack.\nRyna is voiced by Chizu Yonemoto in Japanese and A.J. Parks in English.\nAldonova\nA huge but somewhat timid wizard who becomes part of Spark's company. He is Slayn's pupil and very devoted to Little Neese, often to the point of losing his sight on more important matters.\nAldonova is voiced by Tamotsu Nishiwaki in Japanese and Steve Patterson in English.\nGreevus\nA dwarven priest of Myrii, who also joined Spark under Kashue's request. He is a skilled healer, as well as a doughty fighter with his halberd.\nGreevus is voiced by Kazuhiko Kishino in Japanese and Greg Wolfe in English.\nOther characters\nAshram\nKnown as the \"Black Knight,\" Ashram is a highly skilled warrior and the former retainer and right-hand aide of Emperor Beld.  He served Beld during the War of Heroes, and was sent on the front to deal with any possible resistance.  After the death of Beld at the hands of Karla the Grey Witch in the OVA (or Kashue in the TV series), Ashram took up his blade, the Demon Sword Soul Crusher and returned to Marmo to regroup.  Later on, Ashram seeks to dominate Lodoss rather than conquer it, as he looks for one of the governor's treasures, the Scepter of Domination.  After the destruction of the scepter, Ashram is believed to have died in the fires of Fire Dragon Mountain, but it is later revealed that one of the agents of Wagnard sacrifices his powers (stripped by Wagnard himself) in order to save his life.\nAshram is voiced by Akira Kamiya in the original OAV, and by Shō Hayami in the TV series. In the English version, he is voiced by John Knox in both series, and by Ken Webster in Legend of Crystania.\nBeld\nEmperor Beld was a former member of the \"Six Heroes,\" a band of adventurers who fought and defeated the Demon King 30 years before the events of Record of Lodoss War.  During the battle with the demon god, Beld's soul was destroyed when his blade became baptized in the blood of the demon, and in the aftermath, his sword became the legendary blade Soul Crusher.  He later became the lord of Marmo Island and led an army comprising humans, dark creatures, and dark elves in an invasion of Lodoss. The invasion was largely successful, but just after killing his old friend Fahn in personal combat, he is betrayed and struck down by Karla the Grey Witch; the rule of Marmo subsequently passed over to his general, Ashram.\nBeld is voiced by Taro Ishida in Japanese and by Bob Barry in English.\nFahn\nLike his former friend and companion Beld, King Fahn was one of the Six Heroes and a Holy Knight of Valis, later becoming the King of Valis. He is the one force that truly holds Beld in check and prevents him from acting. Fahn holds the opposing blade to Soul Crusher, called the Holy Sword of Falis, the two blades increase in power when in each other's presence. Parn's father was a former knight of his. Fahn is struck down by Beld just before Beld himself is killed.\nFahn is voiced in English by J. W. Gunther in the TV series.[https://m.imdb.com/name/nm1389647/ J. W. Gunther IMDB link]\nKarla\nKarla the Grey Witch (so named because of her obsessive neutrality) is the enigmatic sole survivor of the ancient kingdom Kastuul, also known as the Kingdom of Sorcery. As barbarian tribes laid siege to the city, Karla, a member of the nobility at the time, foresaw the destruction and sealed her consciousness into a circlet she wore on her forehead. Though her original body was inevitably killed in the battle, her consciousness (and power) lives on in an endless series of host bodies, utterly possessed by her so long as they wear the circlet in which she resides. Due to the horrible fate of Kastuul, Karla swore never to allow such destruction to occur again. Karla has maintained a secret, shadowy influence on the major events of Lodoss for more than 500 years. Her long life and incredible power has warped her perception of herself. Her sworn duty \"for the good of Lodoss\" is to endlessly shift the balance of power between the various nations of Lodoss, preventing the annihilation of any one power, at the cost of preventing its rise. All of the major wars in Lodoss since the fall of Kastuul have been carefully manipulated (and some directly participated in) by her, though by nature of her neutrality, she is not always an antagonist. She was even one of the \"Six Heroes\" -  a group of adventurers who fought and defeated the Demon God King 30 years prior to the events of the series.\nThroughout the anime series, she is shown possessing three bodies: Leylia, priestess of Marfa and daughter of Neese; Woodchuck, whom she used to escape at the battle where Karla's circlet was forcefully removed from Leylia (subsequently freeing her); and an unnamed woman who somewhat resembles her original body. After Karla helped Wagnard to resurrect Naneel, avatar of Kardis the Destroyer, Leylia takes Karla's circlet, believing that she can control the witch so long as she is consciously aware of Karla's presence within the circlet, thus ending 500 years of conflict in Lodoss due to her machinations.\nLeylia\nLeylia is the daughter of Neese, a priestess of Marfa. She is possessed by Karla when her mother is busy tending a battered Ghim. Ghim then sets out to rescue Leylia from Karla's control. Later Leylia marries Slayn and becomes the mother of Little Neese.\nShiris\nA red-headed and somewhat hot-tempered mercenary woman. She meets Parn and his companions while on protective watch over a village, along with her partner Orson. She develops a crush on Parn (much to Deedlit's disconcertion), but in the end they only remain good friends.\nIn the TV series, after losing Orson, Shiris makes off on her own.[http://members.fortunecity.com/samhain13/lodoss/heroes.htm Lodoss War the RPG]\nOrson\nA strong and silent mercenary and the partner of Shiris. He maintains an impassive front to anything and anybody, mainly because he is a berserker. In the TV series it is revealed that a dark spirit called Hyuri first took him over as a child when he watched his younger sister being attacked by bandits. In order to prevent himself from hurting those he loves, he has shut himself off from the rest of the world.\nOrson is secretly in love with his partner Shiris; his berserker state is triggered when he sees her in mortal danger, and only she is able to bring him out of it. However, because of his condition he cannot bring himself to admit his feelings to her. In the TV series, he dies protecting Shiris from Ashram, and it is only then that Shiris discovers her true feelings for him.\nPrincess Fianna\nThe daughter of Fahn. As a child, King Fahn surrendered her to one of the tribes of the desert (which would later become Flaim) to the north, so that she could be sacrificed to Shooting Star to appease the dragon. Parn's father, Tessius, made a secret plan with King Fahn to rescue Fianna, in which he would take all the blame for destroying diplomatic relations with the tribe. This led to his dishonor, and he was sent to the front lines of the civil war that began as a result, where he died.\nFianna's presence is a diplomatic one at first, sent to give a message to Alania, but she is intercepted by Karla who informs her that Alania has fallen anyway. She is saved by Parn and his companions, and later on grants Parn the blade of her father.\nUpon first encountering the group, Fianna becomes attracted to Etoh. While it is never explicitly indicated in either the manga or the anime series, it is likely that they were married when Etoh assumed the throne of Valis. Fianna was not considered an heir to the throne, however, as the royalty of Valis is chosen not by royal bloodline, but upon the death of the previous king, a successor is chosen from the knighthood. Etoh's succession to the throne after marrying Fianna was due to his high spiritual power as a Falis priest and the high regard that the church held him in, though there was opposition in not only a non-knight ascending the throne, but Fianna gaining political power as queen.\nFianna is voiced by Rei Sakuma in Japanese and by Simone Grant in English.\nKing Kashue\nAlso known as the Mercenary King, Kashue is famous for being the only man capable of uniting the desert country of Flaim, which he accomplished using only his sword. During the War of Heroes, Kashue was instrumental in staving off the invasion of Lodoss by the Marmo forces, assuming leadership following the death of King Fahn, after the latter killed Beld in the final battle by cutting him down when he was distracted by a crossbow bolt shot by Karla the Grey Witch. (The story surrounding these events was changed in the OVA, instead having Karla perform the killing blow herself.) Because of this Ashram holds Kashue responsible for treachery, and would love nothing more than to slay him for his supposed sins. Parn greatly admires him.\nIn the Japanese version, Kashue was played by Shuichi Ikeda in the OAV and by Joji Nakata in the TV series. In the English version, Kashue was played by Chris Yates in the OAV and by Anthony Cruise in the TV series.\nNaneel\nNaneel is a priestess of Kardis, as well as her avatar embodied.  She begins to directly manipulate the people of Lodoss for over 50 years before she is slain by King Kadomos I.  Naneel's death was one that was not complete, as she was reincarnated in the form of Leylia some time later.  Neese, knowing the child's dark secret, adopted her and raised her as her own, trying to shield her from the truth of her dark secret.  When Leylia became pregnant, the soul of Naneel was transferred into the body of her baby, \"little Neese\".\nPirotess\nPirotess is a dark elven noble considered to be one of the more prominent figures in her people's society. Like most dark elves, she worships Fararis and calls the Forest of Darkness on Marmo island her home. She is the younger sister of Astar, a member of the quest of Scepter of Domination, eventually cheated by the chief leader of all dark elves, the powerful Luzev, who had decided to recreate the kingdom of his kindred. Since she believed that the useless human Ashram should be the one to pay for her beloved brother's death, she joined the mission of killing the general of Dark Knighthood. Ashram found and bested her in hand-to-hand combat when she ambushed him in his bedroom, but let her go after learning her identity as the sister of his lost old friend. After she learned the truth and the crazy decision of Luzev from her fellow assassin, she stalked Ashram to learn about him and discovered his loyalty to the lost emperor, the heroic Beld, and his dedication to Marmo and its people. She decided to protect him from the other assassin and aided him in a \"Test\" from the Dark Sage. After 10 years, she had been the only one to whom Ashram had showed appreciation and care. She in turn remained fiercely loyal to Ashram as a lieutenant and a leader of his scouts. She was accepted by the subordinates of Ashram as their mistress and sub-general.\nPirotess is a skilled adversary, both an adept of the rapier and a skilled magic user. A shaman like Deedlit, she often uses spirits that high elves will not associate with, such as the spirits of darkness.\nShe is a lover of Ashram and is very loyal to him. When Ashram decides to leave Lodoss for good and seek a new land where they can find peace, Pirotess goes with him. When they reach Crystania, Pirotess is forced to seek out a solution after Ashram is placed into stasis by one of the god beasts of Crystania.\nIn the original OVA, she sacrifices herself to save Ashram from the powerful dragon Shooting Star.\nIn the Japanese version, Pirotess is voiced by Sakiko Tamagawa in the OVA and by Kumiko Nishihara in the TV series. In the English version, Pirotess is voiced by Meg Frances in both series, and by Edi Patterson in Legend of Crystania (as Sheru).\nFlaibe\nFlaibe is a dwarf and the king of the Stone Kingdom. When the Demon Wars began Flaibe's kingdom is the first to fall. He is rescued by Karla and is the only survivor of his kingdom. He forms a group with Beld, Fahn, Neese, Wort, Karla and Flaus - the group that would later be known as the Six Heroes (except Flaus). Flaibe led his comrades into the ruins of Stone Kingdom where they fought and killed the archdemon who stole his throne. After the Demon King was slain in the Deepest Labyrinth Flaibe was hailed as one of the Six Heroes.\nFlaibe hoped to rebuild his nation. After the purification of Marmo he decided it would be the location of the new Stone Kingdom.\nWagnard\nWagnard is a dark wizard, and a worshipper of Kardis, the goddess of destruction. He was originally a student of the magical academy in Valis (the same Slayn had attended), but was expelled for studying the dark arts of magic and cursed with a spell which restricted his ability to cast magic by inflicting severe pain whenever he does so. In time, however, Wagnard became mostly inured to the pain and managed to attain great power as a magician.\nDespite following Beld, Wagnard's intentions are far worse, as he seeks to kill all the inhabitants of Forcelia, and rule over them as their undead king (a lich).  In the OVA, he attempts this by abducting the high elf Deedlit, as high elves have near immortal life spans, and such energy is necessary to revive Kardis. In the original story, manga, and TV series, Wagnard tries to accomplish this task by abducting the priestess of Marfa and daughter of Leylia, Little Neese, the doorway to Naneel and avatar of Kardis.  When Naneel is successfully summoned, Wagnard's plans are thwarted and he is killed. Wagnard's summoning of Kardis never takes place in the manga, but the summon of Naneel does.\nIn the Japanese version, Wagnard is voiced by Takeshi Aono in the OAV and by Chikao Otsuka in the TV series. In the English version, Wagnard is voiced by Jayce Reeves in the OAV and by Pete Zarustica in the TV series.  (Reeves does play the role in the TV series for at least one episode—episode 18, for reasons unknown.)\nDragons\nAbram\nA blue dragon, and an ally of Narse, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. Abram resides on Blue Dragon Island, where he leisurely swims from to attack and destroy sailing vessels. Abram protects the Soul Crystal Ball, an artifact that can restore life.\nBramd\nBramd is an ancient white dragon, and a former ally to the magic city of Kastuul. A direct ally with Mycen, he would be more likely to lend his aid to her than to any other ally on Lodoss.  When Kastuul fell during the final battle of the magic city, Bramd and several other dragons were sent to distant corners of Lodoss to try and preserve the legacy of the magic city. Bramd himself was given the Mirror of Truth to protect, and until he was absolved of the geas spell upon himself, he did so.\nA decade or more before the events of Record of Lodoss War, Bramd's geas spell was lifted by Neese, a priestess of Marfa. After Neese removed the curse from Bramd, Bramd granted her the staff he was entrusted to protect. In order to keep the staff protected, Neese sent the staff away to the city of Valis to remain within the halls of the temple of Falis.\nIn his search for the Scepter of Domination, Ashram slew Bramd while he was still in hibernation, but finding no treasure with the dragon, he went to Tarbin, the location of the high temple of Marfa, where he found out that Bramd's artifact was not what he was looking for.\nMycen\nA golden dragon, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. She resides in Moss, guarded by a fortress of dragon riders. Mycen's treasure is the Staff of Life, which could heal any wound and even resurrect the dead.\nNarse\nA black dragon, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. Narse resides underneath Marmo itself, where he sleeps awaiting the proper day to awaken. Narse protects the Ferronierre of Knowledge, but it still lays unclaimed and unfound under Marmo. Narse is the dragon counterpart of Kardis.\nShooting Star\nA red dragon, one of the five ancient dragons that had one of the governor's treasures. The most powerful of the dragons, Shooting Star protects the most powerful artifact, the Scepter of Domination. Shooting Star resides in Flame Dragon Mountain, not far from the city of Blade.\nGods of Lodoss\nThe seven gods listed below each form the basis for a major religion of Lodoss.  There are other gods who are worshipped, such as Ganeed, the god of thieves, but these gods are considered minor gods. Some gods are named after racehorses such as Pharis, Marfa, Mairie and Phalaris.\nPhalis (or Falis)\nPhalis is the supreme god of goodness and light, and his affiliated colours are blue, white, and gold.  He is associated with healing, good, and protection, and is lawful good in alignment.

Etoh is a priest of Phalis. The name is also commonly translated in the anime as Falis.\nMarfa\nMarfa is the goddess of all creation and preservation, and her affiliated colours are green and silver.  She is associated with healing, creation, and good descriptors, and is chaotic good in alignment.  Marfa and Kardis were the final two gods left alive at the end of the cataclysmic war, with their battle ending in a stalemate as the two tried to strike each other down with one final blow, but both falling into a death sleep after Alecrast and Lodoss split apart. Kardis fell on the island of Marmo, while Marfa fell on Lodoss. Marfa's spirit is the strongest in Alania, and her main temple is the village of Tarba in Alania's White Mountains.\nMairie (or Myrii)\nMairie is the god of war and justice, and his affiliated colors are red and grey.  He is associated with war, protection, and knowledge, and is true neutral in alignment.  Mairie's role in the cataclysmic war is never specified. In Rune Soldier, Melissa is a priestess of Mairie. Mairie is also often translated as Myrii.\nRahda\nRahda is the god of knowledge, and his affiliated colors are black, white, and grey.

He is associated with desire, death, darkness and freedom, and is chaotic in alignment. Pharalis and Phalis were two of the major gods who had a place in the cataclysmic war, with their final battle resulting in the destruction of many gods and other fighters in the battle. Also he is not truly evil, but his acceptance of all desire causes most of his mortal followers to become enshrouded in evil. Pharalis is also often translated as Falaris.\nKardis (or Cardice)\nKardis is the goddess of all destruction and misery, and her affiliated colors are black and red.  She is associated with evil, death, and destruction, and is chaotic evil in alignment.

The island of Marmo bore the brunt of her curse, leaving the island corrupted and shrouded in darkness.\nNotes"
