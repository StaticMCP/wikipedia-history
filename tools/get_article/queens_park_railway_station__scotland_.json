It is located on the Cathcart Circle Line. Services are provided by ScotRail on behalf of Strathclyde Partnership for Transport.\nHistory\nroute map]]\nQueen's Park station opened with the first section of the Cathcart District Railway, which opened as far as  on 1 March 1886 (the line through to the first Cathcart station opened a few months later, on 25 May 1886). The station maintains its original island platform and station building to this day.\nThe lines through the station were electrified under British Railways as part of the Glasgow South Bank Electrification in May 1962.\nFrom July to August 2008, the Cathcart Circle was closed for a short period to allow for subsidence repair works near Pollokshields East railway station. During this closure, Queen's Park was, along with several other stations on the line, one of the first to receive the new ScotRail colours and signage that would replace Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and the incumbent franchise holder's branding.\nQueen's Park station is now protected as a category B listed building. In 2011, part of the station was converted to house Queen's Park Railway Club, a contemporary art space.\nIn 2018 through 2019, over 750,000 passenger journeys were recorded going to or coming from Queen’s Park Station.\nServices\n1979\nService provision consisted of two trains per hour between Neilston and Glasgow Central, two trains per hours between Newton and Glasgow Central, two trains per hour serving the Cathcart Inner Circle and two trains per hour serving the Cathcart Outer Circle Service.\n2016\nService provision consists of two trains per hour between  and Glasgow Central, one train per hour between Newton and Glasgow Central, one train per hour serving the Cathcart Inner Circle and one train per hour serving the Cathcart Outer Circle Service. The Circle services do not operate on Sundays, so the overall frequency at the station drops to 3 per hour each way.\nRoutes\n|previous =\n|route    = ScotRailCathcart Circle\n|col      =  |lightcol= }}\nLine and station open\n|previous = Line and station open\n|route    = Caledonian RailwayCathcart District Railway\n|col      =  |lightcol= }}\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.queensparkrailwayclub.co.uk/index.html Queens Park Railway Club]"
