Recent excavations at the Xiaonanshan site, situated on the left bank of the Ussuri River in Heilongjiang Province, China, have enabled comparative studies between the ceramic and lithic materials of these two regions. These investigations reveal significant cultural parallels and suggest a broader areal cultural complex during the Neolithic period.\nSources"
