As expected, incumbent President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya was easily re-elected against weak opposition.\nThe opposition alleged election fraud, and Ould Taya's main challenger, former military ruler Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla (the man who Ould Taya ousted when he seized power in December 1984), was arrested both immediately before and after the vote. The elections saw two notable firsts; Aicha Bint Jeddane was the country's first female presidential candidate, and Messaoud Ould Boulkheir was the first descendant of slaves to run for the office.\nThe elections took place a few months after a violent unsuccessful coup attempt in June 2003. Ould Taya was overthrown in a coup two years later, in August 2005.\nResults\nReferences"
