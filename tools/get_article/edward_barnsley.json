These two family members were leading figure heads of the Arts and Crafts movement along with their friend, Ernest Gimson. Edward Barnsley was educated at Bedales School, and as a young man, worked on the building of the school's Grade 1-listed Library, which was designed by Gimson.\nBarnsley's most celebrated work is possibly the archbishop's throne and lectern in Canterbury Cathedral.\nHe was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to design in the 1945 New Year Honours.\nHe died in Portsmouth, aged 87.\nReferences"
