In the past, the tool was based on and used GIANT AntiSpyware's engine. The program is currently at version 3.1. Sunbelt Software released version 2, which includes a revamped interface and smaller memory footprint.\nIt was available for download as a 15-day trial version, but effective May 23, 2011, CounterSpy was discontinued and is no longer available for purchase.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060516103756/http://www.sunbelt-software.com/CounterSpy.cfm Official site]"
