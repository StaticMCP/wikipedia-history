The core purpose was to encourage the study of theory and practice of banking and all allied subjects. It was established under the Pakistani Companies Ordinance 1984 with a paid up capital of Rs. 250.0 million. The equity was contributed by the nationalized commercial banks and PBC that held 3% of the shares in its name.
