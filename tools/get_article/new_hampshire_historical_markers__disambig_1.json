The New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources (DHR) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) are jointly responsible for the historical marker program. The program is authorized by [http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XIX/227-C/227-C-4.htm RSA 227 C:4, X], and [http://gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/NHTOC/NHTOC-XX-236.htm RSA 236:40 to 44]. , DHR has installed 291 markers, although several have been retired or refurbished.\nMarkers\nNew Hampshire's historical markers are green with white text; the state seal sits atop each one. There is generally a title line and up to 12 lines of text, each of which has no more than 45 characters. Some markers note the year they were installed; it may be centered under the main text (early 2000s to present) or right-justified under the main text (1980s through early 2000s), although there are some visible exceptions. The installation date is not listed on older markers.\nAny individual or group may propose a marker to commemorate significant New Hampshire places, persons, or events. Requests must be accompanied by a petition for the marker, signed by at least 20 New Hampshire citizens. The state's Division of Historical Resources has final decision rights for all markers. Markers funded by the state must be located along a state highway.  A \"co-operative marker\" must be funded by whoever proposes it, and it can be located on a locally maintained road or on municipal land. , the state's website listed the cost of a marker at $2,000 to $2,500.\nMarkers generally have the same text on both sides, with some exceptions. Marker number one in Pittsburg only has text on one side.}} Marker number 122 in Carroll features the Mount Washington Hotel on one side and the Bretton Woods Monetary Conference on the other; several other markers also have different topics on each side. A few markers appear to have unique layouts:\n* Number 127 in Portsmouth provides a two-part narrative on a single subject, directing the reader to \"see other side\".\n* Number 207 in Madison includes an image of the Gee Bee Model R-1 airplane built by Granville Brothers Aircraft.\n* Number 208 in Manchester has text on one side in English, and the same information on the other side in French.\n* Number 236 in Concord discusses Civil War mustering on one side and lists specific regiments on the other.\nOrganizers have advised, via the state's website, \"As of January, 2025, the Historical Highway Marker program is currently focused on the rehabilitation and repair of existing markers and is not currently accepting new marker proposals.\"\nMarker status\nThe state periodically publishes a roster of markers which lists the status of each one. The vast majority of markers are \"Installed\", while a few may be \"Out for Repair\". Several markers have been \"Retired\", which indicates permanent removal. A New Hampshire Historical Highway Marker Advisory Committee has existed since the summer of 2020, \"created and convened to complete a systematic review of existing markers for lack of historical context among other problems.\"\nRetired markers\nIn 2023, the state published and revised criteria whereby markers may be retired:\n# The marker contains errors of fact\n# The condition of the marker is such that the cost of repair approaches the cost of a new marker\n# The marker requires refurbishment, but its historical or educational value is \"severely limited\"\nSince March 2022, the following markers have been listed as retired:\n* Number 36 in Bow, which discussed an 1833 visit by Andrew Jackson\n* Number 55 in Rumney, which discussed the 1712 destruction of \"a Pemigewasset Indian village\" and resulting \"scalp bounty\"\n* Number 85 in Raymond, which discussed \"the 1747 massacre of [three residents] by Indians of the Winnipesaukee Tribe\"\n* Number 278 in Concord, which discussed Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a labor leader and feminist who served as chairwoman of the Communist Party USA and was convicted under the Smith Act\nMarker Quest\nIn May 2022, the Division of Historical Resources announced a Historical Highway Marker Quest program, encouraging people to visit the state's markers, and offering a free sticker to anyone who visits 10 markers and submits a form listing them.\nList of markers\n]]\nThe following pages list each marker, ordered by marker numbers as chronologically assigned by the state. Each page contains 25 entries, noting each marker's city or town, and providing the text on the marker.\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (1–25)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (26–50)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (51–75)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (76–100)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (101–125)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (126–150)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (151–175)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (176–200)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (201–225)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (226–250)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (251–275)\n*List of New Hampshire historical markers (276–300)\nMarkers by community\nThe below table alphabetically lists each city or town that has at least one historical marker.
