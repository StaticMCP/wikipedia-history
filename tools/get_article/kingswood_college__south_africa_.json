Founded in 1894 by William C Muirhead, Clifford Witheridge Dold, William Burnett Stocks and Richard Restall Stocks, Kingswood caters for boys and girls from Grade 000 to Grade 13 (Bridging Year) from all over the world.\nAt Kingswood College, the National Senior Certificate examination is administered by the Independent Examinations Board.\nHistory\nKingswood College was founded in March 1894 by William C Muirhead, Clifford Witheridge Dold, William Burnett Stocks and Richard Restall Stocks, who considered that there was a need for a school for boys on the same lines of the local Wesleyan High School for Girls. The foresight of the four visionaries initially led to the establishment of the Wesleyan Collegiate School for Boys, which subsequently became Kingswood College. The first Trust Deed formalising the establishment of Kingswood College was notarially executed by Lorimer Dold on 20 August 1895.\nThe College was based on the British Public School model and until 1972 was a boys only school, becoming co-educational in 1973, when the first girls were enrolled, and fully co-educational by 1975.\nThe school is closely associated with Kingswood School, in Bath, England. As a Methodist School, it has close ties with St Stithians and Kearsney College.\nGovernance\nThe Kingswood College Council (or Board of Governors) bears an overall responsibility for the School's corporate governance by leading, governing and monitoring the overall business of the College. The composition of the Council covers a range of professional expertise and members are drawn from around the country, including an elected parent representative from each of the Junior and Senior Schools.\nThe College Council is made up of nominated and elected members, with members of Senior Management also in attendance at meetings as Invitees. In terms of the provisions of the College's Deed of Trust, the President of the Old Kingswoodian Club is the Official Trustee.\nCampus\nKingswood College campus is located on the Eastern side of Makhanda (Grahamstown) in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Running directly through the campus is Burton Street, which was internally renamed in 2019 as Rev Dr Simon Gqubule Avenue in recognition of the late Methodist Presiding Bishop.\nThe College campus comprises a mix of buildings, combining the historic older buildings with newer ones being built through the 20th and 21st century. The first buildings of Kingswood College were designed by architect William White-Cooper. His design was in the Queen Anne Revival style, with its typical red brick, prominent gables and white painted woodwork. This distinctive style is interspersed on the campus with various historical buildings.\nThe Memorial Chapel\nFrom Kingswood's foundation in 1894 until 1961, the historic Commemoration Methodist Church in Grahamstown (dating back to 1850) was the de facto College Chapel, with Kingswood pupils occupying the pews in the gallery. In 1962, the College's Memorial&nbsp;Chapel was consecrated, occupying a strategic and pivotal position on the campus between the Junior and Senior schools. Designed by an Old Kingswoodian architect and built in a cruciform shape, with North and South transepts and ambulatories, it has a pipe organ and numerous stained glass windows. A Norman style clock tower rises above the entrance to the Chapel.\nBoarding at Kingswood\nKingswood has six Seniors School boarding houses, and two Junior School boarding houses.\nSenior School:\n* School House was built in 1894 and housed both Chubb and Gane House. In 1996, the house almost entirely destroyed by a fire. Rebuilt in its original style, School House once again houses both Chubb and Gane House.\n** Chubb House: named after former Principal, The Reverend Theophilus Chubb (1892-1898).\n** Gane House: named after former Headmaster, Colonel Ernest G Gane (1892-1927).\n* Wood House: named in 1921 after Henry Richard Wood, one of Kingswood's founders and Chairman of the College Council from 1896 – 1921. It was originally a single storied structure known as Stanton's Wagon Factory and is the oldest building on campus.\n* Jagger House: named in recognition of John William Jagger, a Johannesburg businessman and educational philanthropist who donated generously to the school.\n* Jacques House: named after Reverend Dr George Henry Paul Jacques CMG MBE, who became Chairman of the College Council from 1938-1946. Originally the Main House of the Wesleyan High School for Girls (built in 1882), it was taken over by Kingswood in 1935.\n* Kirkby House: named after Reverend Howard Kirkby for his contributions to Kingswood. It was officially opened in 2005.\nFile:Kirkby House.jpg|alt=\nFile:Jagger House (Kingswood College).jpg|alt=\nFile:Jacques House (Kingswood College).jpg|alt=\nFile:Wood House (Kingswood College).jpg|alt=\nFile:School House (Chubb and Gane House).jpg|alt=\nJunior School:\n* Hobson House, originally built as a private dwelling for Richard Restall Stocks, the house was converted to Kingswood accommodation in 1969. In 2017 it was demolished and construction commenced in 2018 to build the new Hobson House.\n* Van Vuuren Village: named after retired maintenance manager, Eben van Vuuren for his contributions to Kingswood, and consists of a number of adjoining Kingswood properties.\nThe Junior School also has four sports houses, namely:\n* Rich House: named after Captain Cecil Oliver Rich, who was Headmaster from 1949-1954.\n* Slater House: named after Jack Slater, who was Headmaster from 1958-1963.\n* Tarr House: named after Ray Tarr, Who was Junior School Headmaster from 1955-1968.\n* Dacam House: named after Charles Dacam, who was Headmaster from 1964-1970.\nMusic School\nThe Music School is situated in the historic Walton House. The Music School is home to seven music teachers who offer a wide range of instruments including flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, trumpet, trombone, French horn, tuba, euphonium, violin, cello, double bass, piano and organ.\nMusic as an academic subject begins in Grade 8 and continues through to Grade 12, while class music is a key component of the core curriculum for all pupils from Grade 1 to Grade 9.\nNotable alumni\nAcademia, politics, business\n* Allan Mossop - Chief Judge of the British Supreme Court of China\n* Kenneth Kingo Smith - Regional Magistrate: Johannesburg\n*Neil Aggett - Medical doctor and political activist who died in police custody\n* Rear Admiral Chris Bennett - South African Navy and author\n* Dr Nico Malan - Administrator of the Cape Province\n* Uyinene Mrwetyana - key figure in the movement against gender-based violence in South Africa.\n* David Divine CBE DSM - Author (also under the pen name David Rame) and Defence Correspondent for the UK's Sunday Times\n* Wally Judge - General Manager of the Cape Times\n* Jeremy Mansfield - Radio and television presenter and author\n* Harvey Tyson - Editor of Johannesburg's The Star newspaper and author\n* Graham Beck - Founder of the [https://www.kangracoal.com/ Kangra Group], business magnate, philanthropist, wine maker and horse stud breeder\n* Dr Geoffrey de Jager - Entrepreneur, Philanthropist and director of companies.
