This was the fifth edition of the event that would eventually become known as the Commonwealth Games, the second post-war Games, the second Canadian Games after the inaugural event in Hamilton and the first event since the name change from British Empire Games took effect in 1952.\nThe main venue was the Empire Stadium, which had neen specifically constructed for the games at the cost of £500,000. Work on the 25,000 seated stadium started in October 1953 and the keys were handed over to Stan Smith (General chairman of the games) on 12 July 1954.\nThe games were attended by 24 nations and 662 competitors. It was the first time that the games gained a television audience, when CBC and NBC transmitted pictures to an estimated 100 million North American viewers.\nIt was at these games that the \"Miracle Mile\" took place between Roger Bannister and John Landy at the Empire Stadium. This was the first time these two (and at that time the only two) sub-four-minute mile runners appeared in the same race, and also the first time two runners broke four minutes in the same race. On the same afternoon, Jim Peters, the holder of the world best time for the marathon, entered the stadium 17 minutes ahead of his nearest rival, but collapsed on his final lap, and never completed the race.\nVenues\n*Opening and Closing Ceremonies: Empire Stadium, Hastings Park\n*Aquatics: Empire Pool, University of British Columbia, West Point Grey\n*Athletics: Empire Stadium\n*Boxing: Exhibition Forum\n*Cycling (track): Empire Oval (Broadway Bowl)\n*Cycling (road): 1155 East Broadway\n*Fencing: Lord Byng School Gym, West Point Grey\n*Lawn bowls: West Point Grey Bowling Club, New Westminster Lawn Bowling Club\n*Rowing: Vedder Canal, Chilliwack\n*Weightlifting: Exhibition Garden, Hastings Park\n*Wrestling: Kerrisdale Arena\n*Athletes' Village: University of British Columbia, West Point Grey\nParticipating teams\nCountries that participated\n24 teams were represented at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.\n* 23px Australia\n* : first appearance\n* : first appearance\n*\n*\n*  (host)\n* 23px England\n* 23px Fiji\n* : first appearance\n* 23px Hong Kong\n* 23px India\n* 23px Jamaica\n* 23px Kenya: first appearance\n* 23px New Zealand\n* 23px Nigeria\n*  Northern Ireland\n* : first appearance\n* 23px Pakistan: first appearance\n*   Scotland\n* 23px South Africa\n*\n*\n* 23px Uganda: first appearance\n*  Wales\nMedal table\nand John Landy]]\n| gold_CAN = 9 | silver_CAN = 20 | bronze_CAN = 14 | host_CAN = yes  | name_CAN =\n| gold_NZL = 7 | silver_NZL = 7 | bronze_NZL = 5\n| gold_SCO = 6 | silver_SCO = 2 | bronze_SCO = 5\n| gold_SRH = 2 | silver_SRH = 2 | bronze_SRH = 1\n| gold_TTO = 2 | silver_TTO = 2 | bronze_TTO = 0 | name_TTO =\n| gold_NIR = 2 | silver_NIR = 1 | bronze_NIR = 0\n| gold_NRH = 1 | silver_NRH = 4 | bronze_NRH = 3\n| gold_NGR = 1 | silver_NGR = 3 | bronze_NGR = 3 | name_NGR =\n| gold_PAK = 1 | silver_PAK = 3 | bronze_PAK = 2\n| gold_WAL = 1 | silver_WAL = 1 | bronze_WAL = 5 | name_WAL =\n| gold_JAM = 1 | silver_JAM = 0 | bronze_JAM = 0 | name_JAM =\n| gold_BAR = 0 | silver_BAR = 1 | bronze_BAR = 0 | name_BAR =\n| gold_BHK = 0 | silver_BHK = 1 | bronze_BHK = 0 | name_BHK =\n| gold_UGA = 0 | silver_UGA = 1 | bronze_UGA = 0 | name_UGA =\n| gold_BGU = 0 | silver_BGU = 0 | bronze_BGU = 1\n}}\nSports\n*\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.commonwealthsport.com/commonwealth-games/vancouver-1954 \"Vancouver 1954\"].
