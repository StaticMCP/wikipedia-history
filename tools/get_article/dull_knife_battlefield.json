It was the scene of the Dull Knife Fight on November 25, 1876, in which the Fourth Cavalry under General Ranald S. Mackenzie raided the winter encampment of the NorthernCheyenne, destroying most of their material culture and all their winter supplies and thus forcing the Northern Cheyenne to seek shelter with the village of Crazy Horse in order to survive the winter. Five hundred ponies were captured and about 173 lodges destroyed. The Dull Knife battlefield is on private land and is available to visit only by special arrangement.  The fight took place on November 25, 1876.\nThe battlefield site was considered by the Cheyenne to be sufficiently remote to be safe as winter quarters.  The location is now the site of a ranch. The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* at the National Park Service's NRHP database\n*[http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/NationalRegister/Site.aspx?ID199 Dull Knife Battlefield] at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office\nPhoto gallery\nFile:Dull Knife Battlefied View to East.jpg|Dull Knife Battlefield looking east from Big Red Draw\nFile:Dull Knife Village Site.jpg|Site of Dull Knife Village looking south from creek\nFile:Dull Knife Battlefield Marker.jpg|Battlefield marker above Dull Knife Village\nFile:Ambush Draw Dull Knife Battlefield.jpg|Ambush Draw where Lieutenant McKinney was shot\nFile:Hospital Hill Dull Knife Battlefied.jpg|Hospital Hill where Lieutenant McKinney died\nFile:Breastworks Above Big Red Draw.jpg|Breastworks built by Northern Cheyenne defenders above Big Red Draw"
