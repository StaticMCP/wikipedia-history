As of 2022, there are an estimated 26.9 million professional software engineers worldwide, up from 21 million in 2016.\nBy country\nUnited States\nIn 2023, there were an estimated 1.6 million  professional software developers in North America. There are 166 million people  employed in the US workforce, making software developers 0.96% of the total workforce.\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Role!! # !! SE title !! # !! TE title !!

Many systems analysts manage software development teams, and as analysis is an important software engineering role, many of them may be considered software engineers in the near future. This means that the number of software engineers may actually be much higher.\nIt is important to note that the number of software engineers declined by 5 to 10 percent from 2000 to 2002.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In 2000 in the U.S., there were about 680,000 software engineers and about 10,000,000 IT workers. As of early 2025, there are an estimated 47.2 million software developers worldwide, representing a 50% increase from 31 million in Q1 2022.\nThere are no numbers on testers in the BLS data.\nIndia\nThere has been a healthy growth in the number of India's IT professionals over the past few years. From a base of 6,800 knowledge workers in 198586, the number increased to 522,000 software and services professionals by the end of 200102. It is estimated that out of these 528,000 knowledge workers, almost 170,000 are working in the IT software and services export industry; nearly 106,000 are working in the IT enabled services and over 230,000 in user organizations.\nAustralia\nIn May 2024, the Australian government reported that 169,300 Australians are employed as software and applications programmers, 17% of who are women. The role grew annually by 8,300 workers.\nRussia\nAccording to the Russian government, the number of IT specialists in the country increased by 13% in 2023, reaching approximately 857,000. During the initial phase of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 100,000 IT specialists left Russia.\nSee also\n* Software engineering\n* List of software engineering topics\n* Software engineering economics\n* Software engineering professionalism\nReferences"
