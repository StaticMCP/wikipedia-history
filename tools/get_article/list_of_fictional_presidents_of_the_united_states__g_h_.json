The assassination prompts Sheridan's younger brother, Walter, to announce he is running for office at the next election against Galbrain.\n* During Galbrain's term, a group of powerful people in the United States, calling themselves \"The XX\" (\"The Twenty\"), planned a coup during a war simulation exercise, using loyal SPADS soldiers, to replace US democracy with a totalitarian government.\n* Unbeknownst to Galbrain, his close advisor and Secretary of Defense Calvin Wax was a senior leader of the plot, as was Walter Sheridan. Under Walter's orders, Wax convinced Galbrain to delay declaring a national emergency upon learning of the plot.\n* Later, SPADS soldiers attack a military site Galbrain visits, with his life being saved by XIII, the man accused of William Sheridan's murder. However, the stress of the near assassination results in Galbrain resigning and dropping out of the race, clearing Walter's path to office.\n* In the TV adaptation, Galbrain is sworn into office in November 2007 following the assassination of President Sally Sheridan during a Veteran's Day speech. Over the following few months, the US is plagued by a series of terrorist attacks and continued inability to find Sheridan's killer.\n* Due to his administration's perceived inaction, Galbrain is challenged for re-election by Wally Sheridan, the Republican Governor of North Carolina and Sally's brother from the opposite party. Ahead of the 2008 presidential election, Galbrain is trailing in the polls.\n* Unbeknownst to Galbrain, his Chief of Staff Calvin Wax, Defense Secretary Ellery Shipley and Wally Sheridan himself are co-conspirators in a plot to stage a de facto coup in the US. Together with their allies in business, media, the military and intelligence, they planned to detonate a dirty bomb on Election Day to ensure Sheridan's election and justify the use of draconian, authoritarian powers.\n* The plot is defeated thanks to the efforts of XIII and his allies, NSA Agent Jones and General Carrington. In the aftermath, Wax and Shipley commit suicide whilst a majority of the conspirators are arrested. Sheridan is unexposed, however, and defeats Galbrain in the election. After proving his innocence to investigators, Galbrain resigns from office in November 2008 at Sheridan's request, with the Speaker of the House serving as acting president until Sheridan's inauguration in January 2009.\n* Party: Democratic\n* Played by: John Bourgeois in XIII: The Conspiracy\nPresident Gamberelli\n* President in: We Who Survived (1959) by Sterling Noel\n* President in 2203–04\n* Disbelieves prediction of world catastrophe.\n* Presumed dead.\nPresident Paul Garcetti\n* President in: Political Animals\n* A US Senator, he defeats former First Lady and governor of Illinois, Elaine Barrish Hammond for the Democratic nomination and upon his election, he names Barrish as Secretary of State although relations between them worsen due to disagreements over foreign policy\n* In office, Garcetti listens more to the counsel of his amoral vice president Fred Collier and chief of staff Barry Harris. However, he akes Secretary Barrish's advice when a Chinese submarine is downed off the Los Angeles coast by launching a successful rescue operation\n* After the Chinese rescue, Garcetti refuses to accept Barrish's resignation so she can run for president against him in the Democratic primaries and he offers the Vice Presidency to her at the next election which Barrish is poised to accept. Before Barrish can accept the vice-presidential spot on the ticket, President Garcetti is lost and presumed killed when Air Force One crashes into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of France. This leaves Vice President Collier as the new acting president. Garcetti's corpse is found in the wreckage, which makes Collier the president.\n* Term: January 2009 – July 2011\n* Party: Democratic\n* Played by: Adrian Pasdar\nPresident Jules Gardiner\n* President in The Squadron Supreme, a Marvel Comics mini-series.\n* Former U.S. Postmaster General.\n* Serves as president after the alien Overmind forces former President Kyle Richmond to conquer the World.\nPresident Chauncey Gardiner\n* The simple-minded gardener, becomes a TV celebrity by a series of coincidences. He appears at the end of Jerzy Kosinski's book \"Being There\" (and the film made based on it) selected as the next president by a cabal of powerful business people. The implication is that once they select him, his actual election to the office is a foregone conclusion.\nPresident Hal Gardner\n* Served from 2007 to 2009\n* 47th President in 24\n* Party: Republican\n* Vice President under Charles Logan from 2006–2007 until Logan resigns after being arrested for involvement in David Palmer's assassination in Day 5.\n* Serves out the remainder of Logan's term, but is unsuccessful in securing a full four-year term in the 2008 presidential election to Democrat Wayne Palmer.\n* Previously served as United States senator from Kentucky, governor of Kentucky, and Kentucky secretary of state.\n* Played by: Ray Wise\nPresident Frederick Randolph Garner\n* President in: Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman episodes \"Meet John Doe\", \"I Now Pronounce You...\" and \"Lois and Clarks\"\n* His first and middle names can be seen on a paper he is signing in \"I Now Pronounce you  .  .  .\", and his last name is used in \"Meet John Doe.\"\n* Played by: Fred Willard\nPresident Thomas Edison (Shy) Garland\n* President in: ''Father's Day'', novel by John Calvin Batchelor\n* Former astronaut, former senator from Texas, nicknamed Shy and a nephew of Lyndon B. Johnson.\n* Elected vice president under Theodore G. Jay in 2000, assumes the reins of power as acting president, as per the 25th Amendment, after Jay goes on a leave of absence due to a deep depression. Garland is much more popular than President Jay and attempts to have Jay ruled unfit by Congress and the Cabinet when Jay tries to reassume the presidency. He also orchestrates a military coup to assassinate Jay if the attempt to have him declared unfit fails.

He loses the popular vote, but wins the Electoral College vote by 306 to 232.\n* Caitlyn Jenner serves as his running mate. However, Mike Pence is later seen serving as vice president.\n* After Kyle Broflovski and the pressure group Millennials Against Canada protest the Netflix revival of Terrance and Phillip, worsening American-Canadian relations culminate in Garrison launching a nuclear strike against Toronto.\n* He deliberately mishandles the COVID-19 pandemic to fulfill his racist campaign promises (as ethnic minorities suffered disproportionately higher fatalities), even incinerating a pangolin which may have been the key to creating a vaccine.\n* Apparently having lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, he returns to his old teaching job. However, a large number of children are pulled out of South Park Elementary either because their parents hate him or are loyal QAnon supporters who misinterpret his demands for them to stop accosting him as a coded message to spread conspiracy theories by becoming private tutors. While on vacation to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina with his boyfriend Rick, Garrison is tempted into attending MAGA rallies, readopting his presidential persona, but begs Rick to take him back during an election speech, saying that he needs someone to be accountable to (resulting in his followers storming the Capitol whilst chanting \"I love Rick\").\n* 45th US President\n* Party: Republican\n* A parody of and surrogate for Donald Trump. However, in \"Sermon on the 'Mount\", Trump is depicted as the incumbent president, with his administration's actions leading the citizens of South Park to mistakenly believe that Garrison is president again and break down his door to confront him.\n* Gender: Male (although was briefly a transgender woman)\nPresident Kelly Geller\n* President in The Last Ship (TV series) (Motion Book and Season 1)\n* First female president.\n* Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is elevated to the role of president after he and the vice president succumb to the Red Flu months before.\n* Contacts the  after months of radio silence during the ship's mission in the Arctic, and orders them to return to the United States if Dr. Rachel Scott has managed to synthesize a cure to the Red Flu.\n* Invites the remaining officials from the United States Government into the bunker beneath the White House to escape the Red Flu pandemic.

Studies Law at Harvard, where he is classmates with his future wife, Mellie.\n* Narrowly defeats Democratic challenger Samuel Reston in the 2008 presidential election, although this is primarily through election fraud in Defiance County, Ohio (which he is unaware of until late into his first term).\n* A Republican, he surprises his party by reaching across the aisle during his second term in office, appointing Democrats to his cabinet and taking on issues such as immigration reform [the DREAM Act], Education reform and Equal Pay and successfully passing a gun control bill, completely antagonizing the Republican base. As the death of his son, Fitzgerald Thomas 'Jerry Jr.' Grant IV, helps him win re-election due to public sympathy, these actions may be Grant's attempts either to self-justify his second term or to honour the memory of his son (a Democrat who supported Samuel Reston's 2012 candidacy).\n* Has three vice presidents during his term – Sally Langston, who covets the presidency, even challenging him unsuccessfully as an independent in the 2012 presidential election; Andrew Nichols, who covertly tries to have Grant killed; and finally Susan Ross, a former senator from Virginia appointed primarily for the purpose of Mellie Grant obtaining a Senate seat and being unchallenged for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.\n* His administration has three Chiefs of Staff over eight years with Cyrus Beene, Elizabeth North and Abby Whelan; as well as six press secretaries, two of whom are killed via gunfire.\n* Attempts to divorce his wife and move in his mistress, crisis and public relations manager Olivia Pope, whilst in office.

After a contentious marriage that results in several infidelities on Fitz's part, the Grants divorce during the fifth year of Fitzgerald's presidency.\n* When Grant is rendered comatose following an assassination attempt and Vice President Sally Langston becomes acting president, she forges Grant's signature on a letter ending invocation whilst he is still comatose. Between then and Grant's eventual recovery, she may well have exercised presidential powers, paralleling Edith Wilson's 'stewardship' following her husband Woodrow's stroke.\n* After the death of her son Fitzgerald Thomas 'Jerry Jr' Grant IV (whom she originally thought was conceived as a result of being raped by Fitz's father, Fitzgerald Thomas Grant II), she enters a period of mourning which alienates her from her surviving children, Karen and Theodore, generates press speculation about her mental health, and leads to humiliation after requisitioning federal government resources to solve a much publicised open-and-shut case involving the deaths of two hikers.\n* Former US senator from Virginia from November 2013 to January 2017. Although former vice president and conservative talk-show host Sally Langston questions the constitutionality of a first lady holding elected office, that fact likely helps to get her elected.\n* A Harvard Law graduate where she came top of her class, practicing for a period as a highly skilled corporate lawyer before giving up her career to support her husband's political ambitions.\n* Launches a campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, eventually defeating Vice President Susan Ross and business tycoon Hollis Doyle for the nomination. She selects NSA Director Jake Ballard as her running mate.\n* Loses the 2016 presidential election by an exceptionally narrow margin electorally to Democratic nominee Pennsylvania governor Francisco Vargas, while carrying the popular vote; Vargas' assassination on Election Night throws the presidency into contention due to the constitutional amendments allowing electors to vote for their preferred candidates.\n* Lobbying from Grant's team as well as revelations and pressures surrounding Democratic vice presidential nominee, former White House chief of staff Cyrus Beene, leads to Grant winning the Congressional vote for the Presidency.\n* Grant selects Luna Vargas, a Democrat and Francisco's widow, as her vice presidential choice to unify the nation after Jake Ballard resigns as vice president-elect. Grant's team are unaware though that Luna Vargas has supposedly masterminded Francisco's assassination and is similarly planning an assassination against Mellie.\n* Luna Vargas' role is exposed and she is covertly murdered on Inauguration Night, though the whole plot is actually the brainchild of Beene.\n* Administration officials include Vice President Cyrus Beene and White House Chief of Staff Olivia Pope, who is later replaced by Jake Ballard.\n* It is suggested that she is elected to a second term in the 2020 presidential election in the final scene of the finale as she is seen signing a Gun Control bill in 2021. And if she is to finish out the term, she will seal the Republican Party's grip on the White House for 24 years.\n* Political Party: Republican\n* Played by Bellamy Young\nPresident Phil Graves\n* President in: ''Hemet, or the Landlady Don't Drink Tea\n* Played by Mark Allyn\nPresident Richard Graves\n* President in the EPIX TV Show Graves\n* Two Term President who serves from 1993 to 2001.\n* Former governor of New Mexico.\n* Wife Margaret is considering a run for the U.S. Senate.\n* Daughter Olivia recently separated from her congressman Husband.\n* Son is a Soldier.\n* Party: Republican\n* Played by Nick Nolte\nPresident James Graydon\n* President in The Agency CBS TV Series\n* Former President who serves one term.\n* After leaving office opposed CIA operations in South East Asia.\n* Played by Brian Dennehy\nPresident Charles Grayson\n* President in the CW TV Series Nikita\n* Played by Cameron Daddo\nPresident Paul Green\n* President in: Fire, a novel by Alan Rodgers\n* His wife, Ada, is killed after a plane crash and a series of medical mishaps while visiting the Soviet Union.\n* Belongs to a church called the Armageddonists, which believes man is destined to user in the end of the world.\n* During a virus-caused crisis, is killed by an Air Force serviceman before he can make good his threats.\nPresident Paul L.

Though the country is still officially called \"A Republic\", the meaning of the term republic'' has long been forgotten. The presidency had become hereditary centuries before, Joe Grozen being descended from a long dynasty of earlier Grozen Presidents. Monogamy having been dispensed with, the president can and does have as many wives as he wants. To ensure an orderly succession, the law stipulates that the President's oldest son by his Chief Orthowife would be his heir. Rozh Grozen, President Grozen's designated heir, is a brilliant young man, studying hard to prepare himself for assuming the presidency on his father's death - though, barring accidents, this would still be far in the future. Such ideas as Democracy or Human and Civil Rights having long since totally disappeared; all the American population except a tiny elite at the top are reduced (regardless of skin color) to the status of chattel slavery. Slaves, going around with shaved heads and wearing drab grey clothing, have no rights and may be tortured or killed at their owner's complete discretion. Since there is enormous overpopulation, the US population exceeds a billion (fifteen billion worldwide), slaves are completely expendable. President Grozen and his associates see nothing wrong with cannibalism, regularly consuming the flesh of \"redundant\" slaves, well-cooked by the presidential gourmet cooks. For presidential banquets, it is customary to cook whole a slave baby, \"Suckling Coolie\" being a specially appreciated dish. In daily life, President Grozen is a genial and easy going man, a loving and doting father to his sons and daughters. Though in practice an Absolute Monarch wielding more power than Louis XIV or any other historical monarch did, Joe Grozen does not stand on ceremony and likes his friends and associates to address him simply as \"Joe\". It would never occur to him that there is anything wrong in his dominating the mass of slaves, as a rancher would not feel his domination of cattle was wrong.\nH\nPresident Claire Haas\n* President in: Quantico\n* Former Vice President of the United States under President Todd.\n* Previously served as a US Senator and FBI agent.\n* Takes office after the resignation of President Todd, who steps down after his wife, First Lady Elaine Todd, is murdered during a hostage crisis at the G20 Summit in New York City. Todd opts to resign in favor of Haas due to his mental anguish impeding his ability to effectively lead the nation.\n* When information is revealed that Haas is inadvertently responsible for forming what would later become a rogue element of the CIA responsible for the attack during her time as a senator, and also illegally creates a government task force to investigate it, her resignation is demanded.\n* Not wanting the nation to have to deal with another scandal, Haas resigns the presidency after only three months in office. As no vice president has yet been confirmed, she is succeeded by her enemy, speaker of the House Henry Roarke.\n* Party: Democratic\n* Played by: Marcia Cross\n* First female President to hold the office.\nPresident Kyle Haeffner\n* President in: Shadowrun role-playing game\n* Serves 2057–2064\n* 8th UCAS President | 54th US President\n* Killed after being kidnapped by terrorists.\n* Preceded by President Dunkelzahn\n* Succeeded by VP Nadja Daviar.\nPresident Mike Hagerty\n* President in the 1980 novel Small World by Tabitha King\n* Serves one term from 1953 to 1957\n* Has a 12-year-old daughter named Dolly.\n* Dies in 1976.\nPresident Dewey Haik\n* President in the Fascist Corps running the United States in Sinclair Lewis's novel ''It Can't Happen Here''.\n* Serves as commissioner of the Northeastern Province under President Buzz Windrip, then secretary of war and high marshal of the Minute Men.\n* Collaborates in the coup d'état that removes Windrip and installs Lee Sarason as president. Shortly afterwards, Haik leads a palace coup against Sarason, assassinating him and installing himself as president.\n* Particularly brutal and repressive, Haik's rule makes citizens \"long for the liberal days of President Windrip\".\n* Launches an unprovoked war against Mexico to promote national unity.\n* Later in Haik's administration, a major revolt develops against his rule, with significant defection of military forces. The final fate of this revolt and President Haik remains unknown as of the novel's end.\nPresident Jeremy Haines\n* President in: ''The President's Plane Is Missing and its sequel Air Force One is Haunted'' by Robert Serling.\n* Widower\n* 57 at the time of the novel.\n* Former governor of a midwestern state.\n* Fakes a cross-country trip in Air Force One in order to negotiate a mutual defense treaty against the People's Republic of China with the Premier of the Soviet Union, and is forced to remain in hiding after the crash in order to complete the talks.\n* Later claims to have seen the ghost of Franklin D. Roosevelt aboard the new Air Force One.\n* Party: Republican\n* Played by: Tod Andrews in the film based on the novel\nPresident Emerson Hale\n* President in the play \"The White House Murder Case\" by Jules Feiffer\n* During his administration there is a chemical attack on U.S. troops fighting in South America.\n* The U.S. has recently ended a war in Africa that cost a quarter of a million lives.\n* The first lady is killed by the postmaster general with a golf club, but the president bows to political blackmail and appoints him secretary of state.\nPresident Archie Hall\n* President in the 1961 movie The Last Time I Saw Archie\n* Serves in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War Two.\n* A former movie studio head, he is governor of California when he announces he is running for president.\n* Played by Robert Mitchum\nPresident Charles Halsey\n* President in: The Outer Limits episode \"Trial by Fire\"\n* Shortly after being sworn in, President Halsey is faced with first contact with an armada of alien ships. As the planet arms nuclear weapons, Halsey attempts to communicate with the ships but is unsuccessful.\n* Halsey is married to Elizabeth Halsey, has children and is considered a peace-loving liberal surrounded by hawkish military leaders; President Halsey and advisors are later killed by the aliens.\n* Played by: Robert Foxworth\nPresident Anna Hamilton\n* President in: Travelers episode \"2C1\"\n* Serves as the 53rd President in the mid to late 21st century.\n* Considered a significant figure in 21st century history, in the original timeline Hamilton lost her election by a narrow margin. According to Grant McLaren, \"another old white guy\" was originally the 53rd President. She is elected in a new timeline as a side-effect of Traveler teams operating in 2017.\n* An 8-year-old child in 2017, an underground group of Travelers known as the Faction attempts to assassinate her before she can rise to prominence. Another team of Travelers are assigned to protect her until the Faction are wiped out.\n* Party: Unknown\n* Played by: Elle McKinnon\nPresident Eleanor Hamilton\n* President in: No Men Beyond This Point\n* In the alternate timeline of the film, women gained the ability to reproduce parthenogenecally in 1953, with male leaders worldwide ignoring claims of \"fatherless pregnancies\" and accusing women of lying, leading to rioting and walkouts by women. Hamilton was elected as the first female president in 1964 after the global population became two-thirds female.\n* In 1967, her administration introduced the Worker Replacement Program, also called the \"weeding out technique\", whereby men in powerful positions had to be evaluated to see if they were actually qualified for their roles. As a result, hundreds of men lost their jobs and became homeless, with many opting to live in the countryside.\n* Hamilton was presumably the last president of the United States due to the creation of a world state under the leadership of the World's Governing Council sometime in the mid-1970s. The WGC would abolish all military forces and space programs, invest in environmental protection and cures for diseases including the common cold and cancer, establish reserves for the surviving male population, and mandate asexuality.\n* Party: Unknown\nPresident George Hamilton\n* President in C.L. Moore's Greater Than Gods (1939)\n* In one of the story's alternate futures, he is a dictatorial president in the 23rd Century.\n* A charismatic general and military leader, Hamilton is elected president and then re-elected again and again to multiple terms spanning decades. President Hamilton believes in the subjugation of the many to the State, and dreams of a United World in which all races live in blind obedience and willing sacrifice for the common good. To further that aim, he makes the United States into a nation of soldiers, families being rewarded for producing many boys, using the Cory System of genetic manipulation which produces male babies who are conditioned from birth to accept and blindly obey authority. President Hamilton then embarks on the Great War aimed at unifying the world by force. He does not see its end, dying in a bombing raid on Washington D.C. and gasps out his last words: \"Go on – unify the world!\" while half the US lies in smoking ruins. He is succeeded by his vice president and second in command Philip Spaulding who completes the conquest and unification of the world. The title of \"President\" is than changed to \"Leader\" and the formality of elections is dispensed with.\nPresident Wesley Hamlin\n* President in: Moonfall by Jack McDevitt\n* Was governor of Illinois who won the 2000 presidential election.\n* Is a distant relative of former Vice President Hannibal Hamlin.\n* Narrowly survives an assassination attempt in 2003 by the father of a victim of a convicted killer he pardons as governor.

Vice President Dan Sullivan and Secretary of State Bernie Phillips convince him not to resign.\n* Re-elected in 2004.\n* Opens his presidential library in 2011.\n* Moves back to his home town in Illinois after leaving office.\n* Party: Republican\nPresident Stuart Hammel\n* President in \"Majority Rule\", a 1992 TV Movie.\n* President Hammel leads the country during a war in the Middle East, but loses re-election to General Katherine Taylor in one of the closest Presidential Elections in history.\n* played by Robin Gammell\nPresident Alvin Hammond\n* President in: White House Down\n* Former Vice President of the United States under President James Sawyer.\n* Set to resign in protest of Sawyer's controversially proposed peace treaty to remove all American military from the Middle East.\n* Evacuates onto Air Force One when domestic terrorists bomb the United States Capitol and occupy The White House.\n* Briefly sworn in as the 47th president of the United States when President Sawyer is assumed to have been killed in an explosion at the occupied White House.\n* Killed when Air Force One is shot down by compromised NORAD missiles accessed by the terrorists from the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.\n* Party: Democratic\n* Played by: Michael Murphy\nPresident Donald \"Bud\" Hammond\n* President in: Political Animals TV Mini-Series\n* Is in office around the same time as Bill Clinton, however after what could be described as the 2008 presidential election is divorced by his wife.\n* Later is brought back into the spotlight by his ex-wife the secretary of state to secure the release of three American hostages in Iran.\n* Served previously as Governor of North Carolina.\n* First Gentleman of Illinois while his ex-wife is Governor.\n* Democrat\n* Played by: Ciarán Hinds\nPresident William \"Bill\" Haney\n* President in: My Fellow Americans\n* A rising star of the Republican Party, Haney is elected as Vice President in 1988 as the running mate of Senator Russell P. Kramer of Ohio. The pair go on to be defeated for re-election in 1992 by the Democratic ticket, headed by Governor Matt Douglas of Indiana.\n* Four years later, Haney wins the Republican nomination and defeats Douglas by a landslide in the general election. As part of this, Haney selects Ted Matthews as his Vice President. Matthews is widely decried in Washington as an idiot.\n* Nearly three years into his term, Haney is confronted by a scandal from his time as Vice President, when he had accepted bribes from defence contractor Charlie Reynolds. Haney orders his chief of staff, Carl Witnaur, to frame Kramer for the scandal.\n* NSA chief Colonel Tanner assassinates Reynolds and attempts to kill Kramer as well as Douglas, who had begun investigating the scandal. Kramer and Douglas go on the run together, eventually obtaining a confession from Witnaur and making it to the White House to confront Haney.\n* Unable to refute the evidence, Haney is forced to resign by Kramer and Douglas. He publicly cites a fictitious heart condition as the reason for his departure.\n* Unbeknownst to Haney, Matthews had been the mastermind of the events, with his idiocy being a ruse. Matthews built on Haney's attempts to frame Kramer by using Tanner as a hitman and setting up Haney for the fall. However, Kramer and Douglas secretly tape Matthews bragging about the plan, ensuring his downfall, too.\n* Played by: Dan Aykroyd\n* Republican\nPresident Benjamin Bow Hannaford\n* President in Drew Pearson's 1970 novel The President.\n* Is a former U.S. Senator who is forced to resign after allegations of corruption.\n* Stages a political comeback and wins a four-way Presidential race.\n* Survives Impeachment brought on by his handling of a chemical warfare incident.\n* Inspired by Benjamin Hanford\nPresident Hardin\n* President in the 2018 video game Red Dead Redemption 2.\n* Serves as president some time before the setting of the game.\n* Only appears on the Prominent Americans Cigarette Card Set.\n* Resembles Benjamin Harrison.\n* Political party: Unknown\nPresident Andrew Jackson Harper\n* President in The Agent from UNLESS by Cassandra Harbinger.\n* Former U.S. senator from Tennessee and vice president of the United States.\n* Sworn into office after President Dirk Morganthal \"Duke\" Cassidy is assassinated in by a supervillain in Nashville, Tennessee.\n* Orders an escalation in the Southeast Asian War, but restricts the use of superhumans in the conflict.\n* Gives the United Nations Law Enforcement & Security Service (UNLESS) free rein to deal with supervillains in the United States.\n* Does not run for a second term claiming health reasons, but in reality he is threatened with exposure as the pawn of a criminal mastermind unless he steps down.\n* Party: Liberty Party\nPresident Baxter Harris\n* President in: Scary Movie 3 and Scary Movie 4\n* Bumbling president who has to cope with alien invasions (in both movies).\n* First name \"Baxter\" revealed in the fourth film of the franchise.\n* Played by: Leslie Nielsen\nPresident John Henry Harris\n* President in Allan Folsom's novel The Machiavelli Covenant\n* Back cover copy says Harris is \"on the run ... from his murderous Cabinet.\"\nPresident William Carter Harris\n* President in S.D.

As a result, President Franklin D. Roosevelt has no pretext to take the US into the European war – much as he would like to do it. In the following years, the US concentrates its full military potential on Japan alone, achieving a complete victory by conventional means. At the same time, Roosevelt downgrades the Manhattan Project and in 1945 the US is still far from possessing a nuclear bomb. Meanwhile, Nazi Germany decisively defeats the Soviet Union and forces Britain to sign a peace recognizing German domination of Europe.\n* Andrew Harrison, the junior senator from Nebraska, is surprisingly designated as heir by Roosevelt when FDR retires after winning the war against Japan (the book does not explain why Harrison is preferred over Harry Truman). Entering into office, Harrison is pragmatically ready to accept the new global status quo, Congress being in the mood of winding down military expenses after the victory over Japan. Harrison has a summit with Hitler in Reykjavík which superficially seems cordial and constructive – especially since Harrison speaks fluent German. However, in fact the Nazis are hatching nefarious plans, which are suspected only by a young officer, Lieutenant Commander James Martel – who is unable to convince his superiors in time, and who is far too junior to have any access to the president.\n* The storm suddenly breaks – German commandos under Otto Skorzeny destroy the nuclear facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the Germans seize the uranium mines in the Congo region, and Germany seems ahead of the US in the race to gain a nuclear bomb. German forces under Erwin Rommel launch a massive surprise invasion of Britain and London is heavily bombed; the desperate Winston Churchill tells Harrison: \"This is much worse than 1940!\". Moreover, the president is unaware that German intelligence has used sexual blackmail to suborn the White House chief of staff and make him an active German spy, and the Germans discover that the British are reading their codes and completely change them.\n* The book ends with a cliffhanger; President Harrison faces one of the worst crises in American and world history. As of 2025, the promised sequel has yet to be published.\nPresident William Harrison\n* President in: The President by Parker Hudson\n* Harrison is an extreme liberal president, who becomes a Christian while in office.\nPresident Hart\n* Referred to in short story \"The Jaunt\" by Stephen King.\n* Mentioned in the same breath as President Lincoln, so presumably of some note.\nPresident Hartfield\n* President in the 1997 movie Most Wanted\n* First Lady Bonnie Anne Hartfield is assassinated as part of a plot to murder U.S. soldiers.\nPresident Spencer Harvey\n* Presidency mentioned in: Jack & Bobby\n* Notes: Resigns due to a corporate scandal\nPresident Charles Haskell\n* President in: Moonfall by Jack McDevitt\n* Becomes the youngest vice president in history in the presidential election of 2020 at the age of 35.\n* Becomes the nation's youngest president at the age of 39 after President Kolladner is killed in a Marine One crash.\n* Wins re-election in 2024.\n* Relocates the nation's capital back to Philadelphia after Washington, D.C. is destroyed by a tsunami.\n* Party: Democratic\nPresident John Harker\n* President in the novelization of Escape from New York.\n* Nicknamed \"Straddler\" because of his moderate views, actually is a cunning politician who plots his enemies' downfall from behind a facade of moderation.\n* During World War III being fought against Russia and China, President Harker was going to reveal at the Hartford Summit of a new clean superbomb and threaten to use it unless they surrendered.\n* Air Force One, under the code name David 14, is hijacked on route and President Harker is forced to eject in an escape pod the New York Federal Prison in Manhattan, and is taken hostage by the Duke.\nPresident Hathaway\n* President in Monsters vs. Aliens, a 2009 animated movie.\n* President Hathaway attempts to make first contact with an alien robot probe.\n* After the probe goes on a rampage President Hathaway orders Monsters to fight it.\n* Voiced by Stephen Colbert\nPresident Benjamin Hathaway\n* President when extraterrestrial invasion occurs in Falling Skies.\n* Played by Stephen Collins\nPresident Arne Eino Haugen\n* President in: ''The General's President'' by John Dalmas\n* Born April 3, 1924, in Koochiching County, Minnesota to parents of Norwegian and Finnish descent.\n* Serves in the 11th Airborne Division in World War II, serving in New Guinea and the Philippines.

Donnelly first needs to appoint a vice president to succeed him, having forced his previous vice president to resign days before.\n* Upon the recommendation of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Thomas M. \"Jumper\" Cromwell, President Donnelly appoints Haugen to the office of vice President and then immediately resigns, causing Haugen to immediately ascend to the presidency.\n* During his tenure, Haugen uses the powers conferred to him under the Emergency Powers Act to enact widespread reforms and changes to the legal and political landscape of the United States. This included significant changes in the areas of business law and wages, tax, education, healthcare, intelligence gathering, space exploration and significant changes to the federal court system.\n* Introduces a revolutionary new energy source, the Geogravitic Power Converter to the American and international stage, with the device having been manufactured and invented by his company Duluth Technologies. The introduction of this technology helps contribute to the United States emerging from the depression as a result of the market crash.\n* In addition to the fallout from the 1994 market crash, Haugen deals with a multitude of international and domestic incidents during his five-month tenure. These include: a Soviet invasion of Iran and Iraq, civil unrest and eventual civil war between Afrikaners and the black population in apartheid South Africa and Namibia, secession demands from Muslim majority provinces within the Philippines, a coup d'etat in the Soviet Union, homegrown terrorists detonating an atomic bomb in the Chesapeake Bay, the shutting down of martial law internment camps created to house offenders of the unrest from the market crash and dangerous mortar attacks on the White House.\n* Is made aware of the existence of weather manipulating Scalar Resonance energy weapon's that are in the possession of both the United States and the USSR. When the USSR engages in attacks with these weapons that trigger huge quakes in California and Seattle, Haugen orders a retaliatory assassination of the Soviet Premier and Politburo using the similar United States weaponry.\n* Is able to come to a diplomatic agreement with the new, moderate Soviet leadership at a conference in Zürich which begins the end of the Cold War.

Hayes's appointment is an attempt to unite the country, being the first vice president since Andrew Johnson to be from a political party in opposition to that of the president.\n* Mentioned by White House Chief of Staff David Wellington as attending a party fundraiser in Ohio, something that neither concerns nor surprises Warner. As Ohio is planning on bringing forward its state primary, Wellington suspects that Hayes is planning on running for his party's presidential nomination in 2020, opposing Warner.\n* Following the deaths of Warner and Afghan President Daoud in a helicopter crash while en route back to Bagram Airfield after delivering a speech to troops stationed in a rural area of the country announcing a peace deal between the Taliban, Afghanistan and the United States, Hayes is elevated to the presidency. Hayes orders a drone strike on the crash site to prevent Warner's corpse from being used for propaganda purposes.\n* After events in Afghanistan escalate, bringing the United States and Pakistan to the brink of nuclear war, President Mirov of Russia plays recordings from the black box of Warner and Daoud's helicopter in a televised address, proving that it crashed due to mechanical problems rather than being shot down.
