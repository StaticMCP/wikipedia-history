He was killed in action during the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff, also known as Operation Parakham.\nEarly life\nSalaria was born on July 18, 1961 in Pathankot , Punjab. He belonged to a military family, as his father was an army officer. After completing graduation, he joined the Officers Training Academy.\nMilitary career\nBeing a second generation army officer, Salaria was commissioned in the 5 Dogra Regiment in 1983. As a Major, he received the Shaurya Chakra for his gallantry actions in 1997. He is also a recipient of the Sena Medal.\nIn the early hours of 2002, Salaria had been appointed as the Commanding Officer of the 6 Dogra,  situated at Jammu and Kashmir near LOC. On 18 August 2002, Salaria led his troops for a regular patrol. During the patrol, his team was ambushed by some terrorists at Rajouri. During heavy exchange of fire between his troops and the terrorists, Salaria was shot in the neck after he  reportedly killed two terrorists. He couldn't sustain the injuries and died there.\nFor his actions, the Government of India posthumously awarded him Shaurya Chakra for the second time .\nAwards and decorations\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" | Parachutist Badge\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Shaurya Chakra & BAR\n(1997 & 2002)\nPosthumously\n| colspan=\"4\" |Sena Medal\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Special Service Medal\n| colspan=\"2\" |Sainya Seva Medal\n| colspan=\"2\" |50th Independence Anniversary Medal\n| colspan=\"2\" |9 Years Long Service Medal\n|}\nReferences"
