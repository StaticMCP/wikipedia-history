The SPJ states the purpose of the award is to promote \"the free flow of information vital to a well-informed citizenry\".\nHistory\nThe awards program began in 1939. The SPJ first awarded the Distinguished Service Awards. These awards later became the Sigma Delta Chi Awards. Prior to the creation of the awards program, the society first chose six individuals for their contributions to journalism in 1932.\nEntry requirements\nA fee is collected from each entry. Since 2007, the fee for members of the Society of Professional Journalists was $60, $100 for non-members.
