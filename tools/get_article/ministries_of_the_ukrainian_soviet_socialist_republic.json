Among other central bodies of state administration there also were committees, state committees, and other agencies. After World War II in 1946 ministries uniformly as throughout the rest of the Soviet Union replaced the existing People's Commissariats. The ministries were part of the Council of Ministries of the UkrSSR until 18 April 1991 when the latter was reformed into the Cabinet of Ministries of the UkrSSR.\nGeneral overview\nMinistries of the Ukrainian SSR governed their assigned sectors of economy, socially-cultural, and administratively-political administrations within the Ukrainian SSR. Ministries of the Ukrainian SSR were categorized in union-republican and republican, such division existed until May 13, 1991. Supposedly republican ministries were administered by the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, while union-republican ministries had double subordination to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR as well as to their respective union-republican ministries of the Soviet Union or in some instances - state committees of the Soviet Union.\nThe general principles of organization and functioning of ministries of the Ukrainian SSR are regulated by the Constitution of the Soviet Union, Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR, and other legal acts. More detailed regulations are established by the Law of the Ukrainian SSR about the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR of December 19, 1978. Additionally each ministry has its own statute that defines its tasks, powers, and legal status.\nMinistries of the Ukrainian SSR are headed by their ministers. Ministries are responsible for status and development of their respective sector and execution of state plans as well as solution of other tasks that those sectors face.\nIn 1981 there were at least 28 union-republican ministries in Ukraine and only six republican ministries. After transformation of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR into the Cabinet of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR, number of ministers decreased substantially, while their categorization on union-republican and republican was eliminated after the adaptation of Declaration on State Sovereignty of Ukraine.\nList of Ministries\nIn bold are ministries that were kept or revived in post-Soviet
