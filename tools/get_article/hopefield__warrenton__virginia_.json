The house was originally constructed around 1855 in the late Federal style. The mansion was altered in 1924, making it an unusual local example of the asymmetrical Colonial Revival style. Contributing resources include a brick summer kitchen (c. 1855); a stone walled well (c. 1855), an icehouse with an iron door (c. 1855); timber-framed, multi-purpose, drive-in crib barn (c. 1855); and the beginnings of the designed landscape that evolved with Colonial Revival-style characteristics in the early-20th century. The pump house, built within a stone ha-ha wall, and the swimming pool date to 1924. A brick four-car garage and a tenant house for staff were constructed between 1928 and 1950 in the Colonial Revival-style. A house ruin on Cedar Run (c. 1890) joins the landscape as a contributing site.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\nReferences"
