Since its creation in 2007 it has returned four council members, using the single transferable vote system. For the 2017 Glasgow City Council election, the boundaries were changed and the ward decreased in population, but continued to return four councillors.\nBoundaries\nLocated in the north of Glasgow, the ward includes Possilpark and Milton as well as Ruchill, Firhill, Hamiltonhill, Parkhouse, Lambhill, Port Dundas and part of Cowlairs, consisting of the streets to the west of the Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line railway tracks which form the ward's eastern boundary (the exception is a small section of the Colston neighbourhood on the eastern side of the tracks which is included to Canal ward; however, this area is further divided with everything north of Colston Road belonging to the adjoining town of Bishopbriggs in East Dunbartonshire). The west boundary is the Port Dundas branch of the Forth and Clyde Canal, which gives the ward its name.\nThe 2017 changes added more territory west of the main canal (which was previously the boundary but now lies mostly within the ward), taking in the Cadder neighbourhood from the Maryhill/Kelvin ward, along with a large area around Balmore Road which is almost uninhabited. In contrast, the more densely populated North Kelvinside neighbourhood was reassigned to the Hillhead ward.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Kieran Wild(Greens)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Ellen Hurcombe(Labour)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Jim MacKechnie(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Billy McAllister(SNP/Independent)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=2|Chris Kelly(Labour)\n|rowspan=2|Helen Stephen(Labour)\n|-\n!2016\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Allan Gow(SNP)\n|rowspan=1|Gary Gray(Labour)\n|rowspan=2|Robert Mooney(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Jacqueline McLaren(SNP)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Fiona Higgins(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2022 Glasgow City Council election\n2017 election\n2017 Glasgow City Council election\n2012 election\n2012 Glasgow City Council election\n2007 election\n2007 Glasgow City Council election\nSee also\n*Wards of Glasgow\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/canal-ward-glasgow-city#.Xm_WQrenzN4 Listed Buildings in Canal Ward, Glasgow City] at British Listed Buildings"
