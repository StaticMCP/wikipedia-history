Originally named in memory of Canadian broadcaster Clyde Gilmour, who was posthumously honoured as the award's first recipient, the award honours achievements in any part of the Canadian film industry, including direction, production, criticism, broadcasting and film festival programming, that have helped to enrich the understanding and appreciation of film in Canada.\nSince 2013, the recipient has also been empowered to select an emerging filmmaker to a receive a \"pay it forward\" grant of $50,000 in post-production services toward the production of a forthcoming film. As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the presentation of the TFCA awards in 2020, no recipient of the \"pay it forward\" grant was announced that year; accordingly, the 2022 recipient of the Luminary Award was authorized to choose two \"pay it forward\" filmmakers to compensate for 2020.\nRecipients\n{|class = \"wikitable sortable\" width=100%\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:45%;\"| Clyde Gilmour recipient\n! style=\"width:45%;\"| \"Pay-it-forward\" filmmaker\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| 1997\n| Clyde Gilmour\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 1998\n| Gerald Pratley\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 1999\n| Elwy Yost\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2000\n| colspan=2 align=center | not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n| James Quandt\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2002\n| Wayne Clarkson\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n| colspan=2 align=center | not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| Kay Armatage\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n| Robin Wood\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Allan King\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n| colspan=2 align=center | not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| colspan=2 align=center | not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| Mark Peranson\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n| colspan=2 align=center | not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n| John Dunning\n| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n| colspan=2 align=center| not presented\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n| Norman Jewison\n| Jeff Barnaby\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Piers Handling\n| Randall Okita\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n| Deepa Mehta\n| Nisha Pahuja\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n| Alanis Obomsawin\n| Amanda Strong\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n| Zacharias Kunuk\n| Isabella Weetaluktuk\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n| Tantoo Cardinal\n| Darlene Naponse\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| Michèle Maheux\n| Lina Rodriguez\n|\n|-\n| 2020\n| Jason Ryle\n| not awarded\n|\n|-\n| 2021\n| David Cronenberg\n| Kelly Fyffe-Marshall\n|\n|-\n| 2022\n| Steve Gravestock\n| Hugh Gibson, Frieda Luk\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Charles Officer\n| Thyrone Tommy\n|\n|-\n| 2024\n| Tonya Williams\n| Leena Minifie\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
