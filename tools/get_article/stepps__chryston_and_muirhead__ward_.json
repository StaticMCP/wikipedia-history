It currently elects three councillors and, as its name suggests, covers the settlements of Stepps, Chryston and Muirhead (as well as Auchinloch) with a combined population of 12,290 in 2019.\nIt was created in 2007 as Strathkelvin, covering a larger territory also including Gartcosh and Moodiesburn (the eastern boundary being the M73 motorway) and returning four councillors. A nationwide boundary review in 2017 that recommended more representation for the area overall led to these communities being placed in a separate new ward (along with Glenboig from the Coatbridge North ward), with the remainder of the Strathkelvin ward renamed and returning one fewer councillor. A specific review in 2019 caused the addition of a few streets of modern housing at Cardowan which had been in the North East ward of the Glasgow City Council area, re-allocating them to North Lanarkshire along with the rest of the developments in that area, addressing an anomaly dating back to when the boundary crossed open fields.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Frances McGlinchey(SNP)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Joe Shaw(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Brian Wallace(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|William Hogg(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=4|John McLaren(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Lynne Anderson(SNP/Alba)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Steven Goldsack(Conservative)\n!colspan=3; rowspan=3|3 seats\n|-\n!2021\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Josh Cairns(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Claire Louise Williams(Green)\n|}\nElection results\n2017 Election\n|numcounts= 5\n}}\n*On 22 May 2018, Conservative councillor Stephen Goldsack was expelled from the party after previous connections to the British National Party were exposed.\n2012 Election\n*SNP councillor Frances McGlinchey resigned from the party on 24 October 2012 in protest at the vote to overturn its long-standing opposition to NATO.\n2007 Election\nReferences"
