He was previously erroneously reported by historians and officials to have been an Indigenous Australian.\nHoward was originally a Nambour rugby league player, before switching to rugby union in the mid-1930s.\nA winger, Howard played his first-grade rugby in Brisbane for Bretts-Windsor and Brothers. He was capped twice by the Wallabies in 1938, against the All Blacks for Bledisloe Cup matches in Sydney and Brisbane. The Wallabies didn't play another Test match for eight years due to the war. He went back to Nambour in 1939 and returned to rugby league.\nSee also\n*List of Australia national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
