He gained Wallabies selection the following year for New Zealand's visit, featuring in both Test matches. After a self imposed year long absence due to his studies, Boyce was a regular fixture on the wing for the Wallabies from 1964 to 1967. His two tries against New Zealand in Wellington on the 1964 tour helped the Wallabies to their greatest winning margin over the All Blacks. One of his teammates on that tour was his brother Jim, playing on the other wing. He played all five Tests on the 1966–67 tour of Britain, Ireland and France.\nSee also\n*List of Australia national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
