      "text": "# Deathstalker War\n\nDeathstalker War is a science fiction novel by British author Simon R Green.\nThe fourth in a series of nine novels, Deathstalker War is part homage to – and part parody/satire of – the classic space operas of the 1950s, and deals with the timeless themes of honour, love, courage and betrayal.\nSet in a far-future fictional universe, Deathstalker War develops the plot and themes introduced in the previous books in the series.\nReferences"
