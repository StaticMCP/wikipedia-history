The battlefield is located about  north of Prescott, Arkansas, spanning the Little Missouri River in Clark and Nevada counties. The  battlefield area was designated a part of the Camden Expedition Sites National Historic Landmark, made up of several of the Union expedition's key sites, on April 19, 1994.\nDescription\nThe Elkin's Ferry Battlefield is a predominantly wooded area, crossed by the Little Missouri River, and Middle and Howard Creeks, which are tributaries to its south that flow roughly from west to east. The present alignment of Nevada County Route 37 and Clark County Route 14 roughly follows the route of the Union forces. The presumed ferry site is still visible as a deep cut in the river bank near the road.  The ferry was replaced by a wooden bridge in the 1920s, which was washed out sometime in the 1950s or 1960s.  The construction of Interstate 30 resulted in the decreased significance of the area for transportation, and contributed to the preservation of the battlefield.  The area is also flood-prone (as it was in the 1860s), and not suitable for development.\nSee also\n*List of National Historic Landmarks in Arkansas\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Clark County, Arkansas\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Nevada County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.battlefields.org/visit/battlefields/elkins-ferry-battlefield Elkin's Ferry Battlefield] at American Battlefield Trust"
