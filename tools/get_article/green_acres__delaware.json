I-95 runs along its southeastern border. Green Acres has two entrances, both of which connect to Silverside Road that runs along the northeastern border of the community, and across from which is the neighborhood of Windybush. Stoney Creek runs along its western side and creates its border with Carrcroft.\nHistory\nGreen Acres was established in 1955 by Franklin Builders on land previously owned by Patricia Monagham. The company had penchant for use 'green' in naming its projects: Green Acres, Green Meadow, Radnor Green, Green Tree and Nottingham Green.\nGreen Acres was designed for middle-class families.  Its homes were built among tall trees, rather than completely cleared land as was common at the time.  Shaded sidewalks were built along each street to provide a safe area for children and strollers.  The neighborhood took four years to complete, totaling 376 homes. It is noted for what at the time was its modern split-level architecture, reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright.\nStreets were laid out and named in alphabetical order after American colleges: Athens, Bucknell, Carson, Drake, Emery, Fresno, and Grinnell roads run parallel to Silverside Road. Newcomb, Oberlin, Quincy, Radford, Stanford, and Tulane roads all run perpendicular to Silverside Road.\nNotable people\n*J. Caleb Boggs, US Senator from 1961–1973.\n*Erik Kissa, scientist and author.\n*Lynn Troy Maniscalco, photographer.\nReferences"
