For this, Mr Agarwal built a manufacturing unit \"Kraftwares (I) Ltd\" at Palghar, Mumbai and took a step by setting up a factory in Bhandup, Mumbai, which was manufacturing stainless steel products for the local market. These products are now in the national market as \"Vinod Bowl\" or \"Vinod Entry Dish\".\nAs a modestly priced product, Vinod cookware is accessible to many Indian households. The range of cookware supports cooking a broad spectrum of Indian cuisine.\nHistory\nTimeline\n* 2015 - Mandira Bedi becomes brand ambassador\n* 2014 - Vinod Group became the largest exporter of stainless\n* 2013 - Sakshi Tanwar as its Brand Ambassador\n* 2006 - Set up another factory in Palghar\n* 2000 - manufacturing base was set up in Palghar\n* 1992 - Vinod Cookware went global as Kraftwares began to export\n* 1990 - Vinod launched Aluminum Sandwich Bottom Cookware\n* 1987 - Collaborated with Saphymo Steel\n* 1977 - Factory opened in Bhandup\n* 1962 - The company founded as a cookware trading company\nProducts\nProduct Category:\n* Pressure cooker\n* Pressure PAN\n* Zest non-stick\n* Hard anodized\n* Triply\n* Stainless steel\n* Kraft appliances\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-sector-fmcg/vinod-cookware-introducesvito-health-cookware-113110812962_1.html Vinod Introduces \"Vito Health\"]\n*[http://www.fnbnews.com/Equipment/Vinod-Cookware-launches-Multi-Kadai-with-dhokla-idli-and-patra-plates Vinod Cookware Introduces Multi Kadai]\n*[http://www.fnbnews.com/Equipment/vinod-cookware-offers-zest-superb-a-cookware-in-2-colours--combo-pack-38049 Vinod Cookware Introduces Zest Superb+]\n*[http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253325 Vinod Cookware – a debt free Rs300 crore company]"
