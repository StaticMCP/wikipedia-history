It has been described as President Yoweri Museveni's \"army within an army\".\nOverview\nIt began in 1996 as the Presidential Protection Unit (PPU) and expanded to a full-fledged brigade on 21 February 2003. As such, the commander at the time, Captain Muhoozi Kainerugaba, President Museveni's son, was promoted to a major. In 2010, it was placed under Ugandan Special Forces Command (USFC).\nThe 10,000 strong brigade has personnel pulled from western Uganda and trained to be loyal to the president first and foremost. The unit is responsible for counter-revolutionary, irregular warfare operations, preventing terrorist attacks in the country, protecting the President of Uganda, providing security in the Lake Albert region, and special operations assigned.\nSee also\n*Presidential Guard (Zimbabwe)\n*Presidential Guard Brigade (Nigeria)\nReferences"
