      "text": "# 2003 Minnesota Vikings season\n\n| AP All-pros =\n| uniform = File:Vikings 1996-2005.png\n| shortnavlink = Vikings seasons\n}}\nThe 2003 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 43rd in the National Football League (NFL). They finished second in the NFC North with a 9–7 record, behind the 10–6 Green Bay Packers, but missed the playoffs for a third straight year. Despite gaining 6,294 yards of offense over their 16 games, by far the most in the league, the team managed just 416 points, the sixth-most in the NFL. The Vikings won their first six games of the 2003 season, then lost their next four games, after which they alternated wins and losses for the remainder of the season.  The Vikings were officially eliminated from postseason contention with a loss to the Arizona Cardinals on the last play of their final game.\nWide receiver Randy Moss led the NFL with 17 touchdown receptions, the third time in his career that he led the league in that category. After two seasons of inconsistency, rejuvenated quarterback Daunte Culpepper was voted to play in the second Pro Bowl of his career at the end of the season.\nOffseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Additions || Subtractions\n|-\n|QB Gus Frerotte (Bengals) || QB Todd Bouman (Saints)\n|-\n|T Mike Rosenthal (Giants) || DE Lorenzo Bromell (Raiders)\n|-\n|LB Chris Claiborne (Lions) || CB Tyrone Carter (Jets)\n|-\n|CB Ken Irvin (Saints) || FB Harold Morrow (Ravens)\n|-\n|CB Denard Walker (Broncos) ||\n|}\n2003 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"|2003 Minnesota Vikings draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"|Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"|Round\n!style=\"\"|Overall\n|-\n!1||9\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue|Kevin Williams||Defensive tackle||Oklahoma State||In lieu of #7 (time expired)}}\n|-\n!2||40\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue|E.
