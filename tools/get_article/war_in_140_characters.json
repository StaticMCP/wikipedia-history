They include the investigative journalist Eliot Higgins of Bellingcat, who is discussed in two chapters of the book.\nReviews\nPatrikarakos' book was widely reviewed in the international press, including by Ben Judah in The Times, who wrote that \"War in 140 Characters should be mandatory reading at Sandhurst.\" In the military sphere, War in 140 Characters was placed on the reading lists for the largest security conference in the world, the Munich Security Conference, and the UK's Royal Air Force Centre for Air Power Studies and singled out as essential reading by Admiral Foggo at an October 2018 meeting of the Atlantic Council. In January 2018, the incoming head of UK Chief of the Defence Staff, Nick Carter concluded his first major policy speech at Royal United Services Institute by calling on the 77 Brigade to observe the lessons of Patrikarakos' book.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://www.amazon.co.uk/War-140-Characters-Reshaping-Twenty-First/dp/046509614X"
