He played college football for the UCLA Bruins, earning third-team All-American honors in 1994. He was selected by the Chiefs in the fourth round of the 1996 NFL draft.\nEdwards retired as one of only eight players in the history of the NFL to record more than 20 interceptions and 20 sacks during his career. Since his retirement in 2009, Edwards has devoted himself to philanthropic work with the Best Defense Foundation and children from underprivileged backgrounds.\nEarly life\nEdwards was born in Chula Vista, California, and is the second of eight brothers and sisters. Despite stark financial circumstances, Edwards excelled in school and athletics, where he played football, baseball, and wrestled. On the football field, as a slight linebacker at only 170 pounds, Edwards believed that academics would be his ticket to opportunity. He remains an active advocate for education, and emphasizes this point in his work with schoolchildren.\nCollege career\nEdwards accepted a scholarship to UCLA where he played as a linebacker for UCLA from 1992 to 1995. Edwards left school ranked third in tackles for losses in school history with 38, and fifth in sacks in the school's history, with 22.5 sacks. He also tied the school record for sacks in a game with 4.5 sacks versus Southern Methodist University, and ranks second in school history for sacks in a single season, with 12.5 sacks. Following his junior year, he won third-team All-America honors. He also played baseball as a junior at first base and third base. Edwards was a member of the Alpha Rho chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at UCLA, and played center-field on the UCLA baseball team.\nProfessional career\nFirst stint with Chiefs\nEdwards was drafted in the fourth round (98th overall) of the 1996 NFL draft by the Kansas City Chiefs.\nOn February 28, 2002, the Kansas City Chiefs officially released Edwards after they were unable to come to terms on a new contract. Edwards was released a day before receiving a $2.8 million bonus.\nSan Diego Chargers\nOn April 25, 2002, the San Diego Chargers signed Edwards to a five-year contract as an unrestricted free agent.\nHis first season with the squad, he made the 2002 Pro Bowl as an alternate. He was a starter for the Chargers since the time he joined the team. He averaged 154 tackles from 2003 to 2005, and made at least 100 tackles from 1997 to 2005.\nAfter recording half a sack against the Kansas City Chiefs in a week 7 game of the 2006 season, Edwards became the 9th player in NFL history to become part of the 20/20 Club. He retired with career totals of 23.5 sacks and 28 interceptions, just nine short of the NFL record for most interceptions by a linebacker (37 by the Baltimore Colts' Don Shinnick).\nAt the conclusion of the 2006 NFL season, Edwards' contract was allowed to expire, making him a free agent.\nDuring his tenure, Donnie took time to talk to and counsel youths who came to Chargers practice.\nSecond stint with Chiefs\nOn March 10, 2007, Edwards re-signed with the Kansas City Chiefs after his five-year stint with the San Diego Chargers.\nEdwards was released by the Chiefs on February 24, 2009.\nPhilanthropy\nSince retiring, Edwards has devoted himself full-time to philanthropy. He donates time and money to the charitable organizations and institutions that provided positive guidance during his youth. He hosts an annual 'Dad's Day with Donnie' in San Diego, California. The event provides children who are missing a father figure the unique opportunity to spend a day with professional athletes. He is also a dedicated supporter of the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation, After School All-Stars, the Best Defense Foundation, and Jump for Life.\nEdwards also supports the U.S. military. Influenced by his studies in political science at UCLA and a grandfather who served in World War II, Edwards has participated in seven United Service Organization tours. In 2018, Donnie and his wife Kathryn, started the non-profit, Best Defense Foundation. The Foundation focuses on three pillar programs—Battlefield Returns take veterans back to their battlefields; Stronghold Transitions provides retreats for newly transitioning special force operators to focus on mental health; Education Initiative to promote the preservation of the legacy of those who have served in the military.\nPersonal life\nEdwards travels between his two homes in Rancho Santa Fe, California and Brentwood, California with his wife Kathryn Eickstaedt; they appeared together on the sixth season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. He is a certified yoga instructor and has served as a brand ambassador for Jaeger-LeCoultre and Panerai watches.\nHe is of Mexican, Native American, and African American descent.\nNFL career statistics\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
