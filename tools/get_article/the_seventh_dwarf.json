It is a sequel to the films 7 Dwarves – Men Alone in the Wood (2004) and 7 Dwarves: The Forest Is Not Enough (2006), and is the first film in the series that is animated.\nIn the castle, Fantabularasa is a big celebration for the 18th birthday of Princess Rose, who has been cursed by the evil ice fairy, Dellamorta. If she is pricked with a sharp object before midnight, the whole kingdom will sleep for 100 years. For protection, the princess is required to wear armor. All is going well until clumsy Bobo, the seventh dwarf, makes a big mistake — and Dellamorta's curse is fulfilled. Only with a kiss of true love can the curse be lifted. Dellamorta captures the kitchen boy, Jack, who loves Rose. With the help of a dragon named Burner, the dwarves search for \"Prince Charming\".\nThe film was released in cinemas on 25 September 2014 in Germany and on 31 July 2015 in the US. The director Harald Siepermann died in February 2013 during the production of the film. It received negative reviews from critics and audiences.\nPlot\nAt Fantabularasa Castle, Princess Rose's 18th birthday is celebrated in grand style. If she doesn't prick herself on a sharp object by midnight, the curse of an evil ice fairy that puts the entire kingdom into a hundred-year sleep won't take effect. Therefore, the princess is equipped with a suit of bronze armor.\nEverything goes according to plan until the clumsy Bubi, the seventh dwarf, makes a big mistake and Dellamorta's curse takes hold. To free the princess from her enforced sleep, a kiss of true love is needed. The depressed dragon Burner helps the seven-member troupe and begins the search for Prince Charming, who turns out to be the kitchen boy Jack. But he is severely punished for this by the Ice Fairy. She transforms the dragon into an ice figure and takes Jack away with her. The dwarves follow her and Bubi sadly bids a farewell to his friend Burner. As he does so, he presses his warm little hand to Burner's heart. This activates his inner flame and he begins to thaw, but the dwarves don't notice because they have already chased Jack all the way to the throne room of Fantabularasa Castle.\nBubi insists that Jack now kiss Rose, who is sleeping there. But Rose is under a magical spell cast by Dellamorta and is only freed from the spell by Bubi when he plays Rose's music box and the song reminds Jack of his true love. Dellamorta now tries by all means to prevent Jack from giving his beloved Rose the redeeming kiss. She conjures up a huge and terrifying ice figure that the little dwarves are powerless against. Bubi accidentally discovers the magic potion that the court tinkerer had prepared for her, but before he can give it to Jack, the Ice Fairy takes the bottle. The dwarves are about to give up, but suddenly Burner appears, now completely thawed and, to everyone's delight, can finally breathe fire. This melts the ice monster instantly. The dragon's fire is ineffective against Dellamorta, however, because she hurls her ice beams at him.\nAmidst all the commotion, Jack tries to \"fight\" his way to Rose, but the Ice Fairy notices and plans to use her deadly ice beams on the kitchen boy. Bubi wants to prevent this and, not entirely intentionally but very effectively, places a large mirror between the two opponents. The beams then reflect back onto Dellamorta, transforming her into an ice figure. Now Jack can kiss Rose undisturbed, and the entire castle and its inhabitants immediately awaken from their enforced sleep.\nCast\nNearly all performers of the first two films voice their characters in the German version.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\"\n|-\n!

Factory release probably will creep out kiddies […].\" Justin Chang of Variety Magazine calling it \"CG-animated musical mash-up of fairy tales would still be a pretty pathetic excuse for children’s entertainment,\" and the film \"offers a witless recombination of elements from classic Grimm stories and some of the bigger U.S. toon hits of recent vintage […].\" Charles Solomon of Los Angeles Times says that elements from the animated movies \"ineptly stitched together into a leaden film that children will enjoy about as much as lumps in their oatmeal.\"\nSoundtrack\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     =\n| label      = Universal Music\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n;Track list (Soundtrack)\n# ‘Hauptthema I’\n# ‘Bakery Song’ (Kuchenback Lied)\n# ‘Kuchenschlacht’\n# ‘Hey, Dwarves ...’ (Hey Zwerge)\n# ‘Ankunft im Schloss’\n# ‘Happy Birthday’\n# ‘Dellamorta's Tango’\n# ‘Waffen!’\n# ‘Merman Rap’ (Meermänner Rap)\n# ‘Freundschaft’\n# ‘Take a Chance’ (Gib dir ne Chance)\n# ‘Pfeifen & Barbershop’\n# ‘Fairy Tales’ (Manchmal werden Märchen wahr)\n# ‘Size Doesn't Matter’\n# ‘Burner entdeckt Bubi’\n# ‘Schlittenfahrt’\n# ‘Der Hoftüftler’\n# ‘Das Drachentor’\n# ‘Geh nicht weiter’\n# ‘Schlosswalzer’\n# ‘Der Fluch’\n# ‘Eisriese’\n# ‘Hauptthema II’\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
