It operates as a 501(c)(3) charity and veterans' service organization, headquartered in Augusta, Georgia. The organization aims to build a network of resources and experts to improve the lives of veterans.\nHistory\nAmerica's Warrior Partnership was founded by Jim Lorraine, who currently serves as its President and CEO. Lorraine first became involved with military support services through active service as an Air Force flight nurse and serving as the director for the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Care Coalition supporting wounded, ill, or injured special operations forces service members across the US military until 2011.\nFollowing this, Lorraine became the executive director of the Augusta Warrior Project, a community veteran nonprofit based in Augusta, Georgia. Through the Augusta Warrior Project, AWP was selected by the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) to implement a new national program called Community Integration in 2013. At the time, AWP was fully integrated within the Augusta Warrior Project and sought to expand the program nationally. In July 2014, AWP received its own certificate of incorporation as a 501(c)(3).\nAWP has implemented its Community Integration (CI) program in partnership with nine communities across the United States, serving over 50,000 veterans, family members, and caregivers. As of 2023, AWP has reportedly generated an estimated economic impact of close to $300 million for their network.\nVeterans and military support programs\nAWP operates at a national level, connecting veterans with community resources through a network of case coordinators. It also expands the reach of local veteran-serving organizations by linking them to national resources. If l resources are unavailable or exhausted, local organizations can consult The AWP Network for vetted national partners.\nThrough its branches and affiliate locations, America's Warrior Partnership trains and leads nine communities in direct service to veterans and their families. These locations include Alaska, Navajo Nation, Indiana, Florida, Texas/New Mexico, Georgia, California, South Carolina, and Western New York.\nOperation Deep Dive™\nOperation Deep Dive™ (OpDD) is a national death study conducted by the AWP using large data sets to understand which characteristics put veterans at the greatest risk for dying prematurely. AWP first began this study in partnership with University of Alabama in 2017, with the study take over by Duke University beginning in 2023.\nOpDD included veterans' death data collected from the US states Alabama, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, and Oregon across 2014-2018. The study looked across veterans by age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, military history including where they served, for how long, and what duties they performed during their service. This data set was corroborated with the US Department of Defense.\nResults\nThe OpDD report used the data from the 8 included states to establish a national death rate for Veterans. The study reports that the combined rate would be at least 44 former service members committing suicide every day. This is 2.4 times higher than the suicide rate recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nThrough Operation Deep Dive, the AWP found that approximately 20 former service members die per day by self-injury mortality, which previously were listed as accidents/undetermined (including asphyxiation, accidental gunshot, drowning, suicide by law enforcement, and high-speed, single-driver accidents) instead of suicide. More than 80% of these deaths were coded as overdoses.\nMission Roll Call\nAWP launched Mission Roll Call, a national initiative that features a digital platform that enables veterans, their families, and caregivers to participate in polls and contribute perspectives on improving veterans' quality of life within communities. The Mission Roll Call program became a separate organization in 2024.\nReferences"
