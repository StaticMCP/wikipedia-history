It was dedicated to the Polish American and Polish Canadian soldiers who served in the Blue Army during the First World War.\nThe monument consists of a sculpture that depicts a three soldiers of the Blue Army running to a battle, while emerging from a large ocean wave, symbolising their American origin.

The remaining soldiers are on foot, with the one if the right holding firearm, and the one on the left, a standard depicting Polish ealge. Their uniforms and standard are painted blue. At the bottom of a sculpture is an inscription that reads \"Dla ojczyzny ratownia, rzucim się przez morze\", which translates from Polish to \"To save our homeland, we shall attack from across the sea\". It refers to the line from the national anthem \"Poland Is Not Yet Lost\", that reads \"Dla ojczyzny ratownia, wrócim się przez morze\" (\"To save our homeland, we shall return from across the sea\").\nThe sculpture is placed on a pedestal in a shape of a pyramid, that is covered in tiles.
