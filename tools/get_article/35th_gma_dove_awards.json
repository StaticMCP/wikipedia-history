The show was held at the Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, and was hosted by Deion Sanders and Yolanda Adams.\nNominations were announced months earlier by Steven Curtis Chapman and Toby McKeehan.\nThe event was transmitted live to theaters in 50 cities as part of Regal Entertainment Group \"One Night Only\" event. The livecast was shown at Regal Cinemas, United Artists Theatres, and Edwards Theatres.  There was no delayed television broadcast, as part of a controversial move by broadcast rights holder UPN, scorned by Sanders for leaving CBS' The NFL Today (UPN owned CBS) in favour of Disney's NFL Countdown in the weeks between the awards ceremony and broadcast date, cancelled the television broadcast.  This move was similar to a 1989 incident on CBS' 60 Minutes when a story on Richard Petty intending to air on the show in the weeks before the Daytona 500 was cancelled following reporter Diane Sawyer's defection to ABC.  (That story was later edited and rewritten with Harry Reasoner the following season.)\nThe ceremony was eventually broadcast in December 2004 on Pax (now Ion Television).\nMercyMe won Artist of the Year, plus two other awards, while Jeremy Camp was awarded New Artist of the Year.\nPerformers\n;Telecast ceremony\nThe following performed:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n|TaitT-Bone\n|\"Raised In Harlem\"\n|-\n|Hezekiah WalkerByron Cage\n|\"I Need You To Survive\"\"Presence of the Lord\"\n|-\n|MercyMe\n|\"Here with Me\"\n|-\n|Smokie Norful\n|\"I Need You Now\"\n|-\n|Jeremy Camp\n|\"Take My Life\"\n|-\n|Third Day\n|\"Wire\"\n|-\n||CeCe Winans\n|\"Hallelujah Praise\"\n|-\n|Randy Travis\n|\"Three Wooden Crosses\"\n|-\n|Jars of ClayAshley ClevelandThe Williams Brothers\n|\"Amazing Grace\"\n|-\n|Out of Eden\n|\"Love, Peace, and Happiness\"\n|-\n|Nicole C.
