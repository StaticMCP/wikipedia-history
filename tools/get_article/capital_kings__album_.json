At CCM Magazine, Matt Conner told that the release matches \"the energy and appeal of their flagship artist\", and he found that having \"guests like Britt Nicole, and Royal Tailor will keep fans interested in the entire package.\" Joshua Andre of Christian Music Zine called the album \"near flawless\". CM Addict's David Bunce proclaimed the effort as being \"strong\" and that the release contains \"great songs, catchy tunes, and a great message!\" At Jesus Freak Hideout, Roger Gelwicks evoked that this is an \"electronic pop project that showcases some practiced talent from the get-go\", but it does have some drawbacks that Gelwicks noticed such as \"often struggling to pair up impressive beats with introspective songwriting\". Samuel Parker of Cross Rhythms told that \"it's been a long while since US CCM has brought us anything danceworthy but this talented twosome are making up for lost time.\" Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre found this to be \"an uplifting and enjoyable album.\" Rich Smith of Louder Than the Music affirmed that this release is \"fantastic\", and \"the duo bring a bit of freshness to the Christian music scene\". At New Release Tuesday, Sarah Fine alluded to how the duo \"is already changing the face of new wave/electro pop in the Christian music world\", but does find that \"there are a couple moments on the album where songs feel slightly monotone, but in general, it oozes with fresh and fun musical creativity\".\nTrack listing\nBonus track\n\"We Belong As One (Family Force 5 Phenomenon Remix)\" was originally included as part of the album when purchased from the iTunes store, but was later removed from the album, making it only available for purchase on the duo's EP Remixd.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
