The referendum question read: \"Are you for a sovereign and independent state of Macedonia, with a right to enter into any future alliance with the sovereign states of Yugoslavia?\" It was approved by 96% of voters, with a turnout of 76%; most ethnic Albanians in the country boycotted the referendum over the latter half of the referendum question. 8 September is celebrated as Independence Day in North Macedonia (formerly just Macedonia).\nBackground\nAmid the fall of communism in Europe in 1989, the socialist government of Macedonia introduced reforms parallel to the Glasnost reforms of the Soviet Union. Political pluralism was legalised, and multi-party elections were held in November 1990. In August 1991, the Macedonian parliament passed a motion to hold an independence referendum on 8 September 1991.\nQuestion and results\nThe question on the referendum was: \"Are you for a sovereign and independent state of Macedonia, with a right to enter into any future alliance with the sovereign states of Yugoslavia?\" The latter part of the question was intended to reserve an independent Macedonia the right to join a revived version of Yugoslavia in the event of Yugoslavia's total collapse. Many ethnic Albanians in the country, although in favour of Macedonian independence, boycotted the referendum because they opposed the latter part of the question, as they were wary of Serbian political dominance in a future Yugoslavia of any form. Nonetheless, turnout was over 76%, with 96% of voters in favour of independence and the right to join a new Yugoslavia. Despite the Albanians' boycott, a multiethnic government was formed after Macedonia's declaration of independence later that year.\nThe anniversary of the referendum, on 8 September, is celebrated as the Independence Day of North Macedonia (formerly just Macedonia).\n}}\nReferences"
