He was the third of six sons and two daughters born to John Miller and Harriet (née Edwards) Miller. His father, who was also an artist, was a gentleman of private means. One of his elder brothers was John Douglas Miller, who, like William, was a pupil of the Royal Academy schools, became a prominent mezzotint engraver and protégé of George Richmond. His eldest brother was Arthur William Kaye Miller, who spent 44 years at the British Museum where he became a bibliographer and was eventually appointed Keeper of Printed Books.\nOn his family's return to England, they settled in St Pancras, London. In 1869, he was awarded the silver medal for \"Best Drawing from the Antique\" from the Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington House.\nCareer\nMiller began exhibiting at the Royal Academy in 1873, primarily with portraits and figure subjects. He exhibited regularly until 1893, then more sporadically,  all portraits, in 1895, 1900, 1903 and 1909. He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1891, as well as the Grosvenor Gallery, the New Gallery, at Birmingham Art Gallery and at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, until 1909. Afterwards, his practice ran privately until .\nIn 1897, Miller was commissioned to paint a full-length portrait of the 8-year-old George St Vincent Harris (later 5th Baron Harris), who started collecting clocks as a boy. In 1910 he made a portrait of fellow collector Lewis Evans, who endowed the History of Science Museum, Oxford in 1925. Miller gave the Oxford museum three items, including a 16h-century iron clock.\nIn 1915, Miller lent approximately over 150 clocks and other time pieces to the Victoria and Albert Museum, which he later bequeathed to the museum. Miller was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1923 for his horological interests. In 1934, he donated six clocks and ninety-five watches, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, to the Guildhall Museum (which today are in the collection of the Museum of London).\nPortrait gallery\nFile:Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott (1852–1920).jpg|Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott, 1874\nFile:Edmund Ernest Leatham 1887.jpg|Edmund Ernest Leatham, 1887\nFile:William David Murray, Viscount Stormont.jpg|William David Murray, Viscount Stormont,\nFile:Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig.jpg|Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig, 1896\nFile:William Edwards Miller (c.1852-after 1929) - Richard Edward Lawley (1887–1909) (painted posthumously from a photograph) - 21103 - National Trust.jpg|Richard Edward Lawley, between  and\nFile:William Edwards Miller (c.1852-after 1929) - Walter FitzUryan Rice (1873–1956), 7th Baron Dynevor - 869209 - National Trust.jpg|Walter Rice, 7th Baron Dynevor, between  and\nFile:William Edwards Miller (c.1852-after 1929) - Lowry Egerton Cole (1845–1924), 4th Earl of Enniskillen, KP - 631039 - National Trust.jpg|Lowry Cole, 4th Earl of Enniskillen, 1902\nFile:William Edwards Miller (c.1852-after 1929) - Lady Marjorie Hervey (1898–1967), Later Lady Erskine - 851755 - National Trust.jpg|Lady Marjorie Hervey (later Lady Erskine), 1908\nFile:William Edwards Miller (c.1852-after 1929) - Lady Phyllis Hervey (1899–1990), Later Lady Phyllis MacRae - 851754 - National Trust.jpg|Lady Phyllis Hervey (later Lady Phyllis MacRae), 1908\nFile:Archibald Kennedy, 4th Marquess of Ailsa.jpg|Archibald Kennedy, 4th Marquess of Ailsa, 1910\nFile:William Edwards Miller (c.1852-after 1929) - The Honourable Arthur George Child Villiers (1883–1969) - 772278 - National Trust.jpg|The Hon.

She was daughter of two Camden-based artists, Henry Fleetwood Backhouse and Margaret (née Holden) Backhouse, a successful British portrait and genre painter.

They had no children. He later lived with Emma Rothwell (1876–1956), a retired schoolteacher who reportedly was Miller's his adopted daughter. Miller died at 50 Weymouth Street, in the Marylebone district in the City of Westminster on 2 March 1940. Following his death, Emma gave \"several wooden sculptures of religious subjects from the Miller collection to the V&A.\" On her death in 1956, she left the V&A a longcase clock which Miller had left her.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07319/william-edwards-miller William Edwards Miller (active 1873-1929), Draughtsman] at the National Portrait Gallery, London"
