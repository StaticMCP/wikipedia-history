Situated side-by-side, they merged in the 1980s. Despite this, it is still the oldest surviving pub in Kingston. Originally a coaching inn, it was frequented by a number of patrons including Charles Dickens and Jerome K. Jerome. The latter left an inscription on the upstairs window. A 1983 study noted the building's attractive early 18th century brick front, as well as the original staircase and plaster ceilings on the first floor.\nReferences"
