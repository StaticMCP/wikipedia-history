The expedition was led by the Governor of Danish India, Willem Leyel, and executed by the sloop Valby. Leyel managed to seize a Bengali vessel, which included 34 slaves and seemingly converted them to Christianity.\nBackground\nBecause of previous cargo losses, the Danish East India Company declared war on the Mughal Empire in 1642 and began conducting a series of private ventures against Bengali merchants. These expeditions would continue for a couple of years and proved useful for sustaining the Company's finances.\nExpedition\nIn January 1644, after returning from a privateering venture, the Valby was sent on another expedition by Governor Willem Leyel. The new expedition brought a prize with a load of Bengali linen, pepper, a small amount of ambergris and some Chinese silk. The captain of the vessel, Abdul Gany, and six other Moorish merchants were subsequently imprisoned. Additionally, 34 slaves were on board, most of which being children. All were carefully registered by the Danes and presumably baptized with Christian names.\nAftermath\nThe slaves were presumably sold according to oral tradition, however, the consequences for Gany and the likely Muslim Moorish merchants are unknown. Possibilities includes being sold or held to ransom.\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
