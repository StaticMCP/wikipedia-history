Its central business district has long been a commercial, retail, and entertainment center with a distinctive skyline.\nNewark was founded in 1666, and its downtown grew around the site of the early settlement at Four Corners. Early high-rises were developed there and at Military Park during the economic boom of the Roaring Twenties. Since the mid-2000s numerous buildings have been re-lit and made more prominent.In the New Newark  era (1960s-1970s) modernist buildings went up, particularly around Washington Park. In the post-industrial-high tech era, development was concentrated in the Gateway District near Penn Station, with many buildings clad in reflective glass.  Clusters of residential high-rises are found throughout the city, particularly near Weequahic Park and Branch Brook Park.\nSince the 2000s numerous commercial buildings have been converted to apartments. Since the 2010s Newark has seen a resurgence of high-rise construction, with most projects primarily located Downtown.\nThree ZPMC Super-Post-Panamax container cranes each measuring  at Port Newark are the tallest structures in the city.\nSkyline\nMilitary Park Newark skyline.jpg|North of Military Park\nNewark aerial looking northwest.jpg|Aerial view 2005\nNewarknight.jpg| Eleven80, National Newark, Prudential\nFile:2021-09-19 Newark.jpg|South of Bridge Street Bridge\nFile:Newark NJ Skyline.jpg|North to Downtown Newark\nTallest buildings\nThis list ranks Newark buildings that stand at least 210 feet (64 m) tall, based on standard height measurement. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts, flagpoles, or permanent cranes. An equal sign (=) following a rank indicates the same height between two or more buildings.
