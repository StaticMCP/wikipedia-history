Although a lower debut then their prior release \"A Higher Place,\" which debuted at #73, \"The Discovery\" moved more units in its first week, with 6,400 sold as opposed to 6,000.\nThe album was favorably received by critics, receiving praise for the band's evolving, more technical, sound, but also noting the band wasn't quite there in terms of refining their sound entirely. Blabbermouth.net noted the album's \"obvious jump in compositional creativity\" was approaching \"awe-inspiring at times,\" but wished the band had shown some restraint with their \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach.\" The review noted that when played at \"high volume on a good system, it becomes even more apparent that 'The Discovery' is packed full of amazing musicianship (the guitar work in especially),some scintillating synthesizer lines, and numerous cool \"parts.\" The problem is that in trying to do so much, the forest frequently gets lost for the trees.\"\nAllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann gave the album three stars out of five, nothing Joe Buras' keyboards give the album a feeling of \"sophistication,\" to the point that they make the album \"sound like an album that was recorded in a studio with two rooms at which a progressive rock band was working next door and their music sometimes bled through the wall.\"\nWriting for PopMatters, Chris Colgan wrote that the album was \"solid\" with a \"number of unexpected twists and turns,\" and praised the continued evolution of the band's sound, though noting some may accuse them of Meshuggah influenced \"trend-jumping.\" Colgan praised the solos from McKinney and Richardson, as well as the increased keyboard presence from Buras, concluding:\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBorn of Osiris\n* Ronnie Canizaro – lead vocals\n* Jason Richardson – lead guitar\n* Lee McKinney – rhythm guitar\n* David Da Rocha – bass\n* Joe Buras – keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals\n* Cameron Losch – drums\nProduction, recording and other staff\n* Don Byczynski and Lee McKinney – engineering\n* Jason Suecof – mixing\n* Alan Douches – mastering\n* Ash Avildsen – additional lyric writing, vocal production\n* Cameron Gray – artwork\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
