Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are about 20,000 scheduled monument entries on the list, which is maintained by Historic England; more than one site can be included in a single entry.\nWhile a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, Historic England considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by Historic England to \"no longer merit scheduling\" it can be descheduled.\nLancashire has over 140 scheduled monuments including burial mounds, Roman remains, medieval sites, mining relics, castles and various bridges.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!Image\n!Name\n!Feature\n!Location\n!District\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Ashnott lead mine and lime kiln\n|Mining\n|Newton\n|Ribble Valley\n|On a limestone knoll at Ashnott Farm. Lead mining occurred here in periods from at least the 1300s up to the 19th century. There are earthworks and buried remains of the surface workings, mine shafts and dams built to supply water to the site. The listing also includes a single-pot lime kiln, possibly built here to make use of waste rock from the mine.\n|-\n|\n|Askew Heights prehistoric enclosure\n|Enclosure\n|Quernmore\n|Lancaster\n|A univallate (single-walled) defended enclosure  across, surrounded by an approximately  ditch, with entrances in the north and south. On a hilltop overlooking the Lune valley, there is also a deep hollow way ascending the hill, thought to be a track to the site.\n|-\n|\n|Badger Hole, Warton Crag\n|Cave\n|Warton\n|Lancaster\n|A cave about  up the west face of Warton Crag, overlooking Morecambe Bay. The cave chamber is approximately , with a partially blocked passage leading from the mouth which opens onto a  platform. Excavations have revealed evidence of human occupation dating back to the Paleolithic period.\n|-\n|\n|Bailey Hall and chantry of St John the Baptist\n|Moated site\n|Aighton, Bailey and Chaigley\n|Ribble Valley\n|The late 16th-century Bailey Hall is on the moated site of an earlier building. Next to the hall are the ruins of the early 14th-century chantry chapel dedicated to St John the Baptist. This is the only moated site in Lancashire known to have contained a parochial chapel. The listing also includes two hollows to the west, thought to have been fishponds. The hall and the remains of the chapel are Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Beadle Hill Romano-British farmstead\n|Settlement\n|Briercliffe\n|Burnley\n|At the western end of Beadle Hill, with extensive views over the surrounding area. Inner and outer ditches are separated by an earth and stone rampart, around a farmstead enclosure about  square, with an entrance on the eastern side.\n|-\n|\n|Bellmanpark lime kilns and tramway\n|Kilns\n|Clitheroe\n|Ribble Valley\n|North-west of Bellman Farm are the remains of lime kilns and associated short tramway, next to the Chatburn to Blackburn railway line. James Carter and William Rowe opened the limeworks in 1869. A bank of four massive lime kilns up to  high. Built in 1877 from limestone blocks with brick arches, each kiln is lined with firebricks. Served by a chain-driven tramway from Bellmanpark quarry, small trucks ran across a large wooden trestle bridge to the top of the kilns. The kilns unloaded directly into the wagons which passed through the base of the structure. Little work continued at the site after 1960.\n|-\n|\n|Bleara Lowe round cairn\n|Cairn\n|Earby\n|Pendle\n|On the summit of Bleara Moor, on the border with North Yorkshire, the round cairn is thought to date from the Bronze Age. It is a  by  oval mound of peat and heather-covered stones up to  high, with a  deep, rectangular hollow,  by  on the top.\n|-\n|\n|Bleasdale Circle\n|Henge\n|Bleasdale\n|Wyre\n|On a flat hilltop between the tributary streams of the River Brock. A grave and cremation urns were found in the central mound, around which 11 oak posts formed a ring approximately  across. The Bronze Age urnfield was enclosed by a ditch and a palisaded timber ring  in diameter.\n|-\n|\n|Boar's Den bowl barrow\n|Burial mound\n|Wrightington\n|West Lancashire\n|A bowl barrow thought to date from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods.

South of Boar's Den Farm.\n|-\n|\n|Bomber Camp Romano-British farmstead and associated enclosure\n|Settlement\n|Bracewell and Brogden\n|Pendle\n|4th-century farmstead within an enclosure  square, surrounded by a ditch with inner and outer banks, which are still visible. The entrance was on the south east side and two raised areas inside are believed to be hut platforms. It is north of the Roman road from Ribchester to Ilkley (Margary 72a / RR 72a).\n|-\n|\n|Two Bowl barrows at Hacking\n|Burial mound\n|Aighton, Bailey and Chaigley\n|Ribble Valley\n|On the flood plain, north of the River Ribble, close to its confluence with the Calder,  north-east and  north of Hacking Boat House are two bowl barrows thought to date from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. Both oval mounds of earth, the easterly is the more prominent, at up to  high and  across. The westerly barrow is larger at  wide and up to  high. An archaeological excavation in 1894 has left an approximately  diameter,  deep hollow at the centre of the westerly barrow.\n|-\n|\n|Two Bowl barrows east of Beadle Hill\n|Burial mound\n|Briercliffe\n|Burnley\n| and  east of Beadle Hill are two bowl barrows thought to date from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. The turf-covered, circular mounds of earth and small stones are surrounded by an approximately  wide shallow ditch, which is unusual in Lancashire. The westerly is the larger, at  diameter and  high. The easterly is  wide and a similar height.\n|-\n|\n|Twist Castle bowl barrow\n|Burial mound\n|Briercliffe\n|Burnley\n| east of the Twist Castle Romano-British farmstead is a bowl barrow thought to date from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It is a  circular mound, constructed of earth and small stones to a height of up to . In 1889, an intact ceramic food vessel was recovered from the centre of the barrow.\n|-\n|\n|Two Bowl barrows near Brown Hills Beck\n|Burial mound\n|Gisburn Forest & Easington\n|Ribble Valley\n|In the forest on either side of Brown Hills Beck, are two bowl barrows thought to date from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. Both oval mounds of earth, the easterly is the larger, at  and up to  high. The smaller westerly barrow is  wide and up to  high. There are no records to suggest that either has ever been excavated.\n|-\n|\n|Bowl barrow on Hameldon Pasture\n|Burial mound\n|Worsthorne-with-Hurstwood\n|Burnley\n|On Hameldon Pasture is a bowl barrow thought to date from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It is an up to  high, oval mound , constructed of earth and small stones. At the barrow's centre, there is a  deep hollow, approximately , containing two gritstone boulders. These, along with another boulder a short distance away, are thought to be the remains of a stone cist, which was opened in 1886 but found to be empty.\n|-\n|\n|Bradley Hall\n|Moated site\n|Eccleston\n|Chorley\n|Bradley Hall Farm is on a moated site of an earlier building thought to date from the medieval period. Although partially infilled, the moat survives best on the south-east and north-east sides where its width is between  and depth of up to . Around the moat there are also three fishponds that were connected to it by water channels. The farmhouse is excluded from the schedule, but it is Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Bretters Farm moated site and two fishponds\n|Moated site\n|Heath Charnock\n|Chorley\n|North of Bretters Farm are the remains of a moated site, thought to have been the location of Heath Charnock's manor house from at least the 13th century. Today a  island is surrounded by a partly waterlogged moat about  wide and  deep in places. Outside western and northern arms are two fishponds, one is approximately triangular,  and the other an almost circular shape with a  diameter. Short channels connect both to the moat.\n|-\n|\n|Brooks Farm packhorse bridge\n|Bridge\n|Bleasdale\n|Wyre\n|Although recorded on the schedule as a packhorse bridge over the River Brock, south of Brooks Farm, it might have been misclassified. A bridge doesn't appear on the first Ordnance Survey map, surveyed in the 1840s, suggesting a construction date in the later 19th century. It may actually be a pedestrian bridge, built to improve access to Saint Eadmer's church.\n|-\n|\n|Burscough Priory\n|Building\n|Burscough\n|West Lancashire\n|The Augustinian priory here was dedicated to St Nicholas and established in 1190 by Robert Fitz Henry (Lord of Lathom and Knowsley). The building was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries between 1536 and 1541.\n|-\n|\n|Burwains Camp prehistoric defended settlement\n|Settlement\n|Briercliffe\n|Burnley\n|A circular univallate (single-walled) defended enclosure  across, surrounded by a ditch and bank, with entrances in the east and west. Today the  wide ditch is only approximately  deep and the bank no more than  high and about  across. The site, on Broad Bank Hill, overlooking the valley of Thursden Brook, is thought to be a prehistoric settlement; limited archaeological excavation in 1950 recovered some Neolithic finds but was insufficient to more accurately date the site.\n|-\n|\n|Camp House moated site, moated outwork and connecting channels\n|Moated site\n|Hornby-with-Farleton\n|Lancaster\n|South-west of Camp House is a moated site thought to date from the medieval period. A system of channels link the main moated site with the River Lune  northeast. About  to the north of the main site is a moated outwork consisting of a small island surrounded by a shallow moat which was connected by a ditch to the water channel.\n|-\n|\n|Castercliff small multivallate hillfort\n|Fort\n|Nelson\n|Pendle\n|A small multivallate hillfort is on a hilltop overlooking the valley system of the River Calder and its tributaries, on the edge of the South Pennines. Thought to date from the Iron Age, triple rubble ramparts up to  high, separated by ditches of similar depth, surround the site on all sides except the north. The inner rampart may have been timber-laced and revetted with stone and enclosed an oval area measuring approximately . The hillfort has been damaged by coal mining with old bell pits evident both inside and around the site.\n|-\n|\n|Castle Haugh Ringwork\n|Castle\n|Newsholme\n|Ribble Valley\n|On high ground overlooking the River Ribble, are the remains of a late Anglo-Saxon or early Norman ringwork castle. A circular earth mound  high survives, topped by a breastwork, and largely surrounded by a  deep ditch. It is called Castle Haugh but also known locally as Cromwell's Basin.\n|-\n|\n|Castle Hill motte\n|Castle\n|Penwortham\n|South Ribble\n|Next to St Mary's Church, the earth mound survives of the motte-and-bailey Penwortham Castle, overlooking an ancient ford across the River Ribble. Its diameter is approximately  at the base and  at the summit. The castle was named in the Domesday Book, but appears to have fallen into ruins during the 13th century.\n|-\n|\n|Castle Hill motte and bailey, Halton\n|Castle\n|Halton-with-Aughton\n|Lancaster\n|Located at the end of a promontory overlooking the River Lune is the site of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. Today the truncated motte is topped by a flagpole, and during World War II an observation post was built on it (since removed). The castle was one of several similar fortifications along the Lune valley.\n|-\n|\n|Castle Hill motte, Dolphinholme\n|Castle\n|Ellel\n|Lancaster\n|Overlooking the River Wyre, an earth mound survives, about  high and  maximum diameter, partially destroyed by a neighbouring 19th-century quarry. Known as Castle Hill, this was the site of a medieval motte castle, although little is known of its history.\n|-\n|\n|Castle Hill prehistoric defended enclosure\n|Enclosure\n|Leck\n|Lancaster\n|East of Leck Beck on a flat-topped spur is a defended enclosure thought to date to between the seventh and fifth centuries BC. The sub-circular enclosure is about  and contains two hut circles and is surrounded by three banks, the largest  high and up to  wide, along with two ditches.

The motte became part of the garden of the old vicarage and has been landscaped to include a flight of stone steps, a terrace and retaining wall.\n|-\n|\n|Castle Stede motte and bailey, Hornby\n|Castle\n|Hornby-with-Farleton\n|Lancaster\n|Overlooking Loyn Bridge across the River Lune, the earth mound and sections of the ditches survive of the motte-and-bailey Castle Stede. It is one of a group of similar castles established along the Lune valley in the late 11th century. It is the best preserved example of this type of castle in Lancashire. On the south side of the site, the scheduling also includes a World War II pill box, constructed on the outer edge of the bailey ditch.\n|-\n|\n|Chapel Hill Motte, Arkholme\n|Castle\n|Arkholme-with-Cawood\n|Lancaster\n|Next to St John's Church, the earth mound survives of the motte-and-bailey Arkholme Castle, overlooking an ancient ford across the River Lune. It is one of a group late 11th-century castles established along the Lune valley, with the church sited within the former bailey.\n|-\n|\n|Chingle Hall moated site\n|Moated site\n|Whittingham\n|Preston\n|The early 17th-century Chingle Hall is on a moated site of an earlier building thought to date from the medieval period. The approximately  rectangular island, was surrounded by an up to  wide waterfilled moat. The moat survives best at to west and south and today is accessed by a brick-built bridge on the south side. The house and bridge are excluded from the scheduling, but are Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Claughton hlaew in Sandhole Wood\n|Burial mound\n|Claughton\n|Wyre\n|A 10th-century Viking burial mound in Sandhole Wood, possibly re-using the site of a bowl barrow thought to date from the Late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. Made of sand, it measures about  and up to  high and would have been surrounded by a ditch.\n|-\n|\n|Clintsfield Colliery\n|Mining\n|Tatham\n|Lancaster\n|On the south side of the River Wenning, east of Clintsfield Farm, a colliery operated during the 18th and early 19th centuries. During its lifetime a number of shafts where constructed, with horses used for winding, and two features on the ground are thought to have been gin circles. The structures of the steam engine house, which in 1839 contained a  beam engine used for pumping, and also the boiler house and chimney are still standing. There are also three reservoirs with dams. The engine house is also a Grade&nbsp;II listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Clitheroe Castle\n|Castle\n|Clitheroe\n|Ribble Valley\n|Early medieval enclosure castle on a limestone rock outcrop overlooking the River Ribble in Clitheroe. It was probably built in the 12th century, the property of the de Lacy family. The castle site remained in private ownership until 1920. The keep is the second smallest surviving stone-built keep in England.\n|-\n|\n|Cockersand Abbey\n|Building\n|Thurnham\n|Lancaster\n|On the Irish Sea coast between the Lune Estuary and the River Cocker are the remains of a Premonstratensian abbey, founded 1190 and dedicated to St Mary. It closed in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries and all that survives today is the restored chapter house and some ruined masonry. The chapter house is also a Grade&nbsp;I listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Coking ovens and associated coal workings on Aushaw Moss\n|Mining\n|North Turton\n|Blackburn with Darwen\n|The remains of Broad-head Colliery (closed 1893), including shaft mounds, gin circles, platforms and roadways. Also 8 stone built beehive coking ovens arranged in 3 banks.\n|-\n|\n|Cromwell's Mound Civil War fieldwork\n|Military\n|Broughton\n|Preston\n|The mound is an up to  high, T-shaped earthwork about  by  next to Moss Leach Brook, about  north east of the site of Broughton Tower. Possibly the remains of a dam relating to the medieval tower, it is believed to have been utilised as a temporary fortification by troops of the New Model Army during the Battle of Preston in 1648. It may even have provided Oliver Cromwell his first viewpoint of the battlefield.\n|-\n|\n|Cross Hall moated site\n|Moated site\n|Ormskirk\n|West Lancashire\n|Neighbouring Ormskirk School to the east is Cross Hall Farm. Here there is a moated site with an island around . The moat varies between  in width and up to  in depth, with a causeway on the eastern side, and today is almost entirely dry. Cross Hall was a residence of the Stanley family, and although the construction date is unknown, the building is thought to have been abandoned in the late 17th or early 18th century when a new Cross Hall (since demolished) was built.\n|-\n|\n|Croston Town Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Croston\n|Chorley\n|The bridge dates from 1682 and carries a road called The Hillocks over the River Yarrow. It is in sandstone, and consists of a single segmental arch with rounded coping to the parapets, and a humped deck paved with setts. It is also a Grade&nbsp;II listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Dog Holes Cave\n|Cave\n|Warton\n|Lancaster\n|Like Badger Hole, the cave is on the west face of Warton Crag. Similarly, excavations have revealed evidence of early human occupation, with artefacts discovered from the Neolithic, Iron Age and possibly Roman periods.\n|-\n|\n|Dovecote at Great Eccleston\n|Building\n|Great Eccleston\n|Wyre\n|A 17th-century, slate-roofed, brick-built dovecote situated in a field to the south west of the village,  north-east of Gradwells.

It is also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Downham lime kiln and associated lime yard\n|Kilns\n|Downham\n|Ribble Valley\n| north of Smithfield Farm is a disused single-pot, flare type lime kiln and a stone-walled storage yard. It is a rare example in north west England of such a complete commercial lime kiln site.\n|-\n|\n|Edisford (or Eadsford) Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Clitheroe & Great Mitton\n|Ribble Valley\n|A grant of pontage was issued for a bridge over the River Ribble here in 1339. Today's sandstone bridge contains some Gothic ribbed arches possibly of late-medieval construction. It has nine spans of varying width, four arches crossing the river channel on the east side and a further five partly buried arches with a tight bend over meadow land on the west. The largest arch is the second from the eastern side at  across, it is thought to have replaced two earlier arches before 1799. The bridge was widened over its full length from  to about , sometime before 1903. It is also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Earthworks in Spa Roughs Wood\n|Earthwork\n|Lathom\n|West Lancashire\n| south east of the present Lathom House, the earthworks are thought to be of a moat, perhaps the site of the old house.

The main building, fronting Castle Hill, housed studios and workshops and was occupied by the firm from about 1890. Behind this, the cellar of another, historically larger building, previously the main workshops, contains four melting and annealing furnaces. Glassmaking ceased in the mid-20th century. The older building is scheduled, considered an outstanding and unique survival of such furnaces. The main building is Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Glasson Dock\n|Dockyard\n|Thurnham\n|Lancaster\n|Due to the difficulty of navigation up the River Lune to the docks in Lancaster, the port commission decided to build a dock at Glasson, which opened in 1787. Several additions have since been made: a link was constructed to the Glasson Branch of the Lancaster Canal in the 1820s, a Graving Dock was built in 1837, and the East Quay was extended to accommodate the Glasson Dock branch line after 1880. The late 18th-century lighthouse on the East Quay and former custom house on the North Quay are also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Greenhalgh Castle\n|Castle\n|Barnacre-with-Bonds\n|Wyre\n|After 1490, Thomas Stanley had the castle built on the site an earlier manor house, overlooking the River Wyre.

The remains of the standing sandstone walls are also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Hameldon Hill World War II bombing decoy\n|Military\n|Hapton & Dunnockshaw and Clowbridge\n|Burnley\n|During World War II a network of five Starfish site bombing decoys were constructed in the area, designed to protect Accrington. This site on Hameldon Hill,  north of Heights Farm, was  started in early spring 1941 (during The Blitz) with two control buildings and a number of rectangular areas where fires were ignited, surrounded by firebreak trenches. In the autumn simulated urban lighting was added and the site became a joint QL/SF decoy, operating until at least March 1942. Although the control buildings have been demolished, it is one of only three such combined sites in England still remaining largely in its completed form.\n|-\n|\n|Hanging Stone or Watersheddles Cross\n|Cross\n|Laneshaw Bridge\n|Pendle\n|A standing cross near the Watersheddles Reservoir on the moorland border with West Yorkshire.

An oval yard about  by  is thought to have been enclosed by a wooden palisade or stone wall, with a stone tower keep inside. Additional defences included a dry ditch, which survives in the south and part of the east sides up to  wide and  deep. It ceased to be the seat of the manor when Hapton Tower was built in 1510, but was still occupied in 1667. However, by 1725 it was in ruins and little was left of the structure by 1800.\n|-\n|\n|Headless Cross, Grimeford\n|Cross\n|Anderton\n|Chorley\n|Close to the junction of Grimeford Lane, Roscoe Lowe Brow and Rivington Lane, is the lower  of a wayside cross shaft thought to date to at least the 12th century. It is constructed of local sandstone with carvings on all sides and set on a modern base. It is topped by a post-medieval flat sandstone slab, with the words TO PRESTON, TO WIGGAN, TO BOULTON and TO BLAGBURN carved on the sides. It is also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|High cross in St Peter's churchyard, Heysham\n|Cross\n|Heysham, Lancaster\n|Lancaster\n|Close to St Patrick's Chapel, in the churchyard of St Peter's Church is the lower part of an Anglian high cross shaft thought to date to the 9th century.

Next to this in the 1820s they constructed a larger mill that spans the river, which was damaged by fire and rebuilt in 1859–60 as a cotton spinning mill and warehouse. There is also a square chimney on the hillside overlooking the mill and connected to it by an underground flue. Today the buildings form the Helmshore Mills Textile Museum and are also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Higherford Old Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Barrowford\n|Pendle\n|A stone packhorse bridge crossing Pendle Water, connecting Colne and the Forest of Pendle, consisting of a single span with voussoirs. Built around the end of 16th or early 17th century, initially without parapets, which were added in 1815. It is also a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Hornby Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Hornby-with-Farleton\n|Lancaster\n|This three-arch bridge carries Main Street over the River Wenning at Hornby. Constructed of sandstone, probably in 1769, it has segmental arches with triangular cutwaters and a band below the solid parapets.

It is also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Ice house at Towneley Hall\n|Building\n|Burnley\n|Burnley\n|In the grounds of Towneley Park, west of the hall, is a disused ice house, thought to have been built by the Towneley family during the 17th century. Repaired in 1976, it is constructed of brick and stone, covered with earth. More recently it was found that bats have roosted here, and it has become very overgrown.\n|-\n|\n|Ightenhill Manor\n|Building\n|Ightenhill\n|Burnley\n|Ightenhill was one of the manors of the Honour of Clitheroe, covering a much larger area than the civil parish. The manor house was east of Gawthorpe Hall on the brow of the hill overlooking the River Calder, the site providing a good view of Pendle Forest. The earliest known reference occurred when John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln signed a charter here in 1238. By 1296 a  deer park had been enclosed around it and a horse stud established here. As well as the hall, the site contained a number of ancillary buildings including a chapel, barn and stable.

Today a grassy island, approximately , is surrounded by a  wide dry moat. The foundations of buildings formerly on the island are indicated by an L-shaped bank on the northern half, and a raised platform at the south-east corner. It was accessed by a causeway across the mid-point of the western arm of the moat.\n|-\n|\n|Moated site and fishponds\n|Moated site\n|Priest Hutton\n|Lancaster\n|East of Upp Hall Farm is a moated site thought to date from the medieval period. The oval island is surrounded by a dry moat varying between  wide and a depth of up to . The width of the moat expands to form a fishpond at the western corner, and a boggy area to the south is thought to have also formerly been a fishpond. The site was abandoned when  the present Upp Hall was built around the start of the 19th century.\n|-\n|\n|Moated site and two fishponds\n|Moated site\n|Much Hoole\n|South Ribble\n|About  south of Manor House Farm is a moated site thought to date to the medieval period. The moat is still waterlogged on the west side and averages  wide and   deep with a projection on the north arm. On the east side are two dry fishponds, the northerly is about , the southerly about .\n|-\n|\n|Moated site at Bickerstaffe Hall\n|Moated site\n|Bickerstaffe\n|West Lancashire\n|The moated site of the original Bickerstaffe Hall is situated about  south-west of the present building.

The waterfilled moat survives best at its north and north-east sides and access was by a causeway at the north-west corner. To the north and west are two fishponds connected to the moat and also included in the scheduling.\n|-\n|\n|Moated site of Scarisbrick Hall\n|Moated site\n|Scarisbrick\n|West Lancashire\n|The moated site of the original Scarisbrick Hall,  north-west of the modern Scarisbrick Hall. A tree-covered island measuring  is flanked on two sides by a waterlogged moat, with the north-eastern arm formed by Eas Brook. This hall is recorded in an early 13th-century deed.\n|-\n|\n|Northern part of Rimington lead mines\n|Mining\n|Rimington\n|Ribble Valley\n| south-east of Hollins Farm is part of a medieval open-field system, a part of Rimington lead mines and small limestone quarry with three clamp type lime kilns. It is uncertain when lead mining began here, but it is documented in the late 16th century. Mining for lead and later barytes continued in phases through to the 1950s. There are the remains of shafts, spoil heaps, an ore-processing area, and also a possible buddle pit.\n|-\n|\n|Oak Mount Mill engine and engine house\n|Building\n|Burnley\n|Burnley\n|Oak Mount Mill on Wiseman Street, next to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, was originally built in 1830. Its stationary steam engine by W & J Yates of Blackburn was installed in a new engine house after a fire in the 1880s, continuing to power the mill until its closure in 1979. It was restored by the Weavers' Triangle Trust in 2001, who offer occasional demonstrations. The engine house is also a Grade&nbsp;II listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Old Lower Hodder Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Aighton, Bailey and Chaigley & Great Mitton\n|Ribble Valley\n|A disused sandstone bridge over the River Hodder, built in 1562, also known as Cromwell's Bridge. It about  wide has three segmental arches, the middle being widest, and was replaced by another bridge a little way upstream in 1819. On 16 August 1648, Oliver Cromwell held a council of war here while his 8,000-strong army passed over the bridge on the eve of the Battle of Preston. It is also Grade&nbsp;II* listed.\n|-\n|\n|Part of a Roman fort and a Benedictine priory on Castle Hill\n|Fort\n|Lancaster\n|Lancaster\n|Lancaster Castle was not the first building on Castle Hill. A Roman fort was founded here , probably to command a crossing point on the River Lune. Re-built and expanded a number of times, around 330 AD the fort underwent a drastic remodelling in a style similar to the Saxon Shore Forts, requiring the demolition of buildings within the vicus area outside it. It is known that in the late 11th century Roger de Poitou founded a Benedictine priory here. Excavations beneath the priory church suggest it was built over a pre-Conquest building, possibly a monastery founded under St Wilfred. Several of the buildings on the site are listed.\n|-\n|\n|Paythorne Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Paythorne and Newsholme\n|Ribble Valley\n|This four-arch bridge over the River Ribble, contains some Gothic ribbed arches possibly of late-medieval construction. Largely of sandstone construction with some limestone elements, two older arches cross the river channel on the east side and a further two added sometime after, pass over meadow land on the west. The bridge was widened over its full length from  to about , and the parapets renewed, probably in the mid-19th century. The Pennine Bridleway National Trail crosses the river at this point. It is also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Penwortham Old Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Penwortham\n|Preston\n|The original attempt to build a bridge directly from Preston to Penwortham was completed in 1755, only to collapse the following year. This bridge opened in 1759 and consists of five unequal segmental arches, rising toward the centre. The cutwaters rise to form refuges at the sides of the  wide, cobbled carriageway. The spandrels are of red sandstone. It is also Grade&nbsp;II listed.\n|-\n|\n|Pike Low bowl barrow and site of beacon, Bonfire Hill\n|Burial mound\n|Briercliffe\n|Burnley\n|On the summit of Bonfire Hill is a bowl barrow thought to date from the Bronze Age. It is a  by  oval mound of earth and stones up to  high. The site was used as part of a system of warning beacons during the medieval period and the top of the mound has been flattened to create a platform for the bonfire. This is a rare example of such a combination.\n|-\n|\n|Pike Stones chambered long cairn\n|Cairn\n|Anglezarke\n|Chorley\n|On a ridge on the lower part of Anglezarke Moor is a chambered long cairn thought to date from the Neolithic period. It consists of an up to  long mound of gritstones and glacial erratics up to  high, with a single internal chamber about  made of stone slabs.\n|-\n|\n|Pleasington alum works\n|Mining\n|Pleasington\n|Blackburn with Darwen\n|Remains of a quarry and alum works operated between 1609 and the end of the 18th century, south of Alum House Brook. Established by Sir Richard Hoghton of Hoghton Tower, the operation was of sufficient importance that King James I visited the mines in 1617. It is the only surviving example of an alum site from this period in north west England.\n|-\n|\n|Portfield Hillfort\n|Fort\n|Whalley\n|Ribble Valley\n|A small, possibly Iron Age, hillfort also known as Planes Wood Camp is on a slight promontory to the east of the River Calder. The summit is flat, possibly artificially levelled, over an irregularly shaped area measuring approximately . The defences have generally not survived well, but it is thought to be a univallate site, with a least one entrance on the northern side, subsequently modified to become multivallate. In 1966, workmen digging a trench here, discovered a hoard of nine Bronze Age artefacts including a gold bracelet and lock ring.\n|-\n|\n|Prehistoric defended enclosure and six adjacent hut circles at Tatham Park\n|Enclosure\n|Tatham\n|Lancaster\n|On a small hillock between the River Wenning and its tributary the Hindburn is a defended enclosure thought to date to between the seventh and fifth centuries BC. The roughly oval main enclosure is about  and is subdivided by an up to  high linear bank  wide. There are six hut circles outside the enclosure, with a  deep defensive ditch between  wide surrounding the base of the hillock on all sides except the south where a small stream runs.\n|-\n|\n|Prehistoric, Romano-British, medieval and early post-medieval settlements\n|Settlement\n|Burrow-with-Burrow\n|Lancaster\n|Across Leck Beck from Castle Hill prehistoric settlement is an extensive area of archaeological remains, the ages of which span a period of approximately 4500 years. East of Bindloss Farm, on both sides of Eller Beck, and crossing over the border with Cumbria, the area contains: nine burial cairns (late Neolithic/early Bronze Age), two prehistoric hut circle settlements, a coaxial type field system of similar age. There are also nine Romano-British settlements, seven medieval dispersed settlements, three medieval shielings, and an early-post-medieval dispersed settlement. Many of the settlements have associated field systems and the area was also within an early-15th-century deer park called High Park.\n|-\n|\n|Remains of Aspen Colliery\n|Mining\n|Oswaldtwistle\n|Hyndburn\n|A colliery on the Burnley Coalfield, thought to have been established after this section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal opened in 1810, and closed in 1930. Alongside the canal are 24 brick and stone built beehive coking ovens arranged in three banks and a partially filled  canal basin. There are also the remains of two capped mineshafts and two stone-built engine beds. The coke ovens are said to be the best preserved 19th-century example in North West England.\n|-\n|\n|Remains of Dolphinholme Worsted Mill\n|Buildings\n|Nether Wyresdale\n|Wyre\n|In 1811 Dolphinholme Worsted Mill, on the banks of the River Wyre, was one of the first mills in England to be lit by gas.

The listing covers the gas plant and also chimney, mill race and waterwheel pit.\n|-\n|\n|Ribchester Roman fort (Bremetennacum)\n|Fort\n|Ribchester\n|Ribble Valley\n|On the north bank of the River Ribble, the Roman fort here covered an area of about , but the south-east third has since been eroded by the river. Today St Wilfrid's Church stands at about the centre of it. The earliest fort  was established in the early 70s AD, made of turf and timber. It was rebuilt in stone at the end of the century and a substantial vicus developed around it, covering almost the same area as the modern village. The most substantial stone-built construction so far discovered outside the fort is the Roman baths. The site is home to the only specialist Roman Museum in Lancashire.\n|-\n|\n|Ring cairn near Ell Clough\n|Cairn\n|Briercliffe\n|Burnley\n| east of Ell Clough, close to the saucer barrow, is a ring cairn also thought to date from the Bronze Age.

A limited excavavation, undertaken in 1887, found human remains.\n|-\n|\n|Roman fort and civil settlement, Over Burrow\n|Fort\n|Burrow-with-Burrow\n|Lancaster\n|Burrow Hall was built in the 18th century on the site of Over Burrow Roman Fort. A timber fort was established here probably in the late 1st century (during the Flavian dynasty) but little is known about it. Archaeological excavation of the clay-and-turf ramparts and defensive ditches also suggests a second period of occupation at a so far undetermined time. Probably in the late 3rd or early 4th century, a stone-built fort was constructed, apparently on a slightly different alignment. The fort had a rectangular plan with rounded corners, about  with an area of . A civil settlement is thought to have developed to the west, between the fort and the River Lune. The hall is a Grade&nbsp;I listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Roman fort and sections of Roman roads\n|Fort\n|Burscough\n|West Lancashire\n|A Roman auxiliary fort with at least two construction phases and connecting roads.

A major overhaul was completed in 1917 when it was widened on both sides and the traditional pointed cutwaters replaced with rounded ones.\n|-\n|\n|Whalley Cistercian abbey\n|Building\n|Whalley\n|Ribble Valley\n|In 1296 the Cistercian monks from the unfortunate Stanlow Abbey moved to this site, next to the River Calder. Construction of the abbey slowly continued through 12th and 13th centuries, and  it was dissolved at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Like Sawley, the last abbot was executed for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace. Afterward a large house was built on the site and many of the abbey's buildings were demolished, however remains of the two gateways, the north wall, the east and south ranges of the cloister, the abbot's lodging, and a chapel survive. It is also a Grade&nbsp;I listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Whittington motte and bailey castle\n|Castle\n|Whittington\n|Lancaster\n|St Michael's Church has been constructed within the bailey of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, overlooking the floodplain of the River Lune. The oval-shaped motte survives within the churchyard, its diameter approximately  at the base and it is  high. There are burials on the motte and it is surmounted by a sundial. The castle was one of several similar fortifications along the Lune valley. The church, sundial and graves are all excluded from the schedule.\n|-\n|\n|Witton Old Hall medieval lordly residence\n|Building\n|Blackburn\n|Blackburn with Darwen\n|The ruins of a manor house and associated farm, on the north bank of the River Blakewater downstream of the Feniscliffe Bridge in the south-west corner of Witton Country Park. The building is believed to date from around to 1544, however as the manor (part of the Honour of Clitheroe) dates to the 13th century, the site could contain earlier remains.\n|-\n|\n|Wycoller Bank House Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Trawden Forest\n|Pendle\n|Also called the Clam Bridge, it is formed from a single  slab of millstone grit. It spans Wycoller Beck, supported by rudimentary piers in each bank. The bridge is not possible to accurately age, it could be over 1,000 years old, but a 15th- or 16th-century date is more probable. It is also a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Wycoller Hall\n|Building\n|Trawden Forest\n|Pendle\n|Wycoller Hall dates back to the end of the 16th century, and was extended several times. The Cunliffe family settled at the estate in the early 17th century and after the last member of the family died, heavily endebted, in 1819 it was abandoned as a residence. It is also a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Wycoller Hall Bridge\n|Bridge\n|Trawden Forest\n|Pendle\n|Also known as Druids’ Bridge or Weavers’ Bridge. It is a basic clapper bridge structure of two big gritstone slabs supported by a central pier and the banks of Wycoller Beck. Also undateable, it may have been originally constructed in the 16th or 17th century. To repair the bridge after a fracture of the eastern clapper, an additional pier has been added. It is also Grade&nbsp;II* listed.\n|-\n|\n|Wycoller packhorse bridge\n|Bridge\n|Trawden Forest\n|Pendle\n|Double-arched packhorse bridge over Wycoller Beck, from the 17th century or earlier. Also known as Sally's Bridge (named after a member of the Cunliffe family who lived in Wycoller Hall in the 1900s). It is also a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building.\n|}\nSee also\n* Grade I listed buildings in Lancashire\n* Grade II* listed buildings in Lancashire\n* Scheduled monuments in Greater Manchester\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations"
