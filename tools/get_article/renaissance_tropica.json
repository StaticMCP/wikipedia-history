It was introduced for the model year 1995 and built in a limited number of units, but never entered series production due to financial issues.\nOverview\nRenaissance Cars was founded by Bob Beaumont, who previously founded the company which produced the Citicar in the 1970s. The company was headquartered in Palm Bay, Florida.\nThe Tropica Roadster was designed by Jim Muir.\nSpecifications\nThe car was to use an ABS body on an aluminum backbone chassis. Although the first prototype had a fiberglass unibody, later vehicles used an aluminum chassis and a plastic body. The total weight was about  at the prototype stage, with plans to reduce it by a further  in the production version; the manufacturer ultimately specified the weight of the car as .\nThe battery capacity was about 11.2 kWh, coming from twelve 6V lead-acid batteries, each with a capacity of 156 Ah; the batteries were removable. When a prototype was tested by the Car and Driver magazine, the urban range was about . Later owners of pre-series vehicles reported a range of about . In 2008, a car with about 20,000 miles on its odometer had a range of  on the freeway.\nThe vehicle would take 6–8 hours to fully charge, but as explained by one owner, \"I can get an 85% charge in about 90 mins. The remaining 6-7 hours is used to trickle charge the rest of the battery.\"\nThe vehicle had two DC motors, one for each of the rear wheels, which eliminated the need for a differential. The vehicle had no gearbox. The maximum power output was 49 bhp, however the maximum continuous power output was merely 15 bhp, which resulted in a top speed of about . It was  in the Car and Driver test, while another user reported .\nProduction\nThe car was introduced in 1995 (although prospective customers were able to reserve it earlier). Approximately 16 pre-series Tropica Roadsters were completed with two additional near completed [but finished by successor owners], and exhibited in showrooms, with at least some of them finding customers. According to another source, the company made 25 vehicles overall, including prototypes and pilot series vehicles [three of them are frame/driveline, only]. The car did not enter series production because the second financing round failed.\nIn 1996, the company went into receivership and most of its assets went to a newly founded company called Zebra Motors, based first in Novato and then in Alameda, California. The company announced two models, the Model Z Roadster (which was a renamed Tropica Roadster) and the Light Delivery Van (the latter featuring a swappable battery), but these did not enter series production. The company was then bought by a group of investors reportedly including actor Don Johnson and renamed Xebra Motors. Though the group planned a limited production of the Roadster, the company ultimately failed in 2001.\nThe slightly modified Tropica #18 appeared as the Xebra EV starting in episodes of Nash Bridges (season 4, episode 13) through (season 5, episode 21).\nOne Tropica Roadster is in possession of the Route 66 Electric Vehicle Museum in Kingman, Arizona.\nPricing\nOne user reported buying a new Tropica for $18,000. The manufacturer expected to sell it profitably for $12,500.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nogas.org/ev A website about the Tropica/Zebra]\n** [https://www.nogas.org/zebra The author's personal Tropica page]\n** [https://nogas.org/zebra/Car.html Q&A about the author's Tropica/Zebra]\n** [https://www.nogas.org/ev/product_line_up.html Renaissance Cars Inc. - model linuep, including the Roadster]\n** [https://www.nogas.org/ev/articles/Car_&_Driver.html The Car and Driver article]\n* [http://www.flexquarters.com/getmsm/ev/tropica Another private website]"
