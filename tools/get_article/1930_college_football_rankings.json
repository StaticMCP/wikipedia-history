Dickinson.\nNotre Dame, Washington State and Alabama, all unbeaten and untied at the end of the regular season, were ranked first, second and third by Dickinson, with the Irish getting the higher rating based on their opposition.  The ratings were made before the 1931 Rose Bowl that matched Washington State and Alabama, with Alabama winning, 24 to 0.   Notre Dame did not participate in a postseason bowl game.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Rank\n! Team\n! Record\n!
