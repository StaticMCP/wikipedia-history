Emmanuel Macron succeeded him on 14 May 2017 following the presidential election of 2017.\nFile:Francois Hollande 2015.jpeg|François Hollande,president of the Republicfrom 15 May 2012to 14 May 2017.\nFile:Emmanuel Macron during his meeting with Vladimir Putin, June 2017.jpg|Emmanuel Macron,president of the Republicsince 14 May 2017.\nPrime Ministers and successive governments\nFrançois Hollande first reappointed Jean-Marc Ayrault as Prime Minister on June 20, 2012, which composes a single government. Manuel Valls is then named on March 31, 2014, which consists of two governments. Bernard Cazeneuve succeeds him on December 6, 2016 and will remain head of a single government until the election of Emmanuel Macron to the presidency of the Republic.\nThe last government of the fourteenth legislature is that of Édouard Philippe, which is renewed following the parliamentary elections of June 2017.\nFile:Jean-Marc Ayrault et Alain Kouck (13293393834) (cropped).jpg|Jean-Marc Ayrault,Prime Ministerfrom 15 May 2012to 31 March 2014.\nFile:Valls Schaefer Munich Economic Summit 2015 (cropped).JPG|Manuel Valls,Prime Ministerfrom 31 March 2014to 6 December 2016.\nFile:Bernard Cazeneuve, (42399145362) (cropped).jpg|Bernard Cazeneuve,Prime Ministerfrom 6 December 2016to 10 May 2017.\nFile:Édouard Philippe (cropped).jpg|Édouard Philippe,Prime Ministersince 15 May 2017.\nComposition of the National Assembly\n155 women were elected or reelected and make up 26.86% of French MPs:\n125 women MPs from left-wing parties.\n29 women MPs from right-wing parties.\n1 women MP from the Front National party.\nThe oldest member of the National Assembly is François Scellier, from the Radical Party, linked to the larger UMP conservative grouping. He represents the 6th Constituency of Val d'Oise and was 76 years old at the beginning of the current parliamentary term.\nThe youngest member of the National Assembly is Marion Maréchal-Le Pen from the Front National, the MP for the 3rd Constituency of Vaucluse. She was 22 years old at the beginning of the current parliamentary term and was actually the youngest ever MP elected under the French Fifth Republic.\nChanges in composition\nMembers of the National Assembly who join the government are required to give up their seats to their substitutes (suppléants) a month after their appointment, as stipulated in the constitution. Should ministers quit the government, they recover their seat in the National Assembly from their substitute a month after their resignation. By-elections are held in the event of the annulation of electoral results or vacancies caused by resignations (in most circumstances not those related to the death of a deputy, in which case the substitute takes the seat if possible), except within the year before legislative elections.\nBy-elections\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!
