Novak, and the lifetime achievement award was given to Vinton Cerf. The awards were judged by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.\nThe set design for the show was provided by Tribal DDB Worldwide in an attempt to change the show's image by emphasizing the competitive nature of the awards, calling the ceremony \"The Battle for Web Supremacy.\" EastMedia also altered the website to reflect The People's Voice campaign. As a result, the number of popular votes this year exceeded 900,000 and there were over 1 million site views (10% from social media). As in previous years, the awards ceremony was made available for viewers via the official Webby YouTube channel.\nNominees and winners\n:(from http://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2010)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
