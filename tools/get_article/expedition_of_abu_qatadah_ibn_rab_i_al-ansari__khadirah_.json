He urgently summoned Abu Qatadah and sent him at the head of 18 men to discipline the tribe.\nIt took 15 days to reach them. Some were killed, others captured and all their property confiscated.\nThis was an expedition against the tribe of Khudra a sub-clan of Banu Ghatafan, which resulted in the capture of large amounts of flock.\nAfter this expedition, due to Muhammad's increasing power, many tribes switched their allegiance and converted to Islam. Among them were: Bani Dzobian, Banu Fazara, Banu Murra hand Banu Abs. The Banu Sulaym also submitted themselves to Muhammad after previously fighting his followers in the Expedition of Ibn Abi Al-Awja Al-Sulami, where most of the Muslims and Banu Sulaym who fought each other were killed. Most of the tribes in the vicinity of Medina also recognised the supremacy of Muhammad.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nNotes"
