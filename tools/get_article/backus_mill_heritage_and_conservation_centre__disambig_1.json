It was one of the few mills to not be burned during the War of 1812. The mill stayed in operation until 1957 and is now a national historic site.\nThe conservation area has facilities for both short-term and seasonal camping. This area is full of local history found in the Backhouse Homestead. In September, the area becomes the site of a reenactment of a battle during the War of 1812.\nThe Backus Mill Conservation Education Centre features exhibits about the area's natural history and traditions of waterfowl hunting.\nThe Heritage Village is an open-air museum that includes restored or reconstructed buildings and structures, including the 19th century Backhouse Homestead, Backhouse Mill, church, carriage shop, barn with agriculture equipment, drive shed with buggies and wagons, two log houses, schoolhouse, saw mill and farm and 19th century industrial equipment.  The Museum building includes exhibits about the Long Point Area, 19th century period business displays, and an exhibit about the shipwrecks of Lake Erie at Long Point.\nIt also features a fully lifeguarded pool.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100106151919/http://www.lprca.on.ca/backus.htm Backus Mill Heritage and Conservation Centre] - official site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071026123517/http://www.ontariotravel.net/TcisCtrl?site=consumers&key1=siteTools&key2=search&key3=listingDetail&listingId=27304&language=EN Backus Heritage Conservation Area] at Ontariotravel.net\n* [http://www.lprca.on.ca/ Long Point Region Conservation Authority]"
