Founded in 2007 by Florin Petruța, the company provides local and long-distance moving services, with a specialization in white glove delivery, commercial relocations, and interior design moving services.\nHistory\nEmpire Movers and Storage NYC was created in direct response to unethical practices witnessed within the moving industry. Florin Petruta, the company’s founder, was appalled by movers openly discussing how to scam customers on moving day. This inspired him to launch a moving company rooted in integrity, transparency, and focused on customer care..\nFounded in 2007, the company used grassroots marketing in its early days: flyers, postcards, and door-to-door outreach. A key turning point came when a satisfied residential client hired Empire Movers and Storage for nonprofit housing projects, a partnership that continues to this day. From there, the company expanded into interior design moving services in NYC and secured repeat corporate contracts .\nToday, Empire Movers and Storage NYC operates 8 trucks, employs over 30 team members, and offers a full suite of moving and storage services, including hoisting, shuttle delivery, artwork installation, and NYC storage units .\nFounder\nEmpire Movers and Storage NYC was founded in 2008 by Florin Petruța, a European entrepreneur who immigrated to the United States. Petruța established the company with the stated aim of addressing unethical practices reported within the moving industry, incorporating european principles.  The business has remained family-owned since its founding and, under Petruța’s leadership, has expanded its range of services while continuing to focus on the handling of clients’ belongings.\nMoving services\nEmpire Movers and Storage NYC offers residential, commercial, and specialty moving services.

The project involved the transport of large sculptures, framed paintings, and a grand piano. Due to the size and fragility of the works, the company used custom-built crates, protective materials, and hoisting techniques to move items through restricted urban spaces. Some pieces were temporarily stored in climate-controlled facilities before delivery to their destination.\nAir France – Launching La Première suite\nEmpire Movers and Storage coordinated the reception, unpacking, and staging of Air France’s new Première first‑class seating systems, which were transported in custom wooden crates. The NYC moving company managed the logistics of assembling sophisticated aviation‑grade components under strict deadlines, ensuring the seating systems were perfectly staged for launch. Empire Movers and Storage worked closely with Air France’s on‑site teams to align logistics with the launch schedule, facilitating the introduction of the new suite.\nAssisting interior designers – Sandra Weingor NYC design projects\nThe moving company is noted for its services supporting interior design professionals in New York City, such as Sandra Weingor.
