It is twinned with Queen Mary's Grammar School, and like the Grammar School is part of the Queen Mary's Foundation.\nThe main body of the school is a girls’ school, but the Sixth Form is coeducational.\nThe school gained an outstanding level in the Ofsted report when it was last inspected in 2021.\nThe school was a Language College and historically required students to study two languages to GCSE standard.\nClass sizes in the lower school are currently around 30 girls. Sixth-form classes have a minimum of about 8 students and a maximum of 25.\nThe school is divided into houses named after famous 19th-century female authors – Austen (after Jane Austen), Bronte (after Emily Brontë), Eliot (after George Eliot) and Shelley (after Mary Shelley), the latter being a new house in the 2012/13 academic year. Each house has a member of staff in charge of it, a captain from Year 13 (upper sixth form) and a vice-captain from Year 12 (lower sixth form).\nAlumni of the school include Meera Syal.\nNotable staff\n* Barbara Foxley was head here\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.queenmaryshigh.org.uk School website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060426191937/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/qmarys/qmhome.html Internal Home Page]\n* [http://www.marina-oliver.net/qmhs.php history of the school]"
