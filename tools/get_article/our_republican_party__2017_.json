It was formed following a split within the New Saenuri Party. The party strongly supported former president Park Geun-hye.\nIn June 2019, the party elevated Hong Moon-jong, a National Assembly member who left the Liberty Korea Party, as its leader along with incumbent Cho Won-jin. Originally, the party planned to change its name as New Republican Party (), but faced  a legal issue. On 24 June, the party changed the name to Our Republican Party. The party claimed that the new name came from Park Geun-hye herself.\nIn March 2020, the party merged with the Liberty Unification Party to form the Liberty Republican Party.\nElection results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
