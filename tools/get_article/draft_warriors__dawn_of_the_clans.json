Published by HarperCollins between 2013 and 2015, the six-novel arc explores the origins of the five warrior Clans (organized groups of feral cats)—ThunderClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, RiverClan, and SkyClan—and their founding ancestors. The arc was written by Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, and Tui T. Sutherland under the collective pseudonym Erin Hunter, with editorial direction from Victoria Holmes. The arc’s central themes include the tension between individualism and community, the ethics of leadership, and the role of nature in shaping society.\nDevelopment\nThe concept for Dawn of the Clans arose from fan demand for deeper exploration of the Clans’ backstory, which had been referenced in earlier story arcs. Victoria Holmes noted that the Warriors writing team wanted to create a \"foundational epic\". In a 2013 interview, Holmes stated, \"We imagined this as the 'Bronze Age' of the Clans—no formal borders, no StarClan as we know it, just cats grappling with how to live together.\"\nThe authors drew inspiration from historical migrations and tribal conflicts, adapting these themes to the fictional feline society. The setting, an untouched valley surrounded by mountains, was designed to contrast with the fragmented forest of later arcs, emphasizing the raw struggle for territory. Early drafts focused heavily on Gray Wing and Clear Sky (two brothers who lead the newly formed Clans) as foils—the former representing communal values, the latter embodying authoritarian control.\nSynopsis and publication history\nThe Sun Trail\nAfter a harsh winter kills prey in the mountains, leaving the group of cats who lives there hungry, Gray Wing leads several of them to a fertile forest beneath the mountain. Tensions arise between the traveling cats, including Gray Wing's brother, Clear Sky, who claims hunting rights over a large portion of land for himself and several cats who follow him. The novel ends with the death of Clear Sky’s mate, Bright Stream, foreshadowing future conflicts. Released in hardcover on 5 March 2013 in the US and UK, the novel debuted at #7 on the New York Times Children’s Series Bestseller List. The paperback followed on 3 December 2013, with an e-book edition released simultaneously.\nThunder Rising\nClear Sky’s group grows dominant, demanding respect from others. Gray Wing rescues Thunder, Clear Sky’s abandoned son, and raises him. A battle looms as alliances fracture. Published on 5 November 2013, the hardcover release included a bonus manga chapter. The paperback released on 10 June 2014.\nThe First Battle\nClear Sky’s cats attack another group led by Tall Shadow, resulting in heavy casualties. A persuasive loner named River Ripple mediates a truce. The battle forces cats to recognize the need for rules between their groups. Published on 8 April 2014.\nThe Blazing Star\nA sickness spreads, killing young and old cats alike. Several cats discover the blazing star herb’s healing properties, inspiring them to become healers for their groups. Meanwhile, a troublesome group of rogue cats, led by One Eye, battles with Clear Sky's group. Wind Runner, a cat who was once a part of Tall Shadow's group, forms her own group. Published on 4 November 2014.\nA Forest Divided\nTerritorial borders are drawn between groups. Thunder, who is now a grown cat, establishes a group of his own, as does River Ripple, while Wind Runner, Tall Shadow, and Clear Sky solidify their groups. Gray Wing’s health declines with his old age. Published on 7 April 2015.\nPath of Stars\nThe five groups formalize their identities under their leaders. Each leader adds the \"-star\" suffix to their name to represent their connection to their ancestors, and they receive eight extra lives from these ancestors in turn. Clear Sky becomes Skystar and forms SkyClan, Thunder becomes Thunderstar and forms ThunderClan, Tall Shadow becomes Shadowstar and forms ShadowClan, Wind Runner becomes Windstar and forms WindClan, and River Ripple becomes Riverstar and forms RiverClan. Gray Wing dies peacefully, his legacy solidified in the unified Clans. Published on 1 September 2015.\nForeign editions\nTranslations of the series into other languages began in Germany (2014–2016), before moving to French (2015–2017), and eventually Russian (2016–2018).\nCritical reception\nThe arc received praise for its world-building but mixed reviews for pacing. Kirkus Reviews called The Sun Trail \"a visceral origin story\", praising its \"mythic weight\". Booklist noted \"rich moral complexity\" in Clear Sky’s arc. Publishers Weekly noted \"slow middle volumes\", and School Library Journal noted \"overly didactic\" themes. The arc's finale, Path of Stars, was well-receoved, with VOYA stating it \"redeems the arc’s uneven pacing with emotional payoff\".\nReferences"
