Bosnian Muslims (after 1993 the name was changed to Muslim-Bosniacs, and finally to Bosniaks) were recognized as a sixth \"nation\" of Yugoslavia (note: \"nations\" or officially: \"narodi\" were Slavic majority peoples, while \"nationalities\" of officially \"narodnosti\" were all other national minorities) and one of the three constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nMay 1980\n:Josip Broz Tito dies.\nFall of communism\n1981\n:An economic crisis in Yugoslavia begins.
