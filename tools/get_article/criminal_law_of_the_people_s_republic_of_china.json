Among them, the Criminal Law is a basic law of the People's Republic of China. On the basis of the Criminal Law, there are other separate laws that stipulate new crimes and penalties. As of 2023, the Criminal Law consists of a Criminal Code, twelve amendments, and one or two separate laws.\nHistory\nIn 1950, the Legal Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government began drafting the Criminal Law. By September 1954, the draft of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China and the draft of the Guiding Principles of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China had been drafted. In October 1954, the drafting of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China officially began, and by June 28, 1957, 22 drafts had been drafted. After that, due to the rise of \"leftist\" thinking and legal nihilism, criminal legislation work came to a standstill. It was not until 1962, after Mao Zedong criticized legal nihilism at the 7,000-person meeting, that the Legal Affairs Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress continued to draft the law based on the previous 22 drafts in May of the same year. By October 9, 1963, 33 drafts had been written. However, due to the influence of the socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution, the drafting work was stopped.\nAfter the Cultural Revolution, the newly drafted Criminal Law was revised based on the original 33 drafts in accordance with new situations and problems. The fourth draft was approved in principle by the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. After being reviewed and revised by the plenary session of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress, it was submitted to the Second Session of the Fifth National People's Congress for review, revision and supplementation. In March 1979, the Legal Affairs Committee of the NPC Standing Committee formed the fifth draft. Finally, the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China was adopted by the Second Session of the Fifth National People's Congress on July 1, 1979, promulgated on July 6, 1979, and implemented on January 1, 1980.\nAmendments\nFrom the implementation of the Criminal Law in 1980 to the revision of the Criminal Law in 1997, the legislature promulgated 23 separate criminal laws. These separate criminal laws have been included in Annex I and Annex II of the Supplementary Provisions of the Criminal Law revised in 1997, or repealed, or the criminal law parts therein have been repealed:\n* \"Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Servicemen for Violating Their Duties\"\n* \"Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

were more than 100 articles on criminal law in administrative law, economic law, and civil law, which are referred to as subsidiary criminal laws in the legal community.\nOn March 14, 1997, the Fifth Session amended the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, which was promulgated on March 14, 1997, and came into effect on October 1, 1997.\nSince then, the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China has been amended several times:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Information on the passage and implementation of previous criminal law amendments\n!Pass Date\n!Implementation

Some scholars believe that this is also a separate criminal law.\nContent\nThe current version of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, Article 2 of the General Provisions, etc. clearly defines the legislative task: The task of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China is to use punishment to fight against all criminal acts in order to safeguard national security, safeguard the people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system, protect state-owned property and property collectively owned by the working people, protect citizens' private property, protect citizens' personal rights, democratic rights and other rights, maintain social order and economic order, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.\nReferences"
