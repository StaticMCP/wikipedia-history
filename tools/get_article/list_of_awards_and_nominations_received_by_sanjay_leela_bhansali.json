In 2015, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award.\nBhansali made his directorial debut with Khamoshi: The Musical (1996), for which he received the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film. He rose to prominence in Indian cinema with the hit romance Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), the commercially successful and widely acclaimed romantic drama Devdas (2002) — which received a nomination for the Best Film Not in the English Language at British Academy of Film & Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards — and the drama Black (2005), for all of which he received multiple Best Film awards and Best Director awards along with an additional Filmfare Award for Best Film (Critics) award for the latter, and multiple National Film Awards for the latter two. However, he followed it by directing consecutive commercially failures such as Saawariya (2007) and Guzaarish (2010), however, Guzaarish received positive reviews from critics and audiences.\nThis changed with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet — the tragic romance Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013) — opened to positive reviews and strong box office collections, for which he received several awards and nominations. His home production biographical sports film Mary Kom (2014), had him receive his third National Film Award. His ensemble period dramas Bajirao Mastani (2015) and Padmaavat (2018) rank among the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. For the former, he won the National Film Award for Best Direction, as well as Best Film and Best Director Awards at Filmfare. He further earned more commercial and critical success for his biographical film, Gangubai Kathiawadi (2022) for which he received several accolades including the National Film Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Editing and Filmfare Awards for Best Direction and Best Film.\nBritish Academy Film Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Category\n!Film\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2002\n|Best Film Not in the English Language\n|Devdas\n|\n|\n|}\nNational Film Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n!Year\n!Category\n!Film\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2002\n|Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment\n|Devdas\n|rowspan=\"8\"\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Best Feature Film in Hindi\n|Black\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment\n|Mary Kom\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Best Director\n|Bajirao Mastani\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Best Music Director\n|Padmaavat\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2021\n|Best Screenplay\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gangubai Kathiawadi\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|Best Editing\n|}\nFilmfare Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n!Year\n!Film\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| Best Film\n|-\n| 2000\n| Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Black\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n| Mary Kom\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n| Bajirao Mastani\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| Padmaavat\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Gangubai Kathiawadi\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| Best Film (Critics)\n|-\n| 1997\n| Khamoshi: The Musical\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Black\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| Best Director\n|-\n| 2000\n| Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n| Devdas\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| Black\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n| Guzaarish\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n| Bajirao Mastani\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| Padmaavat\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Gangubai Kathiawadi\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| Best Screenplay\n|-\n| 2023\n| Gangubai Kathiawadi\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| Best Music Director\n|-\n| 2014\n| Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n| Bajirao Mastani\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n| Padmaavat\n|\n|\n|-\n| 2023\n| Gangubai Kathiawadi\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\"| Best Scene\n|-\n| 2003\n| Devdas\n|\n|\n|}\nMirchi Music Awards\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n!
