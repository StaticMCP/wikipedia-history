      "text": "# 1912-1935 Ethnic Rebellion of Cambodia\n\nBetween 1912 and 1935, an alliance of native peoples in what is now Cambodia rebelled against French colonizers. Their leader, whose name was recorded by the French as Pa-Trang-Loeng, united multiple diverse tribes, such as the Phnong and the Mnong, the latter of which Loeng was a part of. Initially beginning with a series of tribal attacks upon French outposts in Kratié, the conflict would escalate in 1914 with the assassination of explorer First Class Counselor Henri Maître at the hands of Trang. The insurgents established the Nam Nung base, which consisted of thousands of kilometres of land. The war ended with a French victory during the Siege of Nam Nung in the May of 1935.\nReferences"
