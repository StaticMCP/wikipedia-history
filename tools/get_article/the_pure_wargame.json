There's some question, however, about whether or not they'll want to. For someone unfamiliar with the wargaming experience, this one can be overwhelming.\"\nMike Robel of Computer Games Strategy Plus recommended it as \"excellent\" for its fast pace, ease of learning, and higher replay value over the richer and more detailed V for Victory: Market-Garden.\nThe game was in the 40 top strategy/war games in terms of both dollars and units sold, according to PC Data.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.mobygames.com/game/2779/the-pure-wargame/ The Pure Wargame] at MobyGames"
