It was built in 1891, and is a two-story, 10-bay brick building originally constructed for the Strasburg Stone and Earthenware Manufacturing Company to make earthenware.  It was converted to railroad use in 1913, at which time a one-story pent roof was added.  The building is covered with a slate-clad hipped roof surmounted by a hipped monitor.  The building served as a station and depot for the Southern Railroad.\nThe Strasburg Museum opened in the building in 1970.   Displays include railroad artifacts and a model railroad, Strasburg pottery, Native American artifacts, period rooms, and items from the American Civil War.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.strasburgmuseum.org/ Strasburg Museum] - official site\n*[http://www.csonner.net/museum.htm Strasburg Museum building history and photos]"
