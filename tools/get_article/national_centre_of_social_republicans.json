The party succeeded the Rally of the French People, but was not backed by Charles De Gaulle. The party did poorly in the 1956 parliamentary elections (relative to the RFP's performance in the 1951 elections).\nIts president was Jacques Chaban-Delmas. It ceased to exist in 1958.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Rally of the French People\n* Union for the New Republic"
