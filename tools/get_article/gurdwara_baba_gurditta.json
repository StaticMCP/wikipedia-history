Not only the residents of the village but ‘sangat’ from all surrounding area throng the Gurudwara Sahib on ‘sangrand’ to pay obeisance at the sacred place. It is believed that during the life span of Baba Gurditta ji, he spent many years here & culminated his ‘tapasaya’ on the auspicious day of ‘bhadon sangrand’.\nThe ‘sangat’ has built a huge gurudwara at the site & each ‘sangrand’ is celebrated with lot of reverence. It is believed that Baba Mangal Singh, who was a devout Sikh belonging to Chak 116, Sahiwal district (now Pakistan) took upon himself the ‘sewa’ to build the gurudwara at the current site in the year 1843-45. He belonged to a well to do agricultural family famously known as ‘Oonthwalas’. (Atwals used to husband camels and hence came to be known as oonthwalas).\nBaba Mangal Singh served in the Khalsa Durbar army of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and after the first Anglo-Sikh war, it seems that on the ‘hukaknama of the ‘Akal Purakh’ he headed to the village of Chandpur Rurki with the purpose to build Gurudwara Baba Gurditta ji. His grandson Sardar Sant Singh, who became a senior government officer, further upgraded the premises. Baba Mangal Singh and his decedents were the first Sikhs to settle in the village, which is located in the Kandi area of Shivalik foothills.\nThough his descendants have moved to cities in India and overseas, as and when possible they make it a point to visit their ancestral village and the Gurudwara. They have been big donors in the gurudwara sewa, donated land to the village school and also built a community centre in the village.\nThe gurudwara is managed by Sehajdhari Sikhs & during the ‘sangrand’ festivity every household, all men, women & children of the village work with utmost faith in preparing ‘langar’ and manage thousands of devotees. Free medical check-up camps for the sangat are also arranged on the auspicious day.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.babagurdittaji.com   www.babagurdittaji.com]\n* [http://wn.com/Baba_Gurditta WN.com]\n* [http://wikimapia.org/8926146/Gurudwara-Baba-Gurditta-ji Wikimapia.org]\n* [http://gallery.sikhsangeet.com/v/Gurudware/KeeratpurSahib/Gurdwara+Baba+Gurditta+Ji+24.JPG.html Gallery.sikhsangeet.com]\n* [http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/?option=com_content&view=article&id=4207 allaboutsikhs.com]\n* [https://archive.today/20130210001115/http://www.worldgurudwaras.com/historical-gurudwaras/india/punjab/nawanshahar/gurdwara-baba-gurditta-ji-chandpur-rurki worldgurudwaras.com]"
