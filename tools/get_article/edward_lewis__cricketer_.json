He played for the American national side from 1991 to 1997, and before emigrating to the U.S. also played for the Leeward Islands in West Indian domestic cricket.\nLewis made his senior debut for the Leewards in February 1985, in a limited-overs game against Barbados. Coming in third in the batting order, he scored 145 not out, setting a Leeward Islands record for the highest individual score in List A matches that still stands. Despite this, Lewis never played another limited-overs games for the Leewards. He did appear in three first-class matches later in the 1984–85 season, but failed to repeat his earlier success.\nAfter emigrating to the U.S., Lewis made his debut for the U.S. national team in August 1991, in the annual Auty Cup fixture against Canada. His first major international tournament for the team was the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya. He scored 196 runs from six innings (the second-most for his team), with his highest score being 68 not out against East and Central Africa. Lewis played his last international fixtures at the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia, aged 37. His older brother, Enoch Lewis, also played first-class cricket.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/5/5554/5554.html Player profile and statistics] at [https://cricketarchive.com CricketArchive]\n* [http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/player/25672.html Player profile and statistics] at [http://www.espncricinfo.com ESPNcricinfo]"
