Gould coined the binomial name Toccus hartlaubi. The specific epithet was chosen to honour of the German ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub. This species was previously assigned to the genus Tockus but is now placed in the genus Horizocerus that was introduced in 1899 by the American ornithologist Harry C. Oberholser.\nThe western dwarf hornbill was formerly considered to be conspecific with the eastern dwarf hornbill (Horizocerus granti) with the English name \"black dwarf hornbill\".\nDescription\nIt is black with a curved beak and a wide white brow above its eye.\nReferences"
