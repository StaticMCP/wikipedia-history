In 1990, the bottling rights to Stewart's were acquired by the Cable Car Beverage Corporation. Cream Soda and Ginger Beer flavors were introduced in 1992. Other flavors have been added since then. In November 1997 Cable Car Beverage Corporation was purchased by Triarc.  Cadbury Schweppes PLC acquired the Stewart's brands in 2000 along with Snapple and Mistic Brands for $1.45 billion.\nStewart's drinks come in 12 fl. oz. (355 ml) glass bottles with twist-off tops. The bottles of some flavors are tinted amber, while the others are clear.\nFlavors\nVarious Stewart's root beer bottles\n{|\n|style=\"width:375px\"|\n*Root Beer\n*Diet Root Beer\n*Birch Beer\n*Cream soda\n*Black Cherry Wishniak\n*Grape\n*Key Lime\n*Cherries 'n Cream\n*Orange 'n Cream\n*Diet Orange 'n Cream\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*Stewart's Restaurants\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.drinkstewarts.com/ Drink Stewart's]\n*[https://www.drpeppersnapplegroup.com/brands/stewarts Stewart's brand at Dr. Pepper/Snapple]"
