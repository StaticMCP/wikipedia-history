This article is based on [https://18daagseveldtocht.be/ one source], which covers up every detail on the 18 day campaign (1940) in the Belgian Perspective.\nDivisions\n22 divisions form the basis of the Belgian Army. A division at full strength had three infantry regiments, an artillery regiment, an engineer battalion, and some transmission troops. Additional arms may include quartermaster companies, tanks, and signal units. Three divisions form a corps.\nOriginal six divisions of 1914\n1st Infantry Division\n2nd Infantry Division\n3rd Infantry Division\n4th Infantry Division\n5th Infantry Division\n6th Infantry Division\nDivisions formed in the mobilization process of 1938-1939\n7th Infantry Division\n8th Infantry Division\n9th Infantry Division\n10th Infantry Division\n11th Infantry Division\n12th Infantry Division\n13th Infantry Division\n14th Infantry Division\n15th Infantry Division\n16th Infantry Division\n17th Infantry Division\n18th Infantry Division\n1st Cavalry Division\n2nd Cavalry Division\nArdennes Hunter divisions (Chasseurs Ardennais)\nFormed in 1934, they were specifically supposed to hold the Ardennes against attack. There were only two divisions.\n1st Division Ardennes Hunters, also known as 1st Division Chasseurs Ardennais\n2nd Division Ardennes Hunters, also known as 2nd Division Chasseurs Ardennais\nGroup Ninitte\nGroup Ninitte was a special group of regiments that acted as a flexible reserve and defence force.\nInfantry 1940\nBefore World War II began, the Belgian Army had only 19 regiments, of which most were regiments of the line. In the ensuing mobilization process of the 1930s, each regiment was split, or reinforced, to form 3 more regiments. There was a traditional distinction between the Line Infantry, Foot Hunters, Carabiners, and Grenadiers, but all uniforms remained the same. (Besides the badges)\nThe Infantry Regiments were divided among 18 Infantry Divisions, two Cavalry Divisions, Several Corps, and Group Ninitte.\nField army\nMost of these regiments saw combat in World War I, and were split to form other regiments. These regiments were well equipped as they were the first to enter combat.\nLine regiments\n1st Line Regiment (3rd Infantry Division), under Colonel Louis Barthélemy\n2nd Line Regiment (12th Infantry Division), under Colonel Devloo\n3rd Line Regiment (1st Infantry Division), under Captain Victor Defonseca\n4th Line Regiment (1st Infantry Division), under Colonel Arthur De Cae\n5th Line Regiment (2nd Infantry Division), under Colonel R.

Dagois\n2nd Regiment Foot Hunters (5th Infantry Division), under Colonel Georges Lescornez\n3rd Regiment Foot Hunters (10th Infantry Division), under Colonel A. Sthouse\nGrenadiers and carabiners\nGrenadiers, like all other armies in the world, consist of strong forces in the army. Carabiners fight quick skirmishes with the enemy to allow regular infantry to join the front. Carabiner-Cyclists also have cycles to increase mobility, allowing them to cooperate with cavalry, unlike most infantry. The Carabiner-Cyclists are also considered as cavalry.\n1st Grenadier Regiment (6th Infantry Division), under Colonel André Van Sprang\n1st Carabiner Regiment (6th Infantry Division), under Colonel, Robert Oor\n1st Regiment Carabiner-Cyclists (Group Ninitte), under Colonel M. Flameng\n2nd Regiment Carabiner-Cyclists, under Colonel Albert Mersch\nArdennes Hunters\nThe Ardennes Hunters were special forces in the Belgian Infantry. Created in 1934 by the reformation of the 10th Line Regiment, these regimental forces position themselves in the Ardennes, manning posts important junctions in the Ardennes region. In the Battle of Belgium, they slowed down the German onslaught, in time for the rest of the army to retreat to new positions.\n1st Regiment Ardennes Hunters (1st Division Ardennes Hunters), under Colonel Robert Deschepper\n2nd Regiment Ardennes Hunters (1st Division Ardennes Hunters), under Colonel Florent Merckx\n3rd Regiment Ardennes Hunters (1st Division Ardennes Hunters), under Colonel H.
