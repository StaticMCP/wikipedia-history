Lechovitch is a branch of Karlin Hasidism as Jaffe was a leading disciple of Rabbi Shlomo of Karlin. The Slonim, Koidanov, and Kobrin dynasties derive from Lechovitch Hasidism.\nHistory\nLechovitch Hasidism was founded in 1772 by Mordechai Jaffe, a disciple of Aharon Perlow of Karlin and Shlomo HaLevi of Karlin. After Shlomo HaLevi's death in 1792, Jaffe succeeded him as rebbe. Following Jaffe's death in 1810 he was succeeded by his son, Noach Jaffe , who was the Lechovitcher rebbe until his death in 1832 after which the community split between the followers of his son-in-law Mordechai Malovitzky and his nephew and student Shlomo Chaim Perlow, who founded the Koidanov Hasidic dynasty. The last Lechovitcher rebbe was Yochanan Malovitzky who was murdered in the Holocaust. His uncle, Pinchas Betzalel was the son-in-law of the Slonimer rebbe, Shmuel Weinberg, and established a branch of Lechovitch Hasidism in the United States and was succeeded by his grandson, Yehoshua Malovitzky (1923 - 1987).\nLineage\n*Grand Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe (ca. 1742 - 1810), 1st Lechovitcher Rebbe\n**Grand Rabbi Noach Jaffe (1775 - 1832), 2nd Lechovitcher Rebbe\n***Grand Rabbi Mordechai Malovitzky (maternal grandson of R.
