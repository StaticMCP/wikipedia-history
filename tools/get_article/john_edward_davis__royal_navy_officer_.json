From 1831 to 1837 he served on  and  in South America, becoming master's assistant. He spent a period with HMS Beagle surveying parts of the coasts of Chile, Peru and Bolivia.

In September Terror, along with , sailed for the Antarctic on what would be a four year voyage of discovery led by James Clark Ross. The expedition discovered the Transantarctic Mountains and the volcanoes Erebus and Terror, named after the ships. Davis was responsible for surveying operations and preparing charts, and also made numerous illustrations of events on the voyage. On returning to England Davis was thanked by Francis Beaufort, Hydrographer and promoted to master\n|File:Collision of Erebus and Terror.jpg\n|Collision of Erebus and Terror\n|File:P313 Voyage of Discovery Ross Vol 1.jpg\n|Beaufort Island and Mount Erebus\n|File:Ross 1847 A Gale in the Pack voyagediscovery2Ross 0194.jpg\n|A Gale in the Pack\n}}\nFrom 1844 until 1862 Davis worked as a surveyor in home waters, first as assistant-surveyor to Captain G.A. Bedford on the west coast of Ireland, then on the south coast of England with Lieutenant H.L. Cox and then with Staff-Commander Usborne. In 1862 he sailed with  on a deep-sea sounding cruise to the north-west of Ireland. This was successful in finding a suitable route for a transatlantic cable, avoiding the precipitous slopes that mark much of the edge of the continental shelf. Davis was commended in official reports for his contributions to this work. He then became a naval assistant to the Admiralty, responsible for supervision of deep-sea sounding equipment and for maintaining the catalogue of official documents. He published a number of works on the technical aspects of surveying and exploration, in particular on deep-sea temperature measurement. He was promoted Staff-Commander in 1863, and to Captain in 1870. He retired from the Hydrographic Office in 1877 and died later that year.\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/catalogue/bpa/artists/davis%2c+j.e./ Paintings by Davis in the collection of the Scott Polar Research Institute]"
