The battle, while not widely reported by the Portuguese, was recorded in correspondence between the Kongolese and their Dutch allies.  The battle marked the turn of the short war in the favor of Kongo and led to the ouster of the Portuguese governor of Luanda and the return of Kongolese subjects taken as slaves in earlier campaigns.\nAs a result of the conflict, the manikongo Pedro II sought an alliance with the Dutch Empire to drive the Portuguese from the region entirely.\nFootnotes\nSee also\n*First Kongo-Portuguese War\n*Portuguese Angola\n*Kingdom of Kongo\n*History of Angola"
