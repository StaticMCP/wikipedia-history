The incumbent Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture is Angus Robertson, who assumed office in May 2021.\nThe Cabinet Secretary was supported by the Minister for Culture, Europe and International Development until May 2024.\nHistory\nThe Europe and External Affairs brief was instituted in 2000 and combined with Education as the Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs which was a Cabinet position in the McLeish Government. After 2001 the Europe and External Affairs Brief was abolished as a ministerial position. From 1999 to 2001, the Culture brief was a junior post in the Scottish Government as Deputy Minister for Culture and Sport. It was made into a Cabinet position as Minister for Culture and Sport in the First McConnell government from 2001 to 2003. The Second McConnell government from 2003 to 2007 combined the Culture and Sport brief with Tourism to form a Cabinet post in the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. Culture was combined with External Affairs and Europe, to form a junior ministerial position, of Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture in the Salmond government following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. In February 2009 the role was expanded to deal with constitutional issues this additional role was later removed in December 2009 following the publication of the National Conversation. After the 2011 Scottish Parliament election the office-holder returned to the Cabinet with the junior ministerial post being transformed into the Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs. After the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the post was retitled Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs.\nIn February 2020 the existing Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop took on additional responsibilities for economic matters from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy (that role becoming the Cabinet Secretary for Finance), whilst responsibility for external affairs was transferred to the Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations, with that post being renamed Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, Europe and External Affairs. Tourism moved to the Rural Economy brief. On 19 May 2021 the position ceased to exist with the re-establishment of the roles of Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy, and a separate Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture.\nResponsibilities\nThe responsibilities of the Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, External Affairs and Culture:\n*British Irish Council\n*broadcasting and screen\n*communication with people, businesses and organisations regarding devolution, independence and Scotland's constitutional future\n*architecture, creative Industries and supporting the creative workforce\n*Creative Scotland\n*constitutional policy and strategy\n*culture, community engagement and libraries\n*cultural festivals\n*culture policy\n*Europe and the European Union including alignment\n*Historic Environment Scotland\n*international development\n*international strategy implementation\n*independence strategy\n*major events\n*Museums and Galleries Scotland and cultural collections\n*National Performing Companies\n*National Records of Scotland\n*other arts including performing arts, literature and poetry\n*Parliamentary co-ordination and liaison regarding devolution, independence and Scotland's constitutional future\n*royal and ceremonial\n*Scottish Connections\n*Scotland’s International Network\n*UNESCO World Heritage/intangible cultural heritage\n*youth music initiative and youth arts\nList of office holders\nCabinet position\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; \"\n! colspan=7| Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs\n! colspan=7| Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Name\n! width=75|Portrait\n!Entered office\n!Left office\n!Party\n!First Minister\n!colspan=\"2\"|Name\n! width=75|Portrait\n!Entered office\n!Left office\n!Party\n!First Minister\n|-\n|\n|Jack McConnell\n|\n|1 November 2000\n| 22 November 2001\n|Labour Party\n|Henry McLeish\n|\n|Sam Galbraith\n|\n|1 November 2000\n|20 March 2001\n|Labour Party\n|Henry McLeish\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport\n|-\n|\n|Mike Watson\n|\n|28 November 2001\n|28 November 2002\n|Labour Party\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Jack McConnell\n|-\n|\n|Elaine Murray\n|\n|28 November 2002\n|21 May 2003\n|Labour Party\n|-\n|\n|Frank McAveety\n|\n|21 May 2003\n|4 October 2004\n|Labour Party\n|-\n|\n|Patricia Ferguson\n|\n|4 October 2004\n|19 February 2007\n|Labour Party\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs\n|-\n|\n|Fiona Hyslop\n|\n|19 May 2011\n|21 November 2014\n|Scottish National Party\n|Alex Salmond\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Europe and External Affairs\n|-\n|\n|Fiona Hyslop\n|\n|21 November 2014\n|18 May 2016\n|Scottish National Party\n|Nicola Sturgeon\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs\n|-\n|\n|Fiona Hyslop\n|\n|18 May 2016\n|17 February 2020\n|Scottish National Party\n|Nicola Sturgeon\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| }}Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture\n|-\n|\n|Fiona Hyslop\n|\n|17 February 2020\n|19 May 2021\n|Scottish National Party\n|Nicola Sturgeon\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| }}Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, External Affairs and Culture\n|-\n|\n|Angus Robertson\n|\n|20 May 2021\n|Incumbent\n|Scottish National Party\n| Nicola SturgeonHumza YousafJohn Swinney\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Scottish Parliament\n*Scottish Government\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/cabinet-secretary-culture-tourism-external-affairs/ Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Fair Work and Culture]  on the Scottish Government website"
