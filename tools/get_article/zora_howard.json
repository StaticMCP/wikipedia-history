The film follows Howard as Ayanna, a 17-year-old New Yorker who strikes up a summer romance with an artist in his twenties (Joshua Boone). It premiered at Sundance 2019. The film received positive critical reception. Writing for Elle, Candace Frederick called it \"the kind of confident, remarkably vulnerable drama to which even veteran storytellers aspire.\" Michael Cuby of Nylon described it as, \"a coming-of-age love story that's as much about finding your first love as it is about using that first love to find yourself.\"\nHoward's first play, STEW, ran in February 2020 at Walkerspace in New York. It centers a family of three generations of women who must grapple with their personal choices. In a mainly positive review for Vulture, Helen Shaw stated, \"Howard moves from broad strokes to ontological bewilderment almost before you know it...Howard makes us hear hundreds of years of pain, knocking to be let in.\"\nAccolades\n* 2020-2021 Van Lier New Voices Fellow, The Lark\n* 2021 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Finalist (for STEW)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://zorahoward.com/home Official website]"
