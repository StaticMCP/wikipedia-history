He attended Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, and American University in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1916 Paul joined the Colorado Army National Guard as a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery Branch to serve on the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition.\nHe received a commission in the Regular Army in 1917, after the American entry into World War I. During the war he served at Camp Merritt, New Jersey. Like many others who became general officers in World War II, Paul did not serve overseas.\nBetween the wars\nThe war came to an end on November 11, 1918. Paul, remaining in the army during the interwar years, graduated from the Infantry School, Officers Course in 1921. From 1922 to 1924 he was assistant professor of military science for the Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Johns Hopkins University, from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1924.\nPaul was a 1930 graduate of the Infantry Officer Advanced Course, and was an instructor at the U.S. Army Infantry School from 1930 to 1933. He graduated from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School in 1935, and the U.S. Army War College in 1937.\nHe was assigned to the staff of the Adjutant General's Department, 1937 to 1941, and in 1942 he received a Master of Arts degree from the American University.\nWorld War II\n, commanding the XII Corps of Patton's Third Army, under whose command Paul's 26th Division fell.]]\nIn 1942, after the American entrance into World War II, Paul was assigned as Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, as a G-4 staff officer with Headquarters Army Ground Forces, receiving promotion to the one-star general officer rank of brigadier general on June 24, 1942.\nHe was promoted again, this time to the two-star rank of major general, on March 16, 1943. The following month he was made the first Commanding General (CG) of the 75th Infantry Division, an all-draftee division, during its stateside training. In August he then assumed command of the 26th Infantry Division, nicknamed the \"Yankee Division\", an Army National Guard formation recruiting from Massachusetts. He took over command from Major General Roger W. Eckfeldt, who had commanded the 26th Division for over three years. Paul led the 26th in numerous training exercises in the United States and was to command the division for the rest of the war.\nIn a memoir written by one Yankee Division (YD) infantryman who trained under his command at Camp Jackson, SC in 1944, the general \"was known as 'Gangplank Paul' to everyone in the ranks for his outspoken eagerness to get his troops overseas. His hortatory speeches on the subject went back years and still stuck in the minds of the earliest YD recruits.\"\nPaul led the 26th Division overseas to the Western Front in late August 1944, arriving at Cherbourg, France in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) in early September 1944, three months after the Normandy landings. The 26th Division's first major action of the war was during the Battle of the Bulge towards the end of the year where it played an important role in the counterattack by Lieutenant General George Patton's Third Army that reduced the German salient. Earning praise from Patton, the 26th took part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany in March 1945 until the end of World War II in Europe in May.\nFor his services during the war Paul was twice awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, and the Legion of Merit. Interestingly, Paul was also the recipient of four decorations from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics during World War II - the highest number awarded to an individual U.S. Army servicemember.  His decorations included the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Patriotic War First Class, the Order of the Red Star and the Bravery Medal.\nThe citation for his Silver Star reads:\n}}\nPostwar\nreceives the Legion of Merit from Major General Willard S. Paul, then the Director of Personnel and Administration, 1946.]]\nAfter the war Paul remained in Europe as Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, G-1, at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF).\nIn 1947 Paul was promoted to lieutenant general and returned to the United States as the army's Assistant Chief of Staff for Personnel, G-1, where served until his 1948 retirement. As the army's top personnel officer, he was responsible for its post-war manpower demobilization.\nPaul's decorations included two awards of the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit.\nCivilian career\nFollowing his retirement from the military he was a consultant for the American Red Cross, Assistant Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization, and a member of the subcommittee set up by the Hoover Commission to study personnel issues in the Department of Defense. Paul also served as President of the Retired Officers Association.\nIn 1956 he became President of Gettysburg College, where he remained until his 1961 retirement.  One of his acts as President of the college was to make space available for former President Dwight D. Eisenhower to maintain an office.\nRetirement and death\nLieutenant General Willard Paul died at Walter Reed Army Hospital on March 21, 1966, and was buried in Section 30, Grave 1073 RH of Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.\nReferences\n* Army List and Directory, U.S. Army Adjutant General's Office, 1919, page 140\n* Johns Hopkins Half-Century Directory, 1926, page 275\n* Newspaper article, President Names 23 Major Generals, New York Times, March 26, 1943\n* Newspaper article, Paul Commands 26th Division, Hartford Courant, August 26, 1943\n* Newspaper article, Heads Demobilization: Maj.
