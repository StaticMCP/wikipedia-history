It was last contested in 2018, with James Pasternak elected councillor for the 2018–2022 term.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nThe current ward is an amalgamation of the old Ward 9 and the old Ward 10.\n2018 municipal election\nWard 6 York Centre was first contested during the 2018 municipal election. The Ward 9 incumbent, Maria Augimeri, ran against Ward 10 incumbent James Pasternak and two other candidates. Pasternak was ultimately elected with 47.61 per cent of the vote.\nGeography\nDespite its name, Ward 6 York Centre is part of the North York community council, and does not form part of the former city of York.\nYork Centre is bounded on the north by Steeles Avenue (the city limit), and on the east, south and west by a line drawn from the city limit south along Yonge Street, west along the hydroelectric transmission line north of Finch Avenue, south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Don River West Branch, southwest and west along Highway 401, north along Jane Street, east along Sheppard Avenue, northwest along Black Creek, east along Grandravine Drive, and north along Keele Street to the city limit.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Council term\n! colspan=\"2\" |Member\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |North York Spadina (Metro Council)\n|-\n|1988–1991\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Howard Moscoe\n|-\n|1991–1994\n|-\n|1994–1997\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ward 8 North York Spadina\n|-\n|1997–2000\n| colspan=\"2\" |Howard Moscoe, Mike Feldman\n|-\n!\n!
