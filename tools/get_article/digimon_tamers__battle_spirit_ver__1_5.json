      "text": "# Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5\n\n|genre = Fighting\n|modes = Single player, Multiplayer\n|platforms = WonderSwan Color\n}}\nis a fighting game developed and published by Bandai. It was released exclusively in Japan for the WonderSwan Color handheld console on 27 April 2002. It is an expansion to Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit (released in the United States and Europe as Digimon Battle Spirit) and contains many new features and characters. Unlike its predecessor or sequel, Digimon Battle Spirit 2, this game did not receive a Game Boy Advance port.\nGameplay\nDigimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 is a platform fighter.\nOpening\nDigimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 had a similar opening to the original game, although lengthened to contain the expanded roster (although BlackAgumon and Extra Agumon were not revealed. A shadowed Beelzemon Blast Mode is shown along with Impmon and Milleniummon\nThe final scene of the opening is randomly picked. The following duels could be seen at the end:\nBlackWarGreymon vs. WarGreymon\nMegaGargomon vs. Cherubimon\nGallantmon vs. Omnimon\nSeraphimon vs. Ophanimon\nGallantmon Crimson Mode vs. Beelzemon Blast Mode\nStory line\nBy beating the game on Normal difficulty or higher without losing, the player got a chance to battle ZeedMillenniummon as a second \"final boss\".\nStages\nThree new levels were added in Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5.\nA Locomon level, was included as Patamon's level. The Train had two vents on either side of the level which worked similar to the trampoline in Terriermon's level. During the match, the train passes through a modern, unnamed town. DemiDevimon are constantly flying above the fighters.\nA waterfall level was included as Gatomon's level. The Digimon fight beside and behind the waterfall, with bushes here and there on the sides. Makuramon can occasionally be seen in the bushes, and Gotsumon occasionally roll down the mountain. This is the only vertical level in the Digimon: Battle Spirit series.\nInstead of randomly interrupting a fight, Impmon received his own stage, which appears to be loosely based on the net from the Second Digimon Movie. Television screens of Impmon line both sides of the level, and the entire stage has an odd feel to it. The level is vertically symmetrical; you can see a floor above you when you're on the highest platform. The suction effect, which draws loose data to Impmon, is automatically on.\nItems\nThere are six items available in the game:\n* Baseball\n* Shot put ball\n* Fire ball\n* Electric ball\n* Gear\n* Clock\nCharacters\nPlayable characters\nAll of the original characters, including the unlockable Digimon, from Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit were included as playable characters from the start, with the exception of Impmon. In addition, Patamon and Gatomon were added, with Seraphimon and Ophanimon as their Digivolutions, respectively.\nIn addition, there were two unlockable Digimon; An Extra Guilmon (who is unlocked by obtaining the \"ultimate*\" level tag in single player mode) who, like the Extra Agumon that could Digivolve into Omnimon, Digivolved into Gallantmon Crimson Mode, and the returning Impmon (who is unlocked by obtaining the \"champion*\" level tag in single player mode), with Beelzemon Blast Mode as a new Digivolution.\nThis game marks the first ever appearance of Extra Guilmon.\nDigimon Battle Spirit and Digimon Battle Spirit 1.5 are compatible for multiplayer crossplay.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Digimon\n!Digivolution\n!Availability in Battle Spirit\n!Availability in Battle Spirit 1.5\n|-\n|Guilmon\n|Gallantmon\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|Terriermon\n|MegaGargomon\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|Renamon\n|Sakuyamon\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|Veemon\n|Imperialdramon Paladin Mode\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|Wormmon\n|Imperialdramon Fighter Mode\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|Agumon\n|WarGreymon\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|Sukamon\n|Etemon\n|Starter\n|Starter\n|-\n|BlackAgumon\n|BlackWarGreymon\n|Unlockable\n|Starter\n|-\n|Lopmon\n|Cherubimon (Evil)\n|Unlockable\n|Starter\n|-\n|Gabumon\n|Omnimon\n|Unlockable\n|Starter\n|-\n|ExtraAgumon\n|Omnimon\n|Unlockable\n|Starter\n|-\n|Patamon\n|Seraphimon\n|Not Available\n|Starter\n|-\n|Gatomon\n|Ophanimon\n|Not Available\n|Starter\n|-\n|Impmon\n|None/Beelzemon Blast Mode\n|Unlockable\n|Unlockable\n|-\n|ExtraGuilmon\n|Gallantmon Crimson Mode\n|Not Available\n|Unlockable\n|}\nNon-playable characters\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Characters\n!Type\n!Appearance\n|-\n|Calumon\n|Digimon\n|Every stage as a neutral Digimon that causes the first Digimon to touch it to Digivolve\n|-\n|Betamon\n|Digimon\n|Toytown\n|-\n|Gotsumon\n|Digimon\n|Cathedral Ruins and Pichi Pichi Falls\n|-\n|Numemon\n|Digimon\n|Etemon's Desert\n|-\n|DemiDevimon\n|Digimon\n|Shinto Temple, Locomontion, and Irritation Room\n|-\n|Mushroomon\n|Digimon\n|Puppetmon's Jungle\n|-\n|Bakemon\n|Digimon\n|Digimon Emperor's Lair\n|-\n|Penguinmon\n|Digimon\n|Frozen Wonderland\n|-\n|Millenniummon\n|Digimon\n|Final boss in Final Battle\n|-\n|ZeedMillenniummon\n|Digimon\n|Secret second final boss in Secret Final Battle\n|-\n|Locomon\n|Digimon\n|Part of the stage in Locomontion\n|-\n|Chuumon\n|Digimon\n|On the back of Sukamon and on the character selection screen\n|-\n|Takato Matsuki\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Henry Wong\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Rika Nonaka\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Davis Motomiya\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Ken Ichijouji\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Taichi \"Tai\" Kamiya\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Willis Gladstone\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Yamato \"Matt\" Ishida\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Takeru \"T.K.\" Takaishi\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|-\n|Kari Kamiya\n|Tamer\n|Character selection screen\n|}\nDevelopment\nWonderswan Color: the console Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 was exclusively released to\nDigimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 is the sequel to Digimon Battle Spirit, which released a year prior on 6 October 2001. It contains everything the previous version contains, along with some added characters, an extended \"storyline\", and several other bonuses.\nUnlike its prequel Digimon Battle Spirit and its sequel Digimon Battle Spirit 2 that received Game Boy Advance ports, Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 was solely released on the WonderSwan Color.\nReception\nThe game received an average rating of 8.2/10 from players.\nIGN writers Lucas M. Thomas and Craig Harrist listed 1.5 as one of the games they would most like to see appear on the DSiWare service for the Nintendo DSi. They claimed that \"it would still be interesting to get this game on our DSi systems through digital download -- to play for fun, but also because of its place in industry history\", referring to its status as one of the final games for the WonderSwan Color.\nEsports\nThe Digimon Battle Spirit series has a multiplayer option. However, no significant competitive scene exists.. Digimon Battle Spirit and Digimon Tamers: Battle Spirit Ver. 1.5 are available for multiplayer crossplay both in person and online.\nSee also\n* Digimon Battle Spirit\n* Digimon Battle Spirit 2\n* Digimon\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nhttps://www.dimps.co.jp/en/"
