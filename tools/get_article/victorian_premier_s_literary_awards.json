As of 2013, it is reportedly Australia's richest literary prize with the top winner receiving 125,000 and category winners 25,000 each.\nThe awards were established in 1985 by John Cain, Premier of Victoria, to mark the centenary of the births of Vance and Nettie Palmer, two of Australia's best-known writers and critics who made significant contributions to Victorian and Australian literary culture.\nFrom 1986 till 1997, the awards were presented as part of the Melbourne Writers Festival. In 1997 their administration was transferred to the State Library of Victoria. By 2004, the total prize money was 180,000. In 2011, stewardship was taken over by the Wheeler Centre.\nWinners 2011–present\nBeginning in 2011, the awards were restructured into five categories: Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Drama and Young People's. The winner of each receives $25,000. Of those five winners, one is chosen as the overall winner of the Victorian Prize for Literature and receives an additional $100,000. There are two other categories with different prize amounts: an honorary People's Choice Award voted on by readers, and an Unpublished Manuscript Award with a prize amount of $15,000. In 2022 an Award for Children's Literature valued at $25,000 was added, with entries being accepted in 2023. Another category was added in 2024, the John Clarke Prize for Humour Writing, honouring satirist John Clarke, for fiction, nonfiction and poetry.\nShortlists are maintained in the main article for each category.\nVictorian Prize for Literature\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Ref.\n|-\n! 2011\n|\n| That Deadman Dance\n|\n|-\n! 2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2013\n| colspan=\"3\" |Presented in January 2014 (see 2014 entry) for books published in 2013.\nPrevious awards were based on the year of publication.\n|-\n! 2014\n|\n| Liquid Nitrogen\n|\n|-\n!2015\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2016\n|\n|Broken\n|\n|-\n!2017\n|\n|''The Drover's Wife\n|\n|-\n!2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison\n|\n|-\n!2020\n| with Eamon Flack\n|Counting and Cracking\n|\n|-\n!2021\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2022\n|\n|Black and Blue: A Memoir of Racism and Resilience\n|\n|-\n!2023\n|\n|Cold Enough for Snow\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|\n|Chinese Fish\n|\n|-\n!2025\n|\n|Three Dresses\n|\n|}\nFiction\nFor winners from 1985 to 2010, see Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Ref.\n|-\n! 2011\n|\n|That Deadman Dance\n|\n|-\n! 2012\n|\n| Foal's Bread\n|\n|-\n! 2013\n| colspan=\"3\" |Presented in January 2014 (see 2014 entry) for books published in 2013.\nPrevious awards were based on the year of publication.\n|-\n! 2014\n|\n| Coal Creek\n|\n|-\n! 2015\n|\n|To Name Those Lost\n|\n|-\n! 2016\n|\n|The World Without Us\n|\n|-\n! 2017\n|\n|Between a Wolf and a Dog\n|\n|-\n! 2018\n|\n|Australia Day\n|\n|-\n! 2019\n|\n|The Madonna of the Mountains\n|\n|-\n! 2020\n|\n|Damascus\n|\n|-\n! 2021\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2022\n| Melissa Manning\n|Smokehouse\n|\n|-\n! 2023\n|\n|Cold Enough for Snow\n|\n|-\n! 2024\n|\n| Edenglassie\n|\n|-\n! 2025\n|\n| Highway 13\n|\n|}\nNonfiction\nFor winners from 1985 to 2010, see the Nettie Palmer Prize for Non-fiction.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Ref.\n|-\n! 2011\n|\n|An Eye for Eternity: The Life Of Manning Clark\n|\n|-\n! 2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2013\n| colspan=\"3\" |Presented in January 2014 (see 2014 entry) for books published in 2013.\nPrevious awards were based on the year of publication.\n|-\n!2014\n|\n|Forgotten War\n|\n|-\n!2015\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2016\n|\n|Something for the Pain\n|\n|-\n!2017\n|\n|Offshore: Behind the Wire on Manus\n|\n|-\n!2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2019\n|\n|No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison\n|\n|-\n!2020\n|\n|Sea People: The Puzzle of Polynesia\n|\n|-\n!2021\n|\n|Body Count: How Climate Change Is Killing Us\n|\n|-\n!2022\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!2023\n|\n|Root & Branch: Essays on Inheritance\n|\n|-\n!2024\n|\n|Personal Score: Sport, Culture, Identity\n|\n|-\n! 2025\n|Susan Hampton\n|Anything Can Happen\n|\n|}\nPoetry\nFor winners from 1985 to 2010, see the C.
