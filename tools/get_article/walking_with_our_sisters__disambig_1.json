Each pair of moccasin vamps, also known as tops, represents one missing or murdered Indigenous woman from North America.\nProject\nThe Walking With Our Sisters project was initiated by Métis artist Christi Belcourt to acknowledge the grief families of missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) suffer with, to raise awareness of MMIW and to create opportunities for a discourse in which the issue can be acknowledged across communities in Canada and the United States. This project began in June 2012 with lead organizer Belcourt using social media to invite people to create moccasin tops in memory of Missing and Murdered Women. By July 25, 2013 more than 1,600 vamps had been mailed to Belcourt far surpassing the initial goal of 600.  Over 200 individuals from around the world contributed to the project. At last count over 1,725 pairs of vamps have been donated to this project.  They were created by 1,372 artists, 331 from the United States, 9 from countries outside of North America, and 1,385 from Canada.  In addition to the moccasin vamps sixty audio recordings were submitted.  These songs have been compiled and are played as visitors go throughout the exhibits.\nIn 2014 the project expanded to include 108 pairs of children's moccasin vamps in memory of children who died or went missing while attending a residential school . The children's vamps were added to the exhibition through a similar social media call to the one used at the start of the original project. Families and residential school survivors were encouraged to contribute children's vamps in memory of a loved one. This addition to the project occurred when the Walking With Our Sisters was at Algoma University, which is located on the site of the former Shingwauk Indian Residential School. A ceremony was held as part of the exhibition programming to honor the children being remembered through this initiative and to add the children's vamps to the exhibition.\nWalking With Our Sisters Collective\nThe installation schedule and community outreach for the Walking With Ours Sisters exhibition is managed by a volunteer collective. The work of the collective is overseen by Maria Campbell, an Elder and advisor on traditional protocol.

Tracie Louttit and Jodi Stonehouse are part of a volunteer film crew for the project.\nExhibition\nDuring the exhibit the installation space is considered a traditional lodge space. Visitors to the exhibit are asked not to use cameras or other electronic devices, to remove their shoes, and to be smudged before entering the space. Each visitor is offered a tobacco tie to hold in the left hand, which is closest to the heart, before entering the exhibit area, which is covered in red cloth. Visitors move clockwise through the display area, and are asked to stay on the red cloth, not stepping on or over the vamps. At the end, they return the ties, which are later burned in a sacred fire. Native elders and volunteers are on hand to answer questions, or to hear visitors' impressions after the visit.\nExhibition locations have included:\n2013\n* University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta.
