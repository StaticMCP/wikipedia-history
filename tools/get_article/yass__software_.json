YASS accepts nucleotide sequences in either plain text or the FASTA format and the output format includes the BLAST tabular output. YASS uses several transition-constrained spaced seed k-mers, which allow considerably improved sensitivity. YASS can be used locally on a user's machine, or as SaaS on the [https://bioinfo.univ-lille.fr/yass/yass.php YASS web server], which produces a browser based dot-plot.\nSee also\n*Sequence alignment software\n*PatternHunter\n*BLAST\n*FASTA\n*JAligner\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://bioinfo.univ-lille.fr/yass Official website]"
