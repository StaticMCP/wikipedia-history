Unlike other accolades about the art form, the AFI Awards acknowledge the film and television productions deemed culturally and artistically representative of the year's most significant achievements in the art of the moving image in American cinema.\nMedia that does not fit the AFI's conventional eligibility criteria for the main categories, such as non-American productions as well as other types of media, are given recognition through the AFI Special Award.\n2000\nThe 2000 AFI Awards honored the Top 10 Films of the year.\nTop 10 Films\n* Almost Famous\n* Before Night Falls\n* Best in Show\n* Erin Brockovich\n* Gladiator\n* High Fidelity\n* Requiem for a Dream\n* Traffic\n* Wonder Boys\n* You Can Count on Me\n2001\nThe 2001 AFI Awards honored the best in film and television of the year. The nominations were announced on December 17, 2001, and the ceremony was broadcast on January 5, 2002, on CBS. It did not do well in the ratings (getting only 5.5 million viewers), so it would not be held in this format again. The AFI would go back to just listing the Top 10 Films and Top 10 Television Programs of the year, and not have any technical nor acting categories.\nEach winner is in bold with the other nominees after:\nMovies\n, Director of the Year winner]]\n, Actor of the Year – Male – Movies winner]]\n, Actress of the Year – Female – Movies winner]]\n, Featured Actor of the Year – Male – Movies winner]]\n, Featured Actress of the Year – Female – Movies winner]]\n, Cinematographer of the Year winner]]\n, Screenwriter of the Year winner]]\nMovie of the Year\n* The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n** A Beautiful Mind\n** Black Hawk Down\n** In the Bedroom\n** ''The Man Who Wasn't There\n** Memento\n** Monster's Ball\n** Moulin Rouge!\n** Mulholland Drive\n** Shrek\nDirector of the Year\n* 'Robert Altman – Gosford Park'\n** Todd Field – In the Bedroom\n** David Lynch – Mulholland Drive\n** Ridley Scott – Black Hawk Down\nActor of the Year – Male – Movies\n* 'Denzel Washington as Alonzo Harris – Training Day'\n** Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash Jr. – A Beautiful Mind\n** Billy Bob Thornton as Ed Crane – The Man Who Wasn't There\n** Tom Wilkinson as Matt Fowler – In the Bedroom\nActor of the Year – Female – Movies\n* 'Sissy Spacek as Ruth Fowler – In the Bedroom'\n** Halle Berry as Leticia Musgrove – Monster's Ball\n** Stockard Channing as Julie Styron – The Business of Strangers\n** Naomi Watts as Betty Elms / Diane Selwyn – Mulholland Drive\nFeatured Actor of the Year – Male – Movies\n* 'Gene Hackman as Royal Tenenbaum – The Royal Tenenbaums'\n** Steve Buscemi as Seymour – Ghost World\n** Brian Cox as Big John Harrigan – L.I.E.\n** Tony Shalhoub as Freddy Riedenschneider – The Man Who Wasn't There\nFeatured Actor of the Year – Female – Movies\n* 'Jennifer Connelly as Alicia Nash – A Beautiful Mind'\n** Cate Blanchett as Kate Wheeler – Bandits\n** Cameron Diaz as Julianna \"Julie\" Gianni – Vanilla Sky''\n** Frances O'Connor as Monica Swinton – A.I.
