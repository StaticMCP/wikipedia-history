      "text": "# Indonesia Warriors\n\nThe Indonesia Warriors was an Indonesian professional basketball team that last competed in the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL).\nBased in Jakarta, Indonesia, the Warriors replaced Satria Muda BritAma as Indonesia's representative in ABL.\nOn 19 January 2015, team general manager Rudolph Tulus, the commercial and corporate partnership director of Indonesia Sport Venture, the company that owns and manages the Warriors, announced that management had decided to pull the Warriors out of the 2015–16 ABL season in order to focus on its team (Satria Muda BritAma) in the domestic league. Rudolph Tulus also cited the team's poor results in the 2014 season and its responsibility to its sponsors as contributing factors to the decision. He said that management had not ruled out rejoining the ABL, but he could not be sure when that might be.\nRoster\n| asst_coach =\n*\n*\n| I = y\n| roster_url = http://www.indonesiasportventure.com/indonesiawarriors/team/roster\n| accessdate = 29 December 2013\n}}\nNotable players\n*  Youbel Sondakh\n*  Welyanson Situmorang\n*  Mario Wuysang\n*  Stanley Pringle\n*  Steve Thomas\n*  John Smith\n*  Richard Smith\n*  Chris Daniels\n*  Jerick Canada\n*  Francis Adriano\n*  Ricky Ricafuente\n*  Marlon Legaspi\n*  Nakiea Miller\n*  Achmad Adiyanto\n*  Swen De Ruijter\n*  Amin Prihantono\n*  Christian Ronaldo Sitepu\n*  Ronny Gunawan\n*  Cokorda Raka\n*  J.R.
