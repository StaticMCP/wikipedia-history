Both battles resulted in a Turkish victory.\nThe French also who  constituted the second group of the Crusade of 1101, could not escape the wrath of Sultan Kilij Arslan I. William II, Count of Nevers who arrived in Istanbul in June 1101, moved fast to Ankara and then to Konya. His army suffered Turkish raids on the way. When they arrived the army were terrified by the Turks.\nThe French and Germans who headed east under the command of William II arrived at Istanbul early June 1101, where they headed to Konya through Nicomedia-Nicaea entering Seljuk lands near Aksehir. As Kilij Arslan had heard of their marching, they evacuated cities, including Konya and destroyed the fields and water sources. Kilij Arslan and Gazi Gümüshtigin waited for them to weaken. When they saw the Crusaders running to a river, Kilij Arslan attacked and achieved a Turkish victory.\nReferences\nCitations"
