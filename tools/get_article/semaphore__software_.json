Semaphore also offers Boosters, a feature that reduces the duration of running a test suite to that of the longest test through automatic parallelization of builds for Ruby projects.\nFeatures\nSemaphore supports the following programming languages: C/C++, Clojure, Elixir, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala.\nProjects written in other programming languages demand manual configuration.\nSome of the supported frameworks include: test/unit, RSpec, Cucumber, Steak, Capybara Webkit, Jasmine, Karma, Minitest, Poltergeist, PhantomJS.\nDeployment integrations include AWS, Heroku, Capistrano and Cloud 66.\nSemaphore 2.0 supports iOS and MacOS.\nOperation\nOnce the project and the branch have been selected, Semaphore determines the configuration of the project, by extracting meta information. After customizing and configuring the wanted builds, Semaphore begins testing.\nThe results of the performed jobs are highlighted red (failed) or green (passed). If a test fails, the developer needs to further configure and fix the code until the test is green.\nSee also\n* Continuous integration software\n* Comparison of continuous integration software\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://semaphoreui.com/ Official site]\n* [https://github.com/semaphoreui/semaphore Semaphore on GitHub ]"
