The three actors take refuge in a rural country where they, having the bright idea to recite a sacred drama on the birth of Jesus Christ, have to interpret the three Biblical Magi. The show is so successful and magically the villagers give birth to a son on Christmas Eve for every family, and there the faith in Jesus is regained.\nCast\n*Silvio Orlando: Melchiorre\n*Rolf Zacher:  \"Augusto\"/ Gaspare\n*Patrick Bauchau:   Baldassarre\n*Gastone Moschin: Don Gregorio\n*Laura Betti: Chorus girl\n*Franco Citti: Attore\n*Ninetto Davoli: Comparsa\nCritical reception\nIn Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston (critic) wrote: \"Warm performances from its lead troika and beautiful photography of the Italian countryside help compensate for the film's fairly flimsy nature. ... The humor is low-key but relatively consistent, and the three leads make a good comedy team.\"\nSee also\n* List of Christmas films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
