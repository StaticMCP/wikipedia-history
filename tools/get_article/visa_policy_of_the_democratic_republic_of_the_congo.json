A letter of request is sent via e-mail to the Direction Générale de Migration with a photocopy of the passport of the applicant and the inviting person/organization. A confirmation is sent to the applicant which is then used to obtain a visa on arrival, valid for 7 days and extendable in the DR Congo.\nElectronic visa (e-Visa)\nCitizens of other countries may obtain an e-Visa for up to 7 days. The electronic visa must be used within 3 months from the date of issue.\nIn November 2024 DR Congo authorities announced the introduction of electronic visas for early 2025.\nVirunga National Park\nAs tourism is growing steadily for Virunga National Park, the government has joined forces and allowed the Park to act as a facilitator in the visa process. Local tour operators can act as facilitators in the process.\nVisa required in advance\nVisitors requiring a visa need to submit a legalised letter of invitation from a DR Congo person or organization. For tourists, a hotel booking confirmation is accepted in case the traveller has no contact in the DR Congo .\nSee also\n* Visa requirements for Democratic Republic of the Congo citizens\nReferences"
