He was the first member of the Radical Party to be elected president.\nThe elections took place amid economic turmoil due to the Great Depression and in the aftermath of the toppling of Carlos Ibáñez del Campo's military government.\nElectoral system\nThe election was held using the absolute majority system, under which a candidate had to receive over 50% of the popular vote to be elected. If no candidate received over 50% of the vote, both houses of the National Congress would come together to vote on the two candidates who received the most votes.\nResults\nReferences"
