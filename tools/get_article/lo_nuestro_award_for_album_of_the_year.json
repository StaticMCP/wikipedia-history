The award was established to recognize the quality of recorded vocal or instrumental albums of Latin music. Nominees and winners are selected based on performance on the Billboard Latin music charts and social media polls, winners are selected via online voting. The trophy awarded is in the shape of a treble clef.\nThroughout its history, the Lo Nuestro Awards originally always awarded albums by musical genre, but without any general category. The Album of the Year category was first added in 2016 and has been awarded to date with the exception of 2018 and 2019. The 30th ceremony was held in 2018, and a special program was made instead of voteable categories, while in 2019 it was decided to omit all album categories.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5px;\" |Year\n!Winner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:300px;\" |Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n!2016\n|Hoy Más Fuerte – Gerardo Ortíz\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|-\n!2017\n|Visualízate – Gente de Zona\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|-\n!2020\n|Oasis – J Balvin and Bad Bunny\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|-\n!2021\n|YHLQMDLG – Bad Bunny\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|-\n!2022\n|El Último Tour Del Mundo – Bad Bunny\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|-\n!2023\n|Un Verano Sin Ti – Bad Bunny\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year\n* Billboard Latin Music Award for Top Latin Album of the Year\nReferences\nExternal links"
