His current work is situated at the intersection of paleoclimatology, the history of institutions, and historical change. He is the Principal Investigator of a major National Science Foundation funded project investigating the link between explosive volcanic eruptions, Nile flood behavior, and human responses to climatic change with very broad implications for understanding climatic change across the pre-industrial world. He is currently at work on a major book examining global history since the Neolithic from the viewpoint of paleoclimatology, environmental history and climatic change.\nBefore coming to Yale, Manning taught in the Classics Department for two years at Princeton University. Manning went on to the Classics Department at Stanford University and taught there for 12 years. He was a Solmsen Fellow at the Institute for Research in the Humanities at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1995–1996.
