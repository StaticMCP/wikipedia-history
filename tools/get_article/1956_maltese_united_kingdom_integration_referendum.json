      "text": "# 1956 Maltese United Kingdom integration referendum\n\nA referendum on integration with the United Kingdom was held in Malta on 11 and 12 February 1956. The proposals were approved by 77% of those who voted, on a turnout of 59%; the low turnout was partly because of a boycott by the Nationalist Party. The proposals were never fully implemented, and the country became an independent Realm within the British Commonwealth titled the State of Malta eight years later.\nProposals\nUnder the proposals Malta would have had three seats of its own in the British House of Commons. In addition, the Home Office would take over responsibility for Maltese affairs from the Colonial Office. The UK parliament would have control of defence and foreign affairs, and eventually direct taxation, whereas the Maltese parliament would be responsible for all other areas of public life, including education and the position of the Catholic Church. Under the text of the referendum, agreements would be made with the United Kingdom with the objective of improving wages, employment opportunities and standards of living on the islands to parity with the rest of the UK.\nQuestion\nResults\nAftermath\nDespite the results approving further integration with the UK, the low turnout allowed the opposition to claim that the result was inconclusive. There were also concerns expressed by some British MPs that the representation of Malta at Westminster would set a precedent for other colonies, and influence the outcome of general elections. Malta became an independent Commonwealth Realm on 21 September 1964 and a republic on 13 December 1974; after the expiry of a defence agreement with the United Kingdom, the last British forces left Malta on 31 March 1979, a date now marked as Freedom Day.\nReferences"
