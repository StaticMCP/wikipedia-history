According to that narrative, as death was approaching, Jared2 and his brother gathered together the Jaredite people to ask them what they desired of them before they died. The people requested that they anoint one of their sons as king. This was grievous to them, and the brother of Jared2 remarked that \"surely this thing leadeth into captivity.\" Despite his brother's misgivings, Jared2 pressed him to allow the establishment of a Jaredite kingship, at which request the brother of Jared2 yielded.\nThe people chose Pagag, the firstborn of the brother of Jared2. Pagog refused. The people then wished to force him to be king but the brother of Jared2 would not allow that. They suggested Jared2's sons, Jacom, Gilgah, and Mahah, but each refused to be king. Jared2's youngest son Orihah finally agreed to be king. Thus began the institution of monarchy among the Jaredites.\nIn the following compendium, the terms righteous, wicked, unrighteous, et. al. derive from Welch and Welch designations.\nEarly kings\n# Orihah, first Jaredite king, fourth son of Jared2. Walked humbly, executed righteous judgment. Fathered 31 sons and daughters, including Kib.,\n# Kib, righteous son of Orihah, father of Corihor1, who took him into captivity, and of Shule, who freed him and restored him to his throne.,\n# Corihor1, rebel son of Kib (and brother to Shule), who later repented of his rebellion.
