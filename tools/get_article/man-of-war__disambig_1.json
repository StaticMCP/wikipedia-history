The Cannon Shot, painting by Willem van de Velde the Younger.]]\nIn Royal Navy jargon, a man-of-war (also '''man-o'-war, or simply man') was a powerful warship or frigate which was frequently used in Europe from the 16th to the 19th century. Although the term never acquired a specific meaning, it was usually reserved for a sailing ship armed with cannon. The rating system of the Royal Navy classified men-of-war into six \"rates\", a \"first-rate\" having the greatest armament, and a \"sixth-rate\" the least.\nDescription\nThe man-of-war was developed in Portugal in the early 15th century from earlier roundships with the addition of a second mast to form the carrack. The 16th century saw the carrack evolve into the galleon and then the ship of the line. The evolution of the term has been given thus:\n– Talbot.|Henry Frederic Reddall, Fact, Fancy, and Fable, 1892, p. 340}}\n]]\nThe man-of-war design developed by Sir John Hawkins was a type of galleon which had three masts, each with three to four sails. The ship could be up to 60 metres long and could have up to 124 guns: four at the bow, eight at the stern, and 56 in each broadside. All these cannons required three gun decks to hold them, one more than any earlier ship. It had a maximum sailing speed of eight or nine knots.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160609113535/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/bb/bb_naut.html Nautical References]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10997 Project Gutenberg: The World of Waters'']\n* [http://www.ariannascuola.eu/ilfilodiarianna/it/storia/dinamiche-e-problemi/la-tecnologia-nel-xviii-secolo/la-navigazione-nel-xviii-secolo/211-i-vascelli-da-guerra-nella-seconda-meta-del-700.html#gallery Gallery of photos of men-of-war (Museo delle Navi, Bologna, Italy)]"
