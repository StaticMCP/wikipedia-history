He was responsible for the design of numerous residential, civic, and religious buildings throughout Medway and Kent, often working closely with local builder Charles Edward Skinner.\nBiography\nGeorge Edward Bond (July 1853 – 20 May 1914) was celebrated in his obituary as “the most expert architect this part of Kent has known.” He came to Medway in 1883 to serve as Clerk of Works and foreman for William Callund’s practice, where his first significant assignment was supervising the construction of Bernard’s Palace of Varieties in Chatham. Soon after, he partnered with James Nash to rebuild Sir Joseph Williamson’s Mathematical School on Rochester High Street.\nIn 1886, Bond launched his own practice—George E. Bond Architect and Surveyor—at Victoria Buildings, 384 High Street, Rochester. His inaugural design is thought to have been “Ingleside,” a villa on Chatham’s Maidstone Road that now functions as the Medway Registrar’s Office. He designed several notable public buildings, including Chatham Town Hall (1898–1899), the Medway Conservancy Board offices on Rochester High Street (1909), the Theatre Royal on Chatham High Street (1899), the Baptist Church on Crow Lane, the Liberal Club on Castle Hill, Chatham Free Library, and the Aveling & Porter building on Strood Esplanade. Unfortunately, the Aveling & Porter premises were demolished by Medway Council in 2010. In addition to these, his work encompassed a range of houses, churches, and shopfronts.\nBy 1904, his growing practice warranted the construction of bespoke offices at Pier Chambers on Chatham’s Sun Pier, in which Bond relocated to, where he entered into a partnership with architect Frank T. Goring.\nIn addition to his public commissions, Bond designed numerous private residences, including his own home—St Ronan’s—on King Edward Road, Rochester (built in 1909 and now incorporated into The King’s School). His initials remain visible on the concrete corbels beside the entrance. He frequently worked with builder Charles Edward Skinner—who would later become his son‑in‑law—on projects for local leaders such as W. D. Driver, then Mayor of Chatham.\nA staunch Liberal, Bond chaired the Rochester Liberal Club from 1904, designed the classical Freemasons’ lodge on Manor Road in Chatham in the same year, served as a trustee of the Chatham Savings Bank, and was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1908. From 1909 until 1913 he was President of the Society of Architects.\nBond passed away at St Ronan’s on Wednesday, 20 May 1914, and was interred at St Margaret’s Cemetery on Maidstone Road, Rochester.\nNotable projects\nResidential\n* 69 and 71 Maidstone Road, Chatham – Pair of seven-bedroom semi-detached homes (c. 1900–1902).\n* 124 Maidstone Road, Chatham – Designed between 1900 and 1902.\nCivic and Commercial\n* Sir Joseph Williamson’s Mathematical School, C-Block Extension, Rochester – Designed in 1914; demolished.\n* Chatham Town Hall – New addition to the building in the early 20th century, originally designed by George Edward Bond as a town hall before being converted into a theatre.\n* Chatham Free Library - 221 New Road, Chatham.

Skinner constructed many of Bond’s buildings, including churches, villas, and public buildings. The two were later linked through family as well, when Bond’s daughter Mary married Stanley Skinner, Charles’ son.\nLegacy\nAlthough some of Bond’s buildings have since been demolished or altered, many still survive and continue to shape the architectural fabric of Medway. His designs are characteristic of late Victorian and Edwardian domestic architecture, often incorporating ornate façades, turrets, and thoughtful proportions.\nReferences"
