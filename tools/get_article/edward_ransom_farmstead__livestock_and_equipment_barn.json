It was a -story structure, built in part out of logs and in part out of wood framing.  Its principal form was derived from three log cribs, joined by saddle- and V-notching, a form not seen anywhere else in the county.  It was built about 1915.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.  It has been listed as destroyed by the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas\nReferences"
