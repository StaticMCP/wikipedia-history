Over  of snow fell in South East England, with some locations reporting snowfall at . Ireland was also affected by the cold wave, reporting more than  in some areas.\nUnited Kingdom\ntruck covered in snow]]\nDuring the cold wave, more than  of snow fell in parts of Kent, Essex, London and Surrey, and the North Downs reported more than . Parts of West Cornwall also had heavy falls.  Several towns were cut off due to the heavy snowfall including the Isle of Sheppey which needed airlifts during the height of the storm.\nThis was due to a high pressure system over Siberia that moved into Scandinavia which in turn dragged a strong easterly airflow and brought very cold temperatures across Europe and the United Kingdom.  A low pressure system over Italy caused the airflow to drag the very cold air from Siberia to Western Europe and picked up further moisture from the North Sea which produced the heavy snowfall.  This caused serious disruption of transport in the area including the cancellation of many train services and the closure of many roads and railway lines.  Motoring organisations had to deal with more than 4000 car breakdowns and 500 schools were forced to close.  The extreme cold even affected the chiming hammer of Big Ben and at Southend-on-Sea the sea froze over.\nThe cold spell lasted from the 7th to the 20th of January, with temperatures remaining well below freezing on many days. On the 12th, maximum temperatures were between  and  over much of England, with  the daily maximum at Warlingham.  The lowest overnight temperature of  was recorded at Caldecott, Rutland, making it the coldest recorded temperature in the East Midlands.\nIreland\nIn Ireland, the amount of snowfall was far less pronounced, but had a similar weather pattern to the United Kingdom. The amount of snowfall was greater in areas further inland than coastal areas. Around  of snow was recorded in the Irish Midlands and the East of Ireland, with some places recording snowfall as high as  in the east.\nAt Roche's Point Lighthouse, Cork Harbour,  of snow was reported, and is the highest depth of snow since snow observations began at this location in 1961. As well as the snow record, the temperature dropped down to  on 13 January, and is the coldest temperature recorded at Roche's Point since record observations began in 1867. It's also likely that this figure marks the coldest temperature during the cold wave.\nSee also\n* Winter of 1990–91 in Western Europe\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
