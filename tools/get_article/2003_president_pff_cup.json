It ran from 18 September till 5 October 2003, and was held in Quetta.\nThe tournament was initially scheduled to feature 17 teams, a reduction from the traditional 24. Two days before the event began, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) was added by newly elected Pakistan Football Federation secretary Arshad Khan Lodhi. This late inclusion led to a significant reshuffling of the original 16-team draw and group allocations. However, only 15 teams ultimately participated, as both HEC and the City District Government Karachi (CDGK) withdrew before playing any matches.\nPTCL won the title on coin toss after a draw against Karachi Port Trust, no penalty shoot-out was held because the chief guest, the governor of Balochistan, could not wait.\nGroup stage\nPool A\nPool B\nPool C\nPool D\nKnockout round\nQuarter finals\nLal Bakhsh\n| goals2 = Abdul Qayyum\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet = 2–1\n}}\n| goals2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet =\n}}\n----\n| goals2 =\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet =\n}}\nSemi finals\nAkhtar Majeed\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet =\n}}\n----\n| stadium =\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet =\n}}\nFinals\n| goals2 = Hameed\n| stadium = Sadiq Shaheed Stadium\n| attendance =\n| referee = Nazeer Ahmed\n| event =\n| round =\n| score1 =\n| score2 =\n| aet =\n| location = Quetta\n}}\nStatistics\nTop goalscorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Rank\n!Player\n!Team\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |1\n| align=\"left\" |Lal Bakhsh\n| align=\"left\" |Karachi Port Trust\n| rowspan=\"3\" |5\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Muhammad Essa\n| align=\"left\" |PTCL\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Muhammad Nawaz\n| align=\"left\" |Pakistan Police\n|-\n|2\n| align=\"left\" |Fareed Majeed\n| align=\"left\" |Karachi Port Trust\n|4\n|}\nReferences"
