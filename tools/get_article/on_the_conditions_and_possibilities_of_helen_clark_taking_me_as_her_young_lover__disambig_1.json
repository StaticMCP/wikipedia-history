It centres on the author's belief that Helen Clark, then Prime Minister of New Zealand, would find personal and political rejuvenation if she was to take on a younger lover, and that the ideal person to be that lover is Meros. The author contends that Helen Clark is a woman of intellectual pursuits and that:\n\"her surroundings of subordinates ... probably leaves her with unfulfilled desires for a situation where roles are reversed and she can become the double-double agent of gender deconstructions.\"\nIt covers such subjects as Rogernomics and a bus strike. The book also contains detailed descriptions of flesh and bodily fluids.\nThe first edition was published by Lawrence and Gibson had a print-run of only 50 copies, but further editions were subsequently released. As of January 2008 the author claimed that only 16 copies had been sold, but in August of that year, after the success of the play, stated that over 400 had been sold.Promotional image.\nCritical reception\nThe Guardian described the book as a treatise of \"sociology, psychoanalysis and cringe-making erotica\".\nStage adaptation\nThe book was adapted for stage by actor Arthur Meek and director Geoff Pinfield, and premiered at Wellington's BATS Theatre in early 2008. In the play Meek portrays Meros giving a PowerPoint presentation lecture tour, narrating why Helen Clark needs a young lover, bringing the issue to the Prime Minister's attention, and impressing her intellect:\n\"She is a very rational woman. It would take more than chocolates or flowers to woo her. The show is designed to appeal to that rationality\"\nHe critiques individualist liberalism and imagines being taken by Clark to a secret \"pleasure dome\" and bolsters his argument with Kantian theory. The play was well received critically and described as \"slightly disturbing, but highly entertaining... sharp political satire\". The play is said to have been seen by staffers of Helen Clark, and recommended by her husband Peter Davis. After a successful first season the play toured New Zealand, and returned to Wellington's Downstage Theatre for a second season.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz Lawrence and Gibson Publishing Collective] - book details\n*''[https://fightingtalk.blogspot.com/2005/05/hamish-mckenzie-outraged-london.html Outrageous new book imagines PM's love-life] (Press release for the book)\n*[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0801/S00026.htm THCAPOHCTMAHYL - The Play Arrives At Bats]'' - BATS Theatre description of the play."
