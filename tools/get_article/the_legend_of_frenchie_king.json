A new family arrives, calling themselves the Millers, but in fact they are the daughters of the hanged outlaw Frenchie King. His eldest daughter Louise seeks to keep her father's name alive by donning men's clothing and continuing his criminal ways. Louise and Marie fight, but when they are jailed, they team up to take revenge on the town's men.\nCast\n* Claudia Cardinale as Marie Sarrazin\n* Brigitte Bardot as Louise a.k.a.

It was also Cardinale's third Western, after The Professionals and Once Upon a Time in the West.\nPaul Wheeler says he was approached by Michael Deeley to write a buddy Western for Brigitte Bardot. He was paid £1,000 to do the job in two days. Wheeler says this film was not made.\nAt one stage the film was called Love on Horseback. Filming took place in Spain near Madrid amd started in June 1971.\nFinance was partly provided by Hemdale.\nGuy Casaril started directing the movie but quit and was replaced during the shoot by Christian-Jaque. Christian Jaque said \"‘I think it’s a lively and eventful story that does justice to the talents of its heroines. It’s a more a satire than a parody. Zany but not exaggerated . . . with all the trappings of the Western, Sheriff, Indians, saloon, chases and fights. Brigitte was very brave because she hates physical pain. Claudia is a real tomboy—up in the mornings early to ride and shoot.\"\nThe director found it \"enormously satisfying working with\" Michael J Pollard. \"He does so much with a character that might have been quite ordinary. To me, he is as important as the two women.\"\nRelease\nThe premiere of Les Pétroleuses was on 17 December 1971 at the Balzac cinema in Paris.\nReception\nBox office\nThe film grossed £250,000 in three weeks in France.\nCritical response\nThe film received generally negative reviews. Bardot's performance in particular was criticised by Jean Loup Passek, who noted how uncomfortable she seemed in the film's outdoors action setting. Writing in Variety Gene Moskowitz dismissed the film as \"predictable, naïve and gauche\" whilst Tom Milne called it \"drearily unfunny\".\nFilmink argued Claudia Cardinale \"suited the genre\" of Westerns \"it’s a shame she didn’t make more.\"\nSee also\n*List of Spaghetti Western films\n*1971 in film\nNotes\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
