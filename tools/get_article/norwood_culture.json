It is widely accepted that Archaic cultures began using hand held spears to atlatls to more effectively bring down animals for clothing and consumption.\nThe Norwood culture was one of the first in North America to make pottery. The pottery was tempered with Spanish moss or strands of fiber from the palmetto, and decorated by making stick impressions on its outer surface prior to firing. Much of the Gulf coastal shell middens date to this Archaic period. Some sites have been covered by rising sea level, while other sites have been destroyed by modern borrowing activities and development.\nSources"
