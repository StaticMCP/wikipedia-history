The whole council was up for election and the Labour Party stayed in overall control of the council.\nBackground\nIn the years between this election and the last there were 2 by-elections to replace councillor who either resigned or died, however none of these elections resulted in the seats changing parties.\nThe election saw the Conservative Party only put up five candidates in the election, and they failed to win any seats on the council. The Labour leader of the council, George Brooker, stood down at the election after 51 years. He opposed the Greater London Authority referendum that took place at the same time as the election, however Barking and Dagenham saw 73.49% vote in favour and 26.51% against. Overall turnout in the election was 25.41%.\nShortly before the election a single Labour seat became vacant and there was not enough time to hold a by-election to replace them, meaning that the composition of the council just before the elections was as follows:\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:; width:90.19607843137255%;\" |46\n| style=\"background:; width:1.96078431372549%;\" |1\n| style=\"background:; width=5.882352941176471%\"|3\n| style=\"background:; width:1.96078431372549%;\" |1\n|-\n||Labour}}\n||Lib Dem}}\n||Resident}}\n||Vacant}}\n|}\nElection result\n}}\n|seats %    = 92.16\n|votes %    = 72.40\n|votes      =44,885\n|plus/minus =  0.95\n|government=yes}}\n|seats %=5.88|votes %=7.34|votes=4,550|plus/minus= 3.43}}\n|seats %    = 1.96\n|votes %    = 18.42\n|votes      =11,424\n|plus/minus =  1.03\n}}|seats %=0.00|votes %=1.84|votes=1,140|plus/minus= 2.06}}After the election the composition of the council was as follows:\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:; width:92.15686274509804%;\" |47\n| style=\"background:; width:1.96078431372549%;\" |1\n| style=\"background:; width=5.882352941176471%\"|3\n|-\n||Labour}}\n||Lib Dem}}\n||Resident}}\n|}\nWard results\n(*) - Indicates an incumbent candidate\n(†) - Indicates an incumbent candidate standing in a different ward\nAbbey\n10.58}}\n}}\n16.50}}}}\n258}}\n12.41}}}} 1.66}}\nAlibon\n12.87}}\n}}\n0.66}}\n117}}\n12.81}}}} 0.02}}\nBecontree\n7.45\n}}\n7.45}}\n7}} 14.17}}}} 0.34}}\nCambell\n3.94\n}}\n3.94}}\n224}}\n14.94}}}} 0.29}}\nChadwell Heath\n13.74}}\n}}\n10.72}}}}\n3.14}}\n97}}\n8.91}} 0.38}}\nEastbrook\n11.54}}\n}}\n|votes      = 1,089\n|percentage =\n|change     =\n}}\n11.54}}}}\n286}}\n9.96}}\n1.13}}\nEastbury\n0.86\n}}\n0.86\n}}\n185}}\n16.07}}}} 0.46}}\nFanshawe\n9.93\n}}\n9.93}}\n214}}\n12.71}}}} 0.47}}\nGascoigne\n16.42}}\n}}\n16.42}}}}\n504}}\n11.06}}}} 1.33}}\nGoresbrook\n16.88}}\n}}\n16.88}}}}\n99}}\n13.83}}}} 0.03}}\nHeath\n21.92}}\n}}\n4.98}}\n209}}\n13.13}}}} 0.53}}\nLongbridge\n7.01\n}}\n19.55}}}}\n19}}\n15.16}}}} 2.09}}\nManor\n|votes      = 803\n|percentage = 76.95\n|change     =  4.78\n}}\n4.78}}\n60}}\n15.33}}}} 0.37}}\nMarks Gate\n0.62\n}}\n0.62}}\n41}}\n12.33}}}} 0.92}}\nParsloes\n27.85}}\n}}\n|votes      = 700\n|percentage =\n|change     =\n}}\n9.93}}\n224}}\n15.34}}}} 0.08}}\nRiver\n6.20\n}}\n6.20}}\n74}}\n12.92}}}} 0.19}}\nThames\n4.64\n}}\n4.69}}}}\n158}}\n16.32}}}} 0.37}}\nTriptons\n5.18\n}}\n5.18}}\n214}}\n12.06}}}} 0.03}}\nValence\n7.81\n}}\n7.81}}\n204}}\n16.17}}}} 0.55}}\nVillage\n9.65\n}}\n8.17}}\n1.48}}\n32}} 13.41}}}} 0.01}}\nNotes\nReferences"
