The Paraguayan defenders, who were poorly armed and included children, fought the attacks of the Allied forces, led by French-born Brazilian general prince Gaston of Orleans, the Count of Eu, son-in-law of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. The town refused two peace envoys calling for surrender, sent by the Count of Eu. At 04:00, the Brazilian batteries surrounding the town started a bombardment which lasted until 08:00, when the infantry charged. General João Manuel Mena Barreto was mortally wounded leading a cavalry charge against the Paraguayans.\nThe battle lasted for five hours, with the Allies, who had overwhelming numerical advantage, capturing the town. The town's hospital was burned and official documents were lost in the resulting fire.\nGallery\nFile:Esboço Memorial da Praça de Piribebuy.
