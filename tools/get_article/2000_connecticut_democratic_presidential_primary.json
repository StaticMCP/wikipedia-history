The Connecticut primary is a closed primary, with the state awarding 67 delegates, of which 54 are pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the results of the primary.\nVice president Al Gore won the primary with 55% of the vote, winning 30 delegates, while senator Bill Bradley caught a relevant amount of delegates one of the last times in the primary cycle, receiving 41% and 24 delegates, while the Uncommitted ballot option took the remaining 3% of the vote. Lyndon LaRouche, Jr. was again not on the ballot in this contest, making it one of the few contests during the primaries that he did not have ballot access, and made Connecticut the only other Super Tuesday contest that LaRouche did not make the ballot for, the other being Georgia.\nProcedure\nConnecticut was one of 15 states and one territory holding primaries on March 7, 2000, also known as \"Super Tuesday\".\nVoting was expected to take place throughout the state from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. In the closed primary, candidates must meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 54 pledged delegates to the 2000 Democratic National Convention will be allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of the 54 pledged delegates, between 5 and 7 are allocated to each of the state's 5 congressional districts, and another 12 are allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 7 at-large pledged delegates.\nThe state party committee met to vote on the 7 pledged at-large and 12 PLEO delegates to send to the Democratic National Convention. The 54 pledged delegates Connecticut sends to the national convention were to be joined by 12 unpledged PLEO delegates: 6 members of the Democratic National Committee, 6 members of Congress (both Senators, Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman, and 4 Representatives, John Larson, Sam Gejdenson, Rosa DeLauro, and Jim Maloney), 1 distinguished party leader, and 1 add-on.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates appeared on the ballot:\n*Al Gore\n*Bill Bradley\nThere was also an uncommitted option.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em;\" | 2000 Connecticut Democratic presidential primary\n!
