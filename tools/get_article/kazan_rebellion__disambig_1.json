It aimed to restore the Kazan Khanate, which the Russians had conquered in October 1552.\nThe rebel armies mostly consisted of Tatars, Chuvash, Cheremises, Mordvins, and Udmurts. Some Nogais were also involved in the war. Independent rebel governments formed among the Chalem and in Mishatamaq. The khan of the Nogai Horde, Ğäli Äkräm, was invited to head the renewed khanate because Mameshbirde, leader of the rebellion, was not a descendant of Genghis Khan. Russian troops under Andrey Kurbsky and Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky opposed the \"rebels\".\nAt the peak of the rebellion, Tatars controlled the greater part of the former khanate. However, the city of Kazan, the former capital, remained under Russian control. Ivan IV sent major reinforcements to the Kazan area and suppressed the uprising.
