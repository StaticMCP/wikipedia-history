It preserved such status up until Javier de Burgos' provincial division of Spain in 1833. This was a \"kingdom\" (\"reino\") in the second sense given by the Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española: the Crown of Castile consisted of several such kingdoms. Its extent is detailed in Respuestas Generales del Catastro de Ensenada (1750–54), which was part of the documentation of a census. Falling largely within the present-day Region of Murcia, it also included parts of the province of Albacete, the municipalities of Villena and Sax in the province of Alicante, and some localities in the province of Jaén.\nLike the other kingdoms within Spain, the Kingdom of Murcia was abolished by the 1833 territorial division of Spain.\nThe title \"King of Murcia\" was used by the monarchs of the Crown of Castile and today constitutes one of the historical titles of the Spanish Crown.\nSee also\n* Murcian nationalism\nReferences"
