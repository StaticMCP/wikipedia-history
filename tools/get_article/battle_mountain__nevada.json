The population was 3,705 at the 2020 census. Its primary economic base is gold mining and, to a lesser extent, legalized gambling.\nThe town is located on Interstate 80 between Winnemucca and Elko.\nHistory\nThe Battle Mountain area was home to the Northern Paiute and Shoshone peoples. The area was noted by fur trappers in the 1820s and '30s. It served as a waypoint for westward-bound travel on the Emigrant Trail along the Humboldt River by 1845. According to local legend, the name stems from confrontations between Native Americans and early settlers during the 1850s.\nWhen copper ore was discovered and mining began in 1866, the Central Pacific Railroad started a station in Argenta to support the mining activity. In 1868, the railroad established the Reese River siding in Battle Mountain to support it, but in 1870, the railroad moved the Argenta station to Battle Mountain and established a townsite to serve the Battle Mountain copper and gold mining district. Two railroads headquartered there starting in 1890: the Central Nevada Railway and the Battle Mountain and Lewis Railroad.  As of 2009, the  railway is still in use.\nIn 1874, the Nevada Legislature overrode the governor's veto and approved a railroad from Austin to Battle Mountain.  The Nevada Central Railroad from Battle Mountain to Austin was completed in 1880. The rail line was constructed to connect the silver mines around Austin to the Central Pacific line at Battle Mountain. The rail line served the Austin area until it was abandoned in 1938.\nUlysses S. Grant spoke in the town in 1879 during his western speaking tour.\nPresident Woodrow Wilson established Battle Mountain Indian Colony by executive order in 1918. In 1919, Nevada's Red Scare Miners held a ten-day strike at the Battle Mountain Copper Mines.\nOn May 15, 1979, the voters of Lander County approved the move of the county seat from Austin to Battle Mountain in a special election. In a subsequent ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed this decision.\nChiefs Frank Temoke and Frank Brady refused the government's offer of a payoff under the 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley at Battle Mountain on December 11, 1992.\nThe 2008 Wells, Nevada, earthquake of 6.3 magnitude that affected the northeastern part of the state severely damaged one of the city's oldest historical buildings, the Lemaire Building, which was condemned.\nGeography\nBattle Mountain is located at the confluence of two rivers, the Humboldt and the Reese. The town is in the Humboldt valley between the Shoshone Range to the southeast, the Battle Mountains to the southwest and the Sheep Creek Range across the Humboldt to the north.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , all land.\nGeology\nCopper mining started in 1866 and the Copper Canyon Mine operated from 1917 until 1955.  The Tomboy-Minnie ore deposits were developed after the depletion of the West ore body, which was developed after the depletion of the East ore body.  Open-pit mining started in 1967.  Placer gold was discovered in 1912.  Mining switched from the copper-gold-silver ores to gold-silver ores in 1979.  The Fortitude gold-silver skarn body was discovered in 1981.  The Surprise gold deposit was discovered in 1986.\nThe economic geologic zone is primarily in the Antler Sequence, consisting of the Middle Pennsylvanian Battle Formation, the Pennsylvanian to Permian Antler Peak Limestone, and the Permian Edna Mountain Formation.  These Paleozoic rocks were intruded in the Tertiary by a granodiorite porphyry which generated the ore bodies as zones of disseminated sulfide minerals.  These zones include copper-gold-silver next to the granodiorite, followed by a gold-silver zone, then a lead-zinc-silver zone.\nFile:Battle Mtn Au & Cu mines.jpg|Gold and copper mines in the Battle Mountain Mining District.
