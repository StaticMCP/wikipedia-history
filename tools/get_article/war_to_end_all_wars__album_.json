While on tour for this album, singer Mark Boals left the band and was replaced for a brief period by Jørn Lande; however, Boals returned to finish the tour. The instrumental song \"Molto Arpeggiosa\" is often mislabelled as \"Arpeggios from Hell\". The phrase \"the war to end all wars\" was historically used as a description of World War I, especially in the period from 1918 to 1939.\nTrack listing\nBonus tracks (Japan)\nBonus track (USA and Europe)\nPersonnel\n*Yngwie J.
