He then went up to New College, Oxford, where he played cricket for Oxford University Cricket Club for three seasons from 1928 to 1930 (captain in 1930), and then intermittently for amateur sides such as the Free Foresters.\nKingsley was a right-handed batsman. He played Minor Counties cricket for Dorset in 1927 and thereafter to 1948 for Hertfordshire.\nIn 1930 Kingsley became assistant to Sir Clive Burn, Secretary and Keeper of the Records of the Duchy of Cornwall; he succeeded Burn in that post in 1954 and served until 1972.\nHe had been an army cadet at Winchester and subsequently joined the Territorial Army; during World War II he served in the Queen’s Royal Regiment in Belgium and Germany.\nKingsley was appointed CVO in the New Year Honours of 1950 and knighted KCVO in 1962.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/16049.html Patrick Kingsley] at ESPNcricinfo\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/30/30792/30792.html Patrick Kingsley] at CricketArchive"
