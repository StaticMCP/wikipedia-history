It was the result of a merger of Intervention Communiste and the Union Révolutionaire Communistes de France (URCF).\nHistory\nInitially in 1991, the Coordination Communiste pour la Continuité Révolutionnaire et la Renaissance Léniniste du PCF (CC) was established as an internal faction of the Parti Communiste Français (PCF) by the party's orthodox Marxists-Leninists members. In 1994, its press organ named Intervention Communiste (IC) was launched. At the faction's 4th national conference, a minority group led by Georges Gastaud split and established the Coordination des Militants Communistes du PCF pour sa Continuité Révolutionnaire et sa Renaissance Léniniste (CMC) staying in the PCF, which would eventually become the Pôle de renaissance communiste en France (PRCF).\nThe majority left the PCF and established the ''Coordination Communiste pour la Reconstruction d'un Parti Communiste Révolutionnaire (CC) led by Jean-Luc Sallé and Maurice Cukierman, which would eventually form the Union Révolutionaire Communistes de France''  in 2004.\nMaurice Cukierman died on 24 July 2020.  On 29 August the central committee unanimously elected Pierre Komorov (PK) as the new secretary-general, and Emmanuelle Kraemer as deputy secretary-general.\nIdeology\nThe PCRF is an anti-revisionist communist party and upholds the legacy of the Soviet Union as a socialist country until the Perestroika period during Mikhail Gorbachev’s leadership. It considers the policy initiated by Nikita Khrushchev’s leadership as degenerative and a step back from a socialist system to a capitalist one, a process which continued until Mikhail Gorbachev’s leadership, during which the capitalist regime was restored after the 1985-1991 counter-revolution. The PCRF recognizes the states of Cuba and the DPRK as the only examples of countries that build socialism at the moment, however, the party is not supportive of China,  which it views as an emerging imperialist power.\nThe PCRF supports self-determination of Kanaky and Corsica.\nElection results\nThe PCRF participated in the 2017 election for the National Assembly, fielding candidates in two constituencies.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Constituency\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|Aude's 3rd\n|Michel Martin\n|144\n|0,30%\n|-\n|Hauts-de-Seine's 13th\n|Maurice Cukierman\n|115\n|0,22%\n|}\nIn 2022 the party fielded candidates in four constituencies:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|Aude's 3rd\n|Michel Martin\n|131\n|0,27%\n|-\n|Eure-et-Loir 2nd\n|Emmanuelle Kraemer\n|34\n|0,11%\n|-\n|Ille-et-Vilaine 4th\n|Christian Lohyn\n|156\n|0,33%\n|-\n|Seine-Saint-Denis 2nd\n|Jean-Christophe Brossard\n|151\n|0,86%\n|}\nSee also\n* French Communist Party\n* Communist Revolutionary Party (France)\n* Pole of Communist Revival in France\n* Workers' Communist Party of France\n* List of anti-revisionist groups\nReferences\nExternal links"
