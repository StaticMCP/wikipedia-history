Of particular concern is degradation caused by backscatter of positive ions, to combat which the photomultipliers are coated using atomic layer deposition.\nThey are expected to withstand 3×1015 neq/cm2 per 100 fb−1. Earlier designs for ToF called QUARTIC (\"QUARtz TIming Cherenkov\") were based on straight quartz bars. Originally, an alternative system named GASTOV was considered, which used a gas rather than quartz to generate the Cherenkov radiation recorded by the photomultiplier.\nThe silicon pixel sensors are positioned 2mm to 3mm from the beam.\nThe construction of the pixel sensors is complicated by the uneven radiation doses that they receive over the course of their operating lifetimes.\nTo harden them against this radiation their manufacture is more complex than that of a simple planar arrangement.\nTheir operating temperature also affects performance, and they are operated at a temperature of &minus;20&nbsp;°C with primary (Vortex Tube) and secondary (a vacuum kept between 5mbar and 30mbar) cooling systems.\nThe vacuum system has a useful side-effect of reducing the mechanical stress caused by atmospheric pressure on the Roman pots, which have thin windows and floors.\nOperating at 40&nbsp;MHz an FE-I4B integrated circuit (IC) chip is DC coupled to the sensors themselves, providing multiple readout channels that can be independently amplified and shaped, and that have independently adjustable discriminator levels.\nThe chip, running off an externally supplied clock, provides 4-bit timing data for the time-over-threshold which is stored alongside the firing time.\nThe sensors themselves are 336×80 pixels, with each pixel being 50×250μm2 on their faces and 230μm deep.\nThis design is modelled off a 3-D sensor design that was made for the IBL by CNM (of Trento) and FBK (of Barcelona).\nAn initial deficiency of the design was that it had a comparatively large (roughly 15000μm) dead area on the part of the sensor closest to the beam.\nThis was ameliorated, reducing the dead area to approximately 200μm, by employing a cut by a diamond saw to \"dice\" the sensor.\nTests were carried out in 2016 to determine the efficiency of this design; and the results showed an efficiency of 97%, potentially rising by 1% because the actual sensor arrangement could use a small incident angle whereas the testbed was placed perpendicular to the incident radiation.\nThis angle is the mean Cherenkov angle, 14°, found to be the optimum angle giving a resolution of 6μm instead of the 50/μm that a perpendicular orientation gives.\nThere are several parts of the LHC that affect the refraction of the emitted protons, including the beam separation dipole magnets, the beam focusing quadrupole magnets, and the beam collimators that protect the magnets.\nThe divergence of the detected protons from the main proton beam depends from the energy loss of the collision, and the AFP detectors by the nature of their positions can only detect protons with energy losses in the range from 2% to 10% of the energy of the original beam.\nThe resolutions of the time-of-flight detectors were measured in tests in 2015 to be between  and  per LQbar.\nCross-references\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  |title=FP420 R&D Project |url=http://www.fp420.com/ |access-date=2010-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727213454/http://www.fp420.com/ |archive-date=2009-07-27}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
