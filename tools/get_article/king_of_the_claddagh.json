A new king was chosen on St. John's Day, 23 June. It is now an honorary role.\nMayors and kings\nElections of Mayors of the Claddagh are noted in 1812 and 1837. One possible mayor in the 1830s was Denis King. Only in 1846 are the names of the mayor, Bartley\tHynes, and the runner-up and deputy, Owen Jones, recorded. Hynes died on 27 April 1849 and was succeeded by Jones.\nThe first recorded King of the Claddagh was the Rev Thomas Folan, who died in 1887. Padge King and Eoin Concannon were his successors, and regarded as the last actual kings when Concannon died in 1954. Ceremonial 'kings' since then have been Martin Oliver, Patrick Ladeen Curran, and Mike Lynskey.\nMartin Oliver, for example, held the title from the early 1960s until 1972, and represented the community at events such as the Oyster Festival. Oliver was a descendant of 19th century mariner Martin Oliver and owned the Galway hooker Truelight.\nSee also\n* Mayor of Galway\nReferences"
