The culture filtrate contained the toxic lipopolysaccharide endotoxins from Salmonella typhi.\nFour years before Shwartzman published his paper, a controversial Italian researcher named Giuseppe Sanarelli described a similar phenomenon using culture filtrates from Vibrio cholerae.\nDescription\nIn the experiment by Shwartzman, the phenomenon begins with a \"priming\" event. The initial injury (e.g. injection) of the skin is combined with the introduction of strong antigens (e.g. endotoxins like lipopolysaccharide in the bacterial filtrate) inititate the innate immune response. Stimulated by the toxins, macrophages release cytokines both mast and defensive white blood cells rush to the injection site  to fend off bacterial invaders.\nThe second dose of this \"two-hit\" model is another injection of toxin, but this time delivered intravenously and known as the \"provocative\" dose. This must be timed within a narrow window between 2 and 36 hours after the priming dose. The timing is to coincide with presence of the activated white blood cells in the tissue at the site of the priming dose.\nThe massive neutrophil infiltration at the priming injection site releases the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1, TNF, IFN-γ, and IL-15. Complement is activated and a deposition of fibrin and platelets within the lumen of the capillaries leads to coagulation and obstruction of the capillaries at the site of the priming injection. This culminates in a lack of oxygen which in turn causes necrosis of the surrounding tissue. The skin at the injection site turns blue and then purple as the necrosis progresses.\nThe phenomenon can be local (as in the experiment) or generalized (if both doses are given intravenously). The generalized Shwartzman reaction serves as an experimental model for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\nAssociated Conditions\nThe disease conditions the Shwartzman phenomenon provides a model for understanding include:\n*Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)\n*Meningococcemia\n*Purpura fulminans\n*Septic shock\n*Septic abortion / Septicemia after abortion\n*Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)\n*Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome\nReferences\nExternal links"
