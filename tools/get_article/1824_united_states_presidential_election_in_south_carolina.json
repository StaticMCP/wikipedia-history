The state legislature chose 11 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nSouth Carolina cast 11 eleven electoral votes for Andrew Jackson. These electors were elected by the South Carolina General Assembly, the state legislature, rather than by popular vote.\nOpinion poll\nWhile presidential electors were selected by the legislature, polls were occasionally held to gauge popular opinion. However, these polls had little impact on the outcome of the legislative election.
