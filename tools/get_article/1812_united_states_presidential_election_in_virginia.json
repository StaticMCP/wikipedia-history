Voters chose 25 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nVirginia voted for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent president, James Madison. Madison won Virginia, his home state, by a margin of 46.2%.\nThe race in the state was noteworthy for a dispute within the Federalist Party, who had formed an unofficial pact to support rebel Democratic-Republican candidate DeWitt Clinton nationwide, while putting up Federalist candidate Jared Ingersoll as Clinton's running-mate. The Virginia state Federalist Party rejected this pact, however, and instead nominated Rufus King, the party's vice-presidential candidate in the two previous elections, for president, while nominating William Richardson Davie as King's running-mate. Despite the state's substantial number of presidential electors and the closeness of the race nationally, the dispute did not have a major impact on the election's outcome, as Madison was never considered likely to lose his home state.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Virginia\nReferences"
