The song was licensed without the band's knowledge or permission. The licensing was handled by Darla, the California-based record label that had reissued the album Old Traditions, New Standards. Needless to say, the band was upset when they learned of the commercial, and a dispute between Tullycraft and Darla ensued.\nReferences\n* Strong, M. C. (2003).
