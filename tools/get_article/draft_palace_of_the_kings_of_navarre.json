After the Conquest of Navarre in the 16th century, it became the residence of the Viceroys. Later, it housed the Captaincy General for thirty years, followed by the Military Government until 1971. After a long period of abandonment during the last quarter of the 20th century, it was renovated in 2003 by Rafael Moneo to become the Royal and General Archive of Navarre.\nDesignations\nIt has had several names throughout history; therefore, a timeline of these designations is presented below:\n* From 1189 to 1841: Royal Palace of San Pedro, Royal and Episcopal Palace of San Pedro, Royal Palace. The name “San Pedro” comes from the church that once stood on the site (where the Church of San Fermín de Aldapa is now located).\n* From 1841 to 1872: Palace of the Captaincy General.\n* From 1876 to 1971: Military Government.\n* The building was abandoned—remaining under the control of the Army until 1979, and later becoming property of the Pamplona City Council and the Government of Navarre.\n* Since 2003: Royal and General Archive of Navarre.\nHistory\nMedieval period\nOn this land, located on a hill in the Navarrería area of the city, there was a prohibition by Alfonso the Battler against building in the area, in order to protect the borough of San Cernin below, which was separated from it by a ravine. In 1189, Sancho VI the Wise \"granted Navarrería the privilege of repopulation,\" receiving in return a gesture from the residents who, \"with the Church’s permission, gave him that plot of land so he could establish his residence.\" Thus, this king revoked Alfonso’s decision and, in agreement with the bishop—who held lordship over Pamplona until 1319—authorized the use of the space for the construction of a royal palace. The palace was built in a proto-Gothic style and was initially named the “Palace of San Pedro.” It included a chapel, granary, and wine cellar.\nThis palace was mortgaged in 1198 by King Sancho VII to the then Bishop of Pamplona, García Ferrández, which led to numerous legal disputes. As a result, it was used jointly by the Crown and the Episcopal See. Thus, when Theobald I arrived in Pamplona in 1246, he found the palace occupied by Bishop Pedro Ramírez de Piédrola and had to stay in the “old palaces,” located next to the Chapel of Jesus Christ beside the cathedral cloister.\nThis situation sparked tensions between the two powers, both vying for control of the palace. Theobald I accused Bishop Pedro Jiménez de Gazólaz of treason, and in response, the bishop excommunicated him. The king had to flee to Navardún, a town under the Crown of Aragon, to avoid reprisals, where he remained for three years. He later had to appeal to Rome to have the excommunication lifted. Although Bishop Gazólaz returned the palace to Theobald II, Pope Alexander IV annulled the restitution, and the dispute continued.\nIn 1276, during the War of the Navarrería, the palace suffered significant damage, as the inhabitants of the Navarrería had launched attacks with catapults against the borough of San Cernin from its esplanade.\nPope Martin V ordered that the Royal Palace of San Pedro be handed over to Blanca I of Navarre, and from then on, it was occupied by the Kings of Navarre until its conquest.\nModern period\nAfter the annexation of Navarre, it became the residence of the Spanish viceroys, apparently starting in 1539. In 1590, there was another attempt by the bishop of Pamplona, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, a Castilian, to claim the palace, filing a lawsuit against the Spanish Crown, but he failed.\nThe kings of Spain also stayed there when visiting the city. For example, Philip II did so in 1592, and according to some accounts, he removed the episcopal coat of arms from the entrance and replaced it with the royal coat of arms that had been in the old castle, which is the one that has remained until now.\nIn 1646, Philip IV visited Pamplona and stayed here. Philip V was there in 1706. The building’s structure was affected by explosions at the gunpowder mill, located near the current Puente del Vergel, which occurred in 1675 and 1733. Both blasts caused numerous and considerable damages to buildings throughout the city, including this old palace, which was repaired “without regard to aesthetic criteria.”\nJosé Bonaparte, during his retreat to France, also spent the night in the palace.\nContemporary period\nWith the abolition of the viceroyalty in 1840, the palace became the military residence of the captains general until 1893, and of the military governors until 1971. For this reason, Emilio Mola—one of the key figures in the events of 1936 that led to the overthrow of the Second Republic and the failed coup that sparked the Spanish Civil War—was housed in this palace as military governor from February 1936. This function led to the building being known as the Palace of the Captaincy or Military Government, historical names that the building has also held.\nIn 1976, while abandoned, it was declared a Provincial Historic-Artistic Monument. While studies were being carried out to plan its restoration, the building was repeatedly targeted by arsonists. The fires began in May 1978, occurring almost monthly, and reached a peak in October 1983, when firefighters had to respond on 12 occasions over a span of fifteen days.\nIn September 1987, architects Manuel Iñíguez and Alberto Uztárroz submitted a preliminary design, commissioned by the Government of Navarre, which proposed preserving the entire building as the Museum of the History of Navarre. Later, in 1993, it was decided to repurpose the building as the Historical Archive of Navarre. To this end, architect Rafael Moneo was contacted to develop the final project. Construction began in 1994, and part of the building was demolished—something that had not been included in the initial proposal. Additionally, a newly built annex tower was erected to house the archive.\nArchitecture\nRomanesque\nThe palace was likely built around 1189, although some authors suggest an earlier date.\nPartially buried, there is a large rectangular room measuring 26.8 by 7.1 meters that corresponds to the original construction. It is the only historic room preserved after the renovation. The ceiling is supported without the need for corbels and features a simple ribbed vault. On the north wall, there are six narrow, deeply splayed windows with semicircular arches. The north wall also has large prismatic buttresses that reach up to two-thirds of its total height, ending in a sloped finish. The west wall contains three tiers of lintelled openings arranged irregularly along the wall, and corbels appear where the wall meets the roof. This wall faces the palace gardens.\nThe rooms on the west side, where the royal chambers were located, included on the ground floor a coffered hall decorated with oak leaf motifs dating from the late 16th century. These decorations deteriorated in recent years and were removed during the recent renovation.\nGothic and Renaissance\nVarious expansions were made in the northeast corner, and a tower with a larger footprint than the others, facing Santo Domingo, was rebuilt. The different improvement works are documented.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nEnlaces externos\n:Category:History of Navarre\n:Category:Bien de Interés Cultural landmarks in Navarre\n:Category:Royal residences in Spain"
