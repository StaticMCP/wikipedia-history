She lived during the time of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. She is held the mother of the Crown Prince Unas-ankh, though this fact is disputed. In addition to Unas Anch, Nebet may also be the mother of Khentkaues, Neferut, and Nefertkaues.\nTomb\nNebet was buried in a double mastaba with another queen, Khenut, next to the Pyramid of Unas in Saqqara. The mastaba was excavated by Peter Munro.\nTitles\nNebet's titles are: \"Great One of the hetes-sceptre\" (wrt-hetes), \"She who sees Horus and Seth\" (mȝȝt-ḥrw-stẖ), \"Great of Praises\" (wrt-ḥzwt), \"King's Wife, his beloved\" (ḥmt-nsw mryt.f), \"Consort and Beloved of the Two Ladies\" (smȝyt-mry-nbty), \"Attendant of the Great One\" (ḫtt-wr), \"Companion of Horus\" (smrt-ḥrw), \"Companion of Horus, his beloved\" (smrt-ḥrw-mryt.f) and \"Companion of Horus\" (tist-ḥrw).\nEven though she bears the titles of a queen, she is depicted in her tomb as a high-ranking woman without any of the insignia of a queen.\nShe had her own estates, which were administered by women.\nReferences"
