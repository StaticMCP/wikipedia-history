It is thought the present name was the name of a pastoral property owned by Ernest Christian Frederick Beutel. Due to the number of local areas which had \"Tarampa\" as part of their place name, local residents met in February 1906 to propose that their area had a new name and submitted a list of proposed new names to the Education department and the postal authorities.  The name Brightview as the local place name is in use from at least  July 1906.\nTarampa Flat Provisional School  opened on 25 November 1902, being renamed Brightview Provisional School in 1906. It became Brightview State School on 1 January 1909. A new school building was erected in 1935. It closed on 11 May 1962. It was at 1060 Brightview Road ().\nBy 1911, an Apostolic congregation was already meeting in Tarampa Flats. In 1914, the Brightview Apostolic Church was erected.\nDemographics\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft\"\n|+Population of Brightview\n!Year\n!Population\n!Notes\n|-\n|1911\n|131\n|\n|-\n|1933\n|180\n|\n|-\n|1961\n|158\n|\n|-\n|2001\n|675\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|895\n|\n|-\n|\n|813\n|\n|-\n|\n|911\n|\n|}\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Brightview.
