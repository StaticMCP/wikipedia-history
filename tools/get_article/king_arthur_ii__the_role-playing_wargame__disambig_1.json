It was developed by NeocoreGames and published by Paradox Interactive. It blends elements of the real-time tactics, role-playing, and grand strategy genres into one.\nGameplay\nGameplay in King Arthur II is a mix of real-time strategy, role-playing, and grand strategy elements. The grand strategy portion of the game is played on a large campaign map of Britannia. Unlike its predecessor, King Arthur II does not feature multiplayer.\nPlot\nThere are two campaigns in the game, a prologue with only one chapter, and the main story, spanning several chapters. In the prologue, the player takes the role of Septimus Sulla, heir to one of the Roman families that ruled in Britannia south of ''Hadrian's Wall''. The prologue details Septimus' rise to power and eventual descent into madness.\nIn the main campaign, the player takes over the role of William Pendragon, son of the once and future King Arthur. Arthur lies mortally stricken by a magical curse and several of the figures of Arthurian legend are missing when William steps up to unite the provinces that once made up Arthur's kingdom, fight back the Fomorians unleashed by the Witch Queen Morgawse from the Orkney Islands and find a way to heal his father.\nAs in the previous game, other heroes join the army of William and, eventually, a second army led by the sorceress Morgana Le Fay becomes available as William allows her to search in the name of King Arthur for her mentor Merlin, who was kidnapped by the enchantress Lady Nimue. Over the course of the game, Septimus Sulla attacks from the North.\nKing Arthur II: Dead Legions\nAn expansion pack King Arthur II: Dead Legions was released alongside the launch of the base game on January 27, 2012, and was released later in Japan on September 7, 2012.\nReception\n| Destruct = 7/10\n| EuroG = 5/10\n| GI = 10/10\n| GSpot = 5.5/10\n| GSpy =\n| GRadar =\n| IGN = 6/10\n| PCGUK = 77%\n| PCPP = 6/10\n| rev1 = The Digital Fix\n| rev1Score = 7/10\n| rev2 = The Escapist\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
