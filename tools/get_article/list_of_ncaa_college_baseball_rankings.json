The Coaches Poll is voted by a panel of 31 coaches, all of whom are members of the American Baseball Coaches Association, and is published by USA Today beginning in the preseason, and then weekly after the second week of the regular season.  Baseball America also publishes a ranking, which is voted by its staff members, and appears from the preseason through the end of the season.  Collegiate Baseball Newspaper published the first poll of college baseball teams in 1959, and ranks the top 40 teams in the preseason and top 30 teams during the regular season and postseason.  The National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association, or NCBWA, has, since 1998, published a ranking of the top 35 teams in the preseason and top 30 during the regular season and postseason, as voted by 40 of its members.\nNCAA Division I poll seasons (1959–present)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Poll season\n!Season\n!Champion\n|-\n| 1959\n| 1959 season\n| Oklahoma State\n|-\n| 1960\n| 1960 season\n| Minnesota\n|-\n| 1961\n| 1961 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1962\n| 1962 season\n| Michigan\n|-\n| 1963\n| 1963 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1964\n| 1964 season\n| Minnesota\n|-\n| 1965\n| 1965 season\n| Arizona State\n|-\n| 1966\n| 1966 season\n| Ohio State\n|-\n| 1967\n| 1967 season\n| Arizona State\n|-\n| 1968\n| 1968 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1969\n| 1969 season\n| Arizona State\n|-\n| 1970\n| 1970 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1971\n| 1971 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1972\n| 1972 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1973\n| 1973 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1974\n| 1974 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1975\n| 1975 season\n| Texas\n|-\n| 1976\n| 1976 season\n| Arizona\n|-\n| 1977\n| 1977 season\n| Arizona State\n|-\n| 1978\n| 1978 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1979\n| 1979 season\n| Cal State Fullerton\n|-\n| 1980\n| 1980 season\n| Arizona\n|-\n| 1981\n| 1981 season\n| Arizona State\n|-\n| 1982\n| 1982 season\n| Miami (FL)\n|-\n| 1983\n| 1983 season\n| Texas\n|-\n| 1984\n| 1984 season\n| Cal State Fullerton\n|-\n| 1985\n| 1985 season\n| Miami (FL)\n|-\n| 1986\n| 1986 season\n| Arizona\n|-\n| 1987\n| 1987 season\n| Stanford\n|-\n| 1988\n| 1988 season\n| Stanford\n|-\n| 1989\n| 1989 season\n| Wichita State\n|-\n| 1990\n| 1990 season\n| Georgia\n|-\n| 1991\n| 1991 season\n| LSU\n|-\n| 1992\n| 1992 season\n| Pepperdine\n|-\n| 1993\n| 1993 season\n| LSU\n|-\n| 1994\n| 1994 season\n| Oklahoma\n|-\n| 1995\n| 1995 season\n| Cal State Fullerton\n|-\n| 1996\n| 1996 season\n| LSU\n|-\n| 1997\n| 1997 season\n| LSU\n|-\n| 1998\n| 1998 season\n| Southern California\n|-\n| 1999\n| 1999 season\n| Miami (FL)\n|-\n| 2000\n| 2000 season\n| LSU\n|-\n| 2001\n| 2001 season\n| Miami (FL)\n|-\n| 2002\n| 2002 season\n| Texas\n|-\n| 2003\n| 2003 season\n| Rice\n|-\n| 2004\n| 2004 season\n| Cal State Fullerton\n|-\n| 2005\n| 2005 season\n| Texas\n|-\n| 2006\n| 2006 season\n| Oregon State\n|-\n| 2007\n| 2007 season\n| Oregon State\n|-\n| 2008\n| 2008 season\n| Fresno State\n|-\n| 2009\n| 2009 season\n| LSU\n|-\n| 2010\n| 2010 season\n| South Carolina\n|-\n| 2011\n| 2011 season\n| South Carolina\n|-\n| 2012\n| 2012 season\n| Arizona\n|-\n| 2013\n| 2013 season\n| UCLA\n|-\n| 2014\n| 2014 season\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| 2015\n| 2015 season\n| Virginia\n|-\n| 2016\n| 2016 season\n| Coastal Carolina\n|-\n| 2017\n| 2017 season\n| Florida\n|-\n| 2018\n| 2018 season\n| Oregon State\n|-\n| 2019\n| 2019 season\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| 2020\n| 2020 season\n| Cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n| 2021\n| 2021 season\n| Mississippi State\n|}\nReferences"
