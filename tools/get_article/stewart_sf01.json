It was driven by Rubens Barrichello and Jan Magnussen, the latter who had brief race experience with McLaren in .\nThis was the first Formula One car to run on Texaco fuel since the McLaren M26 in 1979.\nLaunch and design\nThe car was launched in December 1996.\nThe SF01 was the team's first F1 car, designed by Alan Jenkins for three-time Drivers' Champion Jackie Stewart and son Paul to enter the series after several years in lower formulae such as Formula Three.\nRacing history\nIn an era when many smaller teams such as Forti, Pacific and Simtek went bankrupt, and fellow debutants MasterCard Lola folded almost immediately, Stewart's competent first year after building a car from scratch proved to be a welcome boost for the sport.\nWhilst the car was quite competitive enough to regularly score points, it was frequently prevented from doing so by appalling unreliability; the team were only classified eight times out of a possible 34. The main reason for this were difficulties with mating the Ford engine with the car's oil tank. However, Barrichello drove to a fine second place at Monaco, the highlight of a season in which he largely eclipsed Magnussen.\nThe team eventually finished ninth in the Constructors' Championship, with six points.\nLivery\nThe car featured a white livery with a tartan stripes from the front to the rear the car. The team's main sponsor was HSBC.\nComplete Formula One results\n(key) (results in bold indicate pole position)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n! Year\n! Team\n!
