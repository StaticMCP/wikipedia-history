The museum is operated by the Rhode Island Historical Society and located at 42 South Main Street in Market Square in the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor.[http://www.woonsocket.org/workandculture.htm Woonsocket – The Museum of Work and Culture]\nAbout The Museum\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, immigrants flocked to Rhode Island in search of work and prosperity within the state's mill towns. Their labors - both on and off the factory floor - helped define the culture of the Blackstone River Valley. Today, the Museum of Work and Culture preserves their stories for future generations. Visitors begin their journey in a farmhouse and imagine the experience of agricultural life in nineteenth-century Québec. From there they cross the border into the United States and enter the workday world of the Industrial Era. The Museum's other exhibits recreate the new settlers' life at home, at work, and at school, and present the story of the Independent Textiles Union (I.T.U.). The Museum of Work and Culture explores the continued impact of the industrial revolution and honors the experience of the people, past and present, who have enriched the Blackstone River Valley.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rihs.org/museums/museum-of-work-and-culture/ RIHS Museum site]\n*[http://www.woonsocket.org/workandculture.htm Woonsocket.org Description]\n*[http://www.projo.com/ri/woonsocket/content/NO_WOONSOCKET_MUSEUM_01-23-07_MH42A19.196290c.html Kia Hall Hayes, Providence Journal, \"Work museum marks its 10th anniversary\" (January 23, 2007) (accessed February 11, 2008)]"
