The programme was first broadcast on 8 January 2009, running for a series of 13 episodes. Series 2 began airing on 6 October 2010, and series 3 began on 18 May 2011 on CBBC.\nFormat\nAnimated boy Little Howard and his live-action guardian Big Howard live together in Purley, London. Each episode typically begins with a short comedy sketch, which inspires Little Howard to blow a loud animated klaxon and ask a \"big question\" on a related topic. After a credit sequence involving an animated monkey song-and-dance routine, the remainder of the programme investigates possible answers to the big question, using a combination of research, expert advice, fantasy, and song.\nFurther assistance is provided by Mother, a pink (series 1) or orange (series 2/3) anthropomorphic personal computer that wears clothes and feels emotions.\nAlthough the programme is broadcast on the BBC, which does not show commercial advertising, each episode features a comedy \"advertising break\" with imaginary products vaguely related to the big question. Similarly, a frequent element throughout the series is the use of humorous pop culture references to appeal to an adult audience, and which would fly over younger viewers' heads.\nAwards\nOn 16 November 2011, the episode Why do Things Have to Die? from series 2 won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Children's Television Script.\nList of episodes\nSeries 1\nSeries 1 began airing on 8 January 2009. Performers who appeared in series 1 included: Kirsten O'Brien, Lucy Porter, Justin Edwards, Ishia Bennison, and David Penn.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #6699CC;\"| #\n! style=\"background-color: #6699CC;\"| Little Howard's Big Question\n! style=\"background-color: #6699CC;\"| Original air date\n|-\n| 1\n| Why Do I Need to Go to Sleep?\n| 8 January 2009\n|-\n| 2\n| Why Can't I Fly?\n| 15 January 2009\n|-\n| 3\n| How Did I Get Here?\n| 22 January 2009\n|-\n| 4\n| Can I Get Big Howard Abducted by Aliens?\n| 29 January 2009\n|-\n| 5\n| How Will I Know When I'm in Love?\n| 5 February 2009\n|-\n| 6\n| How Can I be Lucky?\n| 12 February 2009\n|-\n| 7\n| Could Dinosaurs Ever Come Back?\n| 19 February 2009\n|-\n| 8\n| Why Does Time Fly When You're Having Fun?\n| 26 February 2009\n|-\n| 9\n| What is Funny?\n| 5 March 2009\n|-\n| 10\n| What the Gibbing Flump Are You on About Doris?\n| 12 March 2009\n|-\n| 11\n| What is the World's Most Dangerous Food?\n| 19 March 2009\n|-\n| 12\n| Can I Believe My Eyes?\n| 26 March 2009\n|-\n| 13\n| Little Howard's DVD Extras(Clips episode, premiered on CBBC following episode 12)\n| 26 March 2009\n|}\nSeries 2\nSeries 2 began airing on 6 October 2010.
