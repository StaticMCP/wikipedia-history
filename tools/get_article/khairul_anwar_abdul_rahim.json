He previously played for Bruneian powerhouses Indera SC and DPMM FC.\nKhairul trained with the youth system of Indera SC and made his league debut in 2011. He won the first two Brunei Super League championships in 2012–13 and 2014. The following season, he was one of four local recruits selected to play for Brunei's professional club DPMM FC, along with Indera teammate Reduan Petara, Yura Indera Putera Yunos and Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir. He failed to make an appearance in DPMM's title-winning season of 2015.\nKhairul found form at the start of 2016 and was a second-half substitute in the season-opening Community Shield on 13 February which DPMM lost 3–2. However, by March he failed to remain in Steve Kean's plans after two further substitute appearances.\nHe was released in February 2018, ending a three-year spell with only five league appearances to his name. He promptly moved to Kasuka FC where he has been playing since, winning the league in 2023 and 2024–25.\nHonours\nTeam\n;Indera SC\n*Brunei Super League (2): 2012–13, 2014\n;DPMM FC\n* S.League: 2015\n;Kasuka FC\n*Brunei Super League (2): 2023, 2024–25\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
