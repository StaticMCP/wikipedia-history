Barnwell and Emma Elliott. He was educated at Trinity College in Connecticut and graduated in 1871. While there, he was a member of the Fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall). He then studied at the General Theological Seminary and graduated in 1873. In 1900 he would receive the degree of D.D. from the University of the South and LL.D. from the University of Alabama.\nOrdained ministry\nBarnwell was ordained deacon in 1873 by Bishop John Williams and priest in 1875 by Bishop John W. Beckwith. He served in St George's Church in Griffin, Georgia, between 1873 and 1876. In 1876, he transferred to Demopolis, Alabama, as rector of Trinity Church, while in 1880, he became rector of St Paul's Church in Selma, Alabama.\nEpiscopacy\nOn May 18, 1900, Barnwell was elected as the Coadjutor Bishop of Alabama. However, prior to his consecration, the diocesan bishop of Alabama Richard Hooker Wilmer died and hence Barnwell was instead consecrated as the third diocesan Bishop of Alabama on July 25, 1900, in St Paul's Church, Selma by the Bishop of Mississippi Hugh Miller Thompson. He died two years later on July 24, 1902, in Selma, Alabama.\nReferences"
