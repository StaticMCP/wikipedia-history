Seeking control over key trade routes and resources, Egyptian forces invaded territories now part of Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia.\nWell-equipped with modern weaponry, the Egyptian army defeated numerous local powers, seizing strategic cities such as Kassala and Massawa. The invasions resulted in a decisive Egyptian victory — thousands of locals were enslaved or displaced, and large amounts of gold, ivory, and livestock were taken north.\nThe campaigns marked the height of Egyptian expansion under the Muhammad Ali dynasty, establishing Egypt as a dominant regional power until the late 19th century."
