Smurf is very protective of her family and presents a borderline-incestuous love towards them. She is forced to kill her adopted son Baz after he betrays her and she is briefly confined to jail. She is later diagnosed with terminal cancer and plans an elaborate final job, the bunker heist, to die on her own terms and take at least Pope with her. However, after her sons refuse to go through with it, she is shot dead by J, who fulfilled her wish.

In 1999, she formally cuts ties with Julia after she is caught attempting to rob the Cody family estate, also forcing her sons to do the same. (seasons 5–6; recurring season 4)\n* Scott Speedman as Barry \"Baz\" Blackwell, Smurf's adopted son and J's potential biological father. He is the leader in the Cody family's heists but begins to question how Smurf runs their jobs. He is shown to be neglectful of his long-time girlfriend Catherine and their daughter Lena, often cheating on the former with his recurring fling Lucy. He is later assassinated by Mia Benitez, on Smurf's orders, after he planned to rob Smurf with Lucy and even successfully framed Smurf for the murder of Javi in an attempt to take over leadership. In season 6, flashbacks reveal that Baz abandoned Pope during a bank robbery job, leading to him being incarcerated for three years until his release at the beginning of season 1. Reflecting on these events, Pope hallucinates Baz while in solitary confinement during his imprisonment for Catherine's murder. (seasons 1–3; guest season 6)\n** Reeve Baker as Young Barry \"Baz\" Blackwell, the 10-year-old son of Linda Blackwell in 1984. (guest season 5)\n** Darren Mann as Teenage Barry \"Baz\" Blackwell, Smurf's 18-year-old (1992) and 25-year-old (1999) adopted son and the adopted brother of Julia, Andrew, Craig, and Deran who ran away from home in 1986. He becomes the shot-caller while on jobs with his adopted siblings and later starts a secret relationship with Julia. After Smurf discovers the relationship, she forces him to move out and he stops seeing Julia. In 1999, he started to pull off higher-risk jobs to make Smurf money. (recurring season 6)\n* Shawn Hatosy as Andrew \"Pope\" Cody, the oldest Cody son, who suffers from mental illness and OCD for most of his life, and even considers suicide. After having served three years in Folsom State Prison, for a bank robbery job gone wrong, he returns to the Cody family. His father, Colin, died before Pope and his twin sister Julia were born. He also had an obsessive infatuation with Baz's girlfriend Catherine, whom Smurf forces him to kill, and later becomes increasingly involved in taking care of his niece, Lena, after she is orphaned. He later goes against Smurf's wishes and puts Lena into the foster care system to protect her from the Cody's criminal lifestyle. While Pope struggles to connect and get close to people, he has had relationships with churchgoer Amy Wheeler and his childhood friend Angela Kane. Catherine's death is later investigated by Detective Louise Thompson, who eventually gets Pope to confess to her murder due to his mounting guilt, and he is incarcerated once again. He later plans with his brothers and J to escape from his imprisonment. During the prison transport heist, Craig and Deran successfully free him and they attempt to escape the country together until they discover that J has betrayed them as the police close in on their location. During a shootout with the police, Pope is shot in the chest while allowing Craig and Deran to flee, but survives, and makes his way to the Cody family estate. He confronts J about his betrayal, and after initially attempting to drown his nephew, instead lets him go after feeling guilty about abandoning Julia during his youth.

He struggles to find his place in life while maintaining a complicated relationship with his family and a sibling rivalry with Baz, who also gives him his nickname \"Pope\". In 1999, after stopping a now-pregnant Julia from robbing the Cody family estate he is forced by Smurf to abandon his sister for good. (recurring season 6)\n* Ben Robson as Craig Cody, the middle Cody son, who has a predilection for drugs and extremely risky activities. Often unpredictable, and less reliable than his brothers, he finds enjoyment in the criminal lifestyle and throwing parties. His father is Jake Dunmore, a former member of Smurf's criminal gang and her ex-boyfriend, but Craig is unaware of his existence. While he has had numerous flings, including with J's ex-girlfriend Nicky Belmont and the professional thief Frankie, he and his longtime on-again/off-again girlfriend, and former drug dealer, Renn Randall, eventually have a son, Nicholas \"Nick\" Cody. This leads Craig to struggle to improve his life by attempting to stay clean for his new family and he eventually proposes to Renn which she happily accepts. Following Pope's incarceration, he and Deran help rescue him during the prison transport heist but they are forced to leave Pope behind after J's betrayal leads to the police discovering them and so Craig and Deran attempt to flee to the Mexico-U.S. border together. While robbing a convenience store to get money to cross the border, Craig is shot in the stomach by the store owner's son and he and Deran steal a truck and drive away. With Craig's condition worsening, Deran is forced to pull over and together they watch the ocean by a cliffside as Craig begs Deran to look after Renn and Nick, before he finally succumbs to blood loss.\n**Oz Kalvan (recurring season 6) and Jack Michael Doke (guest season 6) as Young Craig Cody, the son of Smurf and Jake Dunmore, younger half-brother of Julia and Andrew, the older half-brother of Deran, and younger adoptive brother of Baz in 1992 and 1999.\n* Jake Weary as Deran Cody, the youngest Cody son, a former competitive surfer who is not as ruthless as his older brothers but slowly adapts to protect those he cares for. He owns a bar as a legitimate side business in an attempt to distance himself from the Cody family's criminal activities but later uses it to launder money and is eventually forced to sell it. His father is Billy, a low-level criminal whom Smurf had a recurring fling with, and whom Deran is estranged due to his selfish habits. He initially hides the fact that he is gay from his family, but later opens up to them, and they happily accept him. He was in a complicated relationship with fellow surfer Adrian Dolan until they parted ways for his safety, as Adrian was forced to flee the country. He would also have sex with various men to vent his anger and frustrations. After Pope's incarceration, he helps rescue him alongside Craig during the prison transport heist but they are forced to flee after being discovered by the police, due to J's betrayal. With no money to make it across the Mexico-U.S. border, he and Craig attempt to rob a convenience store, leading to Craig being mortally wounded. He later sits by a cliffside watching the ocean with his brother, promising to look after Renn and Nick as Craig succumbs to blood loss.\n**Cyrus Blomberg (recurring season 6) and Dexter Hobert (guest season 6) as Young Deran Cody, the son of Smurf and Billy, younger half-brother of Julia, Andrew, and Craig, and younger adoptive brother of Baz in 1992 and 1999.\n* Finn Cole as Joshua \"J\" Cody, Smurf's grandson who moves in with her and his uncles at the Cody family estate following the death of his mother, Julia Cody, who was Smurf's only daughter and Pope's twin sister. He quickly adapts to the criminal lifestyle, working with his uncles on various jobs and partaking in heists, and is the only one who will challenge Smurf. He slowly becomes more connected in the criminal world, using his intellect to operate numerous side businesses to launder money, and works with criminals outside of the family while becoming more ruthless in his actions. Smurf claims that J's biological father is Baz, but it is later revealed during flashbacks that Julia does not know who J's father is. J has been in multiple relationships, most notably with his high school girlfriend Nicky Belmont, reckless gang member Mia Benitez, college student Olivia Dunn, and legal secretary Penny Dean. J eventually grows resentful of his uncles for their past treatment of his mother Julia, and seeing an opportunity to cut and run, he abandons his uncles during the prison transport heist to rescue Pope, sabotages their vehicles, steals all their money and weapons and notifies the police of their location. Feeling betrayed, Pope later attempts to drown J for his actions but ultimately lets him go. J is then able to flee the country and escape to the Virgin Islands with all of his family's money, now alone.\n* Daniella Alonso as Catherine Belen, Baz's girlfriend, and the mother of their daughter, Lena Blackwell. She later became a criminal informant, working closely with Officer Patrick Fischer, but never implicated any of the Codys in any crimes. She is then smothered to death by Pope on Smurf's orders, who thought that Catherine was going to betray them. Her body is later discovered by the Oceanside police after having been buried by Pope years prior. Initially believed to be a cold case, her murder is investigated by Detective Louise Thompson who focuses her efforts on the Codys and eventually gets Pope to confess. (season 1)\n* Molly Gordon as Nicky Belmont, J's girlfriend and fellow high school student who becomes close with the Codys. Although initially unaware of the Cody family's criminal activities, she becomes more corrupted and rebellious after being increasingly associated with them. She later moves in with the Codys, against her father's wishes, has a recurring fling with Craig, and even participates in the yacht heist. She eventually turns to heroin and after seriously injuring herself, J abandons her outside a hospital. She soon leaves Oceanside and goes to live with her parents in Guam and is later mentioned to have gotten married there. (seasons 1–3)\n* Carolina Guerra as Lucy, Baz's mistress from Mexico with whom he has a recurring romance.
