The awards honor films, television shows, musicians and works of journalism that fairly, accurately and inclusively represent the LGBT community and issues relevant to the community. GLAAD announced the 151 nominees split across 27 categories on January 25, 2019 in Park City, Utah. Some of the awards were presented in Los Angeles on March 28, 2019 and the remaining awards were presented in New York City on May 4, 2019.\nCategory changes\nUnlike in previous ceremonies, the 30th GLAAD Media Awards did not include the Outstanding Daily Drama category, while the award for Outstanding Video Game was presented for the first time. Additionally, Outstanding Talk Show Episode award was renamed the Outstanding Variety or Talk Show Episode. In order to reflect increased cinematic representation, GLAAD expanded the number of potential nominees in both film categories from five to ten nominees.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are presented in bold.\nFilm\n{| class=wikitable\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Love, Simon (20th Century Fox)'\n** Blockers (Universal Studios)\n** Crazy Rich Asians (Warner Bros.)\n** Deadpool 2 (20th Century Fox)\n** ''The Girl in the Spider's Web (Sony Pictures)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n* 'Boy Erased (Focus Features)'\n** 1985 (Wolfe Releasing)\n** A Kid Like Jake (IFC Films)\n** Can You Ever Forgive Me?

GLAAD issued a statement explaining that it was a \"difficult decision\" but added that \"This week's story in The Atlantic documenting unspeakable harms endured by young men and teenage boys brought to light a reality that cannot be ignored or even tacitly rewarded. Singer's response to The Atlantic story wrongfully used ‘homophobia’ to deflect from sexual assault allegations and GLAAD urges the media and the industry at large to not gloss over the fact that survivors of sexual assault should be put first. The team that worked so hard on Bohemian Rhapsody as well as the legacy of Freddy Mercury deserve so much more than to be tainted in this way\".\nReferences"
