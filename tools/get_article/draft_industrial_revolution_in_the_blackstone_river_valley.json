The success of this mill led to other mills becoming prominent within the Blackstone River Valley, and from there, the techniques and technologies learned and developed in the Blackstone River Valley spread to the remainder of the United States.\nBackground:\nStarting in the mid-18th century, Great Britain began to industrialize in what is known as the first Industrial Revolution. Britain was the first nation to become industrialized, decades before the next European country, Belgium, was able to. Several advantages, such as no internal trade barriers and peace on the island of Great Britain, while also not being physically connected to the European continent, which was known for having conflicts, allowed Great Britain to heavily industrialize relatively quickly and become the first industrialized country in the world. While Britain's Industrial Revolution was in its early phases, some of the colonies of Great Britain in British North America, often known by the moniker the Thirteen Colonies, declared independence from Great Britain, resulting in the American Revolutionary War, and gained independence officially with British recognition in 1783.\nOrigin and Reason for Industrialization:\nIn the new country founded after the American Revolutionary War, the United States was primarily an agrarian nation. Even in the states that would become the heart of the American Industrial Revolution, primarily in the Northeast, the economy was still largely agrarian-based, since the techniques and new technologies that began in the Industrial Revolution that started in Britain had not crossed the Atlantic yet. This new country in the United States was found however to be rich in terms of resources, especially in the western regions of the new United States that had not been colonized or explored as of yet such as in the new Northwest Territories. This led different United States based entrepreneurs to begin looking for possible ways to both exploit these resources, and find ways to develop industry in the already populated portions of the new United States.\nThe Initial Development of the Blackstone River Valley:\nThe Blackstone River Valley, a valley based around the Blackstone River stretching around 48 miles from Worcester, Massachusetts, to Pawtucket, Rhode Island, was where the first mills and industrialization in the United States occurred. The Blackstone River Valley was known among locals for having a strong, steady downflow of water with a total drop of 438 feet. The river is considered to have many sites that are perfect for the creation of dams. These dams allowed the river to have reservoirs of water even in times of drought, allowing for water power in all seasons. An industrialist from Rhode Island, Moses Brown, became interested in how the British were using water power to power textile mills and make them more efficient. Due to British protectionism of their industries, the designs were not allowed to be exported from Britain, ensuring that Britain could retain a significant advantage in terms of industrialization. While still in Britain, the industrialist Samuel Slater became aware of the desire of industrialists in the United States to become competitive with British industry and to kickstart their own industrial revolution. Samuel Slater learned what he could of the British techniques and technologies. He left for New York City, in the United States, with many in his hometown of Belper considering him a traitor due to his abandoning where he trained and helping a rival gain an advantage. Brown, along with William Almy, his son-in-law, and Smith Brown, a cousin of his, decided to open a new mill in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Having obtained an Arkwright pattern frame for the production of fabrics and textiles, they had the technology needed to operate the mill but could not figure out how to operate the wheel frame itself. Having arrived in the United States by this point and hearing of their dilemma, Slater offered his services to the Almy & Brown company. Slater sought to replicate the British designs from his memory, but due to a lack of skilled mechanics and designers in the United States, he had great difficulty with this. This was due to the lack of industrialization at that point in the United States, meaning those jobs were rare. Slater eventually found two men in Oziel Wilkinson and David Wilkinson to handmake the iron for the machinery. David Wilkinson would shortly become another significant figure in the American Industrial Revolution for his innovations involving the development of a lathe for cutting mechanical screw threads, which became widely used in both The United States and in Europe. Slate and Brown's gamble worked, as by 1791, despite a shortage of supplies and skilled workers, the technology became operational for the production of textile goods. By 1793, Slater's Mill opened in Pawtucket, which was the first factory in the United States to use the Arkwright System of cotton spinning, developed only a few decades earlier in Great Britain. Slater would begin to teach new workers at the mill the technical expertise on how to properly run the mill, ensuring that the knowledge of what Slater learned in Britain about the Industrial Revolution would slowly spread throughout the United States. The industrial base would slowly expand out of the Blackstone River Valley and into the larger New England region. Slater's Mill would also be the site of the United States' first factory strike in 1824, which was successful.\nDevelopment of the Rhode Island System:\nSlater developed a working system for his factories known as the Rhode Island System, based on how family life worked in the New England states, which was very communal. Slater, instead of hiring singular workers, hired families and sometimes entire towns of workers in order to work for him. Many of the workers in his mill were children, as child labor was common during the Industrial Revolution. In exchange, Slater gave the workers company housing, company stores with which the workers could buy needed goods, and educational opportunities. This system is where the system of company towns would originate from in the United States that are popularly associated with states involved in coal mining such as Kentucky or West Virginia, while also inspiring the Waltham-Lowell System, also present in textile mills in the Northeastern United States. In 1803 the company Almy and Brown, along with Slater would indeed open a company town in Rhode Island, known as Slatersville. Samuel Slater would later collaborate with Oziel Wilkinson to create mills throughout the New England region in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.\nThe Invention of the Cotton Gin:\nIn 1794, only shortly after the development of Slater's Mill, the cotton gin was patented by Eli Whitney. Having been developed in 1793, the cotton gin, \"gin\" short for engine, is a device that removes the seeds from the cotton. Historically, it was difficult and time-consuming to perform by hand, but the cotton gin allowed for the production of around 55 pounds of cotton daily, just from a single cotton gin. The invention of this device, around the same time that the Blackstone River Valley mills became functional, was good timing for Slater, Brown, and their associates since the Southern states could now produce more cotton to satisfy the factories' demand for cotton.\nConnection between Slave Labor and Textile Mills:\nAfter the invention of the cotton gin, the agricultural Southern states with their system of slave labor would be encouraged even more to both maintain the system of slavery to allow for the growth of cotton, and to primarily focus on their agricultural industry to feed the growing mill industry of the Northeast. The mills in the Blackstone River Valley, which were already thriving, could now process the vast amounts of cotton coming from the Southern United States. Despite the economic connections between the Southern agricultural slave economy and the Blackstone River Valley economy dependent on slave produced cotton, one of the main people driving the Industrial Revolution in the Blackstone River Valley, Moses Brown, was actually a staunch abolitionist due to his Quaker values. Synergy between the slave owners of the Southern states and the factory owners of the Northern states was not solely in providing raw materials, as in some cases the factory owners would buy the cotton at higher prices in order to gain favorable deals with slave owners to produce textiles for slaves, which the slave owners would buy.\nExpansion in the Blackstone Valley:\nDue to the Embargo Act of 1807 and the later War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, the United States had become more reliant upon local industry, which resulted in new textile mills sprouting all around the Blackstone River Valley, notably all near Providence. This made Providence a key center point from which the industry could flourish, with hundreds of New Englanders working in textile factories in towns near Providence. Pawtucket, particularly bordering Providence, would become particularly important in the region, hosting Slater's Mill and the Wilkinson Mill. Eventually, as the mills grew and steam power would replace water power in the area, the need for extra workers became apparent, so immigrants were drawn to the area seeking jobs that could be performed at the mills. Many of the immigrants were Irish and French Canadians.\nDevelopment of the Blackstone Canal:\nThe region's development was so vast by the early 19th century that a canal was constructed to connect Worcester, Massachusetts, one of the primary cities of the Blackstone River Valley, with Providence, Rhode Island. The government of Providence was the primary force that sought the development of a canal connecting the two cities, and Providence believed that the goods coming from Worcester would help Providence economically. Business interests in Massachusetts thought it would hurt the economy of Massachusetts while helping Rhode Island, with benefits only coming to Worcester, which led to the project being put on hold for years. Eventually, the state government of Massachusetts would approve construction for the Massachusetts portion of the canal through a company created to construct it. In contrast, Rhode Island soon and eagerly approved its equivalent. Worcester grew even compared to from beforehand and experienced an economic boom, as did the entire Blackstone River Valley going from Worcester to now both Providence and Pawtucket. Despite its initial importance, the development of the Boston and Worcester Railroad led to shipping shifting from Providence to Boston and the canal eventually falling into disuse with the Worcester to Providence railroad being completed in 1847.\nAftermath:\nThe Industrial Revolution slowly spread out from the United States, from its epicenter in the Blackstone River Valley through the Northeastern United States, and eventually into parts of the Midwestern United States. The Southern states of the United States, remaining agriculturally based and dependent on a slave labor-based economy, would see little of the benefits of the Industrial Revolution, with only cities such as Birmingham becoming industrial centers of the Southern United States after the Civil War. This focus and reliance upon agriculture in the Southern United States to feed the raw materials the textile factories in the North required while the Northern states industrialized and diversified their economies would come to give a significant advantage during the American Civil War to the Union States. Due to being the first major industrial center in the United States and remaining a center for industrialization for over a century, the Blackstone River is among the most polluted of all rivers in the entire United States. Even after the Civil War the Blackstone River Valley would remain a center for textile manufacturing until the Great Depression. Many abandoned factories now dot the area. Samuel Slater himself would gain the title of the Father of the Industrial Revolution in America due to his assistance in helping turn the Blackstone River Valley into the first industrialized hub of the United States.\nReferences"
