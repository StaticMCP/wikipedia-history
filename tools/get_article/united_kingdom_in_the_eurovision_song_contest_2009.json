The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry in the contest via the national final Eurovision: Your Country Needs You. Six acts competed in the national final which consisted of two heats, a semi-final and a final, during which the winner was selected entirely through a public televote.\nAs a member of the \"Big Four\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 23, the United Kingdom placed 5th out of the 25 participating countries with 173 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2009 contest, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom fifty-one times. Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in  with the song \"Puppet on a String\" performed by Sandie Shaw, in  with the song \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" performed by Lulu, in  with the song \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" performed by Brotherhood of Man, in  with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\" performed by Bucks Fizz, and in  with the song \"Love Shine a Light\" performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , the UK had only twice finished outside the top 10, in  and . Since 1999, the year in which the rule was abandoned that songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, the UK has had less success, thus far only finishing within the top ten once: in  with the song \"Come Back\" performed by Jessica Garlick. For the 2008 contest, the United Kingdom finished in twenty-fifth place (last) out of twenty-five competing entries with the song \"Even If\" performed by Andy Abraham.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. Despite calls from the leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron for a withdrawal due to the 2008 South Ossetia war, the broadcaster announced that it would participate in the 2009 contest on 28 May 2008. BBC has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose the British entry for Eurovision. For their 2009 entry, the broadcaster announced that a national final involving a public vote would be held to select United Kingdom's entry.\nBefore Eurovision\nEurovision: Your Country Needs You 2009\nEurovision: Your Country Needs You 2009 was the national final developed by the BBC in order to select the British entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. Six acts competed over four televised shows between 10 and 31 January 2009 held at the BBC Television Centre in London and hosted by Graham Norton. All shows in the national final were broadcast on BBC One as well as streamed online via the broadcaster's website bbc.co.uk.\nContestants\nOn 18 October 2008, BBC announced an open submission for interested artists to submit their applications in the form of a video recording of themselves performing a cover version of a popular song or a self-written song. Eligible applicants were those being 17 years old by 1 January 2009 and living in a country within the European Economic Area. The submission period lasted until 21 November 2008. The received applications from the open call were reviewed and a shortlist was compiled BBC producers.  Additional applicants were provided to the BBC by casting companies through professional organisations including agents, stage schools, vocal teachers, open mic events, regional print press and radio stations. Candidates from both entry methods were included in a final shortlist which was presented to a professional panel, consisting of Andrew Lloyd Webber (composer of the British song), Colin Barlow (Universal Music representative) and BBC producers, that ultimately selected six contestants to compete in the national final following auditions as well as vocal and staging workshops held in London. The six contestants were announced during an introduction show on 3 January 2009 which covered the background preparation and selection processes of the national final.\nResults summary\n;Colour key\n: Contestant received the most public votes\n: Contestant was in the \"danger zone\" but saved by Andrew Lloyd Webber\n: Contestant was in the \"danger zone\" and eliminated by Andrew Lloyd Webber\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|+ Weekly results per act\n!

On 18 April, Ewen performed during the Eurovision in Concert event which was held at the Amsterdam Marcanti venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Marga Bult and Maggie MacNeal, and appeared during the RTL 4 programme Life and Cooking. On 3 May, Ewen performed \"It's My Time\" during Taniec z Gwiazdami, the Polish version of Strictly Come Dancing. Prior to the contest, Ewen was interviewed by Russian magazine OK! which gave away more than 100,000 copies of \"It's My Time\" to readers from Russia and Ukraine.\nIn addition to their international appearances, on 17 May, Jade Ewen performed during the UK Eurovision Preview Party, which was held in London, United Kingdom and hosted by Nicki French and Paddy O'Connell. On 1, 2 and 4 May, Ewen appeared on the BBC One programmes Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Saturday Kitchen and The One Show, respectively.\nAt Eurovision\nAccording to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top nine songs from each semi-final as determined by televoting progress to the final, and a tenth was determined by back-up juries. As a member of the \"Big Four\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final on 16 May 2009. In addition to their participation in the final, France is also required to broadcast and vote in one of the two semi-finals. During the semi-final allocation draw on 30 January 2009, the United Kingdom was assigned to broadcast and vote in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009.\nIn the United Kingdom, the semi-finals were broadcast on BBC Three with commentary by Paddy O'Connell and Sarah Cawood, while the final was televised on BBC One with commentary by Graham Norton and broadcast on BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce. Norton replaced Terry Wogan following his retirement as the British commentator since 1980. The British spokesperson, who announced the British votes during the final, was Duncan James.\nFinal\nJade Ewen took part in technical rehearsals on 9 and 10 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 15 and 16 May. This included the jury final on 15 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries.

The singer wore a dress designed by designer Amanda Wakeley during the performance, which was choreographed by Arlene Philips. The performance also featured smoke effects. The United Kingdom placed fifth in the final, scoring 173 points.\nVoting\nThe voting system for 2009 involved each country awarding points from 1–8, 10 and 12, with the points in the final being decided by a combination of 50% national jury and 50% televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently.\nFollowing the release of the full split voting by the EBU after the conclusion of the competition, it was revealed that the United Kingdom had placed tenth with the public televote and third with the jury vote in the final. In the public vote, the United Kingdom scored 105 points, while with the jury vote, the United Kingdom scored 223 points.\nBelow is a breakdown of points awarded to the United Kingdom and awarded by the United Kingdom in the second semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows:\nPoints awarded to the United Kingdom\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Points awarded to the United Kingdom (Final)\n|-\n!
