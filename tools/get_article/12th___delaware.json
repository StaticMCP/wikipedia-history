The film was produced and filmed by Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing and covers the center and its patients over the period of a year. The film shows interviews of staff at both facilities, as well as pregnant women who are going to them.  12th & Delaware premiered on January 24, 2010, at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in the U.S. Documentary Competition. It won a Peabody Award that same year \"for its poignant portrait of women facing exceedingly difficult decisions at a literal intersection of opposing ideologies.\"\nOne of the interviewees was president of the Pregnancy Care Centre, Father Thomas J. Euteneuer. In January 2011, Euteneuer issued a statement disclosing that he had \"violat[ed] the boundaries of chastity with an adult female ... I take full responsibility for my own poor judgment, my weakness and my sinful conduct that resulted from it\". and then in June 2012, it was reported that a woman had filed a lawsuit accusing Euteneuer of sexual abuse during what were supposed to be exorcisms.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* , posted by Loki Films\n*"
