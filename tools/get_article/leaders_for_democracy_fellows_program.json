Emerging civic leaders with strong Arabic skills will spend three months in Lebanon, while those with university-level English proficiency will go to the United States, gaining academic and practical experience, as well as networking with like-minded peers and professionals. The program is sponsored by United States Department of State's U.S.-Middle East Partnership Initiative and implemented by World Learning.\nReferences"
