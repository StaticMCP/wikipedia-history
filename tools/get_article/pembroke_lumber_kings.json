The Lumber Kings compete in the Central Canada Hockey League (CCHL) as a member of the West Division. The franchise is one of the \"Original Five\" teams of the league. Founded in 1964, the team folded in 1979, but came back in 1980. Since 1964, they play their home games at Pembroke Memorial Centre.\nThe Lumber Kings have won the most Bogart Cup championships of any CCHL franchise since its existence (14). The Kings played their home games at Pembroke Memorial Centre from 1964 until 1979, for 15 seasons. They got sold to a new ownership group, and came back for the 1980–81 season, and moved into Pembroke Memorial Centre once again. The Lumber Kings are one of the most popular and successful franchises in the CCHL; fans and sports commentators refer to the Pembroke area as \"Hockeytown\", which has been a registered trademark owned by the franchise since 1980.\nBetween the 2002–03 and 2018–19 seasons, the Lumber Kings missed the playoffs only four times. They struggled between the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons, with missing the playoffs for two seasons in a row. But other than that, Pembroke won a total of 14 Bogart Cup championships, including two in a row in 1983–84 and 1984–85, and five in a row between 2006–07 and 2010–11. Since 1980, it has consistently been listed as the league's busiest arena, usually receiving the highest attendance compared to any other arenas in the CCHL. In 2011, it was the fifth-busiest Junior A arena in Canada based on attendance numbers.\nHistory\nThe Pembroke Lumber Kings are the oldest member of the CCHL, having begun operations in 1961. However, in 1979–80 the Lumber Kings were suspended for one season and replaced with the Pembroke Royals. The Pembroke Lumber Kings were approved to rejoin the league for 1980–81.\nThe Pembroke Lumber Kings won a total of 14 Art Bogart Cup league championships between 1973 and 2011. Six of those championships came in the 1980s when the Kings were coached by Jim Farelli. Farelli coached 420 games for the Kings, the most of any coach in Lumber Kings history. His teams advanced to the Art Bogart Cup championship series eight consecutive years, winning six titles. This included three consecutive championships from 1987 to 1989, tying the record for longest streak set by the Cornwall Royals (1966–1968).\nThe Kings had previously won three Art Bogart Cups in the 1970s. The 1972–73 team was coached by Mac MacLean and made it to the Centennial Cup Canadian Junior A Final, losing 4 games to 1 to the Portage la Prairie Terriers. Under coach Bryan Murray the Kings won consecutive titles in 1977 and 1978. The 1977 team made it to the Centennial Cup Final, losing to the Prince Albert Raiders. Murray was fired by the Lumber Kings after the 1978 season. Three years later he was starting a long NHL coaching/general manager career as coach of the Washington Capitals.\nThe Lumber Kings broke their own (shared) league record by winning five consecutive Art Bogart Cup championships from 2007 to 2011, appearing in five Fred Page Cup tournaments for the Eastern Canada Junior A championships (2006 as hosts), winning in 2007 and 2011, and finishing as finalists in 2006, 2008, and 2010. In 2011, the Pembroke Lumber Kings became only the second team since the 1976 Rockland Nationals to win the National Junior A championship. The team was led by owner, coach and general manager Sheldon Keefe, who had purchased the Kings in June 2006.\nKeefe announced on May 29, 2013, that he had sold the Pembroke Lumber Kings to former Calgary Flames player (9 games) and Eganville native Dale McTavish. With Keefe no longer in charge of ownership, general management and coaching duties, the Lumber Kings' success began to fade away, despite making the league finals in 2015, losing to Carleton Place; and failing to qualify for the playoffs for the first time in 13 years in 2017.\nThe team was sold to Alex Armstrong in June 2019.\nNotable alumni\n*Dainius Zubrus, (1995–96) played for the Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens, Washington Capitals, Buffalo Sabres, New Jersey Devils, and San Jose Sharks from 1996 to 2016.\n*Mike Eastwood, (1984–85) played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, Winnipeg Jets, Phoenix Coyotes, New York Rangers, St. Louis Blues, Chicago Blackhawks, and Pittsburgh Penguins from 1992 to 2004.\n*Peter White, (1986–88) played for the Edmonton Oilers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, and Chicago Blackhawks from 1993 to 2004.\n*Eric Selleck (2005–06) played for the Florida Panthers and is currently a member of the Arizona Coyotes organization playing for the Tucson Roadrunners.\n*Dmytro Yakushyn (1995–96) played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2 games in 1999–2000\n*Joe Reekie (1981–82) played for the Buffalo Sabres, New York Islanders, Tampa Bay Lightning, Washington Capitals, and Chicago Blackhawks from 1985 to 2002.\n*Dale McTavish (1988–89) played for the Calgary Flames in 1996–97 (9 games) and last played pro hockey for SaiPa and Blues of the Liiga from 1997 to 2000 and again in 2010–2011 season.\n**His son, Mason McTavish, also a Lumber Kings alum (2018–19), was selected 3rd overall in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft by the Anaheim Ducks.\n*P.J.
