It was led by Yusupbek Mukhlisi, who operated in-exile with other former URFET members in Almaty, Kazakhstan.\nAccording to retired GRU (Soviet Union) (Soviet military intelligence) officer Vladimir Suvurov, the Soviet Union helped establish the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan in Almaty in 1975 during the height of Sino-Soviet tensions as a means of destabilizing Xinjiang.\nIn July 1996, the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) engaged in armed clashes with Chinese security forces. The organization claimed to have killed approximately 450 Chinese troops and security personnel during the fighting.\nThe group was allegedly supported logistically by the Soviet Union until 1989. In September 2001, the URFET merged with the Uyghur Liberation Organisation (ULO) and became the Uyghurstan People's Party.\nReferences"
