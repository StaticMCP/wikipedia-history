It had an estimated population of 162,521 in 2012.\nBoma was the capital city of the Congo Free State and Belgian Congo (the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 1 May 1886 to 1923, when the capital was moved to Léopoldville (since renamed Kinshasa). The port handles exports of tropical timber, bananas, cocoa, and palm products.\nHistory\nBoma was founded by European merchants in the 16th century as an entrepôt, including for the slave trade. Trade was chiefly in the hands of Dutch merchants, but British, French and Portuguese firms also had factories there. No European power exercised sovereignty, though claims were from time to time put forward by Portugal.\nBritish explorer Henry Morton Stanley arrived here on 9 August 1877, after crossing Africa from east to west.\nIn 1884 the people of Boma were forced to grant a protectorate of their country to the International Association of the Congo, made up of European powers. In 1886 King Leopold of Belgium established the Congo Free State, designating Boma as its capital. He ran the state as his personal fiefdom for several years, nearly enslaving many Congolese with a private military, and abusing them to force rubber production. International outrage and action by the Belgian legislature resulted in the government taking over supervision of what was established as the colony of the Belgian Congo in 1908.\nBoma continued as the capital of the Belgian Congo until 1923. Léopoldville, since renamed as Kinshasa, was designated as the new capital.\nTransport\nBoma lies on the north bank of the Congo River, some 100&nbsp;km upstream from Muanda, where the river flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The great width and depth of the river allow seagoing ships to reach Boma, which is the second-largest port of DR Congo, after Matadi. Between 1889 and 1984, the port was served by the Mayumbe line from Tshela. The line was initially built as 610 mm (24 inch) gauge in 1889 before being converted to 600 mm in 1932.\nNotable people\n* Antoine-Roger Bolamba (1913–2002), politician and poet\n* Claude Kiambe (born 2003), singer-songwriter\nClimate\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as tropical wet and dry (Aw).\nThe highest record temperature was  on February 25, 1976, while the lowest record temperature was  on October 21, 1976.\n|source 2= Voodoo Skies for record temperatures\n}}\nGallery\nFile:102 Le pier de Boma.jpg|Boma pier, 1899\nFile:103 Les autorités au bout du pier à Boma.jpg|Authorities at the end of the pier, Boma, 1899\nFile:Hezekiah Andrew Shanu-Anciens rois de Boma.jpg|The nine old kings of Boma (phot.
