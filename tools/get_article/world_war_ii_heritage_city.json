Jones Jr., a retired United States Navy captain and military historian, in about 2008. The designation was made law in an act sponsored by Senator Thom Tillis and Representative David Rouzer, and signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2019 as Public Law 116–9.\nIn September 2020, Wilmington, North Carolina, was designated the first World War II Heritage City.\nCriteria\nAny city credited with a major contribution to the American war effort during World War II and which, since the end of hostilities, has actively endeavored to preserve its military legacy can be designated a World War II Heritage City. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to designate cities. No more than one such city in any single state or territory can be named.
