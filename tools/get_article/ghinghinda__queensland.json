The Fitzroy Developmental Road (also known as Taroom Bauhinia Downs Road, State Route 7) enters the locality from the west (Gwambegwine) and exits to the north (Coorada).\nThere are numerous protected areas in the locality, including the Theodore State Forest, Mebir State Forest, Tualka State Forest, and Waterstone State Forests 1 and 2. Apart from these, the land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe Gilbert Range was named by explorer Ludwig Leichhardt on 14 November 1844, after naturalist John Gilbert who was a member of Leichhardt's 1844 expedition.\nIn 1862, the pastoral station of Ghinghinda is mentioned as the home of William Kelman, a Commissioner for the Peace.\nDemographics\nIn the , Ghinghinda had a population of 36 people.\nIn the , Ghinghinda had a population of 47 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Ghinghinda. The nearest government schools are Taroom State School (Prep to Year 10) in neighbouring Taroom to the south and Theodore State School (Prep to Year 10) in Theodore to the north-east. However, students living in the north-west of Ghinghinda would be too distant from these schools for a daily commute. Also, there are no schools offering schooling to Year 12 nearby. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
