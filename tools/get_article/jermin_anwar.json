With a limited international experience, Anwar had an early 2–3 defeat to fellow Canadian teenager Ivett Gonda during her opening match. When Gonda was defeated by Chinese Taipei's Chen Shih-hsin in the semifinals, Anwar was denied her chance to proceed into the repechage for the Olympic bronze medal.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
