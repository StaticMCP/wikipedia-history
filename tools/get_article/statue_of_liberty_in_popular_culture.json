The statue's likeness has also appeared in films, television programs, music videos, and video games, and has been used in logos, on postage stamps and coins, and in theatrical productions. Liberty Enlightening the World remains a popular local, national, and international political symbol of freedom.\nBooks and stories\nDiana by Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]\n* The 1911 O. Henry story, \"The Lady Higher Up\", relates a fanciful conversation between \"Mrs. Liberty\" and the Madison Square Garden Diana statue by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. In the story, Diana asks \"Mrs. Liberty\" why she speaks with what Diana terms a \"City Hall brogue.\" Liberty answers: \"If ye'd studied the history of art in its foreign complications ye'd not need to ask. If ye wasn't so light-headed and giddy ye'd know that I was made by a Dago and presented to the American people on behalf of the French Government for the purpose of welcomin' Irish immigrants into the Dutch city of New York.\"\n* In Amerika by Franz Kafka, the author inaccurately depicts the statue as holding aloft a sword rather than a torch.\n* During the 1940s and 1950s, the iconography of science fiction in the United States was filled with images of ancient, decayed Statues of Liberty, set in the distant future. The covers of famous pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories and Astounding Science Fiction all featured Lady Liberty at one time, surrounded by ruins or by the sediments of the ages, as curious aliens or representatives of advanced or degenerate humans of the future gazed upon her remains. The February 1941 cover of Astounding showed a primitive man and woman approaching on a raft a Statue of Liberty surrounded by wild growth.\n* In the final scene of Maggie-Now (1958) by Betty Smith, two characters scatter Maggie's late husband's ashes from the statue's torch.\n* Jack Finney's 1970 novel Time and Again takes advantage of the presence, in 1882, of just the arm and torch of the statue in Madison Square Park – where they were exhibited to help raise funds for the pedestal – for an important plot development.\n* The final chapter of Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach (1981) reveals that \"The Glow-worm became the light inside the torch on the Statue of Liberty, and thus saved a grateful City from having to pay a huge electricity bill every year.\"\n* Ellen Kushner's 1986 Choose Your Own Adventure book Statue of Liberty Adventure has the protagonist exploring the statue to find its original inspiration.\n* In the disaster novels Her Name Will Be Faith and Category 7: The Biggest Storm in History, hurricanes cause storm surges that topple the statue into the Hudson River.\n* In the first volume of the Southern Victory series How Few Remain (1997) by Harry Turtledove, the Statue of Liberty does not exist in New York City, as relations between the United States and France are poor. This is due to France supporting the Confederate States in the War of Succession and the Second Mexican War. However, in the novel American Empire: Blood and Iron, Liberty Island (still called Bedloe Island in the series) is taken up by a similar but more grim-looking statue called \"The Statue of Remembrance\", which is German-influenced rather than French and personifies the United States' revanchist Remembrance ideology against the Confederate States, Britain and France. This statue carries a sword in its right hand and a shield in its left. Its full name is Remembrance, holding aloft her bared sword.\n* The climax of Philip Shelby's 1998 thriller Gatekeeper had the assassin 'Handyman' using the Statue's crown as a sniper's perch in his plot to murder the wife of a Presidential candidate.\n* Nevada Barr's 1999 mystery novel Liberty Falling is set on Liberty Island and Ellis Island, and features deaths caused by falling from the Statue of Liberty.\n* In the 2006 speculative fiction novel Empire by  Orson Scott Card, two United States Air Force F-16 jets are shot down into New York Harbor with one hitting the gown of the statue.\n* The history of the Statue of Liberty is told in the 2008 book Lady Liberty: A Biography, written by Doreen Rappaport, illustrated by Matt Tavares.\n* Giannina Braschi's dramatic novel United States of Banana (2011) takes place after the September 11, 2001 attacks, at the Statue of Liberty, where a political prisoner from Puerto Rico is trapped in the dungeon of liberty beneath the 11-pointed star that serves as the base of the Statue.\n* The 1999 children's book Disasters by Ned Halley has an illustration of a future New York City behind a seawall, to prevent flooding by sea level rise because of global warming. Liberty Island is seen submerged in the ocean up to the top of the statue's pedestal.\n* The 1996 children's book Incredible Comparisons by Russell Ash uses the statue throughout the book as a height and weight comparison. It is mentioned on one page that if the sea level rose because all the world's ice melted (possibly due to global warming), that the statue would be submerged in the ocean up to the bottom of her torch. This scenario was later depicted in the 2001 science-fiction film A.I. Artificial Intelligence.\nCoins and currency\nthumb\n* The Statue of Liberty has been depicted on several coins, not only in the US, but all over the world. One of the most recent silver coins is the 20 euro SMS Sankt Georg commemorative coin. The obverse shows the armored cruiser SMS Sankt Georg sailing into New York Harbor on May 17, 1907; passing right in front of the Statue of Liberty.

This was later retconned to have been a dream; she had really gained her powers from an experiment.\n* In the Marvel Comics universe, the torch of the Statue of Liberty is the secret meeting spot between superheroes Spider-Man and his friend and confidant Human Torch.\n* The cover of the fourth volume of the comic series Universal War One depicts a shattered shell of the Statue of Liberty to represent the destruction of Earth by the Colonization Industrial Companies.\n* In the Sinfest webcomic \"Lady Liberty\", a humanized version of the Statue, is the spouse of a similarly humanized Uncle Sam. Owing to their iconic status as embodiments of current America, while Uncle Sam is shown as often worried, affected by financial woes and bouts of depression, Lady Liberty is shown as a quiet, nurturing and loving spouse, doing her best to help her husband around, but still prone to overreaction.\n* Swedish cartoonist Joakim Lindengren and Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi created United States of Banana in 2017; in this comic book, Lady Liberty falls in love with a prisoner, Segismundo, who lives in a dungeon beneath her skirt.\n* According to his autobiography, Disney Studios illustrator Bill Peet was asked by Walt Disney to draw some storyboards for an animated sequence that was to be included in the 1943 documentary film Victory Through Air Power showing a hypothetical enemy air raid on New York City. The last scenes of the sequence were to show the Statue of Liberty sinking into New York Harbor. Ultimately, the sequence was never animated and used in the film.\n*In issues 1 - 5 of Fleetway Comic's series based on the MASK cartoon/toy range, in a story entitled \"The Great Head Robbery\" the terrorist organisation VENOM are seen decapitating then stealing the head of the statue under cover of a massive power cut, later replacing it with a dummy which doubles as a weapons platform. It is later destroyed by MASK and the real head found in a garbage dump and returned to its rightful place.\n* In Kingdom Come (1996), the Earth-22 version of the statue is the site of a battle between the Justice League and the Americommando.

Liberty'' also addresses issues of civil liberties, economics, and American identity.\nAs damaged and destroyed\nAs a famous landmark, damage and destruction of the statue has been used to symbolize the end of mankind or the destruction of New York City. The table below lists some examples of movies which feature the statue damaged or destroyed.\nThere have been questions raised about how the statue would hold up for thousands of years, based on her current corrosion patterns. Studies done during various repairs in the past hundred years show that the copper \"skin\" of the statue herself will hold up, but her insides may not. The copper has aged and chemically changed to create a patina, which on metal is a coating of various chemical compounds such as oxides, carbonates, sulfides, or sulfates formed on the surface during exposure to atmospheric elements. It is this patina that gives the statue her sea-green coloring, due to the oxidation of the copper. It also means that the statue's deterioration by seawater and winds is greatly slowed. The only thing that still poses a threat to the patina is acid rain, which has the power to corrode the surface.\nThe joints holding the statue together have withstood some damage by seawater, and have been periodically replaced or repaired. The greatest damage comes in the form of a weakening to the arm holding up the torch, one of the areas of the statue that supports the most weight over a relatively small area. This arm weakness was most recently repaired in the mid-1980s. The torch that the statue holds was also replaced then, because the original torch had been irrevocably damaged by water and snow seeping in through the stained glass windows cut into the flame by Gutzon Borglum in 1916. The old torch now sits in the Statue of Liberty Museum in Fort Wood. The stone at Liberty's feet has also needed repair in the past. Fifty years after the statue was first erected, in 1937, it was discovered that water was leaking in to the pedestal that the statue stands upon. A giant copper apron (250&nbsp;ft. tall) was placed over the pedestal to prevent future damage. Overall, the majority of the statue would likely survive the test of time if an apocalyptic event happened on Earth, as it does in many of the following movies.\nMedia chart\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Media\n! Description\n|-\n| 1933\n| Deluge\n| The statue is hit by a tsunami.\n|-\n| 1968\n| Planet of the Apes\n| Thousands of years in the future, the statue is seen decayed in the sand on a shoreline. Astronaut Taylor sees it and realizes he has time-traveled and has been on Earth the whole time. The statue also appears scorched, indicating its destruction in a nuclear war. This scene has become a classic science fiction movie moment and is possibly the most famous cultural depiction of the statue.\n|-\n| 1979\n| Meteor\n| A meteor fragment passes by the statue and hits Manhattan.\n|-\n| 1981\n| ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' Episodes 1 and 3\n| In Episode 1 (the pilot episode), after the Vogons have destroyed the Earth, the Statue of Liberty can be briefly seen inside a storage room in their spaceship. The production notes commentary on the DVD states that the statue was abducted from Earth, possibly moments before its destruction, because the Vogons like to keep souvenirs from the planets they demolish. In an Episode 3 animation sequence, the statue is seen being destroyed in a hypothetical nuclear war, with the ruins resembling Joseph Pennell's iconic 1918 World War I recruiting poster.\n|-\n| 1981\n| Escape from New York\n| The statue is decapitated and its severed head is seen in the streets of New York City on the poster. However, it is intact in the film, with Liberty Island being a security headquarters after Manhattan has been turned into a giant maximum-security prison.\n|-\n| 1983\n| 2019, After the Fall of New York\n| This sci-fi film takes place many years after a nuclear war; the statue is seen abandoned and derelict on Liberty Island, which is seen as mostly submerged in the ocean. Fort Wood appears to have sunk into the ground up to the top of the pedestal.\n|-\n| 1983\n| Rock & Rule\n| The statue is seen in the ruins of New York (now called Nuke York). While most of it remains standing, it appears tilted and is missing its torch arm.\n|-\n| 1985\n| ''National Lampoon's European Vacation''\n| The Griswold family, returning to the United States from their vacation to Europe, sees the Statue of Liberty from their plane. Clark accidentally opens the cockpit door while searching for a bathroom, bumps the pilot, and causes the plane to hit the statue's torch, damaging it by knocking it upside down.\n|-\n| 1987\n| Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\n| Nuclear Man lifts the statue from her pedestal and hurls her toward Metropolis. Superman catches and re-attaches her to her pedestal.\n|-\n| 1993\n| The Abyss Special Edition\n| The statue is seen when the aliens create massive worldwide megatsunamis to demonstrate their water control as a warning to humanity. She is incorrectly depicted facing the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.\n|-\n| 1995\n| Batman Forever\n| During the film's opening sequence, Batman chases Two-Face in a helicopter until it crashes into the head of the statue, heavily damaging its face. The statue, notably different from its real-life counterpart, has a Gothic design, the word \"Gotham\" imprinted on its crown, and in place of the torch is a rotating light similar to a lighthouse. Liberty Island also appears to be submerged in the ocean up to the top of the pedestal.\n|-\n| 1995\n| Judge Dredd\n| In the future, after the Earth has suffered massive damage, the statue is seen in the middle of Mega-City 1 and its new base is the location of the confidential Janus laboratories. The statue is shown in a derelict state, with a massive hole in the left side of her forehead.\n|-\n| 1996\n| Independence Day\n| The statue is first seen after a satellite crashes into the aliens' arriving mothership and the camera points at her tablet to indicate July IV, Independence Day. The statue is also seen being covered in the shadow of an alien destroyer that arrives in New York City. After the aliens destroy New York City, the statue is seen toppled into the river.\n|-\n| 1997\n| The Fifth Element\n| In this futuristic thriller film, the statue can be briefly spotted as an interstellar spaceship takes off over New York Harbor. The sea level has lowered drastically so that Liberty Island is now connected directly to the mainland. The statue also has a new pedestal, roughly five times its present height.\n|-\n|1998\n|Guilty Gear\n|The Statue of Liberty is seen toppled in Sol Badguy's battle stage in Guilty Gear, presumably as a result of the Crusades, a war between humanity and biological weapons known as Gears which takes place between the 21st and 22nd centuries. In Guilty Gear Xrd, it is seen being repaired or replaced by a largely identical statue as part of the Neo New York stage.\n|-\n| 1998\n| Deep Impact\n| The statue is toppled by a megatsunami created by a comet impact, which also pushes her severed head into the streets of New York City.\n|-\n| 1999\n| Aftershock: Earthquake in New York\n| The pedestal collapses during an earthquake, causing the statue to topple. At the end of the film, it is shown being rebuilt a year after the disaster. The statue's severed head is seen in New York harbor on the film's poster.\n|-\n| 2000\n| The Busy World of Richard Scarry episode \"The Big Apple Christmas Caper\"\n| The statue is depicted as an anthropomorphic pig. A villain piloting a blimp with a giant magnet attached to it uses it to rip the crown and torch off, along with many other pieces of New York City, like skyscraper spires and vehicles. After the villain's plan is foiled, the torch and crown fall into the streets of the city. Later, in an error of continuity, the torch and crown are shown to have fallen on top of skyscrapers, and the spire of the Chrysler Building is shown to have fallen onto the head of the statue, which makes it look like it has a new crown.\n|-\n| 2001\n| A.I. Artificial Intelligence\n| The statue is seen submerged in the ocean up to the bottom of the torch due to sea level rise as a result of global warming.\n|-\n|2004\n| The Day After Tomorrow\n| The statue is hit by a massive storm surge, submerging her in the ocean up to her thigh, and is later shown to have frozen due to climate change. The statue also appeared in two posters for the film which showed her portrayed differently than in the film. One showed her being hit by the storm surge; another showed her frozen. Both showed her submerged up to her nose and incorrectly facing west toward New Jersey, with the New York skyline to her right. The writer and director of the film, Roland Emmerich, later confided that the Statue of Liberty would, in fact, have been toppled by the force of the massive amount of water flowing around it, but said he wanted to leave it standing in the film in order to create a symbol of American values that stood up to the forces of nature.\n|-\n| 2004\n| Godzilla: Final Wars\n| The statue is seen destroyed after Rodan destroys New York City.\n|-\n| 2005\n| Category 7: The End of the World\n| The statue is hit by a storm surge and destroyed by a tornado due to global warming. The torch is ripped off by the tornado and thrown into the streets of New York City. The statue is also seen being hit by the storm surge in two different posters for the film.\n|-\n| 2006\n| Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\n| Superman is kicked into the torch of the statue by General Zod, destroying it. The destruction is later reversed when Superman turns back time to repair the damage caused by the three supervillains.\n|-\n| 2006\n| Children of Men\n| In a public service announcement stating that the whole world has fallen into chaos with the sole exception of the United Kingdom, the statue is briefly seen being destroyed in a nuclear bomb attack on New York City.\n|-\n| 2008\n| Life After People Season 1 Episode 1 \"The Bodies Left Behind\"\n| The pilot episode of the series shows the statue slowly deteriorating until about 300 years after the human race ceases to exist. After the 300 years (approx.) have passed, the steel connecting the \"skin\" of Lady Liberty to the main steel frame begins to fail, causing the torch arm and face to fall into the harbor. The narrator suggests it continues on like this until the entire structure collapses. The narrator also suggests that it is possible that the imprint of the arm and face on the ocean floor might become fossilized.\n|-\n| 2008\n| Aftermath: Population Zero\n| Similar to Life After People, although the statue is shown deteriorating at a faster rate. Beginning to collapse after 230 years rather than 300, large sections of the statue collapse in stages soon after each other, rather than slowly peeling away as in Life After People. After 1,000 years, only the pedestal still stands, and could last for thousands of more years, until it is eventually crushed by moving glaciers in an ice age. The statue is seen with her torch arm broken off on the poster.\n|-\n| 2008\n| Cloverfield\n| The statue is decapitated by a giant monster and its head is thrown by the monster into the streets of New York City. The decapitated statue is later seen from the Brooklyn Bridge. According to the Special Investigation Mode on the Blu-Ray, the monster was attempting to eat the statue and threw the head after discovering it was inedible. The film's poster also features the decapitated statue. The artwork on the back cover of the DVD and Blu-Ray cases of the film shows an image of the statue's severed head in the streets of New York, although it's not as damaged as it is in the actual film.\n|-\n| 2008\n| NYC: Tornado Terror\n| A tornado forms over the statue, ripping the torch off. The statue is also seen with her torch arm broken off on the film's poster, as well as her tablet arm (although she doesn't lose her tablet arm in the actual film). The poster seems to resemble the Cloverfield poster and Joseph Pennell's iconic 1918 World War I recruiting poster.\n|-\n| 2012\n| Iron Sky\n| The statue is destroyed by the Nazis when they invade New York City.\n|-\n| 2013\n| Oblivion\n| The statue is seen buried up to her torch in a canyon sixty years after the destruction of New York City in an alien invasion. In a flashback seen earlier in the film showing New York City before its destruction, the statue can be seen intact from the Empire State Building's observation deck.\n|-\n| 2018\n| The Man in the High Castle Season 3 Episode 5 \"The New Colossus\" and Episode 10 \"Jahr Null\"\n| In Episode 5 of Season 3, titled The New Colossus, a plan is made by the Nazis to demolish the statue as part of a campaign to destroy American icons, to be replaced by a Hitler Youth monument. In Episode 10 of the same season, titled Jahr Null, the plan is implemented and the statue is destroyed by missiles fired by Nazi aircraft in a spectacular ceremony involving fireworks and set to the strains of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The missiles hit the pedestal, causing it and the statue to collapse onto Bedloe's Island, while the torch arm falls and sinks into New York harbor.\n|}\nReferences"
