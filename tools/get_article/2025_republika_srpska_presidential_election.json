The elections were announced by the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the premature removal of then-President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik from office by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 June 2025. Dodik and his party, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, rejected the court's decision and initially refused to take part in the election. However, the party later confirmed that it will participate.\nBackground\nIn February 2025, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik was convicted by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in a first-instance verdict and was sentenced to one year imprisonment, and was also banned from performing the duties of the president of Republika Srpska for six years due to anti-constitutional conduct. Dodik refused to recognize the ruling and introduced laws barring federal law enforcement agencies from operating in Republika Srpska, prompting the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina to issue arrest warrants against him and other senior officials of Republika Srpska in March 2025.\nOn 4 July 2025, Dodik voluntarily appeared before the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The hearing was conducted following a motion submitted by the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Acting upon the motion, the Court issued a decision revoking the previously ordered arrest warrant against Dodik, replacing it with a precautionary measure only requiring him to report periodically to a designated state authority.\nOn 1 August 2025, the first-instance verdict against Dodik from February of that year was confirmed by the court's Appellate panel. On 6 August, the Central Election Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina ordered Dodik's removal as president of Republika Srpska, a decision which would take effect after an appeals period expired. On 12 August, the Bosnian state court commuted his one year prison sentence to a fine of 36,500 Bosnian marks. On 18 August, Dodik's appeal against the decision of the Central Election Commission was rejected and his mandate as Republika Srpska president was officially terminated, with the termination date marked as 12 June 2025, due to the Bosnian state court's verdict becoming legally binding on that day. The National Assembly of Republika Srpska rejected the court's decision and supported Dodik as the president.\nCandidates\nThe Central Election Commission announced that early presidential elections will be held on 23 November 2025.\nDodik, who is also the leader of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), the largest party in the entity, said that the SNSD would not participate in the election. He later changed his stance, stating that there is \"no problem with the SNSD having a candidate in the elections.\" The SNSD eventually confirmed that it will participate in the election, and on 30 September, Dodik announced that Siniša Karan will be its candidate in the election.\nThe largest opposition party, the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) supported the participation in the election. Minor opposition leaders, Jelena Trivić of the People's Front and Nebojša Vukanović of For Justice and Order, announced that they would support the SDS candidate in the election. On 28 September 2025, the SDS announced the candidacy of Branko Blanuša, a university professor, for president of Republika Srpska.\nDraško Stanivuković, the leader of the second largest opposition party, the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP), said his party would also boycott the election, and reiterated this position after both the SNSD and the SDS announced their candidates.\nReferences"
