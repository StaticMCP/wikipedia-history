The series premiered on 10 October 2015 on BBC Two. After co-producing the second series, Netflix acquired the series in 2018. The series concluded on 9 March 2022 after five series for a total of 46 episodes. A feature-length sequel that concluded the series story, titled Seven Kings Must Die, premiered on 14 April 2023 on Netflix.\nPremise\nSeries One\nProduced by the BBC, the first series adapts the first two novels of Bernard Cornwell's series of novels The Saxon Stories, The Last Kingdom and The Pale Horseman. The series covers the years 866–878 where the arrival of the Great Heathen Army in England led by Guthrum and Ubba Ragnarsson redefines the relationship between Vikings and Anglo-Saxons. Following the establishment of Danish rule, Uhtred, a Saxon raised by the Danes, comes to the aid of the kingdom of Wessex and its ruler King Alfred with the hope of eventually retaking his home of Bebbanburg as ongoing Viking incursions attempt to conquer the whole of England.\nThe eight-episode first series premiered on BBC Two on 10 October 2015 and concluded on 28 November 2015.\nSeries Two\nThe second series adapts Cornwell's third and fourth novels The Lords of the North and Sword Song. The series covers the years 879–886 and deals with Uhtred's quest in Northumbria to defeat his old enemy Kjartan the Cruel whilst the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia combat the invading Norse brothers Sigefrid and Eric.\nThe eight-episode second series premiered on BBC Two on 15 March 2017 and concluded on 4 May 2017.\nSeries Three\nThe third series adapts Cornwell's fifth and sixth novels The Burning Land and Death of Kings, although there are significant plot changes from the novels compared to the previous two series. The series covers the years 892–902 and deals with the end of King Alfred's reign while the conflict between the Saxons and the Danes grows after the arrival of the Second Great Danish Army led by the coalition of Viking warlords including Ragnar the Younger, Cnut, Sigurd Bloodhair and Haesten.\nThe ten-episode third series premiered in its entirety on Netflix on 19 November 2018.\nSeries Four\nThe fourth series adapts Cornwell's seventh and eighth novels The Pagan Lord and The Empty Throne. Similar to series three, there are significant plot changes from the novels. The series covers the years 909–911 and deals with the early years of King Edward's reign over the Saxons, ongoing political struggles in Mercia and the Second Great Danish Army's continued invasion of Wessex that culminates in the Siege of Wintanceaster.\nThe ten-episode fourth series premiered in its entirety on Netflix on 26 April 2020.\nSeries Five\nThe fifth series adapts Cornwell's ninth and tenth novels Warriors of the Storm and The Flame Bearer, and includes elements of the eleventh novel War of the Wolf. Similar to series three and four, there are significant plot changes from the novels. The series covers the years 917–920 and deals with the disputed lines of succession in Wessex and Mercia, conflict with the remaining Vikings in Northumbria led by Uhtred's son-in-law Sigtryggr, and Uhtred returning to Bebbanburg once more to finally achieve his destiny.\nThe ten-episode fifth and final series premiered in its entirety on Netflix on 9 March 2022.\nFilm\nThe film Seven Kings Must Die adapts Cornwell's thirteenth and final novel of The Saxon Stories, War Lord, and includes elements of the twelfth novel Sword of Kings, giving a final sendoff to Uhtred of Bebbanburg. The film covers the year 937 and deals with the fallout following the death of King Edward as his disputed heir Aethelstan seizes the throne of England and ignites a war with an alliance of Kings that decides the future of England.\nThe film was written by Martha Hillier and directed by Edward Bazalgette. It premiered on Netflix on 14 April 2023.\nCast and characters\nCast table\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Character\n! colspan=\"5\" | Series\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | 1\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | 2\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | 3\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | 4\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | 5\n|-\n| Alexander Dreymon || Uhtred of Bebbanburg || colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Tobias Santelmann || Ragnar the Younger || colspan=\"3\"  || colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| Emily Cox|| Brida || colspan=\"5\"\n|-\n| Thomas W.

It was produced by Carnival Films for BBC Two and BBC America. Nick Murphy (Prey, Occupation) served as co-executive producer and directed multiple episodes. For portrayals of the Vikings at sea, the Viking ship replica Havhingsten fra Glendalough was used. The series was filmed primarily in Hungary, with most scenes at the eight acres near Budapest owned by Korda Studios with its Medieval Village Set and surrounding mountains, forests and lakes.\nFilming for the second series began in Budapest in June 2016. Richard Rankin, Gerard Kearns, Thure Lindhardt, Millie Brady, Erik Madsen, and Peter McDonald joined the cast. In August 2016, Aftonbladet reported that Swedish actors Björn Bengtsson and Magnus Samuelsson would join the main cast. Also that month, it was reported that Stephen Butchard would return as the sole script writer and that Netflix had signed on as an international co-production partner for the second series.\nIn April 2018, Netflix confirmed that a third series was in production, based on the books The Lords of the North and Sword Song, which would air exclusively on the streaming service, and Bernard Cornwell indicated that he had been offered a cameo appearance. Swedish actor Ola Rapace joined the cast for series 3, as Jarl Harald Bloodhair. Swedish director Erik Leijonborg was behind the camera for series 3; he has collaborated with Rapace on several Swedish TV series.\nOn 26 December 2018, the series was renewed for a fourth series by Netflix. On 7 July 2020, the series was renewed for a fifth series by Netflix. On 30 April 2021, it was announced that the series would conclude with the fifth series. Filming for series 5 wrapped in June 2021.\nThe final series was followed by a feature-length film titled Seven Kings Must Die, which completed filming on 19 March 2022. It premiered on Netflix on 14 April 2023.\nHistorical background\nThe main events of the reign of Alfred the Great and his heirs are well recorded, and a number of men called Uhtred ruled from Bamburgh Castle, most notably Uhtred the Bold more than a century later. The people identified as \"Danes\" came from many places in and around Denmark, including Southern Sweden and Norway. Historians believe that the Danish invaders of Northumbria came from Jutland in Denmark, as mentioned in Cornwell's books, as well as some of the Danish islands and East Denmark (present-day southern Sweden).\nRelease\nThe first series of eight episodes premiered on 10 October 2015 in the United States on BBC America, and was broadcast shortly after in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 22 October 2015. It became available online in the United States via Netflix on 6 July 2016. It was added to Netflix on 28 December 2015 in the following countries: Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. The first series was broadcast in the Spanish region of Catalonia on TV3 on 24 July 2017.\nThe second and third series were released on Netflix in the US, Canada, Denmark, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Spain, Japan, Australia, and Portugal.\nNetflix was the sole distributor of the third series of ten episodes, produced by Carnival Films. On 26 December 2018, Netflix renewed the show for a fourth series, released on 26 April 2020 and once again produced by Carnival Films. It was renewed for a fifth and final series on 7 July 2020. On 9 February 2022, it was announced that the fifth series would be released on 9 March 2022.\nReception\nThe series has been met with a positive critical response, with praise for its cast performances, cinematography, writing, directing, and action sequences. On Rotten Tomatoes, series one holds an 87% approval rating based on reviews from 31 critics, with an average of 7.61/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Last Kingdom fuses beautiful cinematography and magnificent action sequences to create highly gratifying historical drama\". On Metacritic, series 1 has a score of 78/100 based on 15 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second series received an 86% approval rating based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10, while the third series received a 100% approval rating based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10.\nSam Wollaston reviewed the first episode in The Guardian and warned, \"It's wise not to get too attached to anyone in The Last Kingdom\". Charlotte Runcie gave the opening episode four out of five in The Daily Telegraph, writing that the series had \"satisfyingly high production values, a bloodthirsty appetite for violence and a proper cliffhanger.\" Wollaston and Runcie both remarked on the similarities between The Last Kingdom and Game of Thrones. Kari Croop of Common Sense Media also gave the series 4/5 stars, writing: \"With high production values, strong writing, and compelling characters, this series rivals some of the best and bloodiest epics on TV\". Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the first series a grade of B+, writing: \"BBC America's sprawling, arresting eight-part historical miniseries The Last Kingdom proves that there's room enough on television for more than one Viking invasion.\"\nSean O'Grady in The Independent found that some of the language gave the series \"a satisfyingly earthy quality\", but he thought that the plot was \"a little convoluted\". The television reviewer for Private Eye was more critical, arguing that The Last Kingdom demonstrates how Game of Thrones \"haunts the BBC\", and that the series was directly derivative of both fantasy series and European dramas such as The Killing and Wallander, yet lacking the features that have made such series successful.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.thelastkingdom.tv The Last Kingdom] Official Website\n*\n* [http://www.bbcamerica.com/the-last-kingdom/ The Last Kingdom] at BBC America\n* [https://www.netflix.com/title/80074249The Last Kingdom] on Netflix\n*\n*\n*"
