In March 2015, she won 'Best Songwriter' for the third year in a row – the first artist to do so, which Brett Cottle (APRA AMCOS CEO) described as \"unprecedented, and very likely, a never-to-be-repeated achievement by one of our most talented songwriters.\" As of May 2025, the APRA AMCOS (which consists of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS)) recognized that 15 songs written or co-written by Sia (Chandelier, Cheap Thrills, Titanium, Diamonds, Elastic Heart, The Greatest, Alive, Dusk Till Dawn, Chained to the Rhythm, Wild Ones, Flashlight, Thunderclouds, She Wolf (Falling to Pieces), Try Everything and Flames) had each surpassed one billion streams across various platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, etc.).
