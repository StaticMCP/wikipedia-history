      "text": "# List of Shaman King chapters\n\nThe chapters of the manga series Shaman King were written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Takei. They were serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1998 to 2004. The series follows the story of Yoh Asakura, a shaman who enters into a worldwide tournament of shamans in which the winner would become the savior of the world.\nThe 285 chapters, identified as \"Reincarnations,\" were collected into 32 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha. The first volume was published on December 3, 1998, and volume 32 on January 5, 2005. The first 31 volumes were published once the serialization ended, but the publishing of volume 32 (meant to be published on December 3, 2004) was delayed as Shueisha reported they would only publish it if they receive evidence of demand from approximately 50,000 people.\nDuring Jump Festa 2008, Shueisha announced a kanzenban reprint of the entire series. The series is called Shaman King Kanzen-Ban, or Perfect Edition. This release reprinted the entire series in 27 volumes, complete with new, clear image overlays on the covers, and concluding with an alternative ending. Without the original chapter 285, the kanzenban has sixteen additional chapters and 300 chapters in total. The first volume was published on March 3, 2008, and volume 27 was published on April 3, 2009.\nShaman King was previously licensed in North America by Viz Media for an English-language adaptation, with some chapters initially serialized in its Shonen Jump magazine. The series first appeared in Shonen Jumps third issue from 2003, and last in its September 2007 issue. Viz Media published the original 32 Shaman King volumes: the first was published on September 3, 2003, and the last on January 4, 2011. On July 21, 2020, Kodansha USA announced that they held the rights to Shaman King in English, and they would release all 35 volumes via Comixology and Amazon Kindle Store in July of that year, however it was delayed to October 6 of the same year. Kodansha USA also announced that they would release the series physically in twelve three-in-one omnibus editions. The first volume was published on March 23, 2021, while the last was released on March 7, 2023.\nVolume list\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-872644-1\n| LicensedRelDate = September 3, 2003\n| LicensedISBN    = 978-1-56931-902-4\n| ChapterList     =\n*Reincarnation 001.\n*Reincarnation 002.\n*Reincarnation 003.\n*Reincarnation 004.\n*Reincarnation 005.\n*Reincarnation 006.\n*Reincarnation 007.\n*Reincarnation 008.\n* Special Info! \"Ryu's Companions on His Search for the 'Happy Place'!\"\n| LicensedTitle   = A Shaman in Tokyo\n| OriginalTitle   = 幽霊と踊る男\n| TranslitTitle   = The Boy Who Dances with Ghosts (Yūrei to odoru otoko)\n| Summary         = When Manta Oyamada, a middle-school student from Tokyo finds a shaman, Yoh Asakura, playing with ghosts in a graveyard, he hopes to learn more about him.

However, as they try to find more allies, they only attract the attention of the shaman Ren Tao, whose current partner is Bason, a Chinese warrior.  When Yoh refuses to allow Ren to take Amidamaru to aid him in becoming the \"Shaman King\", the two young shamans engage in a fight against each other.
