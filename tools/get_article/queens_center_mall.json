Queens Center Mall is the largest mall in Queens. It is currently owned and managed by The Macerich Company, who purchased the mall in the 1990s. The building where JCPenney and Burlington are located is separately owned by Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp, yet it is interconnected with the Macerich-owned main portion of the mall.\nThere are over 150 stores located at the center. The mall's current anchor tenants are Macy's, Primark, and JCPenney. A large food court is located in the lower level where Fast food restaurants such as Charleys Philly Steaks, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle Mexican Grill, KFC, Kido Sushi, Noodle House, Panda Express, Sarku Japan, and Shake Shack operate.\nThe mall has a gross leasable area of .\nThe mall is adjacent to the Woodhaven Boulevard station () on the IND Queens Boulevard Line of the New York City Subway. It is across the street from the former St. John's Queens Hospital and the Rock Church. It is also adjacent to Exit 19 of the Long Island Expressway.\nHistory\nQueens Center Mall opened on September 12, 1973, on land previously occupied by a children's amusement park named Fairyland, a supermarket, and automobile parking. The original anchor tenants were Abraham & Straus and Ohrbach's. The mall underwent a major expansion from 2002 to 2004, nearly doubling in size as the original mall was renovated and another wing was added to the east of 92nd Street.\nFor a limited time during the 2006 Christmas shopping season, the Macy's location in Queens Center was open 24 hours a day, becoming the first to do so. Since then, it has had all-day operating hours during every Christmas shopping season.\nOn March 8, 2019, the mall was evacuated when a supposed appearance by The Bronx rapper, A Boogie wit da Hoodie was canceled after fans, most of whom were high school teens that had a half day of school rioted and looted stores, including the sneaker store, Foot Locker. The mall reopened the next day.\nThe mall underwent renovations during the mid-2020s. This included upgrades to furnishings, lighting, and the parking lots.\nAnchor tenants\nCurrent\n*JCPenney (Opened in 1989)\n*Macy's (Opened in 1995)\n*Primark (Opened in 2024)\nFormer\n*Ohrbach's (Opened in 1973.
