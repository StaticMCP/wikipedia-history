It operates 25 schools including two specialized partial-day high schools that draw from the other schools within the district.\nHistory\nWarren Consolidated was formed by 1941, when the North school became part of it. Also known as the Berz school,  it was located on the West side of Mound just South of 15 Mile Road. That school was sold in August 1952. The district was led by superintendent James Clor from 1999 until November 2007. Dr. Robert D. Livernois took over as superintendent in April 2008 after leaving his former district and district neighbor, Warren Woods School District. On March 7, 2024 Dr. Livernois told the Community that he decided to retire from the district at the end of the summer - effective August 30, 2024.\nOn May 2, 2024 Walled Lake Consolidated Schools superintendent Dr. John C. Bernia was appointed as the new superintendent of Warren Consolidated Schools, replacing Dr. Livernois on August 30, 2024.\nBoard of education\n*Brian White (Current)\n*Kyle Johnson (Current)\n*Leah A.
