The school has more than 1,900 students and is one of the oldest schools in Hong Kong. Students take IGCSEs/GCSEs followed by the International Baccalaureate Diploma or the British BTEC programme. There is a Learning Enhancement Centre (LEC) for students with learning difficulties. The campus has an area of . The school is one of three ESF secondary schools in Kowloon and the New Territories, the others being Sha Tin College and Renaissance College.\nHistory\nPre-WWII period\nKGV is the oldest of all schools in the English Schools Foundation, as well as the oldest international school in Hong Kong. It first opened in 1894 on Nathan Road, and originally catered for the children of British people living in Kowloon. At the time, the school occupied just one small building. It was destroyed in a typhoon in 1896, and Kowloon College opened in its place in 1902. A major opening ceremony took place and was attended by many of Hong Kong's elite, including Major General Gascoigne, the Apostolic Vicar of the territory's diocese Louis Piazzoli, and the Colonial Secretary J.H. Stewart Lockhart. The school was built using donations from Hong Kong businessman Sir Robert Hotung. The school was subsequently renamed the Kowloon British School, then the Central British School, and later King George V School.\nBy 1930, the number of students in the school had grown to 300. Wooden huts were built at the back of the school to create extra classrooms. The playground was only . The then-headmaster, Mr. Nightingale, asked for and acquired a new and bigger school site, designed by teacher Thomas Rowell. Classes at the new site began on 14 September 1936. The first headmaster of KGV was Reverend Upsdell, and the foundation stone for the new building was laid by Sir William Peel, the governor of Hong Kong at the time. The building has subsequently been named the Peel Block in his honor.\nSino-Japanese War\nIn 1937, the Japanese invaded China and many women and children were evacuated from Shanghai to Hong Kong. They needed a place to stay, and the school was used as a refugee camp. However, as the Japanese neared Hong Kong, the government ordered the evacuation of most women and children from Hong Kong. Thereafter, the school was used by British forces as a hospital. When Hong Kong surrendered in the Battle of Hong Kong, the school site was taken over by the Japanese and used as a hospital for prisoners of war.\nPost-WWII period\nAfter the war, the school reopened in 1946, and in 1947 the school opened its doors to students of all nationalities. In 1948, the school's name was officially changed to King George V School.\nIn 1979, principal Angela Smith decided that KGV should join the English Schools Foundation, and the transfer was complete by 1981. KGV is currently the oldest active school in the ESF.\nAdditional Information\nIn 2009, musician Mika visited King George V School. He viewed the artwork based on his music (created by Advanced Diploma students) and helped finish a mural on the B-block wall, painting \"I am not what you think I am / I am made of gold.\" He followed by performing Grace Kelly for the students.\nA truncated body of a Spitfire aircraft was placed in a classroom of the school up until the 1950s. It was stored in the basement of the pavilion, until the Air Commodore had it removed, restored and later placed it at the Cenotaph in Central for Remembrance Day.\nStudents and the House System\nA group of senior students at KGV\nThere are more than 1,850 students of around 28 different nationalities enrolled in the school. Students are accepted from many ESF feeder primary schools in the English Schools Foundation such as Kowloon Junior School and Beacon Hill School.\nKGV, like many British schools, has a house system with four colors. This system is used in inter-school events and competitions.\nThe houses, and their associated colours, are as follows:\n*Crozier (green) – named after Douglas Crozier, a KGV teacher who fought for British Hong Kong in WWII, and whom went on to serve as the Director of Education of Hong Kong. He also served on the Executive Council of Hong Kong, and was an official member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.\n*Nightingale (yellow) – the headmaster who first asked for a new school building, which is now the current school site.\n*Rowell (blue) – a teacher who designed part of the current site of the school.\n*Upsdell (red) – the first headmaster in post in the school building at the current school site.\nCurriculum\nThe curriculum adopted by KGV, as an international school, is different from the DSE examination system used in public schools.\nMiddle School Curriculum\nThe Middle School Curriculum is designed for Years 7 to 9. All subjects (Art, Drama, English, History, Information Technology, Mathematics, Music, Media, Physical Education, Religious Studies, Geography, Science, and Design Technology) are compulsory, and students must learn Mandarin and a European language (French, German or Spanish). In Year 9, students can choose to drop either language they are studying for Global Perspectives, or take double Chinese if the European language is dropped. A coherent skills based curriculum is being introduced in 2014.\nIn Year 7, students are not put into academically levelled sets apart from Maths and Chinese classes because it is considered as a \"transition\" year, offering a wide variety of \"inquiry\" opportunities, transitioning from the \"PYP\" inquiry format learning to KGV's Middle School Curriculum.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ MYP\n|-\n!

All students have to complete the core syllabus, consisting of an Extended Essay, Theory of Knowledge and Creativity, Activity, Service, as well as six subjects, wherein subjects in First Language, Second Language, Individuals and Societies, Science and Mathematics are required. Artistic or creative subjects are also offered, though these are optional.\nBTEC\nFrom September 2011 the school replaced the A-Level Programme (which was an option for students who did not want to take IB) with the BTEC International Diploma, a vocational course.\nSports\nKGV is well known for its sporting ability. Games often take place on the campus as the school has an official size AstroTurf playing field for football and rugby. In 2008 and 2009, KGV were back-to-back winners of the Bauhinia Bowl, becoming the best co-educational sporting school in Hong Kong for the academic year. KGV has won 21 Bauhinia Bowls, the most of any co-educational school in Hong Kong, and 25 male and 20 female KGV alumni are winners of the Bauhinia Bowl's sportsboy/sportsgirl of the year award. KGV's school trophies are displayed in a trophy cabinet outside the assembly hall and records of individual and team accomplishments are preserved in a section of the school library.\nRugby\nLike many British schools, rugby has been played at KGV almost since the school's opening. During the 2007/08 school year, the A-Grade boys' rugby team won the 15s, 10s and 7s rugby tournament; a feat never done before in KGV history. This team included many Hong Kong rugby players and the 2010 Larry Abel award winner; Aiden Bradley.\nThe women's team includes many Hong Kong Bauhinia U16 rugby representatives, as well as players for the Hong Kong U18 Development and U18 Nationals. In 2013 the women's team won the cup against the Hong Kong Standard Charter Select team in the first Bill Williams 7s tournament with a women's section.\nCricket\nCricket has been a very popular sport with KGV students for many years, with strong Junior and Senior teams. The KGV Junior Boys won the Hong Kong Schools league in May 2018.\nFootball\nFootball has been a traditional sport at KGV for a long time.\nThe school often takes part in the Jing Ying Inter-School Football Tournament which is regarded as the elite football tournament within Hong Kong with the best school teams participating.

In the 2023-24 season, the B-Grade boys' basketball team also won the ISSFHK Silver Division 2 championship.\nNetball\nThe netball team at KGV has been one of the school's best performing athletic teams. The teams are divided according to A, B, C grade depending on the player's age.\nSwimming\nThe girls and boys swimming teams compete separately in the annual Hong Kong Schools Sports Foundation (HKSSF) interschool competition, with the girls team achieving a promotion to the Division 1 competition in 2018 and the boys team continuing to perform strongly in Division 2. KGV has produced many swimmers who have won podium places in their events at the HKSSF swimming competitions.\nAdditionally, KGV swimmers regularly represent the English Schools Foundation at the annual Wheelock Swim for Millions charity race organised by the community chest. 2015 marked KGV's best showing in the competition with the boys opens team winning the school relay and the overall competition while the staff team came third in the corporate relay.\nFacilities\nBuildings\nPeel Block\nKGV Peel Block – during Karnival 2004\nCompleted in 1937, this block is named after Sir William Peel, the Governor of Hong Kong from 1930 to 1935. His name can be found on the foundation stone at the north-east corner of the building. This is the first block built on the present school site. It is protected under Hong Kong law because of its age and historical significance. The Peel Block is the administrative centre of KGV.\nHall\nThe hall is used for assemblies, special exhibitions and performances.\nNew Block\nSituated on the south side of the campus, the New Block, completed in 1964, is three stories tall and currently houses the Language department along with the Design and Technology department.\nActivities Centre\nCompleted in 1983, the Activities Centre formerly consisted of two drama studios, a drama office, and PE changing rooms. The Activities Centre now houses one of three art studios on campus and three PE rooms.\nLink Block\nBuilt in 1984, this five-story building links the New Block, the Peel Block and the Activities Centre, with covered walkways on connecting floors. The building houses both the Maths and English departments along with some DT and Art classrooms.\nJockey Club Sarah Roe Centre\nThe Jockey Club Sarah Roe Centre (JCSRC) was built in 1986 with funds donated from the then Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club and named after Sarah Roe, an occupational therapist, who was a founder of the Child Development Centre at the Matilda Hospital. The Jockey Club Sarah Roe School, originally on the ground floor, was later relocated into the Senior Student Centre.\nSarah Roe School / Senior Student Centre / Vertical Extension / IS Block\nCompleted in 1996, the original building was erected on the footprint of KGV's two tennis courts, which were re-homed atop the building's roof. The Hong Kong Jockey Club Sarah Roe School is located on the first floor, and this facility educates students with special needs across the English Schools Foundation. KGV's Individuals and Society department occupies the remaining floors.\nScience Block\nThe Science Block is a five-story building with a roof garden built in 2013. The building houses the Science department along with two Media classrooms. The Guilford Lecture Theatre occupies the bottom floor.\nPerforming Arts Block\nBuilt in 2013, the Performing Arts Block is a five-story building built on the former canteen area and PTSA store, behind the Peel Block and beside the Swimming Pool. The building hosts a canteen, the Music Department, drama studios and changing rooms. Similar to the Science Block, the Performing Arts Centre has a rooftop centre; the rooftop garden includes a small amphitheater for any performing uses.\nPavilion\nBuilt in 1940, this block occupies the south-west corner of the school field. Originally equipped with two changing rooms with showers (through the rest of the 20th century), they were converted into two classrooms (X1 and X2), leaving the storage and maintenance sheds on the ground floor. The classrooms have now been converted back into changing rooms.\nOther facilities\nSchool Field\nKGV's artificially turfed field is ESF's multipurpose sports facility. It has markings for various sports, such as rugby, football (soccer), hockey, and also has a long & triple jump track running the perimeter of the field. The field itself is 100 metres long, and is flanked on its school side by a 100-metre-long sprint track and seating facilities for students.\nThe field was reopened on 29 April 2014 after a HK$34 million renovation. On the opening day, 575 students broke the Guinness World Record of 'Most Participants in a Beep Test', previously held by a college in Australia. This is the second world record broken by the school, the other being 'Most People Planking Simultaneously' with 1,549 students on 16 December 2011. In 2014, the field was rebuilt and to celebrate, the school went for the world record of Most People Participating in the Multi-Stage Fitness Test. A then-record of 575 beep test participants out of the 587 participants who started successfully completed the required number of intervals. This record was ratified by the Guinness World Records until it was broken by AFC Harrogate in 2017.\nVolleyball and Basketball Courts\nThere are two courts in the Peel Block, one for volleyball and the other for basketball. They are used by the students during recess and also see use in certain interschool events.\nPride Gym\nThe Pride Gym is a covered, air-conditioned gym room located outside the Pavilion.\nSwimming Pool\nBuilt in 1979, the school's swimming pool is located behind the Peel Block. It is a 22-metre swimming pool with six lanes, normally in operation from April to November.\nFuture site development\nThere were plans to amalgamate King George V School, Jockey Club Sarah Roe School and Kowloon Junior School to allow the three schools to grow further and work more closely given the close proximity of the three schools. This project was known as the Kowloon Learning Campus (KLC). This caused over 100 parents to sign a petition against the KLC in 2015. The then-KGV Principal Dr. Edward Wickins was appointed as the executive principal of the KLC who often informed the students of KGV of the progress of the KLC. However, in 2017 the ESF Board announced that the same goals the KLC would work to achieve would have also worked with three separate schools. Hence, the project was scrapped, and Dr. Edward Wickins retired after twelve years at KGV that same year.\nNotable alumni\n:See also :Category:Alumni of King George V School, Hong Kong\n*Kemal Bokhary – former Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal\n*Martin Booth – author of over 70 books and poems, including Industry of Souls, Music on the Bamboo Radio, and Gweilo: Memoirs of a Hong Kong childhood.\n*Tim Bredbury – professional footballer.
