Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nNew Hampshire voted for incumbent Federalist President John Adams over Democratic-Republican Vice President Thomas Jefferson, this is one of  re–match presidential elections because both candidates were faced in the 1796 presidential election. However, Thomas Jefferson would win the national presidential election. Making this presidential election as the first time New Hampshire voted for a losing candidate in its presidential voting history.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1800 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#EA9978; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Federalist\n|John Adams (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" |–\n| align=\"right\" |–\n| align=\"right\" |6\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican\n|Thomas Jefferson\n| align=\"right\" |–\n| align=\"right\" |–\n| align=\"right\" |–\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |–\n| align=\"right\" |–\n| align=\"right\" |6\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New Hampshire\nReferences"
