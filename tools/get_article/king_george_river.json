The river descends  over its  course, including a  descent over the dual drop waterfall of King George Falls, approximately  upriver from the river mouth. The falls are located at an elevation of  above sea level.\nThe recorded height of the waterfall varies widely, with some sources claiming the descent is in the range of . The area surrounding the falls are popular with tourists, who typically view the falls by boat. The falls are in full force from late December through to early May each year and gradually recede to a small flow in September. The falls were featured in Baz Luhrmann's 2008 film, Australia.\nEtymology\nThe river was named in 1911 by explorer Charles Conigrave after a privately funded expedition in the area. The river is named in honour of King George V.\nSee also\n}}\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
