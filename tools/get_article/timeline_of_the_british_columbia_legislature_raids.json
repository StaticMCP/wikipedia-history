Images of officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Victoria Police Department hauling boxes of evidence were widely broadcast. The offices searched belonged to Dave Basi and Bob Virk, ministerial assistants to two cabinet ministers.  The main criminal trial ended in October 2010 with Virk and Basi pleading guilty to breach of trust. Public questions and controversies continue about payment of $6 million by government to cover their legal fees and whether more people were involved in the corruption activities.\nLead-up to the raid\n* Summer 2002: Victoria police and RCMP launch an investigation (project Everywhichway) involving drugs and organized crime. The probe centres on allegations of cocaine being shipped from Victoria and sold in Toronto.\n* May 13, 2003, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell announced that the government would sell the operations of BC Rail (including all of the assets other than the rail right-of-way).
