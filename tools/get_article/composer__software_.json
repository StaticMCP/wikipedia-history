It was developed by Nils Adermann and Jordi Boggiano, who continue to manage the project. They began development in April 2011 and first released it on March 1, 2012. Composer is strongly inspired by Node.js's \"npm\" and Ruby's \"bundler\". The project's dependency solving algorithm started out as a PHP-based port of openSUSE's libzypp SAT solver.\nComposer runs from the command line and installs dependencies (e.g. libraries) for an application. It also allows users to install PHP applications that are available on \"Packagist\" which is its main repository containing available packages. It also provides autoload capabilities for libraries that specify autoload information to ease usage of third-party code.\nSupported frameworks\n* Symfony version 2 and later\n* Laravel version 5 and later\n* CodeIgniter version 3.0 and later\n* CakePHP version 3.0 and later\n* FuelPHP version 2.0 and later\n* Drupal version 8 and later\n* TYPO3 version 6.2 and later\n* Neos Flow version 2.0 and later\n* Silverstripe version 3.0 later\n* Magento version 2.0 later\n* OpenMage version 20.0.0 and later\n* Yii version 1.1 and later\n* Laminas\n* Silex (web framework)\n* Lumen (web framework)\n*Adianti Framework  version 1 and later\nSee also\n*List of PHP software and tools\n*PEAR\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://github.com/composer/composer Composer on GitHub]\n* [https://getcomposer.org/doc/ Composer documentation]\n* [https://www.codementor.io/php/tutorial/composer-install-php-dependency-manager Composer Tutorial]\n* [https://packagist.org/ Packagist - the main Composer repository]\n*"
