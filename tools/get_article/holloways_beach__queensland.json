It is located about 10 kilometres north of the city of Cairns between the suburbs of Machans Beach and Yorkeys Knob. In the , Holloways Beach had a population of 2,398 people.\nHolloways Beach is impacted by noise from Cairns International Airport, which keeps real estate prices in check. From October 2023 to September 2024 the median price for houses has been $587,500 and for units $281,500. In 2022 the values were $540,000 and $259,000 respectively. However, waterfront properties come also here at a premium, with house well above the million dollar mark.\nGeography\nThe southeastern border with Machans Beach roughly follows Barr Creek, the opposite northwestern border with Yorkeys Knob is formed by Richter Creek. The southwestern border with the suburb of Barron follows the Captain Cook Highway. Directly on the other side of the highway is a sand quarry. The northeastern border is formed by the beach from which the suburb derives its name. It is approximately 1.8 kilometres long. About midpoint on the beach there is a stinger-resistant swimming enclosure. Stingers, more formally known as box jellyfish, pose a danger in the first half of the calendar year.\nThe beach s subject to heavy erosion. Since ca. 2020 several million dollars have been invested to save the beach. This includes the creation of two 30-metre rock groynes. This has not helped a lot, therefore more money is spent to replace the sand (\"sand nourishment\").\nOn the coast the land-use is mostly residential. From about 1300 metres inland farming is predominant.\nHistory\nHolloways Beach is situated in the traditional Djabugay (Tjapukai) Aboriginal country.\nRichard Holloway came to Cairns in 1910 and was farming in the area in 1926. The area was officially named Holloway in 1951 by the Queensland Surveyor-General, renamed Holloway Beach in 1971 and then Holloways Beach in 1981. In 2002, the area was gazetted as a suburb of Cairns rather than as a rural locality.\nLand was acquired in October 1951 for a school. However, in December 1951, a school bus service was established to take the students to Cairns Intermediate School and Cairns North State School. In October 1954, the Queensland Government allocated £2341 to relocate Woree's school buildings to Holloway's Beach and then repair and repaint the buildings. Holloway's Beach State School opened on 23 May 1955. It closed on 13 June 1966.\nDemographics\nIn the , the suburb of Holloways Beach had a population of 2,347 people.\nIn the , the suburb of Holloways Beach had a population of 2,398 people.\nEducation\nSchool children now attend Machans Beach State School or other schools further away.
