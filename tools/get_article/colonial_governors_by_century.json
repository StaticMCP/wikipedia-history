Where applicable, native rulers are also listed.\nFor the purposes of these lists, a current dependency is any entity listed on these lists of dependent territories and other entities. A dependent territory is normally a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside the controlling state's integral area. This latter condition distinguishes a dependent territory from an autonomous region or administrative division, which forms an integral part of the parent state. The administrators of uninhabited territories are excluded.\nLists\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 21st century\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 20th century\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 19th century\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 18th century\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 17th century\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 16th century\n* List of governors of dependent territories in the 15th century\nReferences"
