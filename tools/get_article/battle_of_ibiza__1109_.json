Islamic scholars have referred to the Norwegian raids in the region as part of a larger history of Islamic Spain. After winning a battle at the island of Formentera, Sigurd would go on to attack the islands of Ibiza, which is only separated from Formentera by a narrow channel.\nBattle\nThe battle was a raid by the crusader army from Norway against the pirates of Ibiza. The battle is described in the sagas as Sigurd the Crusader's seventh victory against the \"heathens\" (i.e. Muslims). A description of the battle was given by the skald Halldorr Skvaldri.\nAftermath\nAfter this, the Norwegian fleet continued their journey to the Holy Land via Menorca and Sicily before eventually reaching the Kingdom of Jerusalem, where they accompanied Baldwin I in the Siege of Sidon. These battles on the Balearic Islands influenced the 1113–1115 Balearic Islands expedition, which saw crusaders dismantle Ibiza's defences and occupy the island for a short while before leaving the island that would be later reconquered by the Almoravid dynasty.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
