Special effects convey the subjective experience of the experimental subject. The film's central premise is the search for ‘toxin x’, which is supposed to be at the root of all mental disorders. The medics believe that LSD will help them locate it.\nCast\n* Stanislav Grof\n* Petr Oliva\n* Vaclav Voska (Narrator)\nProduction\nThe whole film crew were also given LSD during filming. The experimental subject Oliva (who went on to become a prominent Czech actor) later recalled that the reason everyone was given the drug was because, “we had to see for ourselves what happens to a person [when they are given the drug].”\nExcerpts from the film appear in the documentary LSD made in ČSSR (2015) directed by Pavel Křemen.”\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
