After three years of development, the game launched in January 1987. In 1988, KJC Games launched the game in the United Kingdom with a limited run of 500 available positions. The game was moderately complex.\nGameplay\nThe game is closed-ended with players striving for the most victory points. The setting is a futuristic North America. Gameplay takes place in a crisis period after nuclear war in Europe. Twenty players led states with gameplay occurring on a hex map. Combat, diplomacy, and economics were elements of gameplay. Victory points could be achieved through a variety of methods. One player compared it to the game Earthwood. Victory could come individually (the most victory points) or through an alliance by meeting multiple conditions.\nReception\nStewart Wieck reviewed the game in a 1998 issue of White Wolf, stating that it was a, \"good, solid, and well-programmed game,\" and \"A good game on which to cut your PBM teeth.\" He rated it a 7 of 10 for Materials and Game Moderation, an 8 for Diplomacy, and a 9 for Strategy. Overall he rated the game at 8 of 10 points. Tim Sullivan reviewed the game in a 1988 issue of The D2 Report, calling it a \"high-energy, modern day wargame\".\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
