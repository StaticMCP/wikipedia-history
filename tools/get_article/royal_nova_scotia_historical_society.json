The Society is a voluntary organization that operates without an office or paid staff.  The Society first published the Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly and then the Nova Scotia Historical Review.  Eventually, the publication was named the Collections of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society and now it is known as the Journal of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society.\nNotable members\n*Thomas Beamish Akins (1809–1921), Nova Scotia's first Commissioner of Public Records.\n* Phyllis Blakeley (1922–1986), Provincial Archivist of Nova Scotia from 1982 to 1985.\n*John Forrest (1842–1920), President of Dalhousie University, who served as the Society's President from 1905 to 1906.\n*Archibald MacMechan (1862–1933), Professor at Dalhousie University.\n* Harry Piers (1870–1940), historian and curator at the Nova Scotia Museum.\nHistorical Plaques\nImage:Valley 244.jpg|Sir William Fenwick Williams, Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia\nFile:SirJohnMoorePlaqueHalifaxNovaScotia1.JPG|Sir John Moore Plaque Halifax, Nova Scotia\nFile:Site of First Nova Scotia Court House and Legistlative Assembly, Scotia Square, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|Site of First Court House Plaque, Scotia Square, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nFile:St. Paul's Church, Nova Scotia Historical Society.jpg|St. Paul's Church (Halifax)\nFile:John Wentworth's Canon, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.png|John Wentworth's Cannon, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia\nFile:GeorgeAugustusWestphalBirthplacePlaque.jpg|George Augustus Westphal's Birthplace, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (Dartmouth Heritage Museum)\nFile:HMS Shannon Plaque, Nova Scotia Historical Society, Province House, Nova Scotia.jpg|HMS Shannon Plaque, Province House (Nova Scotia)\nFile:Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres Monument, St. George's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres Monument, St. George's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia\n* [http://rnshs.ca/?p=506 Treaty Day in Nova Scotia - Plaque of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov16novauoft#page/n345/mode/2up Nova Scotia Historical Society - 23 Plaques Created, 1911]\n*[https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov18novauoft#page/n36/mode/1up Nova Scotia Historical Society - 9 Plaques Created, 1914]\nCollections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society\n* [http://www.blupete.com/Library/History/NSHS.htm Article Index]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov01novauoft#page/n5/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1879 Vol 1]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov02nova#page/n3/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1881 Vol 2]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov03nova#page/n3/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1882-83 Vol 3]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsnova00socigoog#page/n4/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1884 Vol 4]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsnova00socigoog#page/n263/mode/1up NS Historical Society 1886-87 Vol 5]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsnova00socigoog#page/n421/mode/1up NS Historical Society 1888, Vol 6]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov07novauoft#page/n5/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1889-91, Vol. 7]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov08nova#page/n3/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1892-94, Vol.8]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/cihm_05221#page/n1/mode/2up NS Historical Society - Louisbourg 1894]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov08nova#page/n3/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1895]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov10nova#page/n3/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1896-98]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsnova01socigoog#page/n6/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1899-1900, Vol. 11]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov12nova#page/n7/mode/2up Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, #12 (1905)]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov16novauoft#page/n313/mode/1up Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, vol. 13, 1908]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/14a15collectionsof14novauoft#page/n5/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1910, Vol.14]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/14a15collectionsof14novauoft#page/131/mode/1up Index 1878-1910]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/14a15collectionsof14novauoft#page/144/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1911, Vol. 15]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov16novauoft#page/n3/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1912]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov16novauoft#page/i/mode/1up NS Historical Society 1913]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov18novauoft#page/n5/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1914]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnov18novauoft#page/224/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1918, Vol.19]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/20a21collectionsof20novauoft#page/n5/mode/2up NS Historical Society 1921, Vol.20]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/20a21collectionsof20novauoft#page/n234/mode/1up NS Historical Society 1927, Vol.21]\n* [https://archive.org/details/cihm_78709 The memorial sundial at Annapolis Royal: paper read before the Nova Scotia Historical Society, at Halifax, N.S.
