She since distanced herself from the FSP, and was not endorsed by the NHLA when she ran for re-election in 2016.\nIn January 2016, Edwards introduced a bill to decriminalize prostitution in New Hampshire between consenting adults. The bill was opposed by Republican house majority leader Richard Hinch, who commented that \"society is just not ready for that\". Edwards is also an advocate of drug policy reform. With assistance from other FSP members, Edwards helped pass a bill to give drug users immunity from prosecution when they report a drug-related medical emergency.\nPersonal life\nHer father, Jess Edwards, has served in the House since 2016 as a Republican. He credits her example with leading him to run for office, although they differ on many issues and often voted on different sides of issues during the time they served together.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.elizabethedwardsnh.com/ Elizabeth Edwards for State Representative]"
