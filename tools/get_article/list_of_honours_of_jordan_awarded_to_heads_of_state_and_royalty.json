Mainly, a non-heir prince and princess may receive the Supreme Order of the Renaissance rather than the Order of the Star of Jordan.\n;European monarchies\nBritish Royal Family\n* The Queen: 19531984 -  Member with Collar - 1984 - Member with Sash - of the Order of Hussein ibn' Ali\n* The Duke of Kent: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\nNorwegian Royal Family\n* Harald V of Norway: Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali °\n* Queen Sonja of Norway: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance° (Order of Al-Nahda)\n* Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance ° (Order of Al-Nahda)\n* Princess Märtha Louise of Norway: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan ° (Order of Al-Kawkab Al Urdoni)\n* Princess Astrid of Norway: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan ° (Al-Kawkab Al Urdoni)\nSwedish Royal Family\n* Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden: Collar of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali (1989)\n* Queen Silvia of Sweden: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (1989)\n* Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (2003)\n* Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland (2003): Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan (2003)\n* Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan\nDanish Royal Family\n* Margrethe II of Denmark: Collar of the Order of the Star of Jordan\n* Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* Prince Joachim of Denmark: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\nDutch Royal Family\n* Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands\n** Collar of the Order of the Star of Jordan\n** Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* Princess Margriet of the Netherlands: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\n* Pieter van Vollenhoven: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance\nBelgian Royal Family\n* King Philippe: Knight Grand Cordon with Collar of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali (18 May 2016)\n* Queen Mathilde: Dame Gran Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (18 May 2016)\nSpanish Royal Family\n* Juan Carlos I of Spain: Collar of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali (1985)\n* Queen Sofía of Spain\n** Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan (1985)\n** Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (1999)\n* Felipe, Prince of Asturias: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (1999)\n* Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo: Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan (1999)\n* Jaime de Marichalar: Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence (1999)\nMonegasque Princely Family\n* Albert II, Prince of Monaco: Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (before 07/2011)\n;Asian monarchies\nBruneian Royal Family\nThey have been awarded:\n* Hassanal Bolkiah: Order of al-Hussein bin Ali (19.12.1984)\n* Queen Saleha: Grand Cordon Special Class  of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (13.5.2008)\n* Hajah Mariam binti Haji ‘Abdu’l Aziz, Sultan's second (divorced) wife: Grand Cordon Special Class of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (19.12.1984)\n* Azrinaz Mazhar binti Hakim Mazhar, Sultan's third (divorced) wife: Grand Cordon Special Class of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (13.5.2008)\n* Al-Muhtadee Billah, Crown Prince of Brunei: Grand Cordon Special class of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (13.5.2008)\n* Pengiran Anak Sarah, Crown Princess of Brunei: Grand Cordon Special class of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (13.5.2008)\n* Rashida, Sultan's elder daughter: Grand Cordon Special class of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (13.5.2008)\nJapanese Imperial Family\n* Emperor Akihito: Collar of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali\nArab monarchies\nHouse of Saud\n* Salman of Saudi Arabia\n* Sultan bin Salman Al Saud\nFormer monarchies\nRepublics\nSee also\n* List of honours of the Jordanian Royal Family by country\nReferences"
