      "text": "# The House of Dr. Edwardes\n\nThe House of Dr. Edwardes is a psychological thriller novel written by John Palmer and Hilary A. Saunders under the pseudonym Francis Beeding.\nThe plot concerns an asylum that is about to get a new director. The new man is knocked unconscious and imprisoned by an imposter who  allows patients—including a satanist planning a human sacrifice—to run amuck.\nThe novel was adapted to film in 1945 as Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound. The film uses the idea of an imposter and some character names, but otherwise bears no resemblance to the novel.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* Full text of The House of Dr. Edwardes\n\n---\n\n## The House Of Dr. Edwardes\n\n#REDIRECT The House of Dr. Edwardes"
