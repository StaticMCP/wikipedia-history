Motorola was a strategic customer of TTPCom and consequently bought the company and the technology in 2006.\nDescription\nAJAR combines a complete applications framework, toolset and a suite of pre-integrated applications. It represents a single investment in applications for products used across multiple networks (2G, 2.5G, EDGE, CDMA, 3G and HSDPA), multiple architectures (single processor, coprocessor, application processor) and different handset designs (candy bar, clamshell).\nAJAR is compatible with multiple cellular chipsets across a range of handsets from entry level to feature phone.\nReferences"
