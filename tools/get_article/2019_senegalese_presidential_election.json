Incumbent president Macky Sall of the Alliance for the Republic was re-elected for a second term with 58% of the vote in the first round.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Senegal is elected using the two-round system; a candidate must receive over 50% of the vote to be elected in the first round. If no candidate had crossed the threshold, a second round would have been held between the top two candidates.\nPrior to the elections, the electoral law was amended to introduce requirements for candidates to secure signatures from at least 0.8% of the registered electorate, and for at least 2,000 signatures from seven of the 14 regions. Voters were only allowed to give a signature to one candidate.\nCandidates\nAlthough 87 candidates registered intent to collect signatures, only around 20 applied to the Constitutional Council to participate in the election, with the requirement for signatures and the introduction of a 30 million franc bond thought to have put many potential candidates off. Five candidates were approved to run in the elections; , , Macky Sall, Idrissa Seck and Ousmane Sonko.\nIn January 2019, two opposition leaders Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade were barred from participating due to previous convictions for misuse of public funds.\nResults\nOn 25 February 2019, Prime Minister Mahammed Dionne said that Sall had been re-elected with \"a minimum of 57%\" of the vote, enough to avoid a runoff election. He also said Sall had won in 13 of the country's 14 regions. On 5 March 2019, the Constitutional Council confirmed the election results.\n|party4=Party for Unity and Rally|votes4=178613\n|cand5=|party5=Independent|votes5=65021\n|invalid=42541\n|electorate=6683043\n|source=[https://conseilconstitutionnel.sn/decision-n-4-e-2019-affaire-n-25-e-19/ Constitutional Council]\n}}\nReferences"
