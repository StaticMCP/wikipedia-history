Eggplant was a global company that served more than 650 enterprise customers in over 30 countries.\nEggplant had offices in London, Boulder, Colorado, Philadelphia, and Berlin, Germany, with additional development centers and regional offices around the world. Eggplant was acquired by Keysight Technologies.\nProducts\nEggplant's products cover:\n* Automated, AI-driven functional and usability testing\n* Performance testing\n* Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\n* performance monitoring (real user and synthetic).\nMany of these products work together. For example, real user journeys from monitoring can be used to build journeys for functional testing.\nHistory\nThe Eggplant software test automation product was originally developed and sold beginning in 2002 by Redstone Software, a subsidiary of Gresham Computing. In 2008, the Eggplant software (and associated SenseTalk scripting language) was acquired by a group of investors who created a new company called TestPlant to continue the promotion and development of Eggplant. It was created to help organisations put users at the centre of software testing to create amazing digital experiences and drive user adoption, conversion, and retention.  After an initial round of seed funding ($100,000), the company was able to invest in developing technologies ─ predominantly the Digital Automation Intelligence (DAI) suite ─ which interacts with software exactly like a real user does. In 2018, the company rebranded as Eggplant to align with expansion and growth in the US market.\nOn 28 March 2018 Eggplant announced the acquisition of NCC Group's Web Performance Division.\nOn 25 June 2020, Eggplant was acquired by Keysight Technologies for $330 million from the Carlyle Group.\nReferences"
