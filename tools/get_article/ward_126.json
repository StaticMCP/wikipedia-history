Investigators probing the case uncover that Gokul led a secretive personal life, including multiple marital relationships.\nHalfway through the film, the focus shifts to Rossie (played by Shritha Sivadas), a pregnant woman who becomes involved through a chain-snatching incident that occurred in the same lane as Gokul’s crime. Her life becomes intertwined with Gokul’s and the investigation’s darker threads.\nThe narrative is non-linear, interleaving present investigations with flashbacks, gradually revealing connections among Gokul (or “Kannan”), Rossie, other characters (including his wives or partners), and the darker side of life in the IT/BPO world.\nAmong the themes are: harassment faced by women working in or connected to the IT/BPO industry; moral decay, betrayal; and how one death can expose many hidden lives. The climax/ending has a twist—some relationships or events are not what they initially seem.\nCast\nProduction\nOn 25 December 2020 Jayam Ravi unveiled the first look poster.
