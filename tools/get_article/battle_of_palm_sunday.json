Buchanan stated that many of the Mackintoshes and almost all of the Camerons were slain. The Clan Cameron account states that the Clan Mackintosh who were leaders of the Chattan Confederation attacked the Camerons when they were worshiping in a church and that during the engagement most of the Mackintoshes and almost the whole tribe of Camerons were cut to pieces.\nReferences\nNotes"
