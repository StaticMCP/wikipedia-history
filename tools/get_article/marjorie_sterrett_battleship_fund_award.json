This isn't strictly correct, because it has been the policy to rotate eligibility for the award annually among the various type commands (aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious ships, etc.).\nThe award includes a small monetary stipend (about $500 in 2004). Commanding officers receiving the award must put the money into the ship's recreation fund, where it can be spent on athletic equipment, prizes for athletic or marksmanship competitions, recreation room furniture, dances, parties, and similar recreational activities.\nHistory\nThe Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund was established in 1917 by the Tribune Association. It was initiated by a contribution which accompanied the following letter, printed on February 4, 1916:\n{| cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"margin: 0em 3em 0em 3em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid\"\n|\n\"To the Editor of the New York Tribune\n\"Dear Sir:\n\"I read in your paper every morning a lot about preparedness. My grandpa and my great grandpa were soldiers. If I was a boy I would be a soldier, too, but I am not, so I want to do what I can to help. Mama gives me a dime every week for helping her. I am sending you this week's dime to help build a battleship for Uncle Sam. I know a lot of other kids would give their errand money if you would start a fund. I am 13 years old, and go to Public School No. 9, Brooklyn.\nTruly Yours,\nMARJORIE STERRETT\nI am a true blue American and I want to see Uncle Sam prepared to lick all creation like John Paul Jones did.\nP.S.—Please call the battleship America.\"\n|}\nThe letter was written during the buildup to America's entry into World War I, and it generated a huge response. Former president Theodore Roosevelt responded immediately with a handwritten letter and a dollar contribution; within a few days he met with Marjorie in Manhattan. The Tribune printed the name of every contributor, and newspapers across the country reprinted Marjorie's letter and received additional donations.\nUltimately 200,000 dimes were collected, each typically in the name of a child or a contributor's yet-to-be born grandchild. The money was offered to the Navy, but Secretary Josephus Daniels at first rejected it, citing legal prohibitions. A law was soon enacted allowing the Navy Department to accept the money, and by early 1918 the $20,000   (}} today) had been transferred to the government.\nPrior to World War II, income from the fund was used to pay prizes annually to turret and gun crews making the highest scores in short-range battle practice, and to submarine crews making the highest scores in torpedo firing.\nSince the end of World War II, the Navy has emphasized readiness and fitness of the ship rather than competition between individual departments.\nMarjorie Sterrett-Raun died in March 1927 in Wattsburg, Pennsylvania.\nList of Post-WWII Winners\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\"\n! style=\"color: white; height: 30px; background: navy;\"| Year\n! style=\"color: white; height: 30px; background: navy;\"| Atlantic Fleet Winner\n! style=\"color: white; height: 30px; background: navy;\"| Pacific Fleet Winner\n|-\n|2024\n|  USS Gerald R.
