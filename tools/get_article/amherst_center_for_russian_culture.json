      "text": "# Amherst Center for Russian Culture\n\nThe Amherst Center for Russian Culture was created by Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts after the gift of a major collection of Russian books, manuscripts, periodicals and ephemera by Thomas P. Whitney in 1991.  The Center has a particularly strong collection of works by and relating to Russian emigres.  Subsequent major gifts of material have come from Dmitri Tarasenkov and George Ivask.\nThe center has a gallery for the display of over 50 works of Russian art from the collection that was donated to the college by Thomas P. Whitney.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/russian/acrc Amherst Center for Russian Culture]\n\n---\n\n## Amherst center for russian culture\n\n#REDIRECT Amherst Center for Russian Culture"
