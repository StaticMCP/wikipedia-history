He obtained both an undergraduate degree and a doctorate before moving to the United States to teach at Columbia University.\nHe served as professor of physics at Yale University before returning to the United Kingdom in 1994 to start the Sussex Centre for Optical and Atomic Physics at Sussex University.\nHe is currently (2014) a Royal Society Research Professor and director of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London, where his research is concentrated on fundamental problems in physics and on new methods for producing and manipulating cold atoms and molecules.\nHonours and awards\nSource: [http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/ed.hinds/honours-and-memberships.html Imperial College]\n* Royal Society Bakerian Medal, 2019\n* Faraday Medal and Prize, Institute of Physics, 2013\n* Rumford Medal, Royal Society, 2008\n* Thomson Medal and Prize, Institute of Physics, 2008\n* Royal Society Research Professor, Royal Society, 2006\n* Fellow of the Royal Society, 2004\n* Fellow of the Optical Society of America, 2002\n* EPSRC Senior Research Fellow, 1999\n* Humboldt Prize, 1998\n* Royal Society Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellow, 1998\n* Fellow of the Institute of Physics, 1996\n* Fellow of the American Physical Society, 1994\nReferences"
