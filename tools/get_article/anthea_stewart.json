Previously, she had represented South Africa between 1963 and 1974.\nBecause of the boycott of the United States and other countries, only one team was available to compete in the women's field hockey tournament: the hosting USSR team. A late request was sent to the government of Zimbabwe, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise, they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games.  Not only was it Zimbabwe's only medal, it was the first medal given for women's field hockey in Olympic history.\nStewart is the mother of international diver Evan Stewart, who competed in three consecutive Summer Olympics for his native country, starting in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
