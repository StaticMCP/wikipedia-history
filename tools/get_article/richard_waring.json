In 1940, he played opposite Ethel Barrymore in The Corn Is Green and later with Le Gallienne and was signed to play the role in Hollywood opposite Bette Davis, but entered the army during World War II. Before that, he was filmed in his best-known screen role in Mr. Skeffington (1944) as Fanny Trellis' brother Trippy.\nAfter his war service he appeared on Broadway as the Duke of Buckingham in Henry VIII, John Shand in J.M.
