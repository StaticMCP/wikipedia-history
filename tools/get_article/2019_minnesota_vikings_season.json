They improved on their 8–7–1 campaign from 2018 with a Week 14 win over the Detroit Lions, and returned to the playoffs following a one-year absence after the Los Angeles Rams lost to the San Francisco 49ers in Week 16. That week, the Vikings were eliminated from contention for the NFC North division title, losing 23–10 to the Green Bay Packers. They defeated their Rival New Orleans Saints 26–20 in overtime in the Wild Card round but lost 27–10 to the eventual NFC champion San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round.\nDraft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2019 Minnesota Vikings draft\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n!style=\"\"| Player name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| College\n!style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n! 1 || 18\n| Garrett Bradbury || C || NC State ||\n|-\n! 2 || 50\n| Irv Smith Jr. || TE || Alabama ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"5\"| 3 || 81\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 88\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Seattle Seahawks ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Eagles via Lions\n|-\n! 92\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the New York Jets ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Chiefs via Seahawks\n|-\n! 93\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Baltimore Ravens ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Saints via Jets\n|-\n! 102\n| Alexander Mattison || RB || Boise State || Compensatory pick; from Ravens\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 4 || 114\n| Dru Samia || G || Oklahoma || from Packers via Seahawks\n|-\n! 120\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Seattle Seahawks ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 5 || 156\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Denver Broncos}} ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 159\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the New England Patriots ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Seahawks\n|-\n! 162\n| Cameron Smith || LB || USC || from Bears via Patriots, Rams and Patriots\n|-\n!rowspan=\"5\"| 6 || 190\n| Armon Watts || DT || Arkansas ||\n|-\n! 191\n| Marcus Epps || S || Wyoming || from Titans via Ravens\n|-\n! 193\n| Oli Udoh || OT || Elon || from Ravens\n|-\n! 204\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Seattle Seahawks ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| from Patriots via Lions\n|-\n! 209\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Seattle Seahawks ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Compensatory pick\n|-\n!rowspan=\"5\"| 7 || 217\n| Kris Boyd || CB || Texas || from Jets\n|-\n! 232\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the New York Giants}} ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 239\n| Dillon Mitchell || WR || Oregon || from Eagles via Patriots\n|-\n! 247\n| Bisi Johnson || WR || Colorado State || Compensatory pick\n|-\n! 250\n| Austin Cutting || LS || Air Force || Compensatory pick\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2019 Minnesota Vikings undrafted free agents\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| College\n|-\n| Micah Abernathy || S || Tennessee\n|-\n| Khari Blasingame || FB || Vanderbilt\n|-\n| Jake Browning || QB || Washington\n|-\n| Davion Davis || WR || Sam Houston State\n|-\n| Brandon Dillon || TE || Marian\n|-\n| Alexander Hollins || WR || Eastern Illinois\n|-\n| John Keenoy || C || Western Michigan\n|-\n| Nate Meadors || CB || UCLA\n|-\n| Tito Odenigbo || DT || Miami (FL)\n|-\n| Anree Saint-Amour || DE || Georgia Tech\n|}\nNotes\n*The Vikings were awarded three compensatory selections at the NFL's annual spring owners' meetings.

Coincidentally it was also a road game against the Saints. It was also the second Wild Card game of the postseason to go into overtime. The Vikings got the ball first, and Kirk Cousins threw a pass to Adam Thielen for a 43-yard gain, which set them on the New Orleans 2-yard line. After losing two yards on the next two plays, Cousins found Kyle Rudolph at the back of the endzone for a 4-yard touchdown to win the game.\nWith this, the Vikings won their first playoff game on the road since their 31-17 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the 2004 Wild Card Round. As of 2024, this was the last time that the Vikings won a playoff game.\nNFC Divisional Playoffs: at (1) San Francisco 49ers\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=NFC Divisional Playoffs: (6) Minnesota Vikings at (1) San Francisco 49ers&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=\n|time=3:35&nbsp;p.m. CST/1:35&nbsp;p.m. PST\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=7|R2=3|R3=0|R4=0\n|home=49ers\n|H1=7|H2=7|H3=10|H4=3\n|stadium=Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, California\n|attendance=71,649\n|weather=Partly cloudy,\n|referee=Walt Anderson (66)\n|TV=NBC\n|TVAnnouncers=Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth, Michele Tafoya and Terry McAulay\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2020011100/2019/POST19/vikings@49ers Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58160/SF_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*SF – Kendrick Bourne 3-yard pass from Jimmy Garoppolo (Robbie Gould kick), 9:30. 49ers 7–0.

It was Smith's fifth Pro Bowl and Hunter's second, while Cook made his Pro Bowl debut. With the withdrawal of several NFC players, including San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, defensive end Nick Bosa and cornerback Richard Sherman, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, and Chicago Bears linebacker Khalil Mack, several Vikings were added to the roster for the Pro Bowl: fullback C. J. Ham, defensive end Everson Griffen, cornerback Xavier Rhodes, quarterback Kirk Cousins and linebacker Eric Kendricks. It was a first Pro Bowl appearance for Ham and Kendricks, a second for Cousins, a third for Rhodes and a fourth for Griffen.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
