He was the author of a translation of the Satires of the Roman poet Juvenal, now in its third edition. He also contributed poems to many journals, including to Arion and the Southern Humanities Review. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1956.\nEarly life and career\nGreen was born in London on 22 December 1924. He went to school at Charterhouse. During World War II, he served with the Royal Air Force in Burma. In Firpo's Bar in Calcutta, he met and became friendly with future novelist, Paul Scott, who later used elements of Green's character for the figure of Sergeant Guy Perron in The Raj Quartet.\nAfter the war, Green attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he achieved a Double First in Classics, winning the Craven Scholarship and Studentship in 1950. He subsequently wrote historical novels and worked as a journalist, in the capacity of fiction critic for the Daily Telegraph (1953–63), book columnist for the Yorkshire Post (1961–62), television critic for The Listener (1962–1963), film critic for ''John O'London's (1961–1963), as well as contributing to other journals.\nIn 1963, he and his family moved to the Greek island of Lesbos, where he was a translator and independent scholar. In 1966 he moved to Athens, where he was recruited to teach classics for College Year in Athens, and published Armada from Athens, a study of the Sicilian Expedition of 415–3 BC (1970), and The Year of Salamis'', a history of the Greco-Persian Wars (1971).\nIn 1971, Green was invited to teach at the University of Texas at Austin, where he became Dougherty Centennial Professor of Classics in 1982, emeritus from 1997. In 1986, he held the Mellon Chair of Humanities at Tulane University in New Orleans. He was last an adjunct professor at the University of Iowa and also has held visiting appointments at Princeton University and at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.\nBob Dylan used Green's translations of Ovid, found in The Erotic Poems (1982) and The Poems of Exile: Tristia and the Black Sea Letters (1994) as song lyrics on the albums Love and Theft (2001) and Modern Times (2006).\nGreen was a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books.\nAt the time of his death, Green was working with [https://anthropology.uiowa.edu/people/glenn-storey Glenn Storey] on a new translation of the works of Herodotus with full commentaries.
