In addition, some recipients have been simply designated as \"Fellows\", without being placed in a category. The awards include an unrestricted financial grant.\nIn addition to its fellowship program, WINGS WorldQuest  offers Flag Carrier grants in support of field researchers who are financing explorations.\nFellows\nThe awards are given every 1-2 years. Not all awards are given each year. In some years more the same award may be given to more than one person.\n* 2020, Sylvia Earle (Lifetime Award)\n* 2018, Nalini Nadkarni (Lifetime Achievement Award)\n* 2014, Helen Thayer (Lifetime Award)\n* 2010, Carol Beckwith (Lifetime Achievement)\n* 2010, Angela Fisher (Lifetime Achievement)\n* 2007, Jane Goodall (Lifetime Achievement)\n* 2006, Eugenie Clark (Lifetime Achievement)\n* 2005, Marianne Greenwood (Lifetime Achievement)\n}}\nAir and Space\n* 2008, Birgit Sattler (Air and Space)\n* 2005, Nathalie Cabrol (Air and Space)\n* 2004, Vera Rubin (Air and Space)\n* 2003, Meenakshi Wadhwa (Air and Space)\n}}\nConservation\n* 2019, Laly Lichtenfeld (Conservation Award)\n* 2018, Thandiwe Mweetwa (Conservation Award)\n* 2016, Marla Spivak (Conservation Award)\n}}\nCourage\n* 2008, Liv Arnesen (Courage)\n* 2008, Ann Bancroft (Courage)\n* 2007, Constanza Ceruti (Courage)\n* 2006, Elizabeth Bennett (Courage)\n* 2005, Sabriye Tenberken (Courage)\n* 2004, Stephanie Schwabe (Courage)\n* 2003, Marilyn Bridges (Courage)\n}}\nEarth\n* 2014, Daphne Soares (Earth Award)\n* 2011, Catherine Powers (Earth)\n* 2010, Susan Dudley (Earth)\n* 2009, Bolortsetseg Minjin (Earth)\n* 2008, Jill Fredston (Earth)\n* 2007, Erin Pettit (Earth)\n* 2006, Aquilina Lestenkof (Earth)\n* 2004, Katy Payne (Earth)\n* 2003, Rosita Arvigo (Earth)\n}}\nField Research\n}}\nFilm and Exploration\nHumanity\n* 2018, Eleanor Sterling (Humanity Award)\n* 2016, Sheila Ochugboju (Humanity Award)\n* 2014, Arita Baaijens (Humanity Award)\n* 2011, Gladys Kalema-Zikusoka (Humanity)\n* 2009, Aparajita Datta (Humanity)\n* 2008, Irina Nikolaeva (Humanity)\n* 2006, Janine Benyus (Humanity)\n* 2005, Ana Pinto (Humanity)\n* 2004, Iris Love (Humanity)\n* 2003, Anna Roosevelt (Humanity)\n}}\nInnovation in Technology Award\nLeadership\nSea\n* 2016, Kristen Marhaver (Sea Award)\n* 2011, Anna Cummins (Sea)\n* 2010, Alexandra Morton (Sea)\n* 2009, Maya Tolstoy (Sea)\n* 2008, Vera Metcalf (Sea)\n* 2007, Terrie Williams (Sea)\n* 2006, Edie Widder (Sea)\n* 2005, Sue Hendrickson (Sea)\n* 2004, Marie Tharp (Sea)\n* 2003, Sylvia Earle (Sea)\n}}\nAwardee/Fellow\nMetrópoles |url=https://www-metropoles-com.translate.goog/brasil/biologa-brasileira-vence-oscar-verde-por-trabalho-com-oncas-pintadas?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc&_x_tr_hist=true |work=Metropoles |date=2 May 2025 |language=pt-BR}}\n* 2025, Divya Karnad\n* 2025, Grace C.
