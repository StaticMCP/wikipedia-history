The ceremony was hosted by Andrea Martin and Martin Short at the Harbour Castle Hilton Hotel.\nNew categories for R&B/Soul and Reggae/Calypso were introduced this year. Nominations in secondary categories (children's, video, producer, recording engineer, classical and jazz) were announced 27 September 1985.\nThe ceremonies were broadcast nationally on CBC Television from 7pm Eastern Time. These included performances by Liberty Silver, Kim Mitchell and a duet of Tina Turner and Bryan Adams. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was also in attendance.\nEarlier in 1985, most major Canadian music artists joined each other to create the benefit single \"Tears Are Not Enough\". It was not represented among the year's Juno nominations although it demonstrated strength in the Canadian music industry.\nThis marked the first year that a black female was awarded a Juno: Liberty Silver.\nNominees and winners\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Luba\nOther nominees:\n* Lee Aaron\n* Dalbello\n* Anne Murray\n* Carole Pope\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams\nOther nominees:\n* Bruce Cockburn\n* Gowan\n* Corey Hart\n* Kim Mitchell\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: k.d. lang\nOther nominees:\n* Connie Kaldor\n* Belinda Metz\n* Liberty Silver\n* Vanity\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Paul Janz\nOther nominees:\n* Claude Dubois\n* Daniel Lavoie\n* Johnnie Lovesin\n* Johnny MacLeod\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: The Parachute Club\nOther nominees:\n* Helix\n* Honeymoon Suite\n* Strange Advance\n* Triumph\nMost Promising Group of the Year\nWinner: Idle Eyes\nOther nominees:\n* The Arrows\n* The Box\n* Images in Vogue\n* Rational Youth\nComposer of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance\nOther nominees:\n* David Foster\n* Corey Hart\n* Luba\n* Eddie Schwartz\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker\n* Marie Bottrell\n* Anne Lord\n* Laura Vinson\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Murray McLauchlan\nOther nominees:\n* Terry Carisse\n* Ronnie Hawkins\n* Terry Sumsion\n* Valdy\nCountry Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: The Family Brown\nOther nominees:\n* C-Weed Band\n* Kelita Haverland and Gilles Godard\n* Midnite Rodeo Band\n* Anita Perras and Tim Taylor\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: Canadian Brass\nOther nominees:\n* Hagood Hardy\n* Frank Mills\n* The Spitfire Band\n* Zamfir\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: David Foster, Chicago 17 by Chicago\nOther nominees:\n* Bryan Adams, Reckless by Bryan Adams\n* Terry Brown, New Regime by New Regime\n* Peter Cardinali, The Bear Walks by Hugh Marsh\n* Declan O'Doherty, Idle Eyes by Idle Eyes\n* Gino Vannelli, Black Cars by Gino Vannelli\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: Hayward Parrott, Underworld by The Front\nOther nominees:\n* Kevin Doyle, Claim to Fame by Robert Armes\n* Kevin Doyle, Smalltown Girl by Target\n* Gary Gray, The Bear Walks by Hugh Marsh\n* Anton Kwiatkowski, Serenade in Harmony by Elmer Iseler Singers\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: Wilf Carter\nWalt Grealis Special Achievement Award\nWinner: A.
