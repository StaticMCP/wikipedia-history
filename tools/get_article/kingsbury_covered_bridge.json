Built in 1904, it is last documented covered bridge to be built in Vermont during the historic 19th and early 20th century period.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.\nDescription and history\nThe Kingsbury Covered Bridge is located in southernmost Randolph, just west of Vermont Route 14 on Kingsbury Road, a lightly traveled local road.  It is a single-span multiple kingpost truss bridge, with trusses  long resting on stone abutments.  The bridge is  wide, with a roadway width of  (one lane).  Its exterior is sheathed in vertical board siding, and it is covered by a metal roof.  There are no windows in the side walls, and the portal ends and interiors are also covered in vertical boards.\nThe bridge was built in 1904 by an unknown builder.  It is the youngest of the state's historic covered bridges; after this bridge was built, no new covered bridges were built in the state until the 1960s.  It was restored in 1980, but closed shortly thereafter due to ice damage.  It was repaired again in 1994.  The repairs were short-lived as another restoration was completed in 2009.Kingsbury Bridge Renovated\".
