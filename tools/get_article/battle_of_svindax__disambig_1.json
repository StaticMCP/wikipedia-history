Ultimately, the Byzantines won a decisive victory. In the aftermath of the conflict, George I of Georgia was forced to negotiate a peace treaty ending the Byzantine-Georgian wars over the succession of the domains of David III of Tao.\nSee also\n*Battle of Shirimni\n*Battle of Sasireti\n*Tao-Klarjeti\nReferences\n* [http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/cauc/ageo/kcx1/kcx1284.htm A Georgian chronicle Kartlis Cxovreba] (Georgian)"
