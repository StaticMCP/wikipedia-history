The Castilians were defeated and routed.\nHistory\nIn May 1091, the Almoravids, led by Syr ibn Abi Bakr besieged the city of Seville which was ruled by the Taifa king, Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. The Almoravids besieged it for a month. Al-Mu'tamid prepared for defense of the city and called help from the Castilian-Leonese king, Alfonso VI. Alfonso was stunned at the Almoravid invasion, and both of them had one goal: to stop the Almoravid invasion. Around June, Alfonso immediately dispatched one of his great generals, Álvar Fáñez, to assist Al-Mu'tamid.\nMuslim accounts state that the Castilian force had a force of 20,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, while Christian sources state that it only consisted of 2,500 knights. The Almoravid general, realizing what was happening, dispatched a force of 10,000 men led by Ibrahim bin Ishaq Al-Lamtuni, which the Christian chronicles state had 15,000 men. Both sides met at the site of Almodóvar del Río. A fierce battle ensued, and both sides sustained heavy losses. The battle ended in Almoravid victory and the route of the Casilitans. Álvar Fáñez was wounded during the battle and retreated from the battlefield to Toledo.\nThe battle buried any hopes to save Al-Mu'tamid and Seville, which would fall in September.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
