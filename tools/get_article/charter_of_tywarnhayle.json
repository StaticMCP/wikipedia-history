It was produced in the scriptorium at Crediton and now resides in the Exeter Cathedral Library. It is mainly written in Latin with a short boundary clause written in old English at the end.\nContent\n]]\nThe charter covers a land grant of some 9 hides (cassati) at Tywarnhayle in modern parishes of Perranzabuloe and St Agnes, and 2 mansae at Bosowsa in modern Ladock, both Cornwall. It was granted by King Edgar to his \"faithful minister\" or thegn Eanulf or Eanwulf who appears in the PASE database as \"Eanwulf 20\" and is a unique entry, however he could be the same as one of the other 24 Eanwulfs attested in the database.\nIt is witnessed by 24 individuals in total including King Edgar himself: 8 bishops (episcopae), 6 ealdormen (duces), 6 thegns (ministers) and 3 other individuals.\nBoundary Clause\nHooke (1994, pp.&nbsp;28–32) translates the boundary clause, written in old English, as:First to pen altiug, then to the old dyke to the crucifix, from the crucifix to ƿelentlnes gate, thence to the boundary dyke, from the boundary dyke to (the) stream to ƿorƿig ford, thence to munnenno, thence to (St) Piran’s tor, from (St) Piran’s tor to weIm tor, thence to/by the old road to beƿcyric, thence on along the road to dofen soðo, thence by (the) way to cofer fros, thence by the stream to (the) sea to noncuic.\nText\nThe translated text after Sanders (1878). The boundary clause has been left in old English but is translated above:✠ Our Lord Jesus Christ reigneth for ever! The traditions of the various decrees of mortals and the vicissitudes of the times shoul be committeed to the testimony of writing, lest the successive race of posterity be plunged in the whirlpool of falsehood and the obscurity of ignorance. Wherefore I, King Edgar, relying upon the royal authority have sufficiently, devotedly, taken care to bestow upon my faithful thegn, by name Eanulf, a certain small, portion of land, that is ten cassates, in the place which is caleld Tiwærnhel, and elsewhere two manses, where it is called Bodeudan, that he may have free power of having and bestowng or leaving it to whatsoever heir he may please. Moreover let the aforesaid land be exempt from all secular burden, except army service, castle ward and bridge building. Whoever shall endeavour to diminish or transmute this decree, let him know that he will be arraigned on the day of judgement before Christ and his saints unless he here make satisfactory amends. The schedule also of this grant is written in the year of the dominical incarnation 960, the 3rd indication, and confirmed by these witnesses whose names are seen represented in little letters below. ✠ I, Eadgar King, have confirmed this my grant ✠ I Dunstan bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Oskytel bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Byrhthelm bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Alfƿold bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Byrhthelm bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Kynesige bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Osulf bishop consent and subscribe ✠ I Aþulf consent and subscribe ✠ I ælfhere ealdorman consent ✠ I ælfgrer consent ✠ I ælfheah  ealdorman consent   ✠ I byrhtferþ consensi ✠ I æþelstan  ealdorman consent   ✠ I aþelƿold  ealdorman consent  ✠ I eadmund  ealdorman consent  ✠ I byrhtnoþ  ealdorman consent   ✠ I ælfƿine consent  ✠ I eadric thegn consent  ✠ I kyneric thegn consent   ✠ I aelfsige thegn consent  ✠ I ealdred thegn consent  ✠ I ordgaer thegn consent ✠ I æþelƿeard thegn consent\nThe boundaries of the estate are these.
