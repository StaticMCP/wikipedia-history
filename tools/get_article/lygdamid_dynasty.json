The dynasty was founded by Lygdamis, of Carian-Greek ethnicity.\nThe dynasty issued several tyrants, until the last one, Lygdamis II, died , after which Halicarnassus joined the Athenian alliance, known as the Delian League. At that time, Halicarnassus started to appear on the Athenian tribute quota lists.\nFrom 395 BCE, Caria would again fall under the control of the Achaemenid Empire and be ruled by a new dynasty of local tyrants, the Hecatomnids.\nRulers\n*Lygdamis I ( BCE)\n*Artemisia ( BCE)\n*Pisindelis ( BCE)\n*Lygdamis II ( BCE)\nReferences"
