They played as charter members of the XFL, one of eight teams to compete in the league for the 2020 season. The Battlehawks played their home games at The Dome at America's Center and were led by head coach Jonathan Hayes.\nTheir inaugural season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the XFL officially suspended operations for the remainder of the season on March 20, 2020.\nStandings\nSchedule\nAll times Central\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" style=\"\" | Week\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" style=\"\" | Day\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"90\" style=\"\" | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" style=\"\" | Kickoff\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" style=\"\" | TV\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"\" | Opponent\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"\" | Results\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"\" | Location\n|-\n! width=\"60\" style=\"\" | Score\n! width=\"60\" style=\"\" | Record\n|- bgcolor=#ccffcc\n! 1\n| Sunday\n| February 9\n| 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| ESPN\n| at Dallas Renegades\n| W 15–9\n| 1–0\n| Globe Life Park in Arlington\n|- bgcolor=#ffcccc\n! 2\n| Sunday\n| February 16\n| 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| FS1\n| at Houston Roughnecks\n| L 24–28\n| 1–1\n| TDECU Stadium\n|- bgcolor=#ccffcc\n! 3\n| Sunday\n| February 23\n| 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| ESPN\n| New York Guardians\n| W 29–9\n| 2–1\n| The Dome at America's Center\n|- bgcolor=#ccffcc\n! 4\n| Saturday\n| February 29\n| 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| Seattle Dragons\n| W 23–16\n| 3–1\n| The Dome at America's Center\n|- bgcolor=#ffcccc\n! 5\n| Sunday\n| March 8\n| 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| FS1\n| at DC Defenders\n| L 6–15\n| 3–2\n| Audi Field\n|- bgcolor=\n! 6\n| Saturday\n| March 14\n| 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| FS2\n| at Tampa Bay Vipers\n| colspan=2 rowspan=5 bgcolor=lightgrey | Not played\n| Raymond James Stadium\n|- bgcolor=\n! 7\n| Saturday\n| March 21\n| 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| Los Angeles Wildcats\n| The Dome at America's Center\n|- bgcolor=\n! 8\n| Saturday\n| March 28\n| 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| at New York Guardians\n| MetLife Stadium\n|- bgcolor=\n! 9\n| Sunday\n| April 5\n| 11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n| ESPN\n| Tampa Bay Vipers\n| The Dome at America's Center\n|- bgcolor=\n! 10\n| Sunday\n| April 12\n| 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| ABC\n| DC Defenders\n| The Dome at America's Center\n|}\nFinal roster\n| running_backs =\n| wide_receivers =\n| tight_ends =\n| offensive_linemen =\n| defensive_linemen =\n| linebackers =\n| defensive_backs =\n| special_teams =\n| reserve_lists =\n}}\nStaff\nGame summaries\nWeek 1: at Dallas Renegades\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|bg=#fff\n|bg2=#eee\n|title=Week 1 — St. Louis at Dallas\n|date=Sunday, February 9\n|time=4:00 p.m. CST\n|road=BattleHawks\n|R1=0|R2=6|R3=0|R4=9\n|home=Renegades\n|H1=0|H2=6|H3=3|H4=0\n|stadium=Globe Life Park in Arlington, Arlington, Texas\n|attendance=17,206\n|weather=Cloudy • Temperature:  • Wind: S 12 mph\n|referee=James Carter\n|TV=ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=Tom Hart (play-by-play), Joey Galloway (analyst), Pat McAfee (sideline)\n|reference=\n|scoring=\n;First quarter\n:No scoring\n;Second quarter\n*DAL – Austin MacGinnis 32-yard field goal, 9:46.
