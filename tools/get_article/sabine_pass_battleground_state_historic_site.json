The site is the location of a significant Civil War battle.\nIn September 1863, members of the Davis Guard—led by Confederate Lt. Richard \"Dick\" Dowling—held off a Union attack at Sabine Pass, a key port for Confederate shipments of supplies. In a battle lasting less than an hour, Dowling and his men destroyed two gunboats, captured nearly 350 prisoners, and prevented Union forces from penetrating the Texas interior.\nToday, the site is operated as a historic site by the Texas Historical Commission. Features include the 1936 statue honoring Dowling's feats, a monument dedicated to the Union casualties, outdoor educational exhibits, and a scale model of the Civil War-era fort and battle.\nSee also\n* List of Texas state historic sites\n* Fort Manhassett\n* Leon Smith (naval commander)\n* Anaconda Plan\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
