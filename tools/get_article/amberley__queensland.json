The Jeebropilly coal mine is located just to the west of Amberley.\nHaigslea–Amberley Road runs through from west to south.\nHistory\nThe suburb is named after Amberley in the United Kingdom. The name was used by James and Martha Collett for their residence in the 1850s as it was their hometown. Previously the area was known as Three-Mile Creek, referring to it being three miles along on the Old Toowoomba Road from Ipswich.\nIn 1861, a school commenced at Willowbank on a sheep and cattle station owned by Darby McGrath. McGrath then asked the Queensland Government to take over and donated land for the construction of a new building, resulting in the opening of Warrill Creek State School opened on 22 May 1862 on what is now the south-western part of the RAAF Base Amberley. On 28 January 1888 the school relocated to a new site at Sandridge but it was flooded in 1893 by Warrill Creek. In 1903, it was renamed Amberley State School. This school is one of the oldest state primary schools in Queensland. The outbreak of World War II escalated activity on the air force base and it was decided to close the school at the end of 1941 and it re-opened at the start of 1947. Concerns about aircraft noise at the school lead to the construction of a new school on Rosewood Road further from the base in the late 1970s. On 1 January 2010, the school was again relocated to Deebing Creek Road, Yamanto and renamed Amberley District State School.\nIn December 1867 a United Methodist Free Church was opened at Three-Mile Creek.\nDemographics\nIn the , Amberley had a population of 253 people.\nIn the , Amberley had a population of 619 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Amberley.
