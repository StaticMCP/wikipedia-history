He was a violinist before switching to bass at the age of 20.\nBiography\n, San Francisco, California, April 28, 1981]]\nStewart was born in Englewood, New Jersey, United States, and began playing string bass while attending Dwight Morrow High School. While attending the Boston Conservatory, he heard Ray Perry singing along with his violin. This gave him the inspiration to follow suit with his bass. In 1937, Stewart teamed with Slim Gaillard to form the novelty jazz act Slim and Slam. The duo's biggest hit was \"Flat Foot Floogie (with a Floy Floy)\" in 1938.\nStewart found regular session work throughout the 1940s with Lester Young, Fats Waller, Coleman Hawkins, Erroll Garner, Art Tatum, Johnny Guarnieri, Red Norvo, Don Byas, Benny Goodman, and Beryl Booker. One of the most famous sessions he played on took place in 1945, when Stewart played with Dizzy Gillespie's group (which featured Charlie Parker). Out of those sessions came some of the classics of bebop such as \"Groovin' High\" and \"Dizzy Atmosphere\".\nStewart taught at Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York, and at Yale University. He died of congestive heart failure on December 10, 1987, in Binghamton, aged 73.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* Slam Stewart (1946)\n* Slam Bam (1971)\n* Slamboree (1972)\n* Fish Scales (1975)\n* Two Big Mice (1977)\n* Dialogue (1978)\n* ''Shut Yo' Mouth!
